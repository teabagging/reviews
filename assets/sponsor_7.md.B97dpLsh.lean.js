There are tons of headphones out there but it seems the ones that are always recommended are super expensive. I figured I'd give these a try at 35 bucks and I am super glad I did. The sound quality is great, crisp highs and lows. Comfort is pretty great too. The cup design wraps around your ear pretty well, and they're light enough that they don't get uncomfortable or make your head sweat too much after a long period of time. Only downside could be that the body of the headphones is made of a plastic that could be sturdier, but they definitely seem to be durable, and I've heard of this plastic getting bent in all sorts of directions and refusing to snap. Overall, great set of headphones for the budget audiophile, casual listener, or amateur DJ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, bad comfort","review":"Amazing sound for a $20 pair of headphones, unfortunately I cannot wear them for more than an hour as they hurt my ears. I have smaller than normal ears, but the inside part (the speaker) is hard plastic and presses against the outside of my ear and after about an hour it is quite painful. In retrospect I would rather spend a bit more to find some with larger padding and better fit so I could actually enjoy the great sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTALLY UNCOMFORTABLE !!!","review":"These are the most uncomfortable headphones I have ever used. I wanted a not too expensive pair for monitoring with my turntable/pre-amp setup with my computer. I consider myself an audiophile, but did not want expensive headphones for this purpose. With all the great reviews, I didn't even save the packaging. I will write a letter to Sennheiser. I get a headache wearing these. Totally uncomfortable. Would get 0 stars if I could rate them that low."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser hd 202","review":"They're good for the price, very good sound, music and voice is very clear, no static or muffled sound, although their is a humming noise if there is no music or sound, this is with volume up very high, but still, for the price, you can't beat it, and the name of Sennheiser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound, very comfortable","review":"Got these today and without the burning in period, I can notice a vast improved difference in the sound. Can hear what I've been missing with those lousy earbuds. It also tends to bring out the weaknesses in the player as well. I have a first generation iPod touch and a rockboxed Sansa e250. The Sansa sounds great and the iPod sounds muddy. Also, I think that they are comfortable and they are adjustable. Can't beat it for under $22 shipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cups are too small","review":"I've had these for a few months now. Sound quality is decent enough, but the cans just don't fit my ears. I don't have Ross Perot size huge ears, but they aren't flat either. I'll be looking to buy another model. Might just keep these as a backup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work great!","review":"I am on the second pair of these. The first pair lasted about a year before the right headphone started to go. The sound quality is good, and they block out a lot of ambient noise as well, which is why I prefer these to ear buds. The cord is really long, but it can be wound around the device that is included to keep it under control. These headphones fit my ears perfectly, but I am a female with regular-sized ears. I received my first pair from my son, who complained about the fit. I highly recommend these headphones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price, but it pinches my head","review":"Good headphones. I can't stand earbuds and don't like turning my music way up just to hear it in public places, so these fit my needs reasonably well.Pros:-reeaallllyy long cord-comfy ear \\"muffs\\"-blocks out a little less sound than earplugsCons:-sound comes off fuzzy when listening to rock/similar-pinches my head. I have a round face shape, and this thing is too narrow and inflexible for my comfort.-don't seem very durable. (What else do you expect for twenty bucks?)Overall:Good headphones, great price, comfortable if you have a slimmer face shape, blocks a decent amount of sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice sound, nice price","review":"They are comfortable and inexpensive. The sound quality is good. Great product for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are great for the $","review":"These headphones are the best I have ever used in the lower price range. These are comparable to headphones twice their price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like hearing music for the first time","review":"Remember the way you felt when you first heard your favorite songs? These headphones do that for me. I hear sounds and layers of the song I didn't even know existed! I am truly amazed and very impressed with these. If you want to hear your music the way the artist wanted you to, definitely pick up a pair of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sennheiser vs Sony","review":"I bought these headphones 1) because they are so highly recommended on this site and are the bestsellers and 2) because my Sony headphones were built so poorly they literally fell apart.Unfortunately I could not find a pair of these for retail sale anywhere so I could try them out first. The sound is terrific. I have no complaints there. The cord is much longer than other brands which is a real plus. These headphones are astoundingly uncomfortable. They don't sit squarely and apply uneven and excessive pressure to my head. The Sony's were much more comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound starts to crackle way too easily","review":"I don't know, if I received a bad one or not. They were one of the worst value for money headphones. The HD 202 were not even close to the open-designed PMX 60 I owned earlier. Most of the headphones I've owned, my main grudge against them has been too much treble at default settings (except for the pmx60 and Philips HP 840). Same was the problem with Koss 'Plug' earphones and same with HD 202. I change the settings, but then every time I switch in my speakers or other headphones, I've to change again. Gonna spend a dollar or ten more and get better one's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick props","review":"I'm not a pro about headphones, just a regular user. These headphones are great! Definitely recommend especially for the price. They are comparable to the Bose my brother has."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best headphones I have owned","review":"I am a big music fan, as well as a musician who records his own music. These headphones meet all of my needs of comfort, sound clarity, and very good price. These compete with a lot of \\"higher end\\" headphones, but at a fraction of the price. Definitely the best deal for the your money. I would recommend them to any music enthusiast or musician, no matter your taste in music. I listen to a wide variety of music and it sounds great, no matter the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the money.","review":"i bought these headphones because I wanted better quality than most earphones. The only real complaint I have is that after wearing them for about an hour they start to get uncomfortable, but maybe that's just me. The cord is really long! It comes with a clip so you can wind it, but sometimes it gets loose. I don't recommend this based on portability, but if you are going to leave them in one spot it's fine. Overall, the quality for the money is good, but beware if you have big ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones for the price","review":"For under $30, the Sennheiser HD 202 is a great set of headphones. I was buying them to plug into an amp as I play guitar, but I also use them for my iPod at home. Crisp sound with the right amount of bass for the music I listen to (rock, alternative). Only qualm; the plastic band sits funny on my head. It curves out and isn't contoured to the top of one's head. I suppose it's just for style, and it's not that big of a deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conspicuous Consumption at Its Best!","review":"You could spend hundreds of dollars on headphones, but why? At under $26, the Sennheiser HD 202 delivers. The sound quality is fine, the \\"full-ear\\" coverage is comfortable and light. I'm sure that higher-priced headphones may have better nuanced sounds, but for most people, these headphones provide a splendid sound quality. On some songs, the stereo quality and \\"switching\\" sounds from one ear to another is excellent. Crisp percussion is also evident. Hear your favorite artists as they are meant to be heard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"did not last long","review":"I have the same problem with both pairs of sennheiser headphones. They worked great for a few months, then one side starts going out. I suspect it is the cord. I guess I got my money worth, but would expect them to last longer since they are only used sitting at my desk and there has never been any damage, chewed cord, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound quality","review":"This headset has excellent sound quality (great bass response) which justifies its price. There are cheaper headphones for $20 and less, but it is a good idea to buy this one. The downsides are the excessively lengthy cord and the lack of a microphone. A small bonus is that it comes with a .25\\" adapter, which is useful in case you have a guitar amplifier, for instance, and would like to practice without waking the neighborhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good sound for pretty low price","review":"I got these for $20 through BSW, and it's one of the best deals I've ever had. The bass on these is much better than my old headphones, and I can hear a fair number of things that I couldn't before. They cancel out noise decently well (enough to drown out annoying noises, but I can still hear my phone ringing/someone trying to talk to me, which is usually helpful. I especially like how the long cord can be wrapped up to basically any length; you can sit about as far away as you want without having a ton of excess wire hanging down.It does sometimes put pressure on my head #I have a fairly large one), but I've found that slight readjustments usually solve that issue for a while.Overall, I'd highly reccommend these to anyone looking for an inexpensive but very good set of headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headphones","review":"Before using Sennheiser HD 202, i was using Philips SHS3701, a regular model but with these headphones, the music is just unbelievable. You can actually hear new sounds and instruments that you've never heard before with another headphone.Best quality for this price"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but yes, they can hurt if worn for a long period...","review":"Got a great deal on these at 20 bucks total and no shipping but as a medical transcriber, I need to wear them 8 hours a day to transcribe. Again, sound is just great but they do tend to irritate one or the other ear after maybe 3 hours of wearing them. I switch back and forth between my old ones and these and it's still a great deal. The extra-long cord is just great also. So yes, buy them if you don't intend to use them for long long hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent headphones!","review":"Needed comfort, and outside sound blocking(in our small house, we often have both TV and Stereo playing). These do the trick! I even fell asleep wearing them! Bonus: the cord is long enough to reach from TV to couch, and comes with a 'cord-wrap' for when less length is needed. Great sound, too. Had a brief scare when one side came off...but it snapped right back in! My old 'phones required duct tape!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones good price","review":"The sound quality on these have been great, this is a great affordable set of headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound. Not comfortable.","review":"I am a fan of Sennheiser products. Like all Sennheiser headphones this one's sound quality is great. Price is good, too.I also have a Senheiser HD497 and I prefer this one's sound quality over HD497. Deep bass, nice treble. The only thing I don't like about this headphone is the size. It is not flexible enough. So if you have a big head, it starts to hurt your ears after a while. If you have small or medium size head, this would be a perfect pair of headphone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy for the money","review":"OK so the sound is not as good as some of the more expensive (over $100) headphones but for $20 these headphones are pretty damn good. They were also smaller than i expected. after using them for about 20 min my only complaint is the base its just doesnt have much BOOM but still they are very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal for quality product","review":"I forget exactly what I paid for these headphones, but I'm pretty sure it was less the twenty bucks. The item showed up promptly, and it was just what I was looking for. A simple pair of headphones, comfortable, functional, and they sound great. If you don't need anything top of the line, and are looking for a good pair of headphones at a extremely fair price, these are for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for radio announcers -- and at a price even radio announcers can afford!","review":"I love these headphones, particularly for the price. I have always sworn by Sennheisers for broadcasting, and over the years, have always used some form of open-air Sennheisers, but the HD 450 model headphones I used most recently were awful for feedback. If I turned my head a fraction of an inch, the squealing ensued. Well, the HD 202s sound just as good as the 450s, but the closed-can design eliminates all possibility of feedback. The bass is great. If you're in it for longer sessions of listening, I can see where the size and design of the earphones might end up making your head a little hot, but I find them very comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect!","review":"I bought the Sony Studiomonitor headphones and was troubled with the pain they inflicted on my poor ears. So returned those and bought these. HD202's got amazing sound quality, good sound isolation and most important they are much more comfortable than many other closed headphones. Although after about 2-3 hrs of continuous use, you begin to feel the pressure of the hard inside on your ears. Comfort from these headphones largely depends on the size of your ears and on how much they protrude on the outside to be pressed by the hard inside of the ear cups.I found them ok, but others may not feel so, so be sure to try them out before you buy, or atleast buy them from a place where you can return 'em. But definitely 10x better than the Sony Studiomonitor which press HARD all over your ear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A balanced headset","review":"Simply put, this headset will make you happy if you want a balanced bass set. If you want something more bassy, this set is not for you. While it sounds nice, it is not even close to strongest bass you can get for the money. Besides the sound quality, the slide to adjust the ear cups, is very odd. While it works, I took me awhile to get used to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Earth Shattering, But Good Value for Money","review":"These are very solid headphones in both design & sound quality. Yes there are better products out there, but for what amazon charges for these, I could not be Much happier with what I received. Bass response is ok, clarity, soundstage, instrument separation also OK. I would recommend these to anyone looking for cheapie (relatively speaking) headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glasses-wearers be warned","review":"These sound great, and the built-on cable organizer is handy. However, they're pretty tight on the head, which makes them uncomfortable to wear with glasses after a while. This isn't terribly uncommon with headphones of this style, of course, so I'm still giving it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound at a Cheap Price","review":"These where great headphons for the price. They can perform on the level just below Bose, but don't have the pay that kinda cash. I am very pleased with my purchase and how they sound. You can hear parts of the music that I never picked up. Was looking at another model same brand, but im glad I choose these, they have same great sound better looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nine months and it's already falling apart","review":"I've only had it nine months and the cheap wire has frayed insulation, and the ear piece tends to fall off. Was expecting it to last longer and just ordered a different brand to replace it. Sound OK for a cheap set but I was expecting it to last longer. It is uncomfortable to wear and does press your ears until the cartilage hurts. You'll need to readjust every so often to press on a different part of your ear in order to be comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"The item came quickly for Christmas and was everything as advertised. My 5 year old and 11 year old boys got matching sets and use them for the ipods, gameboys, etc. They fit their heads perfectly and they don't complain of sore ears (like other headphones they had before). This is a great buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Headphones","review":"AMAZON: Deleivered a day before estimated delivery date. Very happy with service.HEADPHONES: I was skeptical after reading the many great reviews on these bad boys, but let me tell you these are some decent headphones for the price, and in no way should they be compared to Bose or Beats By Dre like some users have, though they are great for the purpose of just providing good music for your ears.Mids and Lows are well balanced if you ask me, but the Highs could use a little bit of tunning; and again for the price these are great!ONE CAVEAT: Might be tight for big noggins!!!I use L/XL ball caps and these puppies are a bit tight, you have to physically adjust them to a lower setting to loosen em' up but it really doesn't bother me too much.Also since these are over the ear type of a headset, they're bound to stay warm, but that's a plus IMO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID - not made to last!","review":"I've been through three of these...they eventually stop working on one side within a year, maybe two years if you seldom use them. It's either poor manufacturing or planned obsolescence, one or the other. I do not recommend these headphones AT ALL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfied","review":"I really did not like these headphones. They made my head hurt, and especially hurt my ears. I sent them back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"I have had 3 pairs of these things, and after a few weeks, one side stops working (in EVERY pair). What does this tell me? That I am not buying the 4th, I give up. They sound great and that's why I kept exchanging for another pair (12 month warranty), but they just can't stand up to working effectively for long enough. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent choice!","review":"These headphones has pro quality for a lower price. Excellent choice for those who needs the best possible quality for an affordable price. Great bass and isolation. I totally recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Came broken","review":"Well i was excited to get these in but they came broken. I can not hear anything out of them and tried many source hardware with no luck. I am trying to return them but amazon not answering. I hope a 2nd attempt works out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy it, choose another one.","review":"At first, I think it will be a good headphone at this price. However, it turns out that I am wrong. It is really uncomfortable when you put it around your ears after a couple of minutes. While for headphones, the comfort should come first. So I would rate this for just one star. You shall pay a litter more to get one to make you enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurts my ears","review":"Not much more to say other than these headphones have a vice-like grip on my head and it kills my ears to wear them. Have no complaints about the sounds quality, etc, but the rigid plastic on the top that connects the headphones makes for quite the uncomfort"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST ALL AROUND VALUE I FOUND for common use","review":"If you are looking for a great buy at a budget price, these are for you.They were a HIGHER QUALITY THAN I EXPECTED!!!DURABLE,LOOK GOOD,WORK GREATAFFORDABLE.WOULD BUY ANOTHER PAIR .....read on if you wish..I am a student and spend a lot of time studying at home.Whether listening to lectures, music and movies online, these headphones were perfect for my needs.I was looking for a QUALITY product that wouldn't empty my wallet.I happened to find these on sale, so they were worth the price, but if you are considering spending 100+ you may want to shop around; ESPECIALLY if you have experience with noise canceling headphones.As my first pair of n-chphones, these are good enough to dull out background noise.They sound is clear and loud and I LOVE the VOLUME CONTROL built in to the cable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set of headphones for the price.","review":"These headphones sound great. Since I am a typical consumer, I can't really distinguish the audio quality between these and most other over-ear headphones. I do however have a couple of comments. The headphones are a bit too tight. I have a slightly wider than usual head so after a solid 30 minutes of use, I have to take these off. Another thing not entirely apparent when I first purchased this is the cord. It's really long and comes attached with a plastic spool! It's not ideal for office use because the spool ends up moving around a lot but it is still usable.For the cost though, I can't complain. I use it daily in the office in 30 minute stretches."},{"rating":"2","title":"headphones","review":"These are excellent headphones for the price range. One could spend more, no doubt, but these are comfortable, reproduce the spectrum of recorded sound very well, and block outside noise quite well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too tight for me, but I would buy it for others if the price came back down.","review":"I bought this in March 2010 for just over twenty dollars. It has a wonderful sound and is really nice quality overall, but it does not fit me. It is too tight for me and I can't wear it for longer than maybe ten minutes at a stretch before it becomes really uncomfortable. So I gave it away to a smaller-headed friend who is very happy with it. I would buy it as a gift again, but only at the lower price. If you have a small head, I recommend this product, even though it now costs about 50% more than what I paid for it less than a year ago. Good reviews seem to drive the prices up, eh? Pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser HD 202 Headphones","review":"well..well..i have to say...these headphones is worth the price.....About a year ago....i purchased a similar pair of Sony headphones and they were like any other regular pair of headphones.....not clear...muffled sound...cheap...but I thought \\"well they are Sony Headphones, so this is the best it can get...\\"?

Maybe that's why I found nothing new or of particular interest between its pages. I mean, all the \\"recommendations\\" are common sense and can be found with any quick Google search. I kept scanning and scanning, trying to get to the meat of the thing, and then I was at the end pages.I'll leave it on the FREE shelves in the lobby of our public library.

I still want to enjoy my private life and being pregnant there's not much I can do about my belly until I deliver...so I just wanted to say finding lingerie that looks good over ALL of me is hard thanks to my tummy in particular...this is the first piece I've bought that actually hides my flaws and brings out my good aspects. It covers the tummy well, makes it appear flatter and doesn't show any odd shape to it. It's sheer, but not sheer enough to make your midsection look weird if you have a flawed one. Now you just need nice breasts and you're good to go. It's really a good piece and was a huge hit with my husband.

I just wanted to comment specifically on the DVD presentation. The picture quality is average - maybe this has to do with the source materal but I was not blown away by the clarity. The sound is fine but seems to be louder than other DVDs - I have to set the volume down on my TV compared to most movies.

I saw it because I like Ving Rhames, and it was filmed in Pittsburgh, where I went to school. While it shows a lot of good shots of the city, this movie was so bad.It made absolutely no sense. There were drugs and prostitution, random guns, but there was no plot. The characters were all throw-aways, with no redeeming qualities to make me like any of them. Ultimately, the ending flat out sucked. It was confusing and had no basis to occur."},{"rating":"1","title":"MCSE Flop","review":"When I opened this book, I thought it would be a flop, god, was I right!

Overall, this book is not recommended. 2 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time if your looking for definitive topic solutions","review":"This book is a summation of interview questions and answers that are too general and have no topic construction. The book's chapter titles are unrelated to the content within the chapter and the same questions were asked over and over again. There are no objectives for what you are supposed to be learning from this book. And the advice given by most of the designers is pedestrian at best or let's just say extremely obvious. The book shows little organization and is written in a substandard format. If you like name dropping you'll love this book. I'm really surprised Marc Saltzman wrote this.

It just rocks but it is very melodic also. Robin Mccauley had a raspy voice that I really like, different from others of that genre. I never followed Michael Schenker before so this was my intro to him and it impressed me. This could've been huge, I just don't know why it wasn't. The band was talented, the songs were well written and Andy Johns's production was excellent! The album kicks off with Give me your love (straight ahead rocker), Here today,gone tommorrow is a smart rocker, my personal fave is Don't stop me now(cuz the animal is free again), rest of record is good with strong songs and good playing. Bass is pumping, drummer is pretty good, and they just seem to jell together nicely. Just a nice rockin record. period. Hey, Robin where'd ya go dude, you had some serious pipes!!Next record Save me was a bit more commercial than this, but also good. A nice addition if you can find it. Rock on......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodic hard rock","review":"Dating from 1987, Perfect Timing was the first collaboration between Irish vocalist Robin McAuley and German guitarist Michael Schenker. The band, which featured a new rhythm section as well, carried on very much in the same tradition of the earlier MSG albums. The music was a blend of heavy guitar riffs and melodic vocal lines. The songs were a nice mix of hard rock and power ballads, with some memorable hooks. Although not the band's best work, this is a very pleasant, listenable CD. There are various editions of this CD available, all as imports. The original album contained ten tracks. Recent remasters also included two single edits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!","review":"Why does it always seem that all good albums from the 80's are not available new?

There was a bunch of fine girls in the video dressed in ripped jeans, along with the band doing a kind of behind the scenes theme with large cameras moving all around. I bought the cassette of this and recently purchased the CD used through Amazon. The other songs are pretty good as well. Robin's voice is comparable to Klaus Meine from the Scorpions.

Sits in a corner and gets used daily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value for the Money","review":"First off, thanks to the other reviewers for the assembly tips. My assembly time was approximately one and a half hours. The only thing I'd add (which may seem obvious to some) is to not rely on the tools included with the bike. You will definately want a ratchet wrench. I also had none of the problems with the seats needing extra washers.As for the bike itself, I love how quiet it is. I just finished a session while watching one of the AFC playoff games and didn't feel the need to adjust the volume on my television. The computer seems to work pretty well and because my eyesight isn't what it used to be, the large display is much appreciated.My only concern is that the seat could be a little more comfortable. But I bought this thing to exercise, not lounge, so for it's purpose it's adequate. All in all, a very decent product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome bike for the deal","review":"I'm not an expert on bikes, but I did to quite a bit of research. It's very comfortable, easy to read screen, and great features (especially pulse read which is important to know to keep up your cardio workout).Price was great and easy to assemble (even the tension control wasn't an issue on my end). The only thing I did wrong was put the front stabilizer bar in the back and vice versa ... the drawing wasn't as great so pay attention (large bar in back).Anyway, I can't give it 5 stars since there are other more comprehensive bikes out there, but for \\"this\\" class of bike, which I would rate as semi-professional, it's a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pop/Rock with some Electronica/Ambient Sound","review":"This is an Extremely pleasant album to listen to. It's very Easy on the ears. These guys are from Switzerland. Most of the songs here are very Soothing, and Most have very Catchy Melody Hooks. They combine Rock/Pop and Electronica beats with great Melodies. The Beautiful Female vocals of Jael IMO sound Great, and they give music a Very Pop-friendly feel.Most songs really get stuck in your Head, but Not in a Bad way.Highly recommend this album to anyone who likes Dido or Sarah McLachlan or Jewel or Cranberries etc etc, even though I think Lunik is Much Much Better. But I think it's still a Good comparison.Also make sure to check out their First album, which is more Trip Hop than this, and also their Latest 2003 album \\"Weather\\". \\"Weather\\" is very similar to this album. It's a Very Pop oriented album.It's Simply Great and Enjoyable Pop music with a twist.Highly Recommended.Thank You"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Well, erm, yes i suppose you could say she sounds like Avril Lavigne because some people are deaf. it's like my sister confusing Mandalay for Beth Hirsch, stupidity and ignorance is not a virtue dear boy.I bought this album because of her voice on the delerium song, and Im not regretting it at all. she has an amazing voice. She has a similar command of english as Lene Marlin (Whats happened to her?) with the power of Emiliana torrini (sounding nothing like her [for fear of reprisal!]).It's really chilled mixed subtley with a bit of Euro Cheese.

If you're planning on travel with grandchildren, or others who may not have your love of history, this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well done piece of history on film","review":"'Lady Jane' is a great film. Helena Bonham Carter gives a wonderful performance as the ill-fated teen-Queen. Although some 'artistic licence' was taken with respect to the relationship between Jane and her husband Guildford Dudley (Cary Elwes)-in fact they had, at best, an amiable relationship- the story remains relatively true to the actual historical events, and the characters' motives were accurately portrayed. 'Lady Jane' has given life and personality to the historical figures the way no book can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good romance","review":"One of my all time favorite romances. I like the relgious history as well. Will make you cry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing Film ...","review":"for a Depressed person ... NOT A GOOD IDEA - make sure you check out this history on this before you rent - if you are not depressed - then it's perfect for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I saw this movie for the first time as a teenager and I still love it. This movie was one of the first stepping stones for me in becoming fascinated by history, especially English history. Films like these make history interesting and real for so many people. It is a beautiful story about a queen so rarely spoken of!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A True 'Crown Jewel'","review":"What is so compelling about a movie taken from history is that no matter how much we hope and pray, we cannot change the ending of the movie. And Lady Jane is one of these. We feel for the two young lovers so that we would do anything to prevent the inevitable. Just knowing the fate of Lady Jane almost reduced me to tears.The acting was superb, the scenery stunning, and the costumes both lavish and breath-taking.And if *that* doesn't tempt you enough, then I have two words to add. Cary Elwes. You may remember him from The Princess Bride and Robin Hood: Men in Tights. Not only is he a terrific actor, but he gets the job done looking *incredible*. He alone is reason enough to make this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not historically accurate, but a wonderful historical drama","review":"I loved this film for the great drama of a mere sixteen-year old being used for machinations of her family to ascend to the British throne. There is a scene where Lady Jane is punished (by spanking with a paddle or something) for disobedience; this is a harbinger of the ultimate tragedy for the hapless teenager. While the details of this historical drama are not precise, the tale is well-told and the costumes and scenery are magnificent. This is a good, riveting historical drama despite the liberties the screenwriters have taken."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning tale of kings, queens, politics, and love.","review":"This film has everything a film should. There's fighting, fencing, queens, and true love. Not cliched true love, but one that evolves over a span of time. Love that becomes the kind of love we all seek. The love between two friends that is able to go the extra mile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lady Jane","review":"I was disappointed in this movie. I had hoped to show it to my students, however, decided against it. It is a boring story. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane must have been replaced by a clone","review":"One of the worst movies I've seen in my life.I researched a bit and found that the real Lady Jane was very different from this 'clone'.They made her sound like an idiot who backs up the wrong things and doesn't use her head,Also,Jane Grey was suppose to have 'sandy hair',not dark brown."},{"rating":"1","title":"PRETTY BAD HISTORICAL DRAMA","review":"This movie was SO awful, dreary and depressing that my friend and I stopped watching it about 1 hour into it - we couldn't take it anymore!! And we are both HUGE Tudor history fans. But this film was just awful in every way; it was a total waste of money and I wish I could return it!!!If you want to see REAL Tudors drama with fabulous acting, great scenery and extraordinary costumes, check out The Tudors on Showtime - do yourself a favor and don't bother with \\"Lady Jane\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Okay, okay. This was an awesome movie. I cried and cried afterwards. It stinks that I can't find enough info on if Jane and Guildford actually loved each other. Really, I did love this movie, I wasn't joking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Movie with Some Historical Innaccuracies","review":"\\"Lady Jane\\" tells the story of one of British histories tragic figures, Lady Jane Grey, who was forced onto the throne by her manipulative parents and the father of her husband John Dudley. Lady Jane was only queen of England for 9 days, but her story was a good one. The movie takes some liberties with the love of Jane and Guildford Dudley, but it does capture Jane's will and her faith, as well as her strength in the face of death.Great performances are given by young Helena Bonham Carter and Cary Elwes. While this movie is not as flashy as more recent portrayals of the Tudor error (as seen in Elizabeth, The Tudors, and Shakespeare in Love) the movie has a lot of heart and accurately captures the trials of being a woman, even a royal one, in Tudor England. If you're a fan of the period this movie will not disappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still enjoyed after all these years","review":"I hear Helena is a bear to work with, but the results are always worth the wait and the grief. Even so young, she brings such intensity to the screen, you can't bear to look away. A little piece of history dramatized and played before your eyes with passion and vitality. Wonderful midweek escapist movie with tea and crumpets."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Absurd Disappointment","review":"I'm a colossal fan of the sweeping costume drama, particularly for this time period. The costume part of this drama is magnificent. Every other aspect is a mockery in the name of dancing some pretty faces across the screen. The script is weak and the characterizations are binary and ridiculous. As if that weren't enough, editing was handled by the drowsiest of the Seven Dwarfs, and the sound production is extremely cloudy and uneven. If you have any appreciation for Shekhar Kapur's 1998 version of \\"Elizabeth,\\" or even Zinnemann's \\"A Man For All Seasons,\\" don't bother with this slow, sticky mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"This was a really good movie. The scenery and costumes were stunningly beautiful. Having read books about Lady Jane, I do not believe this movie to be entirely historically accurate,(especially the passion that Jane and Guilford shared in marriage - which contradicts most of what I have read about their relationship), but it was still entertaining. The ending was very moving and sad, but Jane stayed true to her Christian beliefs and lost her head over it. I would definitely recommend watching this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sportsman's Paradise 2","review":"I wouldn't recommend this game. I thought it would be really fun until I bought it. The graphics are horable and you can run faster than the animals going slow. The animals are dumb looking and not real at all. I own 10 hunting games and I'd strongly recommend to buy Buckmaster Deer Hunting and Bird hunter Wild Wings Edition. They are the best games I've ever played. Lots of rifle, bows, shotguns,and muzzeloaders equipment. You can drive fourwheeleres, trucks and even boats. Great games features and graphics."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been better","review":"The only really interesting thing about this movie were the flashbacks. If they had focused on that, instead of trekking through the woods, it would have been a much better movie. ANd I must have missed the point of this as I watched alot of the movie in fastforward, but what was Vlads purpose in taking and having sex with the one modern day blonde, and then going after the past blonde? Or is this another of those movies where sex and nudity has to be thrown in just because? I was really disapointed in what I thought would be an interesting movie rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome!!!","review":"This movie was AWSOME!!! It was a little \\"corny\\", but that added to it. I loved every minute of it, until the end, it could have been better. But it did fit the format of the movie. A couple good sex scenes.(very intense)No Complaints with the acting, except Billy Zane, good actor but I think he should have paid a little more attention in his Romanian lessons, then maybe he could have mustered up a little bit more than just, \\"Da.\\" LoL.But overall, GREAT. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to know more about Vlad Tepes (Vlad the Impaler) than just the same old Vampire stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring a pillow","review":"Boring....not much more to say: Lack of action, lack of gore, lack of horror, lack of enthusiasm, lack of energy.

The whole story and variations of the theme of the dracula fiction was also absurb. The main theme is some stupid amulet. I just didn't like the movie. The story is too far absurb, and I didn't like the fusion between the old world and the new-all through the amulet \\"breaking the wall of time\\" It was like mixing two separate themes which totally clashed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love that it's recycled, don't like the shave","review":"I transitioned to this razor after my local store (that sold the Wally shaver & blades) closed down. This razor reminds me of the cheapy disposable razors-the ones that always take a layer of skin off the front of my shin bone when they're sharp, and give me horrible razor burn to boot.I love that they're made of post consumer recycled material, but the blades don't last long, and the shave is not fun about half the time. Maybe it's just me, but I've been shaving for nearly twenty years, and this just doesn't work for me.I'm going back to my Wally-just found it here on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is the recycled razor packaged in plastic?","review":"Full disclosure: I haven't even tried this razor yet. I will rate it again afterwards. This rating is solely for the insane three-steps-forward-two-steps-back thinking that went into using plastic packaging for the razor that is selling itself as being made of recycled yogurt containers.

I didn't know if I would get satisfaction from a sequel as most just don't live up to the original. I am happy to report this one isn't most!This author did a fantastic job keeping to the story, making it as exciting, if not more so, than the first one. The twist was really a twist, not something I had guessed before I was a chapter into the story.I *highly* recommend this book (and her others, especially Cobb Island!) for anyone looking to purchase some great reading and support one of the better authors around."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read","review":"The story of Liv and Kayla, and Bridget and Faylinn continues in this sequel to Cobb Island. More of the Redding Family history is revealed, but from an unusual source.

In this version, the player has to use direction-specific bombs to open walls, hide in little \\"invisible\\" cubes, avoid monks with different agendas. . .It all gets tiresome after several levels.More maddening is the apparent disconnect between keystroke actions and Lode Runner actions. Several times, I thought I timed my jump, turn, or climb perfectly, only to find that the program did not detect the keyboard interrupt (input) for a second or two--long enough to guarantee level failure. Moreover, it's easy to mis-hit a direction key (instead of the usual four direction keys, you get eight--twice the opportunity for error).In sum, you might want to investigate other side-scrolling action games. This one is just too fraught with nuisances, keyboard bugs, and needless complications."},{"rating":"1","title":"IM I4 READ BELOW FOR MORE DETAILS.

A lot of people mention about the cups being uncomfortable on the ears. This is true in my case as well.

I used the 10$ value sony earbuds all the time, and the first trully gave me some surprises.It looks simple. It's not very comfortable for wearing compared with earbuds. I love classic music, and I really can't hear the difference between a 60$-value good headphone and a 10$-value earbuds with pop music. Bass was very strong. I turned fully on bass of my sony CD-player, then my ears protested. Music is crystal clear. The only thing I'm confused is that I could hear clearly the position of diffferent instruments in the band with my earbuds, but I couldn't figure out anything with this one. Maybe I need some time toget used to it.Overall, it's a good headphone, deservs the money you want to put on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good pair of head phones","review":"I have owned this pair of headphones for over 3 years now. They are probably the best pair you can buy, in this price range. Very clear sound. Most of the reviews here and at other audio review sites do a much better job of describing the sound.The ear cups are very soft but the over-the-ear design might cause some discomfort initially; depends on the shape of your ear. This reduces after six months or so. The wire is quite long and i used to trip on it often. i had to buy new ones once ,which sell for $5-$10 on the sennheiser website. The overall construction is quite rugged.Cons: bulky and slightly uncomfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flat is where it's at","review":"These headphones deliver a rather flat response over most of the audible range - just what I had in mind when I bought them.

I am doing research on the German Enlightenment, and only Croce offers a detailed discourse on thinkers whose importance only matches their obscurity. The first half of this book presents Croce's own aesthetic theory: an atheistic theory with a Hegelian twist (he wrote what is living and what is dead of Hegel) that is spiritual without being religious. The second half of the book is the real gem. This is a detailed history of aesthetics, in all its obscurantist glory! Do not deny yourself a book that is both an illuminating introduction to aesthetics via its history, a penetrating theory of aesthetics, and a great reference book for an aesthetician. The man who coined the term aesthetics, Alexander Baumgarten, is developed in this book ... one of the few books that goes beyond mentioning his name and importance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Operation Blockade","review":"I bought Blockade at a tiny gaming store primarily because it was the only game I could afford that fit my requirments.

Operation Blockade is very similar to Beach Hunt, so if you liked BH, you'll like this.Once you become a master at this game, it's all you'll want to do. I still sometimes, when I'm stuck on a game, play Blockade just to relax and enjoy the fun of shooting down planes and ships.

It was written in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, as we in the US struggled to understand why it happened. Gregorian, interestingly enough, is of Armenian parents, but was raised in Iran. The book was published in 2003, but it may as well have been published in 2009, as President Obama himself tries to understand and make peace with the Islamic world.It is a very short book and is written for the general public, but in a very much academic manner. In it he, first of all, explains how Islam started in 600 AD and how and why it split and how this plays out today.

There are already numerous other books which covers World War One in German East Africa and they are more entertaining. I came away from the book with the question if the Gen. Lettow Vorbeck and the schutztruppe were never victorious, then why did it take the Allies four years to defeat them?

You will really develop abdominal power and flexibility, as well as the Yoga glow that comes from deep breathing and a calm mind.

It is most likely the best in the series, essentially due to the intricate fight scenes choreographed by none other than \\"The Man\\" Yuen Woo Ping. Unfortunately, all of the movies in this series suffer in the same manner as the build-up to the fights is rather boring and extensive; i.e. the stories are nothing to write home about. In actuality, my favorite movie with Jet Li depicting Wong Fei Hung would be \\"Last Hero in China\\", which is officially not even a part of the OUATIC series.

In this beginning scene he encounters a \\"White Lotus\\" sect whose aggressive ways in dealing with foreign affairs lead to too much killing. The fight that is created between Wong (Jet Li) and the White Lotus sect displays an internal fight with one's own countrymen. The fight scenes in this sequal are original and high intensity. A very imortant message slips through all the perfectly coreographed action scenes. Even the opposition may be evil and underhanded, violence is only a short-term solution. A nice touch to the movie is the romantic stirring between Wong Master and very distant Aunt with no blood relation. It's not as sick as it sounds...

I still catch late night reruns on 'WE: Women's Entertainment'. Even though I still get to see Jennifer Garner (Hannah) and Greg Grunberg (Sean) on ABC's 'ALIAS' (also a JJ Abrams creation ;-D), I still miss the cast of 'Felicity'.. especially Megan, Javier, Noel and Richard. This first-season collection is awesome. I hope seasons 2-4 will also be released on DVD/VHS in the future -- I know I'll buy 'em!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Star episodes, 2 Star DVD Set.","review":"I really love the show, but I had to rate it 2 stars, because the only \\"bonus\\" material they had was commentary. Menus are nice and touchy. I'm no expert at picture or sound, but picture looked a little granny at some points. My guess this is Buena Vista's first time for a dvd set for a tv show. I say to myself, if you really want to see a really great DVD set, it would have to be, Twin Peaks season 1, hands down. Even though it took long to come out, it was worth it! Let's just hope when Season 2 of Felicity comes out, they jam pack it with a lot of features, tv spots (Especially \\"Cure for the lovelorn\\", special b & w episode![.]), and the FELICITY clip spoofing X-Files, and ER (Which was featured at the emmys!) But most unlikely, it would just have the episodes again (ugh.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST!","review":"The first season of Felicity on DVD is a must for Felicity fans to add to your DVD collection. I miss the show so much and being able to watch the episodes takes away (well only a little anyway) from my longing to watch Felicity and Ben on Wednesday nights on the WB. My only complaint is that the other seasons are not out on DVD yet!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A show to be remembered forever.","review":"I never understood why the public never embraced Felicity. I consider this one of the best television dramas of all time. From the superb acting and intelligent writing, Felicity was one of the shows that always remained \\"real\\". The entire cast is superb, most notably the stunning Keri Russell. Her honest, subtle, and heartbreaking performances were the main reason to tune in every week. Scott Foley, Scott Speedman, Tangi Miller, and Amy Jo Johnson all created wonderful characters that I felt like I knew. There was always a lot of drama, but the one thing the show did best was not make you feel sorry for the characters. It also did well by giving each character their own storyline that was interesting and not overdramatized. In my opinion, Felicity had one of the best ensemble acting in years, and its wonderful to be able to treasure this wonderful series on DVD for years and years, instead of fading off into an oblivion like most great shows do."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHE'S BACK!!!!","review":"I'm glad that now everyone who was not tuned in and mesmorized by Felicity/Noel, Felicity/Ben, Elena/Tracy, Meghan/Sean, Julie, Richard, Ruby and the rest of the gang every week get to meet them now. This was my favorite show on television at the time. I NEVER missed a show and now I can see it again in its entirety anytime I want. The Second through Fourth Years will not come out quick enough for me. This is a great coming of age story for everyone to enjoy. Felicity was a person I would have loved to know when I was in college. I really enjoyed watching her transition from sheltered bookworm to the strong and sure woman she later became. This will be a treat to watch over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to get hooked","review":"I received this DVD for Christmas and was immediately hooked all over again. I loved this show and was sad to see it come to an end. I can only hope that they release the other seasons as well, because I would love to relive the entire series.

I highly recommend this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTALLY DECEIVING !","review":"I love Felicity, and I would love this DVD box set if only Buena did not change nearly ALL of the background popular music. So now when you pop in a disc, watch an episode, you feel completely and utterly lost as the beuatifull music originally aired has been replaced with new \\"up to date\\" music. Exactly like the re-runs on thw WE channel, same \\"new\\" unfitting music. This is not what I have come to watch and love.Would you buy the movie Ghost if the classic love scene would have another song playing in the background than Unchained Melody ? I'm sorry but changing the music alltogether is changing the overall feel and I don't get to watch the scene I remember the way they were done.Poor judgment from Buena Vista to think nobody would notice that.I'll stick to my VHS set thank you very much.This is sad. Don't buy this unless you don't care about the memorable scenes with carefully chosen fitting music playing in the background."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Shows of All Time","review":"Felicity engaged audiences by showing how vulnerable college student Felicity handled life, love and family throughout her college years. The Freshman Year Collection is essential for Felicity fans. The awkwardness between her and Ben, the first sparks between her and Noel and making friends that would last a lifetime. All the tragedies and wonderful events that befell our favorite undergrad are included in this series. Felicity struggled with her destiny - choosing a major that she loved, rather than one her parents' had chosen for her. The first season examined relationships with her roommate Megan, her loves (Ben and Noel), her family and her new friends. Watching these episodes again are a comfort and make me long for my college years."},{"rating":"2","title":"why CRM doesn't work","review":"Brilliant book, I recently purchased the book to help annalize why our CRM program doesn't work.

I have loved Tae Bo ever since. This workout is no exception. I actually like that the videos aren't too polished. They feel gritty, which pushes me to work harder.This workout is not as hard as the Get Ripped workouts, but it is harder than the original 1998 workouts. It keeps you moving but does have some intervals that are more intense than others. I use it for cardio in conjunction with other workouts for toning and abs. Nonetheless, even though I do \\"boy\\" pushups and have been doing resistance and weight training for upper body, my back and arms are sore (in a good way) after this workout! I definitely recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best video but still enjoy it.","review":"I own the Billy Blanks amped DVD's and I wanted something different to work out to, the workout is okay... the music is not all that great and the exercise crew goes a little too fast and off the beat of the music sometimes but I do feel like I get a good workout. It might be a little intense for first time users but I would still recommend it if you want a good cardio workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably not best for beginners","review":"I have been doing martial arts/dance cardio workouts for a while now, in my opinion this dvd in particular is not great for beginners. But dont get me wrong, I really enjoy doing this dvd!There is an brief instructional section in the dvd menu and I definitely recommend checking it out first. It will give you a great base to start from, but when the moves get fast-paced some of the combos feel awkward to me. Especially the kicking ones. Im sure if I stick with it that the awkwardness will go away.In my opinion working out with incorrect form is the #1 reason for post workout aches and pains. Thats a subject that goes untouched in this workout in particular. If youre a beginner your not going to know how to tuck your tailbone, tighten your abs or flatten your back to avoid hurting yourself. Even I catch myself slacking a bit sometimes.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Billy Banks is not a good teacher","review":"I started working out with this DVD about 1 week ago. I'm in pretty good shape. So far, this is not a great workout. Billy Banks doesn't give enough direction & he doesn't allow enough time to slowly learn the moves. I'm not familiar with Tae Bo so it's hard to learn the moves before he speeds them up. Stopping & starting continually does not make for a good workout. Then, at times, he talks on & on while we're still working out in the learning stage! Then he gets back into it & speeds it up. I wish that we had looked into this DVD before purchasing. I will be looking for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardest Taebo Ive done...","review":"I started Taebo way back when it first came out. Unfortunately quit working out for a few years. Started back few months ago. The moves were easy to pick back up. I have 5 other taebo dvds but this one kicked my butt. I had to stop and put on pause to catch my breath a lot. Its my go to dvd when I want that extra push and want to test myself. After a few tries it does get easier. Its a good workout. But its also a no joke workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good video - but harder than expected","review":"I LOVED the Taebo set of tapes that i bought in the late 90's.

Is working out only for fit people???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"I am in pretty decent shape, but this tape was a terrible workout. Everything is too fast and he moves from one exercise to the next without much direction. Also, talks way too much. Much prefer Jillian Michaels kickboxing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Billy missed the point!","review":"Taebo is hard to do if you do not have VERY STRONG ankles! Almost every move requires you to pivot with your ankles in ways most people have never dune. I almost sprained my ankle trying the most basic moves. I got this to work my gut not my ankles! Apparently Billy Blanks expects everyone that tries this to already be in good shape. That wins the award for missing the point of a home workout. In the end I had the trow this dvd away because I could not do the workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Tae Bo","review":"I love Billy Blanks and have many of his DVD's. He is so positive and inspirational. I love that his workouts are mostly in rythmn with the music and they always count in sets of 8. It really helps get you moving. I really like this newer DVD. He keeps you moving and added in some new moves but didn't make it too difficult to follow(like parts of Tae Bo Ripped Extreme). You always get a great workout and sweat with Billy DVD's. This is a great one to add to your collection, or to start with if you have never done Tae Bo before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Cardio","review":"Overall a great cardio workout. But the counting (non-stop from start of the video to the end) was bordering on annoying and very distracting. When I can't get to the gym for Body Combat classes this is a great substitute. Only if they stopped counting and worked in better music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"Not as good as his older VHS tape workouts in the late nineties.

On the rare occasions in which the author deigns to mention criticisms, he frequently dismisses them with the sort of arguments that one feels the French have ready at all times.

THis book is simply wrong, it is a nice idea that Europe has more people, more money and more culture, but in the end it is a failed confederation, sort of like the early american confederation.

Having first-hand experience, my main comment is that there are some inaccuracies; the power of the \\"European government\\" and the pro-European feelings of the EU citizens are exaggerated. May 9, what is that? Who celebrates it? And yes the anti-trust division may be strong with a precise mandate; the euro-parliament, on the other hand, is not considered even remotely as powerful as the individual country governments (in my opinion at least). Perhaps the author's experiences and research results are from a limited number of EU countries where the above sentiments and beliefs hold?

The history of European politics, in regards to European unity is extremely well done. The implications for the common currency is that the whole continent will reduce transaction costs, and in theory invest that money back into Europe's economy. The same applies to the elimination of tariffs as goods and services cross borders. By uniting Europe becomes the largest economy in the world, and the largest market. Weaker currencies exchange their currency for a stronger more desirable currency, the Euro. After putting these puzzle pieces together Europe seems more Superpower like, with a voice certainly equal to the U.S. The author's argument is powerful. The author does not mention how immigration will affect Europe, or make projection/commentary about Social Democratic governments. The \\"Last Days of Europe\\" offers commentary on both immigration and Social Democracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emperically weak book for anti-American Provocateurs","review":"I am PhD student of European Integration and how it has changed Europe's relations with the America. This book is a misguiding piece of literature. The general thesis is that American super-power will be squelched by European soft power. While it is well-written and does illuminate some provocative aspects of European-American relations, it ignores the reality that Europe is finds it difficult to integrate with itself (e.g. Constitution 2004, Bolkestein Directive, Lisbon Treaty Post-Irish Referenda, Free Movement of People). Look, to conclude that Europe is a single bloc politically is absurd. Ask the British, the Danes, the Swedes, the Poles, and any other Euroskeptic state. Europe is an economic idea - not political. This is not to say that it won't be, but Reid assumes it already is.A better, more objecetive, historical account of integration is Dinan's 'Europe Recast'. Read that, toss this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, well written, fairly current","review":"Having lived in Europe for 7 months, I found this book to be very resourceful. It covers a wide range of topics from political and industrial development, to Eurovision and the younger generation.One chapter seemed to ramble a bit about the details of the life of an American CEO, but nothing too distracting. I wish the author would discuss more about the role of India and China as future competitors with the European Union and not just America. Either way, I couldn't put this book down. An enjoyable, informative social read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps a bit over the top","review":"This is an excellent introduction to the European Union, but I fear that Reid exagerrates a bit. The EU is certainly powerful and many of its principles excellent, but Reid seems a little biased in its favor.

Even with the rear pegs out the angle is almost zero. As with most all cordless keyboards the lights that indicate such things as caps lock and numbers lock are not available on the keyboard to save battery power and so are much harder to see.

I'm also surprised I'm writing about a Logitech product - I've always been happy with them, including my last wireless USB laser mouse (which I plan on keeping now!)The keyboard lag and mouse lag are noticeable and I think the key may be in how close you are to the receiver. I was unable to get the unit to work at all over 8 feet away (distance from my big screen to the couch). I have to sit on the floor with the receiver pulled as far out of my entertainment center as it can go, so overall distance is now <5 feet and it seems to work most of the time.

It was a refurbished item and I used it for 2 years. It was very simple but working great except the battery life. It broke recently so I bought this MX3000. I have been using it for 2 months now and I changed the batteries twice - and I only use it at home in the evenings and weekends. My second complaint is the reception of the keyboard. What is the definition of wireless? I can not sometimes get reception when the keyboard is on my lap and I am sitting on an angle to the table. It is crazy, why would I need that many buttons when I can not even get a decent reception? In my opinion most important things in wireless electronics are the battery life and reception - and MX3000 fails in both departments. My only positive comment is the mouse, it is very ergonomic and fits well in my hand.

I have had it about 3 months and have had no problems at all. The desktop I have is a fairly glossy black, and the optical mice don't work very well, if at all on it. The laser mouse works perfectly without a mouse pad on this surface.The keyboard has a nice feel, works without delay, and is fairly compact in dimensions, which is great and does not add clutter to the desk.

I like that it has an on/off button on the bottom. It allows me to shut it off and save battery life if I'm going away for a vacation. The extra buttons did not initially work with Mozilla Firefox, but upgrading the SetPoint software fixed the problem. Only downside left is that the scroll wheel does not wake the mouse up.

He robbed, cheated and lied his way through life and the author wants us to care about him? No attempt was made in this book to cause us to care about his victims. Even while he is in prison he cons his way but we are supposed to accept his behavior because he reads the bible and professes to love Jesus. I might have been able to enjoy the book if it were well written. I found the writing mundane and non-engrossing. If the author wanted to interest me in the main character he shoud have stayed with him instead of trying to make the author's connection with the conman a part of the story. I found no facts in the book that I had not already read in earlier newspaper accounts. If you must read it pick it up in a dustbin.

This is the old guard from the fifties trying to make a hip comedy about new sexual mores that looks less hip than the 1930's film, It happened One Night. Billy Wilder and Jack Lemmon are of the forties and fifties sexual sensibilities. This creates unintended grimacing from the actual sixties and seventies crowd. \\"Hey, grandpa, that's frontal nudity.\\" It's as embarrassing as spotting your parents in the shower. Juliet Mills, cute, nice chest, but not exactly a role your father and younger sister would be proud of.Also, the jokes fall flat then and today. It crawls to a pathetic conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Permisso...Avanti","review":"This is one of Billy WIlder's overlooked filmes.

Perhaps a bit of Billy Wilder's priceless humor. I just saw this film on cable, and thoroughly enjoyed it for a variety of reasons. I give the film 4 stars because I don't think the script was Wilder/Diamond's best. Their best, of course, are among the all-time greatest movies--no need to mention names. Avanti is a cute little romantic comedy, set in gorgeous Ischia and the Amalfi Coast(my next door neighbor is from Ischia, and I called him about the film while I was watching it). It has the scenery, some fine acting by Lemmon, Juliet Mills and especially Clive Revill, an amusing story line (see other reviews), a great song (Senzo Fine), and, finally, Jack Lemmon and a chubby but shapely Juliet Mills skinny dipping in the Mediterranean in their semi-youthful prime. Ah. What more could you ask for? Thanks, Billy."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVANTI","review":"AVANTI with Jack Lemmon and Juliet Mills (bought and viewed in DVD) was a major disappointment. Biggest problem was the casting of Mills. Juliet Mills was an attractive woman, but her part needed a super-attractive starlet that could carry some rather dragging scenes with just personality and looks. The maid with the mustache was creepy, and having to view Jack Lemmon's bare-naked ass not once but twice was a bit much."},{"rating":"1","title":"70's mistake","review":"What went wrong with a Billy Wilder and Jack Lemmon movie? I think it was a 70's thing. This movie is dated and not funny. Funny is when you at least smile at the writing or gags- so unless you call Jack and Juliet Mills nude funny...... The running joke about lunch time is tired. The scenery is gorgeous though and it must have been a fun trip for the cast but I think Avanti is a product of the free love 70's.It's too bad the other reviews here lead you to believe it's better than Some Like It Hot because it really isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gabe Ortiz Fan club","review":"Okay, maybe this is a terrible way to review a book, but I have to say that Earlene Fowler has created a character that I know if he were real I would have a major crush on!! Gabe Ortiz! I am absolutely addicted to this series of books and I am not sure I can make it until the next one.

I enjoyed the reunion with several characters from earlier in the series-like D-Daddy. Earlene has a magic feel for just when to add a new character or revisit the old ones. I never get bored. Benni Harper is so easy to get to know. It is no wonder that clues fall into her lap-folks just want to share their lives with her. I enjoyed sharing a late evening with Benni myself, as I couldn't put down this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit different from the others","review":"This book is different and has interesting complexities. There isn't the personal danger as much as in some of her books and I would have liked more of Gabe but the new characters were great, the old ones welcome returns and the ending not at all what you expect.

The only difference is those labels are clearly visible in conspicuous places on the products. I don't care if this carries only the smallest trace amount of lead or whatever the offending chemical is. I won't buy this product again for my family.

This combination of high-quality whey isolates and \\"green foods\\" is a definite winner; it mixes best with very cold water and could be seen as a good jumpstart to your morning, prior to any \\"heavy\\" breakfast. 22 grams of whey protein per serving, MCTs to augment the mix, and a decent dose of stevia as a sweetener keep Greens & Whey well near the top of my list of preferred supplements.

They either tasted great but had little protein (10g or so), or tasted terrible and had 20g+ per serving. I also liked the fact that this one was loaded with greens, since I could really use a veggie boost in my diet. I was thrilled to taste this one. It tastes GREAT! I always put it into smoothies and always mix with my blender. It mixes well and tastes really good with any fruit I've thrown in, from acai to banana to mango to bluebuerry. I can't speak to how this protein tastes with just water or milk as I never drink my protein that way, but in a smoothie it is excellent! It also fills me up well, so it's a good meal replacer when made into a smoothie. This is my go-to whey protein from now on.

Their is no other protein drink I have had that doesn't make me ( a male) feel pregnant-like and shy away from taking one in the morning before work.

It's high protein, low sugar, and packed with green foods. Unfortunately, the taste makes it almost undrinkable.

I know, it's chocolate flavor, this just illustrates how desparate I am to try anything, because I hate wasting it. I don't remember this from before, but it actually made my mouth numb.

I use it for smoothies, using yogurt (you've got to try Nancy's organic nonfat plain, BTW -- it is hands down the best tasting, richest around!) plus fresh or frozen fruit, whatever's around. Usually bananas and frozen berries, plus if you have pineapple that adds a nice tang. The product tastes good - I've only had the chocolate version - but it's not like it's so delicious that you'd want to drink a case of it if it wasn't good for you. I used to drink Spiruteen and I think this is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formula change = gross","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer: This powder used to taste great, but now it tastes terrible.

They chunk out clear, vibrant, brain wobbling bass, and overall offer fantastic frequency response better than many headphones three times the price. I've been thrashing mine for 3 years and they are still good.Pros - brilliant sound, phat bass, lightweight, can run fine from an ipod or laptop without a separate pre-amp, can wear them for hours, shields out all outside noise including planes, screaming babies and colleagues.Cons - really long cord is awkward, shields out all outside noise including cars screeching towards you, or other dangers.

This doesn't impact me right away, but after a couple of hours, my ears are sore from the pressure, and are very sensitive; however, most headphones have this problem unless they can be altered for fit, but most do not.For $40 or so, these are great.

I'm no expert regarding headphones, but I had no issues with the sound on these.Now, the bad: I found these headphones to be extremely uncomfortable after moderate stretches of use. After 30-45 minutes, my ears would be in pain from being pinched under the pressure of the headset. And my head isn't particularly wide.Secondly, after less than three months, the connection has gone bad. They sit, useless, in a bin next to my computer. I didn't even use them that much before the wiring flaked out on me.Of course, most people seem quite satisfied with these headsets. Maybe you will be, too. But the comfort issues and flimsy connector can't allow me to recommend them from personal experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"I love the frequency response on these headphones, they're also pretty comfortable. This is actually my second pair as I wanted to get one for home as well as at work. The only thing is that since the cups don't go completely around my ears my ears will get sore after multiple hours of listening. If you don't like a lot of bass response they may not be for you. I even use them for some djing since they are so much more light/comfortable than \\"real\\" $150 sony dj headphones, and I got em for about $50.Another plus: the headphone cable is replaceable, which I can't say for $150 sony dj headphones. After about 4-5 years of heavy use and accidentally stepping on the cable I finally broke the cable on my HD-212's, but was able to order a replacement cable from Sennheiser. When the plug on my sony dj headphones broke, the headphones became useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"I did my research before purchasing these headphones. They certainly have great sound and good bass. I was a bit disappointed in the bass, as I like to listen to Dubstep. Very low deep bass much of the time. However, they do have good bass compared to many others...I'm not so sure I will find headphones designed for that type of music. Otherwise, I have nothing negative to say. The reviews are pretty on point. They do sort of make your ears warm and they are a bit tight to my head so after wearing them for a long period my ears need a break.

While the rhyme of Mr. Prelutsky is always fresh and fine, it was the illustrations that captured my mind. Dyanna Wolcott has a wonderful eye for the child like experience. She captures the world of dogs with a fanciful blend of humor, originality and blazing color. As a book of months this is a wonderful teaching tool. But I found it a special book for dog lovers too. I gave a copy to my daughter as a gift. She's 42!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Hold My Attention","review":"I like this author, the Hot Zone was a marvelous book and the fiction version was not that bad. These were the only two reasons I picked up this book. The description of the book sounded somewhat interesting, but without the author I would have passed on it. In hindsight that was a mistake. The author really did try his best to make a business case study more aptly used in a college class then a mass publication book, interesting to read. He could not pull it off. The good flow of the book and the fact that it at least tries to keep you interested is due to the skill of author. Yes there is a lot of detail about this new form of making sheets of steel, but unless you are in the industry or a gluten for punishment I would stay away from the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A company bent on beating Japan at making steel","review":"Never in my wildest dreams would I expect to root for a steel factory in west-central Indiana to save American industry, but you have to read \\"American Steel\\" to believe it. Nucor Corporation has a wild idea about building a plant in tiny Crawfordsville, Indiana, and beat Big Steel and Japan at the same time with non-union labor. Though the writing style is fairly simple the story itself is fabulous and I wouldn't believe it if I didn't know it was true."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining book on steel? YES!!!","review":"I bought this book only because I like Richard Preston's work. Frankly, my interest in steel and the steel industry (metal in general, for that matter) is nil -- but I just had to see what Preston was going to do with this subject. I now know more than I ever wanted to know about steel and the men who make it -- and the learning process was funny, suspenseful and gut-wrenching. This was a DELIGHTFUL book and I'm glad I didn't let my lack of interest in the subject turn me away from it. I give this book my highest compliment: I'm glad I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I finally found a \\"Food Program\\" that I can live with.","review":"I bought Marilu Henner's Total Health Makeover because I have 10 pounds to lose and although I have tried many so called diets, have been unable to drop the extra pounds or feel better. I also found that I was eating too much chicken, and too much red meat. I love the program and even though some of the ingredients are hard to find, you can still follow her program and eat \\"real\\" food. I am going to buy \\"The 30 Day Total Health Makeover, on audio if possible, and continue on this wonderful \\"Real Food Program\\". I find that I am very satisfied and am not hungry between meals. Thank You Marilu, and keep up the helpful information. Irene"},{"rating":"1","title":"The 30-day Total Health Makeover","review":"Though this book has some interesting information I find it discouraging to use for several reasons. First, the author failed to include an index of the recipes to refer back to. Second, many of the ingredients are unusual for the average person. She gives no real assistance in describing what something is to help one find it -- and I'm a fairly seasoned shopper and cook! Finally,I do not think the author is truelly concerned about her average reader. She is so idealistic she forgets many (most!) of us have limited resources in time and money. She can, if reader isn't careful, make you feel like you are a lesser-able person -- when you are really trying to stick to a diet and change a lifestyle it is quite discouraging.For general information regarding her theory I'd recommend instead her other book \\"Total Health Makeover\\". Perhaps there are better cookbooks to use for actual meal planning -- I'm still looking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ideas, but I really don't like some of the food","review":"Overall, I love the ideas of the plan. I only need to lose about 5lbs more, having already lost 5lbs on the plan in a week. Eliminating all meat and dairy (except ice cream) was easy, sugar was harder, not because of craving it, but because even simple things like canned baked beans have it in some form. I find the grocery list helpful for each week, but going through each recipe for the week and adding up the amounts of each food that I need for the week is very time consuming. My biggest problem is that I DON'T LIKE some of the recipes. Not the seafood ones, just the ones that are just brown rice and all the vegetables. I do love all the tips and adapted many of them into my everyday life already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not if you dislike fish!","review":"I got this book and was pretty enthusiastic about complying until realizing that most of the meals are fish!

I lost about 25lbs! My schedule got hectic and I went off the program, hence the weight came back and I feel lousy. Im going to try it again because it is an easy plan to follow and you do feel better. I also bought the \\"Fit for Life\\" book which states the same beliefs as Marilu, but it was harder to read and I found alot of contradictions. I'll stick with Marilu!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Rigid","review":"While this book contains numerous testimonials from satisfied customers, I found it far too rigid. By the time I reached Day 1 on page 83 and was confronted with no caffeine, no dairy, no sugar, no meat -- I felt defeated before I had even begun. No doubt there are numerous people willing to relinquish such mainstays in their diet and happily live on fish, tofu and soybeans -- it simply isn't for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book that Can Change Your Life","review":"I first heard about Marilu's book on my 30th birthday, when she was interviewed on an Atlanta radio station. I was ready for a change and decided to buy her book. I quickly found that Marilu's Health Makeover is not just another diet. This is a lifestyle that will totally change the way you think about food. Take a look at Marilu Henner, she radiates health and birthed 2 children over the age of 40. How? Marilu believes that with good health, you can do anything! The plan is easy to get started and follow, I think it's great if you love to cook.Marilu won't win any awards for her writing, but her style is easy to follow and at times funny. The key is, she keeps you reading, inspires, and appeals to a broad audience.If you are looking for a new way of eating, looking, and living, you should definitely pick up a copy of \\"Total Health Makeover\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've never been so hungry in my life.","review":"Besides being incredibly expensive, I don't like this diet because I spend all my time cooking, cleaning up from cooking, shopping for food and a half hour after every meal, I'm thinking about food again. All I do is eat and prepare meals! I'm so hungry all the time. This can't be good for you. Everything listed as a meal goes right through you. I never feel satisfied. I don't enjoy food anymore. It's nice to spend time cooking but I am quite tired of it. It's a great diet for a very wealthy person who doesn't work for a living and has someone else cook, clean and shop for them. hey, that sounds like Marilu! what a coincidence! By the way, what is Arugula?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A diet mentality, too much work, much of the food is lousy","review":"I had followed Marilu's first book Total Health Makeover, but was disappointed with this book. I tried the 30 Day plan and could only last 4 days on the menu plans. It was a very calorie restricted diet. The rice & rye and the soup were awful and I thought I was going to sprout gills from all the fish (normally I love fish, but not everyday!! - that's not even healthy). I didn't get into her tips that much - I got bored reading them. In her favor, I have tried some of the recipes (including some good fish ones) that I use occasionally (outside of the strict 30 day plan). I have no intention of following the actual 30 day plan again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I wanted! Great!","review":"It is an excellent book! I love the grocery list for each week. It saves me time. I love the daily motivational tips and menus! Helps me stay with the program and be organized.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed in this impractical eating plan.","review":"I gave this plan my best shot but the recipes are too much trouble to fix. I was interested in her no dairy, no sugar, no meat philosophy and have been dairy and sugar free and have given up red meat. I do believe that has helped me. I can't afford to buy organic produce and I got tired of fixing the family something different every night. I will be selling this book as I have no need for it anymore. Anyone interested?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great menus- great food. If you like to cook you will enjoy","review":"I am on day 24 and feel great. Some ingrediants have been hard to find. It would be nice to have a glossary of items along with a substitutiion. I have found that almost all of the recipes are delicious and have enjoyed making them. I have lost 9 lbs and have 12 more to go so when I finish my 30 days I will be gong back to blue and green weeks.Thanks Marilu...I have 3 friends on it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit into the vegetarian way","review":"Although I liked the organization of the book with the types of tips included, I was very disappointed to see that Marilu included FISH recipes. Vegetarians do not just sustain from meat and poultry, but also fish. In the beginning of the book, she discusses how the human body was really designed for a vegetarian diet...why does she include fish as part of the menu? Furthermore, has there been any research done that food combining is really helpful? The ideas sound good--but where are the facts?"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I was turned off by the book because of the way that Marilu speaks to people like they have no clue about life and that she's got it all figured out! Why would I want to live in your world? In addition, her book is the same diet as \\"FIT FOR LIFE\\", with some added tidbits of how to organize your environment. My shoe closet would need organizing too if I had 400 pairs of shoes and what does that have to do with weightloss and healthy eating, are fat people slobs?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite the book I expected...","review":"I've enjoyed Marilu Henner on TAXI and in here other roles, so I thought this diet would be right up my alley.

There are a million diets out there, but no one has written a book about a health makeover that brings it down a notch. Marilu brings it down the the common person and shows just how easy it is for you to incorporate simple changes in your eating habits.This book literally goes day by day, week by week, offering you food tips, exercise tips, beauty tips, spa-on-a-budget tips and more.I hesitantly started this health makeover, and you know what...I lost 17 pounds and was able to keep some of the tips incorporated into my daily life.

The direction, while technically proficient, sets the wrong tone, wavering uneasily between brutal violence and goofy antics. The annoying soundtrack was no help, as it seemed at times like it was intended for a light comedy. Elias Koteas' one-note performance portrays his character as if he was totally clueless, making him look as if he had just graduated from the Blue Lagoon School of Acting (Some day I'm going to count how many close-up shots there are of his dumbstruck face. There seemed to be quite a few.). When you find some of the supporting characters are more interesting, you know the movie is in trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun film, but a little too long.","review":"I rented this movie cause it it had an interesting story. A bellhop in total mess. Its fun and chilling at times, but this movie is little longer then it should be. Elias Kortas is simply a great actor. He makes this movie. He is such a young Robert Dinero.This film was done in 1998, but just released on video/DVD cause it was done by the director who did \\"Secretary.\\" This film I wouldn't put in \\"Film Noir\\" class like the back of box says, but I guess in the new genre of sorts: Post-Tarantino.This movie is perfect for a rental.

In addition to the great screen, I also love the 805's speed, memory and built-in wi-fi. Let's not kid ourselves: this is a high-end PDA and not everyone will find it a good value.

To be very blunt, it kicked my (...) Ed Norton is very believable as Will Graham, and Ralph Feinnes was brilliant. I didn't much care for Harvey Keitel as Jack Crawford, but I guess that's because I loved Silence so much. Harvey wasn't bad, he just wasn't what I thought Crawford should be. And of course, Anthony Hopkins plays Hannibal Lecter as he always does, which is brilliantly. Thanks to Silence of the Lambs, these types of murder mysteries are my favorite type of movie. I don't want to give the plot away, but I will say that the movie is worth the price of admission and much more.

You have been duped, however. You should be comparing this to the movie Manhunter (1986) with William Peterson. Red Dragon is an attempted remake of an excellent movie with very little extra to offer accept an average performance from Anthony Hopkins. I urge you to watch Manhunter first, as it was made long ago, and you will see Red Dragon for what it really is. Considering whether this is a different adapatation as written by others, I recall much of the same dialogue from Manhunter and scenes straight out of Silence of the Lambs.

It starts off adding an extra scene to include Anthony Hopkins, and continues this habit throughout the movie. These scenes are not in the book and do nothing to further the movie. Red Dragon has an all-star cast, though no one seems to put effort into their role. Most importantly, Edward Norton (playing Will Graham) fails to portray the innner conflict in Graham. He seems unaffected by the case, which couldn't be farther from the truth. Manhunter was a much better movie, with much better directing and acting. In Manhunter, William Peterson plays Graham and does the part much better. Peterson plays a dark, brooding investigator who is truly sacrificing a part of himself to take on the case. This self-sacrifice is the heart of the book, and was largely lost in Red Dragon. I recommend that anyone interested in Red Dragon watch Manhunter instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe is not that bad, but after seen \\"Manhunter\\"...","review":"I think they did a poor casting for this movie. Edward Norton is a great actor, but this part (Graham) just doesn't fit him at all. Also, Ralph Fiennes, good looking guy, playing Francis Dolarhyde??? It doesn't make sense.Michael Mann (director of Manhunter) is a genious, the way he goes deep on each character and the music (check Miami Vice), the perfect song for each scene, man! it's everything this one lacks of.Compare Manhunter with Red Dragon, compare the scene of Francis and Reba at the vet, with the tiger, with whichever scene of Red Dragon.

This is a great film, one of the best out this year, in a year of paltry serious releases that have included a short list that contains one hour photo, bourne identity, monsoon wedding, and the cinerama re-release of Lawrence of Arabia.It is much more \\"Silence\\" than \\"Hannibal\\" but with different primary characters (Ed Norton in place of Jodie Foster). There are some flaws, but overall a very good film. The acting cast, which includes Anthony Hopkins as classic Lecter, Ed Norton, Emily Watson (who deserves an Academy nomination as best supporting actress for this role), and Phillip Seymour Hoffman is phenomenal. Great visuals, suspense, and music.Expect this film to do well, critically and commercially."},{"rating":"1","title":"red dragon","review":"I wasted money on this movie.

Edward Norton does a great job as Will Graham, and Hopkins of course is unforgettable as Lecter himself. This movie gives insight as to the background of Hannibal before he winds up in prison before he meets Starling. Ralph Finnes is okay as the \\"tooth fairy.\\" If you're looking for gore though, try another movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Horror.....The Horror","review":"Attention Hollywood. Stop remaking movies that are already good i.e. Psycho(1998) and Red Dragon(2002) formerly known as Manhunter. This movie was slow and boring. Ralph Fiennes failed miserably measuring up to Tom Noonan's performance as Francis Dolarhyde and in this go around Anthony Hopkins is outperformed by Brian Cox's previous portrayal of Hannibal. The film had no sense of urgency or suspense like Manhunter had. The cast even \\"acted\\" like they had a case of deja vu (hasen't this story been told once before?) Granted having seen Manhunter I knew what the story was so there were no real surprises. but at least give it the college try for entertainment. It even failed there. Avoid this movie at all costs. If I could give this movie zero stars I would. Do yourself a favor and watch Manhunter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget this movie","review":"Red Dragon is a huge [failure]. The acting is so bad that you seem to watch a comedy. The killer is ridiculous compared to the one in Michael Mann's Manhunter(judge for yourself).

The only thing Red Dragon had going for it was Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector. Edward Norton played Will Graham in Red Dragon and I have to say he was not very convincing. It was orginally played by William Petersen of the series CSI and he was much more believeable and tangent as the FBI investigator. Edward Norton seemed way out of his element. I'm not saying that Red Dragon is a bad movie.....it's just not as good or as creepy as Manhunter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Movie, Killer DVD Features!","review":"The movie: killer. Almost as good as Silence of The Lambs, I thought. Norton is great and Hopkins still manages to bring new life (or death?!) into the sickly intelligent mind of Hannibal The Cannibal.The DVD: Even more killer! Great interview with Hopkins, inside the mind of a serial killer with an FBI profiler-the real life Norton who hunts these guys down-commentary and more.I grabbed this for a price of [money], I would have paid the retail [money] or whatever for it-it's that great.Happy viewing and be sure to watch this one the sound up, some superb effects bounce all over the room, as with any DVD.5 STAR RATING FROM SCRAGGY'S TOMB OF HORROR DVD'S, USA."},{"rating":"2","title":"just sharing","review":"Red Dragon - Released 2002 - 126 minutesDirected by: Brett Ratner, Universal PicturesAnthony Hopkins, Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Harvey Kietel.Hannibal the cannibal (Anthony Hopkins) starts his feast with a lovely dinner party and the guest of honor is the person they are feasting on.This movie will keep you in your seat and you will not want to miss a part of it.

Red Dragon is just a remake of Manhunter, and not nearly as good. All the performances in Manhunter are much more intense and edgy.

You push \\"Play Movie\\" on the menu, and instead of playing the movie as promised, they make you watch a preview for The Incredible Hulk. Extremely annoying.The only worthwhile moments in the film are with Anthony Hopkins, but he is not central to the film. The problem is that the tortured (and torturing) serial killer, played by Ralph Fiennes, is just plain weird. Not interesting, not compelling, and above all, not believeable.There are some unintentionally funny scenes where he talks to his mom that could have been lifted straight out of Psycho. Except at least Psycho knew that it was a campy exercise in style, whereas this movie takes itself way too seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"good as a commentary on the state of cinema and its viewers","review":"The writers tried very hard to make the gory details as disgusting as possible but apart from that very bad acting and story .Really these Hollywood movies are made for kids , except the subject matter is not for kids .

Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Film creators need to read the book!","review":"Those who read the book knows that the movie is not 100% accurate. This really annoys me.In the book, Francis Dollarhyde was supposed by really ugly. Ralph Fiennes does not seem to be ugly. In fact, he was more good looking. This is important because it is one of the reasons why he is messed up. His mom left him because of what he looked like and thus his grandma took care of him. That's why he still lives in his grandma's house. Anyway, there is more to Francis' background.......BUT WHERE WAS THIS IN THE MOVIE????There was barely any info on Francis' life. That's why audiences are like, \\"what the heck? why is he like this?\\"Hint of advice for movie creators- Read and understand the importance of the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Epic fail","review":"Bad casting! Bad adaptation of the book. False ending.Edward Norton seemed more like Doogie Howser than Will Graham; hardly believe him as an FBI agent and it's like he just got out of Acting 101 with his monotone delivery. Harvey Keitel was unbelievable as Jack Crawford and would better suit a TV crime show with his usual delivery. Ralph Fiennes is too damn good looking to play Francis Dolarhyde, someone I made out to be quite freaky looking from the book's adaptation of the character.The story itself was cut up and moved slowly with a finale that wasn't even in the book itself. There was no fear in this movie whatsoever..then again, never read a good book and then expect Hollywood to turn it into anything but a weak rendition of it.Can't believe people gave this 5 stars, I barely wanted to give it one.Read the book and don't waste your time with this movie! Fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Are you kidding - It's gonna be such a big disappointment?\\"","review":"This is gonna be a short review because i am very disappointed. I can't really say that this movie will be bad but after such brilliant directors like Ridley Scott worked on Hannibal and Silence of the Lambs (forgot the director's name), how could they take a prequel and make Brett Ratner direct it? How could you put the director of Rush Hour, which is a comedy, into a psychological thriller like Red Dragon? Sorry guys but I'm gonna have to give it one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than I thought it would be","review":"I was impressed by this movie. The story is predictable, but the production itself was well done.

This is, I'd say, the best film of the trilogy, edging out Silence of the Lambs. Edward Norton and Ralph Fiennes also give strong performances. Brett Ratner did a superb job on this masterpiece, clearly his best work to date. Wittier and more clever, Red Dragon is an instant classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wheee","review":"I finally had a chance to see this movie. It's no Silence of the Lambs but it's good. Edward Norton has always been a great actor.. Primal Fear, Fight Club, American History, etc, etc. He can mix it up unlike most. This movie fit him quite well. And of course Hopkins always does quite well. He's got a level of sarcasm to add to the narcism and it works nicely.

I wish I enjoyed Hannibal as much as I enjoyed Red Dragon.."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Good Actors Do Bad Things","review":"Wow-what a horrible movie. This is really sad to me. I love Silence of the Lambs, didn't see Hannibal, and really expected great things from this film. Everyone is really great in it, which is why I can't figure out exactly why this movie is so bad. The genius detective thing is really embarrassing to watch. Everything is predictable and silly and trite. This might be one of the worst written screenplays I've seen in a while.

As the movie opens, Norton captures the elusive Hopkins, not without suffering some physical and psychological repercussions. Keitel convinces Norton to return to the FBI to help snare a monstrous killer who has been dubbed Tooth Fairy by Hoffman's tabloid publication. This includes Norton's decision to seek the assistance of the equally vile Hopkins. Moody and atmospheric, RED DRAGON is well paced by director Brett Ratner with an ominous score by the ingenious Danny Elfman, and a twist ending that might leave you squirming a little in your chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"In my opinion","review":"Graham's character is portrayed much better in Manhunter. In Red Dragon, his empathy appears to be a psychic ability because they never really define his struggle. The psychological result of thinking like a serial killer is the focus of Manhunter, and they pull it off nicely.That being said, Dolarhyde's character is done much better in Red Dragon. He gets a lot more screentime than in Manhunter, and we really get to see the 'non-beast' side of him. In my opinion, this characterization is what truly made the movie.Hannibal Lechter just felt like dead weight in Red Dragon; he never really helped the investigation. In Manhunter, his inclusion merely served to awaken those old serial killer thoughts in Graham. In Red Dragon they try to make him more than that, and it comes off very flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Do It!!","review":"Red Dragon is a terrible, formulaic flick with good actors but nauseating writing.Not only are almost all events and details plot devices (oh, how I dream of a day of character development without excessive leveraging for plot line) but they aren't really interesting. Imagery is not great (I had AT LEAST expected good imagery) and I was not put on the edge of my feet. The clincher at the end was not fun, exciting, or creative.

This movie is a prequel to Silence of the Lambs, and explores the relationship between Dr. Lecter and Will Graham, the FBI agent who captured him. Graham has retired from the FBI but they ask him to come back for \\"one last case\\" in which the serial killer seems to be targeting families. Ralph Fiennes is a great choice to play the \\"Red Dragon\\" and his skill makes you almost feel sorry for him. His relationship with the blind woman played by Emily Watson is both revealing and very sad, and gives you hope that he can be redeemed. Edward Norton is fantastic as the FBI agent and his journey because of Dr. Lecter is intriguing as well. This movie has many twists and it really keeps you on the edge of your seat. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Prequel","review":"Anthony Hopkins reprises his role as Hannibal Lector in this prequel to Silence of the Lambs.

Suffering thee, as he puts it \\"The Black Dog\\" for most of his life it becomes clear to the reader that he did live his role in life beyond just satisfying his personal ego (unlike most politicians), though his ego was not anything small it did gain it's personal satisfactions and it's blows.Much like his life the book is long and never boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"A VITRIOLIC ATTACK","review":"TRY TO EXPLAIN WHY EVERYBODY IN THE CHURCHILL FAMILY WAS A FAILURE.CHURCHILLOPHOBIA ALL THE WAY."},{"rating":"2","title":"See What's Hidden by Trees and Private Acces Roads","review":"The coast of main around Bar Harbour, and the houses on that coast are some of the most beautiful areas on any coast, anywhere. The problem is that the waterfront there is almost entirely privately owned with access restricted and with so much vegitation (trees) so that these views cannot be seen by the casual visitor.A surprising amount of these houses are the work of or were influenced by one architect, Frederick L. Savage. This magnificant book takes us not only back in time through historic photographs, but also through the trees and down the private access roads to see these houses and their settings.The style of these houses, most dating around 1900 have become almost a traditional United States style, although sometimes looking somewhat out of place when placed in a different kind of climate. These houses were designed to keep out the severe Maine winters, with small windows, strongly build roofs and the like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is the front cover Babe for LW8 :(","review":"After all these years of waiting and wondering what hot babe will show for front cover of Inside LW8.. and what do I get? an old GEEZER??? have we waited that long?

EXCELLENT BOOK.

The reviews on this book don't do it justice because it is just that good. The 'novice' guy that thinks the book is not for beginners must be reading something else because if you can't learn from Dan's quickstart chapter (chapter 1) then something is wrong with you. There are hours and horus of videos on the books dvd too that teach you step by step. Each chapter ramps you up from knowing nothing to understanding the program. The novice reviewer is the only 3 star review which makes me believe that its that same guy out to put down dan's stuff.

Inside lightwave 8 rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT","review":"Your looking at the comments to see if this is a good book.... well it's more than just a good book. You WILL be able to use lightwave after reading this book and following the tutorials. If you have even the slightest interest in Lightwave and would like to learn it but don't know where to start, this book will get you there. Not only is this book a great start, it is an invaluable reference. If you need to figure out how to do something in lightwave, whatever that may be, you can probably find it in this book. BUY IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"Dan has written a geat book for the Lightwave 8 user. The quick-start chapter is a great idea and will have everyone up and running in an hour or so. The writing style is easy to understand and conveys the information eloquently. Each chapter,there are 21, is <,= to 50 pages so you could read a chapter a day and in 3 weeks have a very thorough understanding of L8, and 3D in general.

Nothing could be further from the truth.The book has a new approach, starting with a simple tutorial to get you started. The chapters are packed with information and tipps that give you a feeling of accomplishment. A lot of different subjects are covered (incl. the new and exciting features of LW 8), in good-sized chapters that are easy to follow and digest.That alone would all be worth the price, but once you discover hours of video tutorials on the accompanying DVD, you know that you got more than your money's worth !A great deal ... and a \\"must have\\" !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book of all books","review":"This book is certainly the most comprehensive book compiled for any software package that I ever read (and I do multimedia and cg to start:D )Firstly I can certainly say no other LW Tutor has covered what Dan has covered in this bible.

Then to add 'insult' there are extra video downloads available on dan's site for FREE.

My piece of crap processor can't handle the good graphics, which are snail-slow, and Regis is pretty annoying in the game, too. 20 bucks is a small price to pay for expectations, but a big price to pay for such a stupid game.

Give me a break ! That's part of the game. I find that the game is was right on track in the beginning. However, after playing the game for about five times, it started giving repetitive questions. For the amount of questions that this program has, they should make it shareware and let you decide if you want to pay the [money] for registration. Then, you can have more questions downloaded. Otherwise this game is a great disappointment and not worth the [money]."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Who wants to be.... timed?\\"","review":"I agree with an earlier reviewer. There is a timer in this game. You only get 30 seconds to answer each question. That's it. Now you tell me, is that fair? For goodness sake, when I saw the online game at abc.com, it had a timer. So I said to my self \\"Hmmm, those poor soles that have to play the game at abc.com! When I get my new millionaire cd, I'll get unlimited time to ponder the intellectual significance of these brain teasing questions.\\" I never would have dreamed that this utter mistake for a cdrom would actually have a timer! We paid $20 to be timed! Heck, if I wanted to be timed, I'd play the online game.Millionaire 2 will have 600 questions. I don't know if it too will have a timer. I hope for Disney's sake, they don't. Judging by all these reviews, I really doubt people will shell out another $20 for a game with new questions, and no improvements. Pathetic. Just Pathetic.

As noted in other reviews here -- the first 10 questions literally repeat in consecutive games!The sound and graphics are merely o.k and Regis is as smarmy as ever.Beware of any title that can be prepared in such a short amount of time.

After just a few games, you start seeing some of the same questions, which just ruins the fun. Also, there doesn't seem to be that many questions overall.I had more fun playing the free game on the Internet which I highly recommend, esp. if you have a high-speed connection because it loads very fast.The best part of the game was the virtual Regis and the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"There should br a free update","review":"I bought this game for a friend and we played only 6 rounds before starting to get repeat questions. It was very disappointing. They should have allowed you to run the game from your hard drive and included an additional database cd with more questions. If it wasn't for the repeats this would have been a very cool game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but needs more work","review":"First and foremost, the game needs more material. The questions repeat WAY too much than they ought to. Computer games I have from ten years ago don't repeat this often! The other problem with the game is that Regis does not ask you, \\"Is that your final answer?\\" until you answer at $500,000. He should start saying that at the $1,000 level. Regis also doesn't read the question, and the questions are timed. On the show, you could use the whole show on one question, though I'm sure they'd edit that down to an extent. But the game is pretty good. What they need to do is cut down on phone-a-friends (they have four per question!), and do more on the game material. But I did get to the million before the game started repeating, and so I'm glad of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is really fun!","review":"Playing this game is probably just like being on the real show.

This game was the most hideous thing I have ever played. Not only is it easier than the TV show, its twice as dumb! The first and second questions I was asked the first time I played were the same stinkin' question. From the third game on, I never went without a repeat question. You should stay away from this. It will probably eventually drive you insane by the low-fi sound clip of Regis saying \\"Final Answer?\\" anyways. Try some of the not-as-pathetic games by eXpert software.

Since some of the first few questions are ludicrously hard (which is totally unlike the show), and it gives you 30 seconds to answer the question (which is ALSO totally unlike the show), I have to restart the game A LOT, which means I hear Phil Regis A LOT. A \\"skip\\" button should've been put into the game! I haven't recieved any repeat questions after about 3 months of owning the game. How? I uninstalled it after 30 minutes and never played it again! Trust me, you'd get more fun out of an electronic whoopee cushion than this game...and it's $5 cheaper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive and not accurate","review":"There are two problems with this game:1) Not enough questions, and not enough repetition logic.2) The \\"phone a friend\\" lifeline is completely useless. If you were on the show, you would phone a real friend and you would have a good idea whether or not they *should* know the answer. On this, you're just calling Regis' friends, so it's not really useful at all. Therefore it's not an accurate representation of the real game. (yes that's bad, and no I don't have a suggestion around the problem)The game is fun for the first 5 games or so, until you start getting more questions repeated. It's not a full priced game though, so you kind of get what you paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money; Only fun for first 1/2 hr-1 hr","review":"At first, I was very excited about getting this game. When I got it, I really enjoyed it. It started out as a solid 4-star game, great questions, sarcasm from Regis, heart-pounding music, it had it all. The only initial problem was that the first few questions were too hard. But then after 1 hr. of playing it...WHAT WAS I THINKING WHEN I BOUGHT THIS GAME! The questions kept repeating, and repeating, and repeating! After playing it for 2 days of playing 1 hr. each day, I can get up to $125,000 almost everytime because I remember all the answers! Besides the very limited supply of questions, the multiplayer game was also pretty bad. Given, there are more good things about it then there are bad things, but the bad things are absolutely unforgivable. The only reason to get this game would be to learn about 200 new facts (the # of questions) because you're guaranteed to remember ALL of them after only about a week of playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down!","review":"My mom is a HUGE fan of this show. I bought this game for her for mother's day. I was completely embarrased when we discovered how ridiculous it was and actually went out to get her something else! The questions repeat themselves so often it is embarrassing and insulting to the consumer. They should have had at least 1000 questions available. The game repeated its first question after we had played three games. Now every question is a repeat and the CD might as well be a coaster for all the good it is now! The graphics are pretty well done... looks a lot like the show but the content is poor. I expected much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALL HYPE AND NO DELIVERY","review":"It's obvious that this product was rushed out to take advantage of the hype around the show. The question base is limited (started getting repeat questions within 10 games), the game moves at too slow a speed and there is no way to customize the program so it meets the level of the player.My hope is that Disney will create an upgrade that meets what consumers expect from a company like theirs. For all the money Disney is making on this network show being the number rated, they should upgrade this program and make the upgrades available to all who purchased the current version.I don't recommend purchasing this product until they've upgraded it and made it worth the dollars it costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruth from L.V.

If you're expecting something like Trivial Pursuit with Regis this is not the game. Do not buy this game, I feel so bad seeing this game at number one. Save your 20 dollars and buy boardgame Trivial Pursuit instead, you will have about 100 times more fun for only 10 dollars more."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only the TV show were this easy...","review":"My thoughts are a recurring theme of other reviews. The questions repeat too quickly and frequently. Apparently, Disney wanted to take advantage of the show's popularity and rushed to get the CD on shelves for Christmas. Oh well, caveat emptor (this is the answer to one of the repetitive questions). I will be certain to wait until I have read reviews before buying the software. Not worth the novelty of being the first in the family with the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"insulting","review":"As a teacher of educable mentally impaired middle school students, I can only say one thing, \\"Your CD version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire\\", is extremely insulting. I brought it to class for game day and the kids were thrilled! We sat down to play and didn't quite get the two or more player directions displayed on the screen. It was then that Regis started calling us \\"dummies\\" as well as \\"pathetic\\" and then shuts down the game! Can you imagine the reactions of these kids who already suffer from low self-esteem. What is the deal with Regis firing these abusive names and coments at the players. You should be absolutly ashamed at this type of name calling which we absolutely discourage at our school as well as in the home. \\"Get rid of the degrading comments, Regis\\".

Unfortunately I was greatly disappointed. While at the beginning it is enjoyable (mostly for the novelty sake) the questions quickly begin repeating themselves which make this game not worth the time or the effort. If you are indeed a fan of the show, the second version is indeed better although they still appear to be in a need to make a fast buck off of this game. My overall suggestion would be to continue to wait until the programmers spend more time and effort on this game rather that continually trying to make a fast buck off of the novelty of the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for the first FIVE minutes!","review":"After only one day of play, I knew the answer to all the questions.

This was novel, new television. Now, of course, it's repetitive and boring, but for a while there was really a spark there.The computer game, however, always.... It hogged memory, was hard to control, and wasn't very much fun. It's sad, but the online free version at ABC.com was a lot more fun. I generally don't like games where there's no flexibility and very little fun, so if you're like me (and I would hope so!), avoid this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeating Questions","review":"The game is good (if you like the show's concept) except for the repeating questions. The reason that there are so many repeating questions is because every question has a phone a friend lifeline which is actually carried out...you have to listen to 30 seconds of audio of a friend explaining their answer...I imagine that the CD is all filled up with these 30 second audio monologues. It's a cute concept but I would have preferred text to the audio so there could be 100's of more questions.Buy Jeopardy instead...it's more fun and the questions don't repeat as often."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO QUESTIONS!","review":"This game had lots of potential! Regis is exciting in the game, the graphics are nice (although they never change), and it's fun! However, questions repeat and repeat and repeat! IT IS NO FUN!

IT SHOULDN'T BE LEGAL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great theme, horrible game","review":"If you really like Who Want's to Be a Millionaire, like the multitude of television watchers that does, this game is almost worth the price.

Instead of this product, I would personally recommend the You Don't Know Jack series..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Glad it Was Only $20!","review":"My brother and sister were really excited when I ordered the game for a gift. After we opened it on Christmas morning, we could only stand it for about twenty minutes. The questions were ten times harder than on TV, and we could barely get the fastest finger question to work. I was reassured when I saw the game was made by the creators of \\"You Don't Know Jack\\", but the people at Disney must have rushed this product to market. Take your twenty dollars and put it towards another Jellyvision game like \\"Jack...\\" or \\"Headrush\\". This is the most awful computer software I've ever owned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Wants to Be a Sucker?","review":".We had a lot of fun with this game...for the first hour. Then, we started seeing the same questions over and over again. By the time we had played for several hours, every question up through about the $32,000 level was a \\"repeat\\".Another disappointment: you have to read the questions yourself. That may sound like a minor issue, but I bought the Jeopardy game the same day, and it's really helpful to have the audio when you're racing the clock.Save your money; Millionaire is a bust even though it's commercial free. Maybe Millionaire 2 will have some improvements."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING, DISAPPOINTING, and out $20.00","review":"Loaded up the game at 5:00. Saw the first repeat question at 5:20. No joke. The questions were ok the first time they came up, but after a couple hours, anyone who can remember their phone number can get to the big one. We had heard negative reviews, but love the tv game, and decided to give it a shot. It was a $20.00 mistake. You'll read some positive reviews, but in all honesty I feel this game is a con. I cannot believe they didnt have some sort of testing done before release. It is sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Game I have ever played","review":"The game has some serious installation problems. You first get an error \\"App.zip\\" cannot be installed. Then you get to figure out how to copy the files from the CD manually to a directory six files deep on the hard drive. Then the game failed to launch. I then disabled every program in memory and it finally launched. After playing this repetitive - terrible game for a while - we shut the computer off and then the game refused to launch again. We reinstalled the game several times and then it worked again.This game has bugs galore and was obviously rushed to market. Their Web site has very little information on resolving the problems and after six days of e-mailing them I still don't have any replies. I want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for about an hour","review":"The first few times through, this game is entertaining.

The first clue should have come when I had installation problems. Once I got it going, the screen liked to blank. In my opinion, you need a new and powerful computer to run this program. A computer much more powerful than the listed minimum requirements.I tossed my copy of the software in the trash, since it's not easy to get a refund and I'm not interested in an exchange.Too bad, though. We love the TV program and were looking forward to placing the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like in the hot seat","review":"The pressure is on! I was at the $1 million question and suddenly I became really nervous, just like I would've on the real show! The question was about Aesop's fables. I used my 50-50 and the remaining answers were A & D. Then I used my final lifeline and phoned a friend. Regis's friend said it was A. I agreed with him and it was my final answer. YES! I HAD WON A MILLION DOLLARS! You might think it would've calmed me down, bt guess what? It made me even more nervous! This game is not worth it unless you want to rattle your insides. If you wanna feel the pressure and do the game, try the second edition. I haven't played it yet, but I think there'll be much less pressure. Although if you're smart, you might win $64,000 on your first game (like I did.) Also: THe questions keep repeating. Avoid this game like it is a mosquito or a bee or a wasp or something like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"The game crashes","review":"Each time I play, the game crashes.

It is like being on the show only a little bit easier in some parts. In my class, I play it at recess with other people and we have a great time! Some of the questions are pretty hard.

This was just pittifull. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Would Want To Buy This Game?","review":"The game, like most, is ok at first but then gets very repeatitive.

THE MULTI PLAYER FUNCTION DID NOT WORK. I KEPT HITTING VARIOUS LETTER KEYS FOR THE CORRECT ANSWER BUT IT DID NOT REGISTER.

However, when actually being played, the game is sure to depress. If it isn't crudely simple, the design is poor and uninspired. The entire game is essentially based on one lackluster thing: Regis Philbin repeating the same phrases over and over again. \\"Be Sure to come back to... Who Wants to be a Millionaire.\\" \\"I hope you'll join me again on... Who Wants to be a Millionaire.\\" If one doesn't decide to resell (or simply trash) this game within its first week of purchase, they work for Disney Interactive or are Regis themselves. Don't waste your time on this pitiful effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"For $1 Million- Who wants to play this game?","review":"Answer: No one. This game was a gift to my family and we only played it a few times, and then knew this game was NOT Disney quality. They rushed the game out while the show was at an all-time high, without working out the bugs. On the fastest finger question, if you get it wrong, Regis shuts off the game. The game takes almost 10 minutes for it to come on. You don't have to be a millionaire to know not to buy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Wants to Be Dissapointed?","review":"Since this game was developed by Jellyvision, and since I run the only website about their You Don't Know Jack games (I don't know if Amazon let's you post URLs) I was looking forward to this title. Let's just say that, it was a dissapointment. The questions repeated ad nauseum, the opening 5 questions, which are supposed to be really easy, were real tough, and Regis didn't really appear in the game. His voice just popped in from time to introduce the next question, but he doesn't actually read the questions. (And he seemed a bit more sarcastic than usual.)Basically, this game has the soul of Jack but it's trapped in Regis' body. I think maybe Disney Interactive didn't give Jellyvision a lot of time to get this out the door, but here's hoping that they learned from their mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"a total waste of money","review":"Believe me, I would give this game zero stars if Amazon.com allowed me.I received this for Christmas as a gift and let me tell you. This is possibly the worst piece of garbage put on the market. I mean, the questions run out fast leaving the game to replay old questions which are easy once you get to know them which means the replay value isn't very high. If you want a fun game try the Sims or Delta Force: Landwarrior. Your time would be better spent with those games ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Free with the purchase of a box of cereal (I am NOT joking)","review":"Free, with the purchase of a specific brand of rice-flavored cereal: Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, 1st Edition.

Regis isn't funny, the clock kept beating me and every time I used a lifeline I seemed to lose on it. The highest i've got to is $64,000 and I don't think I'm that stupid. The questions repeat too much and the clock, kept making me make stupid errors. Another thing that really annoyed me, is the levels of questions. I often found questions for $8,000 or $16,000 easier than ones for $100 or $200. If you want to play this game without spending about 20 dollars. Go to ABC.com and play their online game, It's better than the CD Rom"},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining for a short period of time","review":"I think that the review at the top of this game has it right -- not enough questions. Also, the $100 through $1000 questions are too hard (compared to the TV show).Another annoying feature is the inability to skip past stuff that you have seen a million times, that is redundant to you.I bought this game out of boredom, and I think that I paid about $... for it. If you like the TV show, then don't pay any more than that. But, if you see it on the rack real cheap, then hey, pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only three questions in this game... when it's working!!","review":"Would have a good review if the developers spent more than five minutes slapping this together. By the second or third time through the questions were already repeating themselves - awful! Plus multiplayer is just a \\"fastest-finger\\" question to determine who plays solo. Big deal!The worst part is the game only runs about two or three times before it crashes on startup. This is on an Intel PC with name-brand components, no cheap swap-meet stuff. The only solution has been to uninstall and reinstall the game. A visit to the Disney Interactive site for tech support... umm where is it? Because of this I can't recommend anyone purchase this game.They've come out with a second edition of this game (wow, so quick?) Perhaps this version works?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad Game!","review":"The only thing good about this game is that it is cheap!

As others have said, the questions start to repeat early on. I think the questions are more difficult than on the real show and the lifelines do not have the same effect. ***I DO recommend playing this game but I would share with family and friends because it does become repetitive so quickly. Hopefully it is because they wanted to get the game out around the holidays and in the future will offer upgrades or additional questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wants to get ripped off?","review":"Loved the TV show which is why I bought the game. As other reviews stated, the same questions started repeating after only a few rounds. It seems that this software was rushed to market so it could beat the holiday rush. Was hoping for the game to run more like Jeopardy which blows this game away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short-Lasting, Realistic, and Drawn-Out","review":"This game matches with the real thing quite well, but has too few questions to endure. If you've never seen the show, it's simply a series of fifteen, each increasing in dollar amount until the last, million-dollar question. It's drawn out. There's a speech clip for each dollar amount, answer, and other things. The infamous \\"final answer\\" option only appears when you take a while to answer, unfortunately. The lifelines are realistic, minus the fact that \\"phone a friend\\" is really \\"phone Regis's friend\\". The \\"fast finger\\" scrambles the choices, and the first correct key pressed wins. The graphics are pretty good and there are neat animations. I recommend this for Millionare fanatics or trivia people, but only those who won't run out of questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Potential...Very Disappointing","review":"I gave this to my brother for his birthday and we were all very excited about playing....but within one nights play we had repeat questions.

I couldn't wait to get my hands on this... but what I got was disappointment. Like many other people the questions started repeating quickly. Also, unlike the game, you may have to use lifelines on the first few questions: in some cases, they're more difficult than the ones later on! The lack of Regis also makes an impact, and when he does come on, he's either delivering his lengthy between question speeches, or insulting you.

Now, I cheated one time by pressing my letter everytime an answer would come up. THEY NEVER GAVE THE RIGHT ANSWER! -Second of all, if u are playing and lose all of it (meaning ur back to zero), Regis comes on and is really rude!

Perhaps I am a bit in a box, but, seeing a Frankie and Annette flick, I expect them together--- I expect most others would, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Soldiers' Pay\\" is Nothing But Talking Heads: Read a Good Book Instead","review":"Despite the fact that the DVD box shows imagery of soldiers in Iraq, this documentary consists almost entirely of talking heads, filmed in living rooms and on streets in the U.S. The heads are talking about the war, and they all give pretty much the same information you could hear from anyone else who reads a newspaper, or knows someone who's been over there, or who reads more than a few current-events blogs. The speakers are not particularly articulate (except for one ex-Marine officer), and -- really -- any random Joe sitting around a coffee shop could deliver a more convincing and tightly argued anti-war polemic. This DVD is all talk, talk, talk. I would suggest you read one of the many good books that have been written about the war, pro and con. I mean, if all you want is words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointed","review":"I was really looking forward to seeing this film. But after viewing it, I was disappointed. It is a great story, but the dialog is weak and sometimes borders on bad banter. I noticed several changes in Harvey Keitel's German accent. The adaptation from stage to film should have been smoother, as many of the lines seem forced. I did appreciate the tone and the horrible images portrayed in the movie. The cinematography is wonderful and David Arquette is quite good. This film just didn't stand up to Schindler's List. Just my opinion!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"Was looking forward to this, a movie based on Jewish internees in German concentration camps who actually helped out in the crematoriums. But what a slog:1. Confusing: it's like the movie's two discs and you've just inserted the second disc.2. Horrible acting.3. No attempt at accents.4. Claustrophobic look, tight shots, etc. This, I assume, was because they didn't have much of a budget so kept the shots tight so that they wouldn't have to build expensive sets.5. No attempt at characterization.6. The film's look is too bleak, too dark throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"bound in banality - spare yourself","review":"This film was a gratuitous usage of \\"shock and awe.\\" I have read widely and seen many movies dealing with the Holocaust and never have I encountered such drivel in a film.

Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars","review":"While declaring that any movie dealing with the Holocaust or the brutality of the camps is bathetic, melodramatic, and ham-fisted might convict one of lacking empathy and so creating a commonality with the arch criminals in this amateurish offering, I will stand by this evaluation. I don't care who you know, what they said it was like--this picture is tripe--good for a film student, perhaps, and even then possessing a cast that is devoid of all credibility with respect to the characters they portray. Insipidity buttressed by heavy themes."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Holocaust was bad?","review":"I went into this movie expecting to see something I hadn't seen. There are alot of cool actors in here, so I was expecting some good characters too. Well, there is nothing in this movie you haven't seen before. There is absolutely NO visual style at all. There is no soundtrack. Every shot is hand held. This would make a good HBO movie, but it's pretty average. Who are we supposed to root for? I don't think we're supposed to root for the Nazis. How can we root for the Jews who are fighting against the other Jews to get \\"special privileges\\"? There is really no character development, I never learned anyones name and it was sort of difficult to figure out what the plot was about. With only 2 powerful scenes at tops, this movie can't dig itself out of the average pit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I found the movie interesting but it won't be a movie a will watch over and over. it told the story of the crematorium worker who planned a rebellion. also it told the story of the girls who worked in the amunition factory and smuggled the explosives. the story about the little girl they found alive after a gassing was a bit strange. especially on the end where the SS shoots her. all in all they subject was well, but i just didn't enjoy the movie as much as i should have."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Grey Zone","review":"Despite rating it a four star, I recommend this book to the aficienados of the WWII era.

It is a great strategy game that is still simple, and it involves lots of counting--I love that it has educational value in addition to the fun. While the box says ages 6+, the basic premise of the beginner version is counting, so as long as a child is comfortable counting to 15 or so, he/she should have little trouble learning to play.

I followed all the way through the end. They may seem old and a bit odd now, but the topics are totatlly relevant to teens anytime. I grew up also in the 90210 area, and as much as i loved that show as well, Degrassi really focused on topics that teens would deal with, popularity, siblings, suicide, etc.A must see for parents and kids!

People were probably not levelling with her - or she wasn't listening.The Laos that I know, and particularly the expats whom she criticises, are not at all the way that I know them.

Before I left I was given her book as something to read while gone.I felt disgusted and angry after reading her narrative of a country I grew to love over three weeks. As other reviewers have stated, her book was so full of unsubstantiated political rantings I had a hard time giving her any credibility as a source. It was almost impossible to enjoy her few cultural encounters and descriptions of the country because of the uneccessary commentary which accompanied it.Having been in Laos, I also noticed that many of the 'brave' and 'independent' things that she did were just plain stupid. Furthermore, although she constantly referred to her own cultural sensitivity and bemoaned the horrendous behavior of other travelers, I have to say that a good number of the things she did were in fact wrong and insensitive to Lao cultural norms."},{"rating":"1","title":"One foot in Laos, one wild imagination elsewhere","review":"The idea that this woman has somehow 'discovered' Laos in 1997 - some 22 years after its fall, is simply ludicrous.

What the US did there was horrible and some Yankees need to wake up to this. But her hatred is pervasive, you can feel it.

Like many highly buy underrated artists, he had taste, style, and substance.He prefered music that sounded good rather than play what people wanted to hear.Every Robert Palmer album I have bought has grown on me with each every track.His unpredictable style of being very comfortable with heavy rock, blues, torch song, as well as R & B seemed as fun for Palmer to sing as was for me to hear.He will be missed. There are few to any American arists like him.It's too bad that his main artistic legacy are his three videos, Addicted to Love, I didn't Mean to turn you on, and Simply Irrestible.

His eighties hard pop posturing is similar in tone to J Geils or ZZ Top, although more generic than either. The big track is \`Simply Irresistible' which isn't. \`Change is Ways' steals it's riff from \`The Lion Sleeps Tonight', but Palmer even flubs this infectious sound.

Eric describes his story telling technique better than I could...\\"Most of what you are about to read are memories, dreams, feelings and even hallucinations, but that's rock'n'roll....My story is true.

I grew up with Superboy and his superdog Krypto. By the way, what ever happened to Krypto? Anyways, the script answers many questions as to what Clark was going through growing up as a teenager in a small town. I can sense his wanting to grow up now, attitude. His frustration over hiding his powers, and his covering his tracks when he had to do something super to save someone. Lex Luthor, I can now see, how he developed his totally dimented personality. He shows us that he is not only bad, but will become totally EVIL (The apple doen't fall far from the tree). This is a great series."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's A Bird! It's A Plane! It's Tom Welling!","review":"Smallville is an excellent rendition of the Man of Steel's humble beginnings. The show is groundbreaking, truly a new genre. F/X notwithstanding, the show's true greatness comes from its character development. Clark, Lana, Pete, Chloe, Lex, and an all-star ensemble, make the show what it truly is . The show does grow campy as the seaason progresses though, what with its kryptonite infused villain-of-the-week growing somewhat tiresome. However the show is truly great, and its cliffhanger season finale leads excellently into the second season, which improves upon the short comings of the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Series Ever...","review":"This Series is the biggest piece of crap I have seen in a long time.

They picked a good bunch of young stars for the roles."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Super Show","review":"Not having access to a WB affiliate I have had to watch the show after its release on video. This is the best treatment of Clark Kent since Lois and Clark - even better than the comic books I loved as a kid.Clark's early years as portrayed in the Superboy comics - besides focusing on Superboy and virtually ignoring Clark - treated him as a mature man in a smaller body. The Clark of Smallville has all of the problems of a teenager: periods of doubt, times when he feels defiant toward his parents, teenaged angst, the initial euphoria when he discovers his X-Ray vision. Clark is a real teenager!The characters are three-dimensional, and the weekly format gives the writers time to let them grow and develop, and for us to have time to get to really know them.Good job, WB!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No 5.1","review":"I am a fan of Superman, always have been.

For a show that I think was broadcast in HighDef, it seems nearly impossible that the DVD looks so unimpressive. Last I checked WB was a recording company... Man, if the show wasn't soooo good I'd return the discs. Video is unsharp, overly high contrast in dark areas, and the sound is like an old stereo DVD mix (Like Highlander if you know what I mean).

This includes the first 21 episodes with some but few special features. This is a great show. So please get this.

Simply put, the Smallville writers got it RIGHT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smallville Starts Light, But Do Not Miss It","review":"Every story has a beginning, and season 1 of Smallville is the lightest season compared to the complex stories and character development that comes in the later seasons. Most episodes in season 1 center around high-school life and trials that most of us can relate to. If you have an affinity for that time of your life, you may enjoy this fun season even more. The acting is well done and you'll easily find yourself working through the episodes wondering what will happen next. I found two episodes in season 1 to be among my all time favorites: Nicodemus and Leech. I think that if you're thinking about skipping over season 1 that you would be making a mistake!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitly a Great, Superb Series","review":"This is one of the best series out in television in today's world. All the actors are absolutely marvolous, especially Kristin Kruek and all of the Kents. The themes are absolutly amazing and down-to-earth. This is a series everyone can identify with in some form or way.Smallville deals with Clark Kent as a teenager for the most part. Yet what makes it unique is that not all of the issues and situations have to deal with just defeating the \\"bad guy\\". There are also intricate emotional plots and etical problems that arise and have to be dealt with. What also makes this an amazing DVD/TV series is the way almost all of the characterss have to learn about themselves and who they are, not just Clark.All in all, one very good buy for families and friends alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy for any tv collection","review":"Smallvile is one of my favorite shows in an age of graphic violence and explicit sex. It has changed an old story, that of a young boy searching for who he is, and put a modern twist on it: he is destined to be Superman. This 1st season DVD set came out right in time for me to view it before the 3rd season premiere. I realize that it isn't a great show, but I also realize that most of the other shows still airing are absolute crap. More shows should try and emulate this style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay!","review":"So what if everyother episode has a corny villian who is scientifically explained by chloe at the end as a mutant or some sort of hormonal deficiency...Flat out truth, great show just to watch for the fun of it, one of those \\"smart-ppl\\" shows on small scale, true there isn't too much of a centralized plot, but little 20 second scenes come back to haunt you 5 episodes later if you took a bathroom break at the wrong time.Overall, fun to watch and simple enough without having to remember the five-generation-long-family-tree/succesor/previous-slayer/hirearchy-of-the-villians/etc...Either way, kristen kreuk's puppy eyes in every episode are funny to watch and jackson's lame attempts to help superman are quite comically effective.Just one major negative.... why is young clark's mom his movie girlfriend?

The best song here is \\"Angel.\\" While other songs aren't as tight, they are done well. She has more range than Ashanti, that's for sure. I was surprised to see some of the negative reviews because the music is actually pretty good. For example, Maryellen Shaw criticizes her speech pathology, but I'm sure she would never have the spine to do the same to an African-American R&B artist because then it would be a clear case racism. As far as Amanda Perez having connections in the industry, almost every field of work is about networking if you want to move up...what planet do you live on. I can only say to people who buy these cd's in this day and age, without previewing some of the tracks on the internet, then the award for the years biggest fool would go to you.

I was completely overwhelmed by the beauty that is showcased in so many of Maury Yeston's pieces. Listening to the CD several times today, I was especially taken by the song \\"Another Day in the Modern World,\\" sung by Michael Holland, \\"My Grandmother's Love Letters,\\" sung by Christine Ebersole and Philip Chaffin's version of \\"My True Love,\\" from \\"Phantom.\\" Yeston's use of such refreshingly lush melodies, moved me tears several times!

Often I wondered is it real? Is it real? IT IS REAL, as there are a number of newspaper reports are also presented in the book to support. When any one thinks about the Indian system, prisons, people or society in general the first thing that comes to mind is, is there a any hope for the country? Most often, the answer in ones mind is a negative to impossible.

Otherwise, the mitts themselves held up well and still looks good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult, but not impossible","review":"I was very excited when I ordered these. My 20-year-old potholders had long since disintegrated, and I had been using two washcloths to remove hot pans from the oven. Each time, I was sure I would end up burning myself and dropping the pan. The mitts arrive, and I could hardly wait to try them on. It never occurred to me that I might not be able to use them. After all, there were no moving parts, no batteries, and they HAD to be better than using two washcloths. Could they be so bad that I would have to return them?... Impossible! Then I put them on. No... That's not quite right. I TRIED to put them on, but I couldn't get my hands into them. They were too small. I would have given them ONE star, but in all honesty, I'm sure that they would function quite well for those with hands smaller than mine. So much for oven mitts being one-size-fits-all (sigh)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value considering price","review":"Good potholders. Quite large and works well for people with big hands/arms.

There was sound so I was stuck with a 40 inch Korean radio.Any repair on an LCD is prohibitively expensive so you better make sure you are getting a workhorse when you buy.The LCD repair business is a really shady affair too. I don't care what anyone says: if you buy online you have zero comeback.

I would highly recommend the Sharp Aquos 1080p series instead - it is 100 times better. If you insist on purchasing a Samsung, buy an extended warranty. This TV started giving me intermittent problems at only 6 months old. The picture kept shutting off. After being in the repair shop for two months, it has returned home and less than 24 hours later - same problem. Samsung replaced the entire main circuit board. It took 2 months for the repair facility just to get warranty approval and the part, and now either the new circuit board is bad or the problem was elsewhere. Buy a Sharp instead - you will be glad you did! And don't forget the extended warranty. Even though I was opposed to them, it pays off with LCD TVs since the cost is about $600 or more to repair (I have been through this twice with two different brands of LCDs)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it..","review":"poor picture quality and bad motion blurring. after 10 days start making noise (huming).SO I had to return this TV after 2 WEEK"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult read...","review":"Not at all an easy book to read.

Some were born there, others passed through and some died there. All of these people and more are the subject of a short story in this book.Other tales are about the communistic Amana Colonies, the artist Grant Wood, a ridiculous hotel war, an even more ridiculous scam of a \\"petrified\\" giant sculpted from Fort Dodge gypsum and the life of the Ringling Brothers. This book is a nice collection of tidbits about the history of the state of Iowa. I am a lifelong resident of the state, so naturally I enjoyed it.

Socially irresponsible garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even worse in English","review":"This is a slick commercial and very mediocre french action film directed by Luc Besson. Filled with cliches from other films, and basically an excuse for some neatly choreographed fight and chase scenes. For me, what little enjoyment there was to be derived from this was ruined by the English dubbing -- a seemingly random hodgepodge of lifelyess English, American, Irish and even, in one case latino-american accents. I watched this on Amazon live video, and would have really appreciated the opportunity to view with subtitles instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"2-dimensional characters fit perfectly in this futuristic environment","review":"-Although I thoroughly enjoyed the stuntwork and chase scenes in this movie, you need to set yourself up fot it mentally. What I mean is that the storyline is there to set the action scenes up versus having the storyline exist to carry the characters forward in their actions. I'm not saying this is a bad thing if it's acknowledged, which the filmmakers have done up front. By doing so, it frees the viewers from having to be attentive to every scene in the movie.I'll keep the review short since most of the other reveiwers have touched on major points already.Bottom line: The film's non-stop energy, via its cinematography and clever editing, keeps everything fun & fresh, and it's a must-see for any Jackie Chan fan out there. Extras I wished for were stunts gone bad instead of 7 takes of a guy not being able to catch a cell phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parkour is awesome","review":"Banlieue 13 was my introduction to parkour and for that, I love it.

If you've never seen Belle in action or even heard of parkour, do yourself a favor and see this film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"This movie is a must, very fast paced movie!

It's called \\"parkour\\". It's a kind of free style jumping over any obstacles such as walls, fences, stones, etc. Yes, they look good but after 30 minutes of seeing the same stuff again and again, it's boring. Jackie Chan's stunts are different and much more engaging.The main problem of this movie is the acting. It's amateurish. For example, when a guy hit another person, I can see it's obviously fake!The plot is typical of this kind of genre.No wonder this DVD did not make much money in North Ameria. It might worth watching once for curiosity."},{"rating":"2","title":"District B13 HD-DVD Review","review":"I just brought it 2 weeks ago, and it's is brand new. I am very satisfied with it.

Good story, sufficient surprises and plot twists. Faced paced action and well edited. The IMDB.com reviews say it all.The star actors are athletes displaying their abilities in the newest sport called, Parkour. It is a type of hybrid form of running and jumping in urban settings, inspired by the martial arts. All stunts were performed by the principal actors, themselves.The English dub track is intended for a British audience, but that is not too distracting. Cool music soundtrack that adds to the suspense.I bought this because I could not rent it. Glad I bought it. Worth the $30 or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crank and Snatch","review":"If you enjoy movies like \\"Crank\\", \\"Snatch\\", and \\"Transporter\\" you will definitely want to catch this one. The choreography of the fights is phenomenal. This movie at first came across very much as a foreign film and I was on the verge of turning it off since it started a little slow. I am glad I hung in a little longer because the pace picked up in a hurry and the story, acting, and action were great. The dubbing is off just a little, but not bad. This is more gang war than SciFi, but it will entertain most action fans. I recommend it and I think it has replayability since it has a different feel and look. Definitely rent it, but I think you will want to buy it, if just for the fight scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"politically correct mainstream for mentally challenged.","review":"Yes, I bought this politically correct mainstream movie for mentally challenged.

At first I was skeptical considering this movie is in French and has no one in it who I'd ever heard of, but one of my friends told me it was a great movie so I gave it a shot. Boy, am I glad I did. This movie is non-stop action and has the best fight choreography I have ever seen. Ever. The plot is good (for an action movie) and the acting isn't bad. If you liked The Transporter because of the great action, then you'll love this movie. The two lead actors are both stuntmen and do all their own stunts brilliantly. This movie features a lot of parkour, or free running, and it's a joy to watch. I watched the movie with English dubbing and I have to say I was impressed with the quality. If you're a true fan of action movies you owe it to yourself to see this one in beautiful HD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly enjoyable, if not terribly memorable","review":"This film has very good dialogue and nice pacing, as well as an imaginative setting. Strictly one for the popcorn crowd, but enjoyable nonetheless. Rent rather than own, unless you're a collector like me.

Given that, when I discovered this I wasn't expecting much, just another mediocre futuristic French actioner. However, I'm glad my expectations were exceeded because this was probably one of the most exciting action films I've seen in the past few years, with some mind-blowing acrobatic stunts and fight sets. The opening chase scene alone is worth the price of admission. The story about a nuke gone missing is fairly standard, but has some nice social relevance in this case and the story involves intertwining the two nimble main protagonists in a fairly believable joint effort. Bottom line: this is a damn cool movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie. Not much else on the disc.","review":"I love this movie. Best action scenes ever caught on film.

In all, more than 90 objects, processes and technologies are described.The explanations are all essentially superficial and profusely illustrated. It's enough to get a young person interested and perhaps move them along to considering learning more about technology.Jerry"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear Explainations","review":"I really enjoy how this book explains things through a combination of words, pictures, and diagrams.

I believed the Colby/Rafael relationship and bought into both their points of view. Thought this one was better written (or maybe just better edited) than most. And the boys from Brazil had an interesting back story that added depth to the Carpathian universe and made me want to read more about them. Okay, Feehan's no Jane Austen but for me she consistently delivers fun, romantic stories that are well worth devoting a few hours to. I'll keep reading as long as she keeps writing 'em."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first and probably last Christine Feehan book.","review":"I was excited to read her books, but not anymore. Way too much stressing and angst by the heroine. I didn't enjoy the story or pace of the book because I did not like the Colby charater. She just grated on my last nerve - I would have just left her alone if I was Rafael, and he was no prince either! I just skimmed to find out what happened at the end. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"DARK SECRET","review":"Ms. Feehan has dropped the ball on this one. I have read all of her books and this one was a total disappointment. Rafael may have loved Colby but I could not tell. The impression I got was that he was God and what he said was law. I did not like the way Colby was treated by Rafael. Her conversion took forever and when it happened Rafael did not seem to understand what was going on. It seemed strange that when a Carpathian is hurt that everyone comes together to help. However, the Carpathian men or either to proud or stupit to ask about the experiences other Carpathian men have had with their lifemates. Rafael may have had his feeling returned to him but he did not know how to share OR CARE about Colby feelings. The next book cannot be worse than this one I hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"i totally agree with L. J. Russell \\"fangirl\\" SORRY!","review":"I love paranormal romance. its mainly what i read. i have read all of feehans work and honestly this one got lost in translation. Lately ive been noticeing the climax in feehans stories have been short lived and leaves you with 100 more pages of muddled \\"same stuff\\" garbage. If you take a look at her recent carpathian novels, you notice the same wording, and plots. Honestly its dishearting because i love her books. maybe she should just stop while she is ahead?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent adventure and Love story","review":"I just could not leave the book alone for long because once I get going in reading and if I happend to stop any where it getting good.

I may get a copy to keep to reread again when I have more time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rafael: Alpha Carpathian, Not Human","review":"Hey, Colby isn't Anita Blake...& Rafael isn't human. Colby is a hybrid, which makes her \\"different\\" than most humans. She has the racial memories that cause her to want the Carpathian quilt, the psychic abilities that her human half-siblings don't share. Carpathian mating rituals are obviously more animalistic than human, and the author wants to convey this to the reader. Rafael is the alpha male to Colby's alpha female role. The female Carpathian, which Colby becomes after her conversion, is the sole recipient of her lifemate's sexual advances. If ever a final Carpathian novel is written, the \\"Prince\\" will be replaced with a \\"Queen.\\" Probably Desari, but Colby will be her right-hand gal. & the males? Well, they can still hunt the vampire, but we all know their real role is to amuse the gals at night!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A mixed bag","review":"It must be hard to come up with fresh ideas for plots and interesting characters for a series we have all grown to love. However, Dark Secret misses the mark. It was like getting mixed messages... is the hero worth loving? Is the heroine not quite human?The best in the Dark series were those that dealt with growing as a person/Carpathian. My favorite was Dark Desire (Jacques and Shea) in a truly moving story of sacrifice and devotion. Bringing in characters from previous books was like meeting old friends. Dark Fire was another good one with a spunky heroine and a Carpathian male who didn't know quite how to handle her.I would hate to see the Carparthian stories end, but surely plots could revolve around more true-to-life lives. I'd like to see a book without an evil vampire lurking. Real life is scary enough.Having said all the above, I hope the Dark series continue, if only to touch base with Jacques, Gregori, Darius, Lucien, and all the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long","review":"Maybe I missed something, but this is the worst book in the whole series as far as I'm concerned and if any of the others focuses on Nicholas, I'm thinking the heroine needs more of a sense of humor and self than Colby.This book went on and on and on, just using mundane filler. The male was abusive, Colby was a dunce. The battle scene was weak although after the scene finally almost made up for having to waddle through this."},{"rating":"1","title":"RAPE IS NOT SEXY!","review":"Feehan has been skirting the line between hot dominance games and rape for years with her Carpathian series, and in this book, she just wipes that line out completely. Disgusting. I've been loyal to this series since the first book (in spite of the same storyline and characters being recycled over and over again with slightly different details), but I'm finished after this.There is a rush of great new vamp writers out there (Sherrilyn Kenyon, for example). Try any one of them before reading this bodice ripper trash. It's embarassing to the paranormal genre and a sad statement about our culture that rape is considered an acceptable form of 'romantic' expression."},{"rating":"1","title":"This could've been a good book...","review":"This could have been a good book but the main characters ruined it. I like a strong heroine as much as the next gal but Colby was just annoying. I found myself rolling my eyes every time she couldn't understand or was afraid of pretty much everything. I don't think I've ever read a story with a more dense or stubborn female character. Things have to go her way or she has a b***h fit unwilling to see reason or common sense. Raphael was just very one dimensional and more of a caveman then 18th century hunter/warrior.The story dragged on forever it could easily have been half the length. The sex scenes were too long and too frequent. I liked the idea of the story but I couldn't get past my dislike for the main characters. I had never read a Feehan book before and unfortunately this one hasn't made me want to take a chance on another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragged On","review":"This story recycled the same theme over and over and over. Female: You can't have me. Male: Yes I can. This one was torturous to get through and I usually burn through her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"This is a great story. Colby is a tough cookie who is not going down without a fight. She tries not to like Rafael, but she is fighting a losing cause. She will do anything to protect her family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark's females need more power","review":"I love Mrs. Feehans books, and I somewhat enjoyed this one. The problem I have is the heroine's lack of strength. It was really hard to connect with this one. She was so supposed to be this strong cowgirl but just came across to me as emotionally whiny and weak. I also felt that the hero crossed the line several times and got by with it, oh sure he was sorry but he didn't suffer any real repercussions. I love a strong alpha male but it seems that the females in this series just have no power of thier own and are on very unequal footing. It would be nice to see a Carpatian get a real run for his money, to see the heroine put up more of a fight. Having said that, it was still worth a read. The book is well developed, the descriptions vivid and even though I didn't enjoy the charactes in this one as much, I found a lot to be likeable in the supporting characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste your Money !!!!","review":"Wow, very disappointed to say the least. Who wants to fall in love with someone who rapes them? Had a hard time finishing this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely the worst ever","review":"I usually can't put down a Feehan, despite the overused metaphors...one more brush of butterfly wings, or molten lava reference and I'll send her a thesarus). This on I can't pick up...how much of an arrogant jerk is this guy, expecting her to giv up her home and family for his, ordering a 12 year out of bed to make vegetable soup for his unwilling lifemate.....Throw this bum to the sunlight, and let Colby live with her brother and sister."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Few Comments...","review":"\\"No\\" still means \\"no\\" regardless-hero was too dominating and heroine was too dumb. The storyline just drags on and on and rushes through conclusion at the end. She even gave the vampire more power than the hero. Apparently Ms. Feehan has decided to change this series to horror instead of romance. I'm disappointed too and hope the author will go back and read Dark Magic in order to get this series back on track."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY disappointing!!!","review":"I will admit that this is my first \\"Dark\\" read. I love the \\"Drake Sisters\\" books and thought to give this one a try. I have to admit I was really disappointed (and kind of disgusted). I understood the need to bond (that the Carpathian males have) but there was no real love between the two characters; only lust. Even that was kind of.. well, sick. He bands her to him against her will, not thinking of her but of himself completely disregards her no's, then tells her that he loves her. She fights him throughout the entire book (even going so far as to call him a rapist the first time they are together), then when he is dying decides \\"oh, wait! He can't die, I love him!\\" Don't get me wrong the \\"love\\" scenes are VERY hot, but that is all it is. You feel her love and determination for her siblings, but for him all there is is obsessive lust. I'm not going to give up on the series, I just hope that the others are better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was not as good as Christine Feehans others. The plot was very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"thoroughly enjoyed","review":"Yet another book in the dark series that I couldn't put down. The author makes these characters come to life. I hope the series doesn't come to an end. I could read dark series for a liftime. Kudos to Christine Feehan for her vivid imagination and sharing it with her readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her worst","review":"This wasn't the worst of the series, but it wasn't the best either. The heroine was annoying and the first half of the book was very repetitive. I found myself skimming through some of her exchanges with Rafael, blah, blah, blah, same old discussion in a bunch of different ways. The second half of the book was much better in that we got to some action with the vampire hunting. That part of the book was like the old Feehan. Ms. Feehan's use of one word in a foreign language over and over takes away from the book also. How many times can you use the word familia? And if you are going to use a foreign language, why just use a couple of words? I found it to be just as annoying in Lair of the Lion with the Italian words she used over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Fantastic Dark Book","review":"Rafael and Colby were very strong characters although somewhat more violent and strong-minded than usual (but with good reason!). Colby's dislike of Raphael went for a long time. I wished she had admitted things to herself a bit earlier. It made for terrible/great tension, though. While I'd prefer the Dark books with a touch less sex/anger in them, these are all keepers and worth rereading. Christine Feehan's vampires are the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rape and compulsion not love...","review":"I have read every Christine Feehan book. I am not sure I will ever read another after this book. It was offensive.Rafael threatens her if she doesn't become his lifemate. He uses \\"compulsion\\" to force her to have sex with him, and he is no better than an animal, and a monster. I wanted to write a letter and complain to the publisher about this novel. Rafael's characater may have loved her, but should a woman return those affections just because he loves her so much? No. What about stalkers? Should women fall in love with stalkers for the same reasons? The stalker thinks he loves her? No. This was not a romance novel. This was sick. It was filled with threats, forced sexual encounters, violence and hatred. The mysterious thread at the end did nothing to make up for the rest.Christine Feehan has created a fascinating world. Too bad she ruins it. Horrid book, horrid romance genre novel especially. This should have been a horror novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Rafael a Carpathian?","review":"I'm a little confused by the name Rafael De La Cruz. Isn't he Carpathian? Why does he have a Spanish name? As for the story itself, I was very disappointed by the hero who was overbearing and arrogant. I was unable to finish the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"MS.Feehan is at the top of her game !.","review":"Where should i start?,this is not just another in a long line of sameness. this book stands out all on it's own.the plot is just great!. the hero is strong and sexy,the herione is just sassy.the fight scenes!,the love scenes!!!oh la la!.to say that i just loved this book would be an understatement. i highly recommend this read. i await on tenderhooks ( and with much nail bitting )MS.Feehan's next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time reader","review":"This is actually the first one of this series I have read. Needless to say, I have ordered the rest that are available on Amazon. I was getting a little bored with the other writers I normally read. A friend recommended these books and let me borrow this one.I keep asking myself, \\"Dear Lord, Why can't these Carpathians really exist?!\\". If the others are even close, I will not be disappointed in the least. Thank you, Christine!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good entry (better than last 2)","review":"I almost stopped reading the Carpathian series due to the annoying last two books. The last decent entry was Dark Symphony. I barely got through Dark Guardian and Dark Legend. This book is interesting, the sex is hot and the family dynamics intriguing. The main problem is the refusal of Colby (heroine) to admit that there is a problem and of Rafael (hero) is entirely too dominant. I love dominant men (in print), but he's almost abusive. He takes away ALL choices and then claims it's because he loves her. Real love doesn't deny choices. The entry of a new story line of vampire enemies is also incredibly annoying. Every other entry insists that vampires can't work together, now they're planning a grand conspiracy? Please! I think that this book would have been better if he had just taken the family back to the Rain Forest in the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer Clear of the Canon Brand Filters - No Coatings!","review":"Chances are 99% that you have a decent lens with lots of anti-reflective coatings on it (even if you don't know it). All of the good quality filters also have these coatings. I was shocked to find that the Canon brand filters do not have any coatings. I was using this with my EF-S 17-85mm IS, and was getting reflections (green or hazy brown spots), vignetting, and also a noticeable reduction in light transmission and sharpness. Do a test - take 2 identical pictures with and without the filter - you'll see it.

This macro lens has a deep lens hood, which in and of itself blocks most unwanted light, so the need for a multi-coated filter wasn't great as it is for some of my other lenses.The filter is available at a great price, and it works as expected.

Despite her professed lack of education, Abigail's letters were erudite, eloquent and got right to the point in an era where legalese and dense language were the norm. Her understanding and interest in politics was nothing short of astounding (at times I think she had a keener understanding of the issues than her husband did).Ms. Levin's painstaking research is apparent in every page of this meticulously crafted volume, and she should be very proud of her accomplishment in bringing someone who left us almost 200 years ago to vivid, blooming life.This is an excellent companion to David McCullough's \\"John Adams,\\" and should be required reading for anyone, especially any woman, who is interested in American history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did they CUT the movie?","review":"I got this movie because it was special to me and my Father you see we are both pilots and it was a movie we used to watch many time together till my father pass away a few years ago when I saw it on DVD I had to have it.Boy I sure was upset to see how much they cut the movie it is a sad because they cut some of the best parts. this movie holds a special place in my hart and I guess i need to buy the Tape now.

Some further research shows that, unfortunately, there isn't a complete cut out there. This film was released in different versions for different countries. That said, this cut seems to skip plot points, and it also seems to be the shortest all together. This DVD features an 86 minute cut. IMDB lists the original US cut as 105 minutes long, whereas the Italian cut featured 120 minutes. This is a fun movie, but the missing parts are obvious.Also note the image format is actually in the correct 2.35:1 ratio, but it's not 16:9 enhanced, so the image shows up as a smaller box on HD televisions."},{"rating":"1","title":"!!!!!!!Better to buy an empty home & fill it yourself and possibly a bigger one!!!!!!!","review":"This home is great!

Their many examples of couple issues from real couples resonated with me. Their descriptions of the perspectives of each member of the couple was especially insightful because their descriptions/discussions usually nailed it with respect to how I myself have felt in similar situations (and explained the feelings better and more powerfully than I am usually able to do) and also really helped me see and understand the perspective of the other person.

It starts out depressing as the main characters whine and wail their way through Commonwealth England. When so many deaths occur at the outset of a book, you're probably going to wonder what's romantic about it. Well, nothing. Autumn Leslie is either devoid of personality, or she's prancing around sleeping with the kings of France and England. She never seems to be having fun, either. Jasmine Leslie seems to have tried so hard to be her grandmother that she has no personality of her own. Ugh. I'm glad I got this from the library instead of buying it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete and absolute waste of money","review":"I bought this book expecting a good and entertaining read as I got from most of Bertrice Small's previous books (and I've read them all). I was terribly dissapointed in the characters, no depth or real personality at all. Someone else mentioned they couldn't imagine Skye prostuting herself for an English title and I couldn't agree more. I've given this book two stars and those stars go to the character of Skye, whose ghost chased the English nobility who were living in her home out. It's pretty bad when a ghost is the most interesting character in a book like this.I won't be rushing out to buy future Bertice Small books and paying $18-$20 (CDN), I'll just wait until they make it to the library where if the book was terrible, at least I got my money's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Boring","review":"I've always enjoyed the majority of Bertrice Small's books and in fact have read every one of them. But this one was rather boring. The heroine, Autumn, never went anywhere exciting or got involved in anything dangerous. She never went to harems or did anything outlandish.

The book is so cluttered with random facts and famous people that everything becomes muddled. The beginning of the book has a list of random famous people that lived in New York from the 1880's-1920's. Some chapters read like a six degrees of Kevin Bacon game, except with Rothstein as the degree of separation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The World Series","review":"This is about wide-spread corruption in every facet of early 20th century NY City, and only peripherally about the 1919 World Series. Too many details about wretched people with awful nicknames. Too hard to follow, jumps all over the map chronologically, paints shallow pictures of people, and is far too long. NOT RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"2","title":"Portrait Of An Evil Genius","review":"David Pietrusza's bio of infamous gangster Arnold Rothstein is a wonderful read. Lots of vignettes involving rip-offs, double-crosses, fixed horse races and rigged trials as well as the hilarious exploits of Rothstein's crooked, shamelessly audacious lawyer William Fallon.Audacious is also the word that comes to mind when wondering how anyone could even think of fixing the World Series, let alone manage to pull it off. However, as the author notes, some of the White Sox players had been throwing games during the regular season that year so getting them to recruit a few more more players for a postseason fix was not that much of a stretch.Pietruzsa is on shaky ground though when wondering whether the first Jack Dempsey-Gene Tunney fight was thrown. On page 235 he claims Dempsey was poisoned by his bodyguard before the bout but provides no reference for this story. It appears to be a baseless rumor first mentioned in the pages of Roger Kahn's A Flame of Pure Fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must have been in a hurry","review":"There are a ton of facts and figures and alot of supposition in this book. That stuff is then just loaded in a shotgun and shot into a book. Really bad. Given the same amount of research and material, a better writer could organize this material and edit about a quarter of it out and make something enjoyable. This is a jumbled up mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"The author must have had all his relatives give him high ratings. This book is a rambling, unreadable, barely coherent mess. It is impressive on one level - he managed to make the story of a gangster totally boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappointed...","review":"This was released Sept 2006, so I was hoping for some new info all the way up to the present. Not sure, but I think this may be a reissue of a previous DVD - and even though the cover says \\"An Authorized Biography\\", IT'S NOT. The back cover states it's unauthorized, and the first thing on the screen when you put the disc in is verification that this is not authorized by Nickelback. Nothing on there about All the Right Reasons or their current tour, it ends about the time that The Long road was released. I wouldn't recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fond Memories & Tears","review":"What a wonderful story about our best friends. It brought back fond memories and tears of our first Golden Retriever, Riley. He was adopted but developed a severe medical problem. Riley poured out his heart with love. I would recommend this book to anyone who owns a dog, owned a dog, wants to own a dog, or is wondering what it would be like to own a dog. You will fall in love with Kilroy and his friend Riley. It is a touching story of friendship and bonding and the service Guide Dogs provide to those in need. Definitely Five Stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"surprised how effective this is","review":"I have a generalized anxiety disorder which makes it easy to get into panic.... and have tried many different remedies that didn't quite do the job of making me feel calmer. Anxiety Relief really works quickly. It usually gets me to a place where I can feel lessjittery and usually within 30 minutes, which by that time, my breathing has calmed down and I'm usually feeling more relaxed.....and if not, I just take another pill. But it always seems to work for me...I'll also take a pill if I anticipate an anxious situation...dental appointments, phone calls that require assertiveness....anything where I think I might feel stressed.... For a very small investment, it's certainly worth trying this remedy for those who aren't getting relief from other similar products. I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmm","review":"Taste like sugar and I suspect its just a placebo but maybe it will help trick my mind to think it really works. The pic shows 250 pills but I only got 120 (not that it works anyways but yeah) The pills take me about 10 minutes to disolve under my tounge but I will continue to take till I run out. I suffer from anxiety that makes it hard to drive and go to stores and what not and I will keep looking for an over the counter helper."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product does NOT work!","review":"I bought this product thinking that it would help me with my anxiety attacks and problems so I decided to give it a try bein that I can't see a doctor about it because I don't have any insurance at this moment and I must say it just was a waste it does not work at ALL!! And I just think it made me feel worst rather than better....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anxiety Relief tablets","review":"I purchased these tablets for my 96 yr old mother who now suffers from anxiety. The product works and has helped her. Her only complaint is that the tablet doesn't dissolve rapidly under her tongue. When I purchased the tablets, I really didn't expect them to work, and I was surprised by the outcome. I definitely recommend this product to anyone suffering from anxiety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Not His Best","review":"I love Thomas Dolby. I consider him a genius. I have all of his albums. But this album, frankly, is a major disappointment. It is his worst. Although there are a couple of good songs on it, and although us die-hard fans will certainly want it, I cannot recommend it to anyone else. It seems as though, on this album, he was pandering to an audience that was unable to appreciate his earlier brilliant work, a bit of a musical sell-out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best overall view","review":"Esdaile's book is simply the best overall description of thePeninsular War. He realizes that war and battles do not exist in a vacuum from politics as well as the reverse, that war involves fighting. He thus spends much time on the intricacies of Cadiz government to show the limitations of the Spanish forces. His theses on the regular army and the guerillas are expanded from his early works as is the realtion of Wellington to the Spaniards. The Duke is not mythologised, but he is shown to be the outstanding personality of the war. Although his descriptions of battles are limited in scope and scale (see D. Gates \\"The Spanish Ulcer\\" for a better strictly military history), Esdaile places the war within the structure of the other conflicts at the time. This book is the definitive description of the entire war."},{"rating":"2","title":"A highly critical history of the Peninsular War","review":"Esdaile criticizes the mythological role of the partisans in the Peninsular War and the contention tht these irregular fighters had popular support. Esdaile believes the partisans were nothing more than draft dogers and bandits, who hindered rather than helped the Spanish cause. According to Esdaile the use of these guerrillas hampered the Spanish war effort because they took away valuable men from the army and committed numerous crimes against the civilian population. Esdaile states in this book that the guerrillas were motivated by personal profit and not by any sense of nationalism. In the concluding chapters of the book, Esdaile believes it was Napoleon blunders by asking his subordinates to launch offensives in eastern Spain which led to the western part of the country vulnerable to Welligton's offenisves that ultimately ended the war. I would reccomend this book to anyone who wants a new view of the Peninsular War."},{"rating":"2","title":"product is ok but nothing mirror","review":"Product is ok but they are perfectly clear, no mirror or I/O shading.

It's true what one reviewer wrote - the color is not what is pictured online, but I bought it in a Walmart hair salon because of the color. It's more of a deep mauve color, beautiful shine, even with one coat. And perfect for my medium brown skintone. Now if I could just find a lip color like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"French Manicure","review":"I discovered this polish Easter 2006.

Nice heavy duty material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk. Don't bother.","review":"I only got to use this one or two times before it jammed for good. The plastic gears are a mistake -- look for one with metal gears, even if you have to pay more. Like the other reviewer, I only use an egg beater occasionally, so I didn't want to make a huge investment. The one I had before was the one my mother used for 40+ years. Alas, it finally rusted beyond repair so I had to find another. This wasn't it. I'll keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"one was broken and not in new packaging","review":"One was broken and was not in new packaging as noted.

The space to do so is too small to use an implement, and each time (being more careful than the previous time) I have sliced up my fingers quite well and deep. That makes it chintzy and dangerous in my book. I have to give it a star to get this review uploaded, otherwise......the makers (or Amazon) should pay for all the band-aids I've used. Finally just threw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ensemble drama...","review":"Just watched this first season, and it's really good. Each of the wives comes into their own, as the series progresses, and Bill Paxton's character is hilarious and real, and Paxton portrays him well. Obviously, there's a lot of good television out there, but if you've been interested in this concept, it's definitely worth the time to check out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aimed at the rental market.","review":"I love this series, and was looking forward to having it on DVD, but two things will keep me from buying this set: First, the price is just too high. List price is $100 for 12 hours? Consider that sets like West Wing have 22 hours at a much lower price. Second, disk 1 starts with one of those self-promoting HBO montages that CAN'T be skipped past and has to be endured each time you put disk 1 in the player.Clearly this set is being aimed at the rental market. I will wait and hope for a set that is packaged more for consumers."},{"rating":"1","title":"VAPID","review":"This is tiresome, and certainly not funny. It was disturbing to see all the positive reviews- is this really what people enjoy filling their minds and time with ? Cereal, grocery shopping, predictable family fueds, and a guy bed hopping in his own \\"three homes\\" (Oh I doubt they are really all that randy) I found it a bit sickening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Soap Opera","review":"This is just as idiotic as any typical idiotic Soap. The only difference is that the polygamy is acceptable (in their religious beliefs) while among other religions it's not, but in most Soaps it just goes on anyway.

True the Mormon Church is very dominant in the state of Utah ( but are not all weird freaks like this show wants you to think), however Salt Lake Valley is less than 40% Mormon, that's right the majority of the valley is not even Mormon, oh and on top of that, I am yet to meet even 1 fundamentalist Moromom ( Or any one who has more than one wife). As far as I know, most of Fundamentalist Mormons do not even live in Utah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downloaded video was horrible","review":"The downloaded video from Amazon Unbox was terrible. It looked like the aspect ratio was all wrong, and the bottom of the picture was cut off, regardless of the window size or aspect ratio. There appeared to be no application setting that would allow me to adjust. Screen is 1200x800, and NetFlix looks great, as does video from other sites.This is the last time that I use Amazon for material that I can get from NetFlix or other sources. Sorry Amazon.I also dislike that that so-called video credit that you gave me didn't apply to this episode. Feels like bait and switch if the whole catalog is not available."},{"rating":"2","title":"A completely absorbing series","review":"I love this series. I bought the first season for my daughter who, I hope, will find time in her busy life, with job, children, etc. to watch it. She usually reads novels in her spare time, but I told her to find time to watch this DVD. I cannot imagine she will not love it as much as I do. The episodes are each so interesting and absorbing, whether it has to do with the relationship among the three wives, or with Bill's dealings with his malevolent father-in-law, as well as all the other difficult characters and situations that enter his life.And my husband enjoys this series as much as I do. So, I recommend it for both sexes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You may not agree with the lifestyle, but the charachters are soooo interesting!","review":"I am hooked, and although I have reservations about this lifestyle portrayed, I love the charachters from this series.

This show is totally absorbing. The writing and acting are top notch, and I watch episodes more than once because there is so much subtlety that escapes you the first time around.This is drama at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked!","review":"A man with three wives, seven children, and his own Home Depot-like store?

First, they shipped in a day even though it was estimated 2-day shipping. I was very pleased. When I tried on the shoes I was so excited. They are so comfortable and for someone like me who has wide feet, these are the first shoes I found that actually fit well. I have never owned a pair of \\"wide\\" tennis shoes, and am going to probably order another pair just to have a back-up. They are stylish as this retro sort of look is coming back. I can finally order shoes in my actual size, a 6 instead of a 7 or 7 1/2 just to get my foot to fit in them. I actually was able to stand up straight in these shoes as the arch support actually hit my foot on my arch. I highly recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THEM AND WANT MORE","review":"This is my first pair of running shoes that I have ever purchased on line.

It is well researched and showcases many smaller companies that produced dolls as beautiful, and desirable, as the larger ,better known manufacturers. The addition of actual advertisements from trade magazines, touting 'uniqueness' and sales potential for particular dolls, is both interesting and education to the serious collector as well as the novice.

What we do have here is a collection of 10 songs, well constructed and nicely sung. I would call this a folk album. Instrumentally, there are drums, electric and acoustic guitars, piano, bass, mandolin, dobro/steel guitars, fiddle and percussion. Don composed five of the ten songs.

It is so nice to have a covered cake stand again. This one is heavy and large, and will accommodate a nice sized cake.

This is a heavy cake stand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but wobbles","review":"I rarely need a cake plate, so the price of this one was attractive. Unfortunately, the plate surface on mine is not totally flat. As a result, the dome wobbles slightly. This gets very annoying when it is sitting on a table that inevitably gets jostled while people are eating. Also, when the pedestal is inverted for use as a punch bowl, the unevenness of the plate surface (now the base of punch bowl) causes the whole bowl to wobble slightly. It's functional enough that I won't bother replacing it, but I probably would not buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice cake plate","review":"I recieved this cake plate a couple weeks ago. it's very heavy and well made. it came boxed extra well.

The only thing I noticed (that makes these seconds) is that there is a small black dot of something...dirt/thred... right in the middle of the plate. It's in the glass and can't be removed.

I tried to read this book but never got past the third chapter! If I could, I would change many things about this book. First of all, lets get a little more action in here! I wish Kathleen Duey would start the action a little closer to the beginning of this book. It's a pain just trying to get to the good part! Also, if she really has to start the action so close to the end of the book, can't she make the beginning of this book a little more interesting? The rest of the American Diaries books are much better than this one. At least the beginning of all the other ones are interesting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Publish or perish","review":"Which is the presumed motive for this extended revisitation of an extensively analyzed subject. This book is bizarrely organized which somewhat masks the fact that it has almost nothing new to say. Odd comments aside (\\"...the casual amorality of Chandlerian violence\\"?!?), the text is little more than a series of introductory remarks with thumbnail bios of hardboiled writers and auteurist asides that cobble together plot summaries and allusions to the writings of other critics. Chapter 4 starts off with promise but fizzles. The extended closing comments on the French New Wave, the epilog, and the needlessly repeated selected credits are pure filler."},{"rating":"2","title":"An encyclopedic review of film noir.","review":"Andrew Dickos has written a very useful history and analysis of film noir, from its predecessors in Europe to its fulfillment as an art form in America.

They insist that it will cost $34.95 per incident of software support.

After complaining, they finally figured they had the wrong record.Once I got suppport, it was absolutely terrible! The automatic network indicator feature was not working properly. They had me hard reboot to connect. In addition, they suggested I do this every time I go to new hot spot. Hard reboot, erases all data and resets the iPAQ.

The screen is small at slightly under 3.5\\" diagonal, and it's NOT readable outdoors, even on an overcast day. The qvga resolution is just not enough. Get this: you don't even get a cover after paying all this money. Battery life is miserable to say the least.

The first time, I grudgingly paid the $175 fee to replace it and figured I must have done something wrong. Two months later, it cracks again. This time I am positive there was no extreme pressure, it was never dropped.It is simply poorly designed and extremely fragile.I will say that the way I use my PDA's has not changed in a decade. This is the only one (Palm Pilot, etc) that cannot take simple every day wear and tear.HP, if this your idea of product quality and design, you should be ashamed of yourself.

HP says I damaged it with too much pressure, or maybe I put it under extreme temperatures (>105 degrees). I told \\"Kim\\" at HP none of these things happened to my unit! I have read elsewhere there is such a thing as an \\"internal pressure crack\\". Grr! I don't mind so much that the unit was defective...I just hate when companies won't stand behind their products. They are sending my unit back today, unrepaired, because I won't let them make a single dollar more of profit on me. They snookered me on the warranty already.

Use an aluminium hard case and never take it out of it.2. Internet browsing sucks, I installed pcAnywhere software and I connect directly to my pc at home, I use the pocket pc as a remote screen of my home pc, so I have all the power of a desktop pc in this little unit.3.

This game needs the interaction with the others players to make it hard and much more fun with out it it is not fun. I was mad and tried to get the activision people, yet they will not tell me why I paided $20.00 for a game that said it had lobby racing, then does not have it. So no customer help is near.

Not many have preached or written about this crucial-to-know topic from the Bible. Howard's thesis is that we're saved by grace, but judged by what we did with that grace here on earth. He backs up his views thoroughly from a plethora of scriptural references. No Christian can read this book and not be challenged to live a more responsible life for Christ. Every reader will want to evaluate their choices made here on earth in light of the account they will be required to give at the judgment seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revelatory! A Must-Have!","review":"Highest praise for Katie Mitchell's extraordinary cinematic version of this difficult opera.

Conductor Richard Hickox leads a revelatory performance with a cast that's sung and acted admirably. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TOUGH NUT TO CRACK","review":"Dramatizing a quintessentially literary ghost story for film is not easy, in fact, it is pretty well doomed to partial failure for those who have grown up with the Henry James masterpiece in print and in several movies that have based themselves upon it.This is quite successful in showing Brittan's music to good effect. I found it interesting, entertaining, well-sung well-acted, well-directed; however, I found it much too prosaic and realistic to evoke the air of mystery, of the unknown and unknowable, that an effective ghost story should possess.I have not seen any of the other versions available on DVD, but would guess that the average viewer cannot go wrong watching this if his objective is seeing Benjamin Brittan's opera rather than Henry Jame'sstory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice","review":"I wasn't expecting a lot from these because they were so reasonably priced, but when I received them I was pleasantly surprised.

This book is for people who want someone to THINK they are in love with them by pretending to be something they are not, then deepening the effect through pain and suffering. the book is divided into two parts. The first tells you the best way lie about yourself to other people, making them believe you are better than you actually are. The second tells you how to \\"choose the right victim\\", manipulate them through mixed signals, then make them believe they are not good enough for you by treating them badly.I believe seduction can be both good and bad, in my opinion this book highlights nothing but the bad. if you are a wife beater, (or husband beater) wanting to make someone your puppet, then this book is for you. if you are interested in finding love that makes both parties involved feel good, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tool for Evil & A Defense Against Evil","review":"I see pure evil in this mans books.

Ever since reading this piece of absolute literary genius I have been able to really asses who I am and what exactly it is that I want out of life, and how far I'm willing to go to get it.The only thing that scares me is this book falling into the wrong hands.

(The other is John Fate's The Nice Guys' Guide to Getting Girls.) I never knew much about seduction before reading this book. Im kinda shy so seducing people is somewhat hard and challenging for me. But this book is really good. It talks about 9 different types of seducers and gives examples for each one, which was really helpful. These books are recommended to anyone who has no idea about the art of seduction, or even if you know a lot about it. They're great books that have a lot of good info. Greene & Fate know what they're talking about!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"Beautiful book, very well put together. It was a little disturbing, the similarity to a bible or a bible companion book. (All the footnotes in the margins and whatnot.) Does the author worship the art of seduction?

Huh.Seduction, but not speed seduction, a take your time if it's called-for seduction.Well-researched with loads of historical data about well known rakes and courtesans. Casanova, Erroll Flynn, La Belle Ortega, etc.Introduces us to the types of victims vulnerable to seduction, types of seducers, moves on to methods, and even how to disengage the victim, \\"sacrificing\\" them, instead of stringing them on, or hurting them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yard work = more stimulating than this read","review":"I love books.

I didn't learn anything from this book besides the useless insights and theories, like I really care!Frankly, this book is way overrated. For an almost 500 pages book, it could have been compressed into a 100 page practical book.

Some find it offensive because it does include manipulation of others, but as the title says, its the art of seduction. Its not about getting *warm fuzzies*. The book uses multiple examples of historical figures that have used the techniques discussed in this book. I highly recommend this book, it is logical, informative, and to-the-point."},{"rating":"2","title":"masterpiece!","review":"Believe what you will, but seduction is a traumatic artform. It is in every way the same as war! You must be crafty, charismatic, and patient. Above all, you have to recognize the certain aspects of a person's character and be able to apply the laws taught in this book. Critics may not like the way the author uses the \\"war-like\\" metaphors, but it is all true. \\"All is fair in love and war\\" applies also to seduction.This book is a great read and is also very true. Anyone who reads it WILL recognize some of the tactics in this book. You may have been seduced by someone using them, or have used them yourself. Either way, the book breaks down why they are so successfull and shows not only why they work, but also any reversal's that can be used against you. Read it with an open mind and see for yourself how the basic psychology of seduction can be used in everyday life. GET THE BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, relatively insightful","review":"This book contains historical and fictional examples of seduction - and gives some insight into how human beings dominate the minds of others, from a personal to a political scale. It is worth reading for the examples which prove interesting, but don't listen to any crap reviews which are people trying to flog you the book - there is nothing revelationary here, but still very interesting you will understand how to manipulate people maybe a little better here and there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what it seems...","review":"This is not an \\"advice manual\\" or anything like it.

Greene and Elffers provide a thorough and entertaining survey of many different types of seduction skills and applications in this classic work on the subject, not to be overlooked by any serious student or practicing Artist. For those seeking complimentary works which will aid in accomplishing seductory ambitions, investigation of \\"9 Free Secrets of New Sensual Power\\" by Clint Arthur will be a natural selection as will his DVD \\"New Free Sex\\" or Dr. Corynna Clarke's \\"Goddess Worship\\" video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Content-Bad Layout","review":"I just received a copy yesterday, so far its very good. The content is strong and sucks you in, its almost like reading a college text book on PUA stuff. But the unfortunate thing is that I found that it reads much like a college text book, that is 3 times smaller. The pages seem to be too cramped for the subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make Love Like War","review":"According to Greene, seduction is \\"a world you enter, a world that is separate and distinct from the real world\\". He uses classical literature to show the styles of seducers; the Dandy, the Coquette, the Siren, to name a few, in the first short chapters. The major part of the 400 + page book lays out the seductive process in steps, among them; choose the right victim, send mixed signals, master the art of the bold move.Greene takes classical stories as examples to show how the steps work, and then describes the dangers involved. If you have read \\"The Art of Power\\" by Greene, this book is written in similar style, with great depth and understanding of archetypes of human nature.

My credit card was charged but the book was never received. Can you please provide me with the sellers info."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting look at seduction, if not that practical","review":"This book went into extensive detail about the different types of seducers, both male and female, which in and of itself is a unique presentation, since most seduction and \\"get laid\\" books only seem to focus on a single idealized type of seducer, i.e. the \\"Alpha Male\\". For this perspective alone, this book is a worthwhile read, because if you are at interested in increasing your seductive powers, which you probably are if you are reading this book, you will realize that there is no single way that you have to be in order to be attractive. Attractiveness is about accentuating your own unique charms and qualities.What this book lacks is practical advice. If you are looking at practical tips or methods that you can employ in everyday situations, this is not the book for you. But for a interesting, somewhat abstracted history and analysis of various types of seducers, this is a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A caution on the use","review":"To start with, this book is brilliant. A new world is opened to the reader who has never experimented with seduction or even thought themselves seductive to begin with. Greene takes the reader on a journey that peers in on the greatest seducers of all time. A word of caution. The material in this book does work, but one should be careful when messing with the psyche of others. It teaches you how to prey on the weak and exploit their weaknesses for your own gain. Women will swoon, and people will do favors for you without even knowing they are under your spell. A very good book on a subject that has to be approached with caution."},{"rating":"2","title":"No complaints","review":"Ive been reading here and there but I love how it's on my iPhone so whenever I'm waiting somewhere I can waste the time wisely and read a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Reading","review":"I'm giving my copy to my teenage daughter. I want her to be a bit more savvy should someone target her for seduction. (Hey, a father's got a right to worry.) The book is essential for any library on the topic and I wonder that it shouldn't be more accurately titled \\"The Science Of Seduction\\" as Mr. Greene has done such a good job in giving structure to a sometimes ambiguous topic. Dangerous knowledge for some, but then I'm the sort to keep survivalist manuals on my bookshelves. It fits right in."},{"rating":"2","title":"use what you will","review":"This book is great in understanding some of the basics of human psychology in the matters of passion and desire. It would take a lot of work, time and effort to really use the strategies explained in the book. Most people may get away with using maybe 30 to 40 percent of the tactics and still see some result. It is interesting to note, though, that most of the historical and literary figures he uses as examples of great seducers, who get what they want, are in larger context very unhappy individuals. For example: Charlie Chaplin, Cleopatra, Marilyn Monroe and DH Lawrence - they all led very dramatic and unhappy lives if not met with untimely death. So I supppose it all depends on what one wants in life and love, and making choices accordingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leopard can't change it's spots","review":"You will like this book if you have the patience to read 400 odd pages of fine print and you don't mind flitting from one historical episode to the next. There is no sense of continuity through the book. The author has, however done an excellent job in writing the commentary on the various historical episodes and personalities and he has drawn practical lessons from them. If however you want to read this book in order to become a hit with the ladies or hunks out there then don't waste your time. Personally I feel that it is possible for a person to polish off his rough edges. However changing a whole personality drastically is extremely difficult, if not impossible. Read with an open mind and without any ulterior motives, this is a good book. I would like to add that this book is not just about seduction in the sexual context but has got a much wider application."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.....","review":"This book don't make any sense. It talks about luring Man in with seduction that only works in the movies. I think this book is terrible unreal and I don't recommend it. This was the worst money spend on a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I have to pick a star...","review":"This book is unbelievable. There is not a single OUNCE of actual scientific research to back up ANY of the author's claims. ALL of the scenarios provided in the book--\\"victims\\", seducers, instructions/\\"advice\\"--are EXTREME prototypes and NEVER actually exist in reality. Every single claim and assertion the author makes is based on fiction, mythology, fantasy, and the author's own opinion. None of it is scientific, and there is no way to weed out what may actually be accurate because the author lists no scientifically relevent sources or further readings. I am appalled at the HORRIBLE taste in which this book was written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Lame","review":"I would bet that the dude who wrote this book has gotten laid very little in his life. If you just want a history lesson on seduction, this is a good book, but if you want to actually know how to meet women and get laid, this book sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hodge podge of stories from all kinds of place","review":"This book is just a collection of stories from movies, literature and rumors about presidents and movie stars. The author has added some highbrow commentary to these stories and declared it a manual for seduction. It's a joke! If you are looking to improve your relationships or seduce the other sex, look elsewhere because this book is nothing more than a mildly amusing read. Better buy some less expensive piece of pulp fiction from your favorite supermarket bookshelf type author -- I think that will be a lot more rewarding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bible of the literary view on seduction","review":"The book provides a strong literary perspective on seduction. In other words, there is zero scientific basis. Having said this, this is a fun and very intriguing book to read. I don't think I have read anything like it. The author is apparently very well read and brings forth the best theories on seduction from hundreds of literary sources and biographies. You can say this is the Bible of the literary view on seduction. I would rank this book with \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" in the common sense knowledge of people skills. This book is destined to become a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't read as a \\"how to\\" book","review":"I read this book a while back. I didn't read it because I wanted to know \\"how to seduce\\" my sexual interests. I read it for curiosity of what this author had to actually say. The stories and examples were interesting as well as the psychology of the book. It does a well job of classifying certain characteristics of people and it helped me become more tolerant of different personalities and reponses that usually don't coincide with my own. I also found that at the end of reading this book, it isn't a step by step guide how to seduce someone, but you feel with the knowledge you have acquired, more confident and brave to want to seduce so to speak your love interest. I felt like I could relate to a little bit of each character in the book. It made me take pride in my own thinking and actions. A reaffirmation that everyone handles situations differently. Yet they can all be effective. Just don't read for literal use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Because You Read This, Doesn't Mean You HAVE To Apply It","review":"I understand and agree with the assertion that many reviewers (and even the main book review) have made about this book being creepy and distasteful in some ways. That being said, anyone on the fence about buying this book should understand that just because you educate yourself about social psychology and human manipulation does not mean that you have to apply what you learn or believe that people who do apply these principles and tactics are noble people. Also, keep in mind that learning about these things provides you with the knowledge to DEFEND YOURSELF against people who try to manipulate YOU.Overall, a solid and interesting book worth reading if you're interested. Nothing more, nothing less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, I would read it time and time again","review":"This book provides not only a guide to seducing the opposite sex as well as the means to seducing people in general and the masses. It is a must-read if you are looking to gain influence with people of the opposite sex or just people in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book but not for marketers or married people","review":"PROS: This book is written in the same style just like all the others, lots of historical examples. I purchased the audio book and the reading voice is excellent, one of the best voices I have heard for an audio book. I am a huge fan of Robert Greene and like all the other books,(48 laws of power, 33 strategies of war).CONS: Not for marketers or married people. I thought this book was about how to seduce prospects into buying your product - I was wrong. This book is really for single people and has various historical lessons on how to seduce the opposite/same sex. There is a part in the book about children which I found weird and quite frankly a little disturbing. As a professional marketer and married man, I only found small parts of this book useful. This book is my least favorite of the three by Robert Greene. I hope this review helps.Caine"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A GOOD PRODUCT","review":"this product is difficult to use.

This album would only make the prospective fan shy away from the obnoxious Coe."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit dry","review":"This book was strong on research and content, but the presentation is very dull and somewhat dry. By now, anyone who has heard of Welch knows about his management philosophies and tendencies...as well as the things that have made him successful. Let's face it, there's been a whole lot written about the man both in books and the news media. By now, we're looking for more private anecdotes and 'behind the scenes' material which this book is short on. Like Welch says about the book, it is fair. But it is sort of boring.I must say, though, that the author is a very strong writer and very diligent in her research. I was put to sleep, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is the man?","review":"I was very disappointed in this book .I thought it was a biography of the man but instead it was a synopsis of business management only. Who cares about the daily life of the corporate CEO? I wanted to know the man. What were his parents like, what kind of a childhood did he have? How about some pictures of Jack the kid? Who was his wife of twenty eight years, what are her opinions of Jack, as a man and a father? How about his children, do they have insights into their fathers feelings? What experiences in his life molded him into what he became? These and many other questions were not answered. How can anyone write a biography with no personal facts or anecdotes? Try it again Janet, the third time never fails."},{"rating":"2","title":"SPECIAL INSIGHT INTO THE WORLD'S GREATEST LEADER!","review":"I really liked Janet Lowe's breezy, yet comprehensive writing style. She certainly captures not only the man but his impressive leadership traits and business acumen. I have the full Welch library but I would highlight this book out of the bunch simply because of her ability to tell a good story. Many of the other Welch books are dry and do not provide new insight. Clearly the author had connects into Welch and GE that allowed her to tell a rich story. I strongly recommend as a must-have to anyone in business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother to read it","review":"Any book that has that many footnotes can't be good. The reader does not care if the author is completely accurate in their information, we just want to get to know the character of the book - what makes him tick, how he thinks, what are his habits, etc. In fact some of the best biographies I have read take liberties with the information to embelish the story and make it interesting. Just read some of Irving Stone's great biographies, Agony and the Ecstacy for example, to see what I mean. The author has plenty of footnotes, but no insightful information. She jumps from one topic to another, without ever giving the reader a good feel for any of the topics she covers. She would have been better off to cut the things she discussed in half and developed each idea more fully. Don't bother reading this book. Wait for Jack's own book. Hopefully we will get to know him better then.PS: At least is was better than Robert Slaters fauning accounts of GE and Welch."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much","review":"Price is way too much, better off to just pound a nail and hang your coat on it.Cheap soft wire and just enough threads to hold it on a wall.

It seems that the author doesn't want to teach you DirectX, but would rather just have you cut and paste his code into your program and use it without understanding how it works. Example: \\"We won't dig into code here; we'll just skim over it...\\"(166). That is no way to teach someone. He makes DirectDraw much more complicated than it really is. I do know a good bit of DirectX now, but no thanks to this book. Also, all of his programs are poor quality. I still consider myself a beginner DirectX programmer, but I can thow together better programs in one day, no joke, they're that bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very poor book for teaching DirectX.","review":"From all appearances DirectX seems to be a extremely clumsy and tedious interface. The author works around this by wrapping all the DirectX details in his own classes. While this might be a good tactic if you are a progammer, it doesn't work when you are actually trying teach the DirectX interface. If his classes where very, very good then one might be tempted to just use them and forget about DirectX entirely. Unfortunately they are not that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to learn DirectX, not the Jason Kolb graphical API.","review":"I'm not sure about just what this book is trying to accomplish. The cover announces it as a guide to directX 3, however nearly the entire book deals with the author's \\"wrapper classes\\" with only sparse mention of actual DirectX or Direct3D functions or their theory. In addition to this, the author spread uses so many wrappers and typedefs, spread over so many files that you will find your self constanly asking, \\"what the hell does 'lpDD3DTHISHEADERISWAYTOOLONG' stand for?

The author makes early assumptions about the sort of program you want to write, then goes about writing wrapper classes that obscure all of the functional features of DirectX just to fit his unhelpful viewpoint. You'll spend most of your time with this book trying to track down what DirectX functions are called when, and if they're really necessary, or just the excess baggage of the author's desire to use the same code example for the entire text"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad stuff","review":"Absolutely one of the worst programming books Ive ever seen. The code is obtuse, the comments are sparse, and the text is shallow.'nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book","review":"This was not a good book at all. The code is extremely hard to read because he puts everything in wrapper functions which are put in more wrapper functions which are put in even more wrapper functions, most of which are totally unnecessary. Throughout the book he builds on the same program, only showing you the modifications made, so you have try to remember what the previous version looked like to try and put it all together. Very confusing. Kind of a pity too because it looks like he covers alot of excellent information, it's just very hard to read his sample code. if you are a veteran windows programmer, you may be able to make some sense out of it but i recommend DirectDraw Programming by Bret Timmons although it ONLY covers DirectDraw ="},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap junk","review":"This sword did not last two months of very gentle use.Don't bother with this product.The old all metal variety is not available anywhere.

Lowest common denominator movie watching especially for fans of the genere. Pretty much before GHOST SHIP left port, it sunk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic ghost story...","review":"Ghost Ship is a classic ghost story at sea, despite being a bit gory. It's got a great cast, a solid plot, and some spooky ghosts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grade B Horror Film's Grade: 2\\\\5","review":"\\"Ghost Ship\\" is another grade B horror film that just isn't scary. Director Steve Beck is more interested in mood and showmanship, but unfortunately, he can't even get that right despite some spooky art direction and what looks to be a pretty big budget. And this isn't the first time that Beck has told a ghost story, he directed \\"Thirteen Ghosts,\\" which, in my opinion, is one of the better horror films in recent history.\\"Ghost Ship\\" could have been fun had it gone in more interesting and unpredictable directions. Instead, we're treated to a fairly dull movie experience with one dimensional characters and very few scares. And it's all capped off by a sequel-ready ending complete with an obtrusive hard rock tune that offsets any sense of terror \\"Ghost Ship\\" might have had to offer.In my opinion, this film should not be purchased. It is an okay rent, but make sure it a 99cent rent, as more would be a waste of your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best script in the horror files","review":"After all the hype, this movie failed to live up to the scary expectations that were promised.Although the acting was passable, the sets were remarkable, the lighting was effective, there was still a lot to be desired with this film.The real highlight of the DVD came from all the extra's where we were given an inside look at the creation of the special effects as well as the film development.It doesn't have a decent shelf life that would command repeat viewings. Personally, this is one to rent before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Terrible","review":"Dull, uninspired, derivative, insipid, etc are just a few of the words that come to mind after watching this stinker. The best moment comes in first 5 mintues and goes downhill from there. The contrived \\"surprise\\" ending that seems to be a necessity for bad horror movies feels particularly takced on here. It's not scary, but it might have been. To its credit there a few scenes of distrubing gore but that's as far as it goes. No real suspense. It's not so bad you turn it off. I might have given it one star but I watched Darkness Falls the same night and it was worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"The beginning was good, I agree, nice way to get rid of lot's of people. The cast was good as well, but the movie was not scary!... I mean come on, I was expecting a horror, and i got to see like what, 3 ghosts that looked like normal people?Oh yea and the twist in the end wasn't that shocking. Not a horrible waste of time and money, but still, I was expecting to see a horror, and what i ended up feeling was sea-sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, But Not Scary.","review":"As a horror movie fan, i can spot what's gonna happen a mile away, and in this movie i knew what was gonna happen 10 min. before it was gonna happen. It's a shame too, it had a great cast of actors, too bad they were not given much to work with. I will admit though i was entertained, but in no way was i scared. What a perfect opportunity to do such a great horror film, \\"on a ship\\". I also will admit, i was surprised that a certain someone/something was behind the whole thing. Anyway, as i said pretty predictable, and not scary, but if one night your bored or something, pop this in, and you'll be entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"While this movie looked somewhat promising from the trailers, only the opening sequence is truly gruesome and scary.

The opening sequence was intersting enough but the film does not live up to the expectations. I feel like the opening sequence should give you an idea of what to expect from the film not be the most interesting and gorest part of a horror film. I believe this scene was have been more appropriate for the climax of the film not a tool to get you to sit through the whole film expecting more and more and getting less and less.

I bought it and I give it a five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Scary Movie","review":"I really liked this movie. It had all the elements that I enjoy in the horror genre. This has ghosts, the devil, a great abandoned ship with treasures aboard. I particularly enjoyed the beginning scenes where we find out what happened to the original passengers. The scene where the cable snaps was wonderfully done. I also enjoyed the flash-back scene where the main ghost shows Julianna M's character what has occured on the ship and who the big, bad devil person is behind everything. Another thing I enjoyed about this movie is that it showed that people can be self-sacrificing and not just out for a buck; that money is not more important that helping others and saving your own soul.I saw this at the theatre and again rented it and watched it three more times. Dark Castle should be proud of this one. It is as good as House on Haunted Hill was. I hope they keep up the good work. Basically, give this a try. I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe for Halloween ...","review":"The scares are too few, too far between, and too often retreads.That said, there are a few good long creepy segments.

Sure, these films succeed in their ability to scare through special effects but it also falls short in this respect too.It seesm to end too abruptly. Just as you think it's about to come to life, it winds down...possibly a blessing though.Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie will pick its audience","review":"I bought this movie based on the cover art and even though I read the reviews here I was hoping that I would still end up liking the film. Other reviewers have already dissected in details what they liked or not like about this film. I have to say this movie turned out to be underwhelming in acting, story and special effect.The nearest equivalent film that I can think that was opposite to this film was the Alien. It had good acting, story was similar in that main characters are trapped in an confined area and the special effect actually made me jump out of the chair (really did) the first time I saw it.This movie is okay as rental. Unfortunately, I bought mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghost Ship Review","review":"This movie is a underwhelming ride to weak plot points. The only A+ in this film is the blood & gore but most of the killings happen offscreen. The cast is so-so and so is the acting. The opening is pretty good but fails to help the film in the long run. It also has pointless jump scares. The Special effects are mediocre at best. Not to mention,the many plotholes in this film. I give Ghost Ship a 1 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"GHOST SHIP SINKS","review":"Terrible horror movie that is more funny than scary.When a haunted ghost ship is left in the seas a crew of people arrive on the ship some die and don't.What a waste, though better than 1999's THE HAUNTING but not that better."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK Ship","review":"Ghost Ship is one of the worst kinds of Hollywood [double dealing] to come along in some time. No wonder THE RING blew it out of the water during it's theatrical release. After a very cool opening, the movie falls into some of the worst dialogue, even worse acting and a completely predictable yawn fest. Not one single scare. No consistency of performance from moment to moment. I've seen these actors in other films or on TV and I suspect they can actually act, but wow, [are they bad] in this. Only young Emily Browning as Katie gives a strange intriguing performance. The film should've been about her not a sorry [imitation]of ALIEN dynamics. And while this movie's gorgeously photographed, and lushly production designed, it's not enough to make it worth the torturous 91 minutes of viewing. Badly executed with a cheeseball score - Ghost Ship should be sunk and forgotten. AVOID!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Serious Disappointment","review":"What do you get when you combine good production values, good special effects, but forget the story? This movie. Perhaps if you are a special effects addict or just have to see every bad movie that comes along, then you might enjoy this. This movie left me with nothing except a waste of my time. Just look at the number of used copies available and the low price they are asking. This should give you an indication that this is a movie you will never want to see again. If you want a much better movie, then check out 'Deep Rising'. And somebody had to be cruel by recommending 'Event Horizon' in addition to 'Ghost Ship'. Maybe they meant that it was to be avoided just like this one. -Bob"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now THIS is a horror movie..","review":"Ghost Ship is one of the bloodiest horror movies in recent years. Watch the first fifteen minutes and you'll see why. The story is not that exceptional: a salvage crew is hired by a mysterious person to recover a long lost luxury cruise ship.Of course everything is not as it seems; the crew is stranded on the cruise ship, a \\"treasure in gold\\" is discovered along with the truth about what happened to the ship's crew and passengers.Ghost Ship is not perfect, but it is worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Worth It!","review":"'Ghost Ship' is lacking of a good story and good actors. First of all the story is very lame, and doesn't correllate with any of the other mysterious happenings. For example the fact that the Ocean Liner shows up in the Bering Strait holds no signifigance whatsoever. Second of all, the cast really drags. It's made up of unknowns, who seem to be complete amateurs. All the parts that were supposed to scare me actually made me either mad or laugh, because it is a disgrace to any cinematographer. Ultimately, Ghost ship actually deserves -1 star but i can't do that. Don't even bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a sunken ship","review":"The title caught my imagination.

The only good thing in the movie is a scene with a lot of gore in the first ten mintues or so (don't want to give away what happens).

In fact, around the time it came to video stores, there were 2 or 3 independent films with similar names and similar covers, with- yes- similar stories put out at the same time. I guess something like that tells you that there's a market for it or at least was. I could see Ghost Rig\\" on the shelf and think it was that one that was a theatrical release instead of this one.

Never at one point was I scared, but for some reason, I thought it was okay. Definately not the best, but not the worst either. The main thing that I really like is the beggining, even though it was kind of gory. And I liked the part where they show what happens in the past, becuase they do it very well, especailly when they have the flashes, I love when movies have that!But, if you're the type who doesn't like movies without an ounce of scare in them, don't waste your money, unless a friend invites you to watch it or something, but if you think a movie doesn't have to be all scary to be good, then I say see it for yourself, and let you be the judge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gory But FUN!!!","review":"Ghost Ship is one of SCARIEST movies I have seen. The oppening scene begins on a luxurious boat named Antonia Graza.There are couples dancing away when a steel line cuts through the couples and cuts them in half, dismembers them, or decapitates them. The only survivor is a girl named Katie.Forty years later after that gory night in 1962. A group of salvagers find the ship. Thay are talking about towing it back to port. Then weird things happen. Like a little girl in the Grand Ballroom, a voice singing to Greer, or blood filling up a pool. Then deaths come. First comes Greer. Then the crew does not care about the ship or it's cargo, but of their lives.Katie's ghost then shows what happenned that fateful night. How everyone died, includidng her. Epps the meets the demon who kiled everyone on board. Then the ship sinks due to a explosion. Epps is the only survivor.I wonder why everyone says this is a bad video.

I am a horror movie buff, but the recent surge of so-called horror movies have left a lot to be desired. If you see this movie with the intention of expecting it to be a total B movie, then it might not be bad. To a certain extent, I expected it. I don't know if the intent was to make this movie scary or gory (I feel there is a difference between the two), but this was all gory.The opening scene with the cord is a bit much. I felt like saying out loud \\"yeah, right.\\"Why do they have to make these \\"ghost\\" movies into \\"action\\" movies? Is it what people want? I wanted to see a movie about ghosts.I wanted a little suspense.

I mean, What The Hell? I thought it might be a spoof opening, but it wasn't. I couldn't believe that a horror flick could even TRY and do this.The plot was so-so, but I can't understand why Julianna Marguleise and Gabriel Byrne would have accepted the script? They must have needed the money. Anyway, there were a few cool and new effects and horrific ways to kill folk.I think the most horrifying point of this movie is the overall production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bashful's DVD Summary #039","review":"Best:1) It was scary and unpredictable. If you examine the whole story, it's pretty packed even though it plays very simply.2) They did a lot with practical special-effects without resorting to many cgi graphics.3) The opening gore scene is very memorable and something you'll want to replay over and over.4) You get good acting from well-chosen star talent.3) There are a few worthwhile behind-the-scenes shows that augment the movie well.Worst:1) The hip-hop music track was completely inappropriate at times (especially when they were flashing back to the 1962 scenes).2) The story is a little hard to understand, so you might have to rewatch it to really get it all.Recommendation:This is Halloween great that you can easily watch once a year and notice something new each time. It's got suspense, ghosts and lots of bloody deaths (that weren't overdone) - what's not to love."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Love Boat this isn't!","review":"Any movie that can make you slide to the edge of your seat and cover your eyes in the first 5 minutes is going to be a good one, guaranteed! This movie is one of the best horror films that I have seen come out in a long time. The special effects are top notch, the acting is incredible, and the plot is good. I wanted to see this movie in the theatre, but just never got around to it. I bought it the day it came out and watched it as soon as I got home. I swear, I had to get up and turn the lights back on to watch it. One of the best things about this movie is that everything comes full circle. There are no loose ends just lying around. On the predictabiliy scale, this movie doesn't even rank. You never know what is lurking around the corner or sitting in the next cabin. The sets in this movie are among the best and rank right in there with the sets from The Haunting and Titanic. This is a movie I will definitely watch over and over and keep enjoying for a long time to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather bland, standard ghost story.","review":"I watched Ghost Ship and Resident Evil within a day of each other and the difference was quite startling. Where Resident Evil was a rollercoaster of pacing and noise with a great back story, Ghost Ship lumbers along without much direction. Salvaging a luxury liner whose passengers were mysteriously \`dispatched' in the 60's, a glorified tug boat captained by a tired and haggard looking Gabriel Byrne must try to understand why his crew is suddenly disappearing. This film just didn't really engage me. The chick from ER as a spot welding heroine? Not only do I not find her attractive anyhow, but that just didn't cut it in the story itself. The tug crew running around in the old rusted and rotted carcass of the ship reminded me and made me pine for a DVD version of Attack of the Mushroom People. Now there was a ghost ship story worth something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie for Sunday Night","review":"This film has been unfairly maligned by the critics. I personally loved it.

Then you get no scares whatsoever, just a really great death rate movie where people get cut in half by extention wires, and gunned down, hanged and stabbed threw the face with a hook. Then theres this big plot twist, The guy who found it and brought them to the ship(Harrington) is actually a ghost and hes harvesting bodys for the ship.

The big problem with this movie is that none of the characters are particularly likeable so you don't care about their fate.As Stephen King points out in his excellent book \\"Danse Macabre\\" CHARACTERIZATION is all important in a horror movie or book if it is to make you feel emotionally involved in the story.I give this movie 5 stars because it does have some good special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, somewhat entertaining","review":"Thirteen Ghosts director Steve Beck returns to helm this Dark Castle flick which begins with an awesome display of makeup and digital trickery and a foreboding atmosphere, but the plot is loaded with cliches and is rather predictable who's going to get picked off next. When an ocean liner, missing for the past 40 years, mysteriously re-appears, a salvage crew (led by Gabriel Byrne) is offered to bring her in. Ghost Ship's presentation is slick to be sure, and I really wanted to like this movie, but it leaves you wanting so much more out of it. The cast also includes ER alumni and off-screen partners Julianna Margulies and Ron Eldard, as well as Wrong Turn's Desmond Harrington, Isiah Washington, and Karl Urban who looks like he just walked off the set of Lord of the Rings (which he most likely did). All in all, this is worth a look for horror buffs, but don't expect anything special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the movie Deep Rising instead.","review":"This is only an AVERAGE horror movie.

In these post-modern times, horror movies aren't scary and the characters are more disgusting than the ghosts/monsters. And the music...the heavy metal/alternative noise in Ghost Ship is simply awful. If you want to know how proper horror music sets an atmosphere and a mood, check out any 80s John Carpenter flick or an early 90s Full Moon movie (i.e., Puppet Master, Pit and the Pendulum). I'd recommend the good 80s movie Ghost Story or even the laughable 80s movie Death Ship (OOP, but available at half.com)...over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Event Horizon on a cruise ship","review":"Aside from the gruesome, gory opening sequence there's really not much to recommend about Ghost Ship. It's basically a rehash of Event Horizon (1997), a much superior horror movie. Event Horizon itself had traces of Alien (1979) and The Shining (1980), but still managed to be an effective, freaky thriller. Ghost Ship offers nothing new, features cardboard characters, predictable situations and annoying music video-type style. This is typical of most horror movies today, though.This could have been a good movie if better work had been done on the script and the director were more intent on making a movie than a music video. Even the plot is derivative of Event Hoziron. I would recommend renting that instead of Ghost Ship. It's a much more effective, scary horror movie.

If you only know them for \\"Under the Milkyway\\" -- their sole top ten hit in the 80s -- you've missed out on some of the smartest and most elegant pop music of the the last 20 years.In his first \\"proper\\" solo album in a long time, Dabble finds Kilbey in top form with poetic, insightful lyrics and catchy music. His speak/sing approach makes the songs accessible and demands repeated listening to catch the words and the message of the songs.If you like music that you can lose yourself in for hours, this is your kind of CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dabble Dazzles in a World of Decay and Hope","review":"Released late in 2001, after the unrest and confusion created by the Sept 11th tragedy this CD opened my ears to a sound and vision concurrent with the vision of a gifted songwriter.\`Dabble', the latest release by Steve Kilbey, the lead Singer of the Australian originated band, \`The Church', shows the crafts of one of the world's most underated songwriter visionaries and musicians.From the opener, \`Blessed One' to songs like \`China' and \`Untitled One'.

It seems that Activision wants to test our vision and ruin our hearing at a stroke. Inherent Evil contains no puzzles that involve logic, you simply must be able to spot the tiny, little clue in a tiny, little corner of the screen at a place in the game you thought you had thoroughly searched before. Also, while optically straining, the game manages to be auditorily cruel. The music and dialogue are at incompatable levels; the former engulfing the latter and rendering it indecipherable. In order to hear the dialogue, so that you may follow the story, you must allow yourself to be punished with music that is vaugely tolerable when it is not insanely off key.So do yourself a favor, if you buy this game and for the holy love of Mary, shut off your volume whenever you enter the elevator; this is the true Evil inherent in the game: The Elevator Music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality.

Miller is best known for The Heroine's Text: Readings in the French and English Novel, 1722-1782, which is clearly not a book that passes unperceived (to paraphrase Peter Brooks of Yale). Here Miller takes on the role of women in a much larger timeline (roughly from the Renaissance through the 19th century), again with her unsentimental criticism. Her style is terse, often funny, and readable. After a thorough linear analysis of a narrative sequence, she discusses the ideological consequence of the novel. Because she doesn't have an axe to grind, her critiques cannot be dismissed as \\"feminist\\" but rather bring added depth to the study of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like the movie, you'll love the book","review":"As intricately layered and briskly paced as the movie adaptation, the original source novel is an excellent entry in the crime noir genre. Sleazy, smoky, and seductive, this is the infamous Los Angeles of the mid-twentieth century, filled with political corruption, Hollywood scandal, and unchecked crime syndicates. The novel explores deeply the motivations and fears of LAPD police officers Bud White, Jack Vincennes, and Edmund Exley as they investigate the suspicious circumstances surrounding the Nite Owl massacre. The seemingly straightforward murder case begins to unravel, enveloping the three protagonists with the demons of past and present. Prepare to be surprised at every turn of the page.

Characters as real as the people you know are found in these pages, made even more real by their flaws.

The three main cops in the story had me liking, scorni ng, liking. It's not the kind of book you'd want kids to get a hold of, but it was sure good and makes me glad I'm not part of that scene. (I understand a movie is in the making, and I wonder if it'll be as good as the book, what with Danny DeVito in it for crying out loud. I can't imangine that little squirt as a bad or good guy.

Instead, I was subjected to a brutal (which didn't bother me) and very confusing story about three cops and their involvement with a massacre at a small L.A. diner.

Ellroy had stuffed too many characters and too many storylines into what could have been a compact, yet compelling novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lower than average read","review":"The book's premise, plot and prose are OK.

For a book ostensibly about Los Angeles, there is little sense of place. It could have taken place anywhere. Why is the mastermind behind the criminal scheme revealed in the prologue, thereby ending all suspense? Why is so much of the book just dull exposition? Why are the action scenes so poorly written that you can't visualize what is going on? And the depiction of African-Americans is flat-out racist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely strong content, weak character development.","review":"Extreme violence and lude sex are the common theme throughout this book.

I quit at about the half-way point, and deleted the book from my Kindle. If there is a plot, I couldn't follow it. The writing style is staccato, with lots of one word and disjointed \\"sentences\\". Every character....and there are many!....is either In publicservice or walks on the dark side of life, and all are corrupt and violent beyond belief. There's a lot of foul language and unintelligible slang which adds nothing but reader confusion. Perhaps I should have been warned by the title...for this is, indeed, trashy tabloid-type writing.

The dramatic Spirit-Baptisms were simply God giving His sign of approval upon their conversions. Thus Dunn views the Baptism in the Spirit as a conversion/initiation experience (1 Cor. 12:13).Dunn's book has become the standard reply by non-Pentecostals and non-charismatics.

I loved it, I ate up every prurient moment; I thought it was extremely explicit and would probably enjoy reading it as an adult. I don't know if it should be read by children under the age of 14 though (I was probably ten when I read it). The memories of that story have stayed with me for over thirty-years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"My mother and I have both read and re-read this book many times over the past 20 years.

In a world where smooth junk jazz rules the airwaves and young guns can't get out of the shadows of the past masters, here was a guy that put adventure into his music. Bowie was not afraid to take a popular song and bend it into a improvisors wonderland. Using tracks from Rapper Notorious B.I.G., Raggae master Bob Marley, Popsters TLC and Vanessa Williams - Lester continues the magic on \\"When The Spirit Returns.\\" His swirling trumpet soaring above the rapid firing Brass Fantasy is spectacular. As always, the humor and improvisations are all present. This CD leaves you happy, sad and fulfilled with a lasting thought that one of the finest musical masters has past on. I am thankful that his recorded work will be around to show the future generation how much fun Jazz could truly be.

To those interested in WWII and the German U-Boat arm, it is well worth it. I also agree with jbavnet's review in that the author could have spared us remarks about Allied treatment of Germans and how the laborors didn't have it so bad. At one point the author states that post-war Germans were provided with less daily rations than those poor souls that had been murdered in the concentration camps and that he felt this was unjust. He makes other remarks about the labor treatment in the same light. He has issues but the information provided makes it a book worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't think it was possible","review":"I bought this book from amazon and got the usual good service; but this book is terrible.I did not think it was possible to write a book this long and say absolutely nothing.

The central situation in many of the poems is the moment of first flowering--into adult experience, love, sexuality, a new consciousness--which moment is repeated and rehearsed like an archetype. A Nicaraguan woman is raped by a stranger while her husband cuts sugar cane; it is a half desired violation. In \\"The Babysitter,\\" two girls mimic their teenage sitter's immature sexual antics while her two charges watch, and then later parody her, anticipating their adult lives.These are lovingly preserved cries from a voice most don't hear or can't hear. They put the reader back in the world of possibility with a tenderness so fine and surely shaped that the reader can feel \\"the swell of moonlight, / and the chill under the separate eaves, / pure white and choked with love.\\" The title poem is a concentration of the whole collection, which glimmers with radiant sadness and often pain.

If you are looking for a tutorial, get one of the O'reilly books (ActionScript for Flash MX: TDG, and/or Essential ActionScript 2.0), I have both of these books and they are wonderful learning books. I do have to say that the ActionScript 2.0 Dictionary (this book) and ActionScript for Flash MX (from O'reilly) are the two books on AS that have a permanent spot on my desk.

Yes, much of the book is a print of the Flash MX 2004 Help menu as a few reviewers have mentioned but I always wish I had a complete bound book of the help menu anyway.I am looking at ActionScript 3.0 books and I don't see anything that compares.I find many instructional books using larger type and large margins on the pages to extend the page count, where this book has quite a bit of information on each page without bloating each page in getting the book to appear larger. It is already large and packed full.This book is becoming quite outdated but if you are new to ActionScript, you will find a lot of useful information here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of mistakes","review":"I'm trying so many examples from this book and they're just full of mistakes.

It is a wonderful story about perseverance, love of family and friends, and a search for the things that make us happy.

Along the way, they have to overcome Manny Rat who wants to kill them, survive war and hypercritical theater critics, deal with a snapping turtle, and help a Muskrat search for the elusive \\"X\\" of life. The writing and characterization are topnotch. Yes, there are places in the book where animals die and Hoban does not shy away from these aspects of life. In my view, however, these events only add to the power of the story. At times, very funny and very sad, this is a story for both those who are young and young at heart.

There are three stories that are intertwined in rather predictable ways. The story and the characters are not to my liking. The treatment of women as somehow superior beings, deeply in touch with the natural world and always intimately connected with their environment, turns me cold.

I am studying this book for my Contemporary Issues in Literature Class, so im not missing out on the themes of human vs nature, endangered species, organic vs. chemical agriculture and the slew of other things in this book. but GOD its the most boring thing i have ever read, it just goes nowhere. When i got to page 400 i found my self saying... \\"geez, when is the plot going to thicken, or more accuratly, when is the plot going to begin!\\" i do not reccomend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a story somewhere in this wordy swamp?","review":"May the good Lord save me from flowery women writers.I like to find a story when I read and all I find are gossimer wings and comparisons between man and nature.Boring, boring, boring.Just my opinion, of course, but I found it a waste of time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nobody's Perfect","review":"I thought Barbara Kingsolver could do no wrong until I read this novel. She is still my favorite author, but this book tanks! It was like reading an ecology textbook with lots of sex scenes. If I had to read it for a college ecology class, I'm sure it would have been more interesting than the other text books out there, but as a novel for a typical person, looking for a great read, it was a real disappointment.Save your money, buy any of Barbara's awesome books but this one. My personal favorite is High Tide in Tucson, but they are all wonderful. Read Prodigal Summer only if you'd like academic credit and you can stay awake through boring text."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing prodigious here","review":"i haven't been this disappointed in a book in quite some time. there was nothing complex, nothing moving...nothing prodigious about this novel. it was a painful read...the sex trashy, the relationships for the most part underdeveloped...the most promising characters too peripheral for my tastes. it didn't feel like kingsolver at all. and the worst thing? this novel was too easy...far too transparent, maps drawn neatly across the pages as though the reader needed a forest services-esque guide to \\"get it\\". i found this book lacking in meaning, depth and breadth. i had to re-read The Poisonwood Bible, The Bean Trees, Pigs in Heaven and High Tide in Tucson just to feel better about having wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Challenge","review":"I offer a challenge to those people who refuse to stop reading a book before it is finished. Start this novel. If you can get through it, you are a better person than I. I have struggled through the long prose of Melville and the 1000 page novels of Dickens, but this book moves about as fast as a turtle with no legs trying to swim in a pool of molasses. If you get this book as a present, (shame on you if you bought it) I wish you luck, you will need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of art","review":"This is one of the most beautifully written books I've ever read. The various personal stories that are woven together in this book give the reader wonderful insights into the very real characters. In addition, the book teaches important lessons about ecology and the place of human beings in the natural world. I love it. I love it. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be Kingsolver's best","review":"Which is saying a LOT!!Kingsolver delivers a tremendously complex and honest precorsination of a remote Southern town. The characters are three dimensional and sympathetic, and the plot takes no shortcuts. Kingsolver's social prosetyletizing is kept to a minimum, and though the characters promoting social and environmental responsibility occasionally appear suspiciously free of error and uncertainty, the tendency is controlled. Along with \\"Poisonwood Bible\\" this is, perhaps, the pinnacle of Kingsolver's art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kingsolver Pushes Her Agenda","review":"I am a long time Kingsolver fan, but found this book thoroughly disappointing. Flat, predictable characters spouting repitious environmentalist propaganda is not my idea of a good read. I'm from Kentucky farm country and believe in the cause wholeheartedly; I just didn't find the delivery interesting. If you're just getting introduced to Barbara Kingsolver, do yourself a favor and read her other books first. I gave it two stars because I finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy Summer","review":"Unless you are a 40+ woman who hasn't had sex in a while, and enjoys a simplistic look on environmental issues, skip this one.... Unfortunately, I knew enough about the issues to resent the simplistic, didactic lecturing by her \\"characters\\" that saturates the novel. It would be great if we could all be rich hippies who could afford to buy organic everything, and have no impact on our environment - but get real!!In addition, she boxes her female characters into the role of educating the men. Her male characters are either niave, stupid, or just [frisky], and the \\"enlightened\\" women seem to just use them for sex and arguments. The [explicit] sex scenes border on offensive, and if I was somehow stuck listening to this book with my mother, I would be beet red the entire time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish this book","review":"I have read all of Kingsolver's books, and I think that the quality of her writing is going continuously downward. The writing I found to be so clich��-ish, I could not stomach reading more than the first 80 pages. Because the plot seemed so predictable, and the characters so flat, I went to the last 20 pages, certain I knew what would happen anyway. What happened in between could not even have been as good as I imagined. I was disappointed even with the last 20 pages. I think Kingsolver is probably a better writer than this book showed. It seemed she was either writing quickly to meet a publisher's deadline, or writing the book with the hopes that a film could be made of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A learning experience","review":"I had put off reading this as it was described as having been written by a woman with a degree in biology and uses it throughout her writing. It sounded boring to me. Well it was not boring and she is a wonderful writer and I learned many things about luna moths, coyotes, chestnut trees. Her elderly characters, Nannie and Garnet were so well done I wish I had them in my life. A very verysweet book. Why did I think I would not enjoy this when I have enjoyed her other books, now this is one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected and enjoyable","review":"The story this book tells was not what I expected but was thoroughly enjoyable. Kingsolver's chadacters were complex and believable. The reader could easily identify with them, laugh with them, and cry with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Kind of Name is Eddie Bondo??? Superglue?","review":"Great book though. She has really melded many interesting characters and environmental concerns in a way that only Kingsolver can do. I really enjoyed this book. You cannot compare it to her other books because they are all so different from each other. But then again, I am a major Kingsolver fan and would read any old scrap of paper she has written on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preaching to the choir","review":"I am a huge fan of Kingsolver, but I felt this book was, well, boring. The writing itself was not up to par with her other works, it seemed hastily thought out and just as hastily written. For the strong or even moderate environmentalist, this book is a kindergarten class look at morality - good for those who haven't thought this stuff through a hundred times already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nature thrives in this wonderful story","review":"Once I read Barbara Kingsolver's \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\", I began reading all her books. The Prodigal Summer was a bit of a let down for me. It was a wonderful story, but I didn't think it was up to her standard. Normally, her characters are well-developed but in this story they just seemed to be lost in the message of organic farming and other environmental issues by the author. These are important subjects and they are told very well as only the biologist writer can do. However, these issues just came across as a bit too patronizing and relationship that I had hoped would develop with the characters just seemed to be fuzzy. Still, the book was an excellent read. There was a bit good humor, an unbelievable insight into the feelings and emotions of women and a priceless education and view of the world of nature. All this rolled up into a wonderful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Library of Sonya Armfield","review":"I recommend all of her books, even though my favorite continues to be the Poisonwood Bible. Her books really make you think.Sonya Armfield"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book for Early Spring","review":"I read PRODIGAL SUMMER as springtime finally emerged here in Wisconsin. The trees finally had leaves, the grass was finally green, the flowers finally bloomed. Reading PRODIGAL SUMMER at this time of year made me crave nature's springtime beauty.I read Kingsolver's THE POISONWOOD BIBLE last year. I had a hard time getting into it, but I was so glad that I slugged it out for 500+ pages. I did not experience the same difficulties with PRODIGAL SUMMER. I felt immediate attachment to the characters, even to the darn coyotes. It didn't matter to me that the plot threads were not neatly resolved by the end of the book. There was no need for such finality.Great character development, good pace, excellent description of this corner of American life."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad other people thought this book was a bomb","review":"I kept wanting to like it because The Poisonwood Bible was so good and I've enjoyed her other books. I knew how it was going to end after the first few pages. I found it hard to believe that Deanna just allowed a total stranger into her life like that after being a hermit for too long. And that their \\"big issue\\" was coyotes. Very unrealistic. I also skipped huge chunks of the narrative because it was boring. This book just doesn't work for me at all. The language was a bit too much - it obscured what little narrative was actually there driving the story, such as it was, forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Lacking a passion for either coyotes or moths, I was unable to finish this. As a rule, I believe that readers who don't finish a book should not review it so do not weigh this review too heavily. The Poisonwood Bible, Kingsolver's last book, was an incredible work of literature and one of the best books I've ever read. I opened Prodigal Summer with high expectations of being treated to an equally compelling novel, and I think many fans of the earlier book will do the same. If you intend to read this, throw those expectations out the window and perhaps you'll see more merit in it than I did. This is just my opinion - I'm sure that other readers will have differing opinions, and I look forward to reading them here. If I've erred in my assessment of Prodigal Summer after reading about half of it, please write a review...do I need to give it more time?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mankind and nature together, not against each other","review":"I was impressed with Kingsolver's ability to mesh in her extensive education with the wonders of fiction. As a huge fan of fiction, I'm also a huge fan of learning. Kingsolver told her tales of people each from different walks of life while also teaching valuble lessons about nature, mankind and how the two must live together. I also learned much about moths, coyotes and farming. Kingsolver's biology background really shone through. I was so pleased with Poinsonwood Bible that I was hesitant to pick up Prodigal Summer, but Kingsolver didn't let me down. I have recommended Prodigal Summer to many of the customers in my bookstore and now I can't wait until her next release. Happy reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as her usual","review":"More preachy and pedantic than her usual. 28 day cycle, full moon, universal attraction of males to ovulating females is way overdone to the point of being ridiculous!! The 40something hermit coming out of the woods to give birth also kind of silly!Kingsolver's books are usually terrific reads. This one not so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did you love storytime as a child?","review":"The story gripped me and would not let go. Having the luck to also have \\"read\\" this on the book on tape version read by Kingsolver herself, I enjoyed it all the more... so if you're a \\"car reader\\" like me, give this one a try. You'll find yourself making excuses to go on long road trips.Kingsolver's voice is pleasant, she dramatizes the story \\"just enough\\" but not so much you feel the performance is \\"affected,\\" and you really feel you're lucky enough to be sitting in a room somewhere while the author reads to just you. I used to be an \\"anti-book on tape\\" snob, thinking that people should \\"read\\" books, not listen to them. But I am such a convert now, and think that some books just beg to be oral stories. I think this is one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predators, Moth Love and Old Chesnuts","review":"I listened to this audio book for much of the later part of April as Spring approached my area & I'm not sure if I'll ever see things the same again. I felt like she was trying to put across a couple of major (& of course a whole bunch of smaller) points with this book: 1.) all life is interconnected and it keeps moving on whether we're really alive or not and 2.) reproduction can be beautiful and it's all around us. Think about *that* the next time your car is covered with pollen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ecology 101","review":"I can see how Kingsolver's Ecology 101 course wrapped up in novel could be as thrilling as Atlas Shrugged to people for whom these ideas are brand spanking new. Already knowing this stuff made Prodigal Summer seem like a lot of heavy handed moralizing. I like Kingsolver, and appreciate what she tries to do with her writing. Well, I used to like Kingsolver, and what she tried to do with her writing. This book is just her thesis on ecology -- and what a hackneyed, cliche-wridden, at times misleading and downright inaccurate it is. I've had it with Kingsolver, and that's after loving some of her earlier works."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with \\"preachy\\"","review":"I am a Kingsolver fan from way back but I found this book annoying. She climbed up on her soapbox on the first page and never got down. I felt like the book was nothing more than her personal views on women and the environment poorly disguised as fiction.I must add that the whole Deanna/Eddie Bondo relationship was rediculous. We are supposed to believe that this forty-something woman is so out of touch with civilization that she never looks in a mirror (nor bathes, that I could tell) or listens to the radio. Yet she is wildly attractive to a 28 year old \\"Adonis\\". I don't think so.Being an environmentalist too, I appreciate Kingsolver's attempt to be an advocate through her medium. However, I'm looking for something else (like a real story) in my leisure time reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"get it? WHACK? Okay, how about now?","review":"As a reader who loved the Poisonwood Bible, I was very disappointed by this book.Altough I agree with the messages in the book, I found it to be preachy and heavyhanded. I agree with other reviewers who found the characters shallow and the writing simple. As for the romantic moments in the story--bizzarre, and not in a good way.My impression of this book was that it was written quicky to fulfill a contract, or written early in the writer's career and shoved in a drawer until it was dusted off to ride on the success of the Poisonwood Bible. It certainly is a contrast to that book, which seemed to have alot of time, research and thought behind it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want a refund!","review":"As someone who has enjoyed all of Barbara Kingsolver's previous works, I was terribly disappointed with this novel. It was pulp romance meets Greenpeace, and if forest-service shirts were lace-ups, I would call it a bodice-ripper. The plot was predictable, the sex was smarmy, the relationships were sentimental, and the environmentalism was pedantic. The worst of all worlds. Kingsolver has always tended to fall into sentamentalism, but other aspects of her books have always made her novels worthwhile. This was just embarrassing.Next time she publishes a book, I'll get it from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"15 hours of pure pleasure","review":"I was given this book as a get well gift and it did its job in lifting my spirits. This is my first book by Barbara Kingsolver and I truly enjoyed following the three different stories of Appalachia: \\"predator\\"--tells the story of a woman forest ranger who lives alone but is touched by love one summer, moth love--of a \\"bug scientist\\" who experiences loss but finds unexpectedly a new life and \\"old chestnuts\\" of an 80 year old crotchedy old man dedicated to a solitary life growing a blight free chestnut tree. I hesitate to write more detail on these stories for fear of spoiling them for you. All stories start independently but happen in the same valley and eventually do touch each other. The prose was gorgeous and it really made me think about how connected we are to one another in a big ecosystem and the tragic consequences of upsetting nature's balance. Save this as a treat for yourself. The audio version will make a long car trip or a daily commute a real pleasure"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Favorite","review":"I was disappointed in this story. Poisonwood Bible is a favorite of mine so I was looking forward to Prodigal Summer. I liked some of it but most of it I found annoying. Are only females allowed to be the strong ones? The men in the story seemed evil, weak or dead. Mostly they followed the scent of a woman like animals without any ideas of a relationship or love."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit like a roller coster","review":"I am a huge Barbra Kingsolver fan, she is truly a magical writer. But I am at a loss of words about this novel. At times it is brillant, other times it slow. She spends a little too much time on developing stituations that tend to go no where. I think she was really trying to pursuade the reader to take a careful look at out how we are destroying our ecosystem. At times, it gets a little to 'environment' for my taste. I gave the book a solid 4 stars because it is a great read, but it is not her best work. I my opinion, the posion wood bible is still her best novel ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadful","review":"Undoubtedly the worst book I've ever had to read. It was a selection for our book club, which forced me to slog through the empty characters, soap-box sermons and simplistic morality of this mess. It is also the most \\"man-hating\\" book I've ever read. Eddie (hunky mountain man) might as well be a sperm donor--no romance here, if that's really what you're looking for. If you like turgid, over-written storytelling and firmly believe that men are idiots and women are the only humans who have insight or worth, this book is for you. Personally, I will never read another book by Barbara Kingsolver. This was punishment enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this book!","review":"This is my favorite book and I have read it twice. I never want it to end and would like Barbara Kingsolver to re-visit these charecters again. I have read and enjoyed all of Ms. Kingsolver's books but this one is not just my favorite book of hers but it is my all time favorite book."},{"rating":"1","title":"loved the book but the electronic (kindle) version had too many errors","review":"Barbara Kingsolver is a wonderful author and Prodigal Summer doesn't fail to enchant, but the Kindle version has too many errors (misspelled words, sentences that don't make sense because of missing words) that shouldn't be there given the price of the book. Amazon needs to look into quality control. I love all the advantages of my Kindle and use it all the time, but I'm getting very tired of books missing random chapter headings, goofed up punctuation, etc. I'm forgiving if the book is inexpensive, but $9.99 and above -- no way! The electronic versions of books that we buy from Amazon should be as carefully edited as the paper versions. Amazon, it's time to hold the publishers' feet to the fire!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite possibly my new favorite book.","review":"I must admit that i'm a little sad the story ended. I truly wish there was another chapter, another book coming out or something to finish the questions that I still have and want to know about what happens next. What an amazing story and the language and words are just so eloquently written. I truly love Barbara Kingsolver and I have pretty much her entire collection of books."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"Great writing. Kept me interested from page 1, though I wish she wrapped it up a little more at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Prodigal summer brings up some very contemporary issues within the environment. The scenes of nature are all so vividly written that you feel you are there. Some of the words describing botanic and scientific things are way above my level and Kindle dictionaries could not define them. The emotions seemed very real. Thanks Barbara!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this book","review":"This book drew me in with the very first page. It is a wonderfully written book and I couldn't put it down. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interconnectedness","review":"Barbara Kingsolver NEVER, EVER disappoints. Her latest, \\"Prodigal Summer\\" is a compelling page-turner about the fundamental interconnectedness of all things. There are three main character: young woman Lusa, Middle-aged woman Deanna and old man Garnett who, of course, become interconnected by the end of this tale.Bugs are the last subject that I would expect to find interesting...but at the hands of Ms. Kingsolver, even bugs become fascinating - even sexy!The only problem with finishing a Barbara Kingsolver book is having to wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy","review":"Kingsolver has gotten more and more preachy with each book, and finally crossed the limit for me with this one. She also implied that all women are in touch with the earth and are trying to save the planet, while all men are scum and trying to destroy it. The characters and the plot were predictable. Give this one a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Harlequin Romance for the Organic Gardener","review":"Thin plot and flat characters. I think the author forgot to develope the characters, choosing to spew the \\"organic\\" and \\"naturalist\\" religion instead. I myself am a firm organic gardener, but I don't think I could have stood another flowery passage describing the importance of bugs and the concepts of predation. The editor failed to do his/her job allowing lengthy descriptions like a garden as having peppers with bright green and red ornaments and eggplants with beautiful purple gifts. (My organic garden certainly doesn't look that way.) The plot seemed like a junior highschool kid's dream of a perfect world in which folks who don't harm nature end up on top. The strings which tie the three stories together are contrived -- they seem to have been added as an afterthought.I thought I was a Kingsolver fan after reading Poisonwood Bible, but this book certainly changed my mind on that."},{"rating":"1","title":"9th grade biology","review":"Okay. I get the message: don't kill predators because they, like all of us, belong to a grand plan. We hear this from Deanna WOLF, from Nannie (Goat?), from Lusa, from Barbara K. herself. I kept reading because I thought we'd get to some literary denoument somehow...WRONG. It's no Poisonwood Bible. Lotsa moths, some gratuitous but procreative sex, a few coyotes, and birds that eat moths before getting eaten by snakes. Darwin would be proud. This English teacher is not...it's not a new chestnut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Sad to have a writer I have liked so much (Animal Dreams, Pigs in Heaven) go downhill so badly. Her simplistic, pedantic and repetitive preaching about the environment, combined with flat, predictable characters (except for the old guy with the chestnut trees) made for a very disappointing read. And the hormonal coupling only added tedium. I suffered through to the end just to verify the really obvious conclusions. What happened to in-depth character development and a unique, demanding story line that requires readers to develop their own ideas and reach their own conclusions? Too bad... but at least I have a new Alice Hoffman book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story idea that grows repetitious.","review":"I was disappointed in this book because it didn't deliver what it promised. I'm interested in her topics: ecology, the plight of the small American farmer and wildlife. However, the story doesn't develop very well. Kingslover is too long-winded, wordy with long descriptions that are not particularly scholarly or informative; consequently, the book becomes one long serman. Plus the characters are not developed enough to be real. My advice is skip this one. My question is what happened to that wonderful writer who gave us \\"Pigs in Heaven\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Sad and Let-Down","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's \\"Prodigal Summer\\" was highly anticipated by me, and those around me, but sadly, it didn't live up to my high hopes. I was a huge fan of her previous work \\"The Poisionwood Bible\\" and was looking forward to a huge, and absorbing novel that I really had to work at. But, I just found this book lacking in so many areas. I could never relate or find anything remotly interesting. I was really letdown and felt like I had wasted my money. Try \\"Poisionwood\\" instead! It's much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful accomplishment.","review":"To all the praise that has already been given to this remarkable book, I can only add a profoundly heartfelt \\"Thank you!\\" to Barbara Kingsolver.

It blew so many accepted theories out of the water: What makes a meaningful relationship? What do we really know about the animals we so blatantly kill? What do pesticides really accomplish...are they really necessary? Can a woman with enough determination and intelligence achieve success in a field of endeavor she was not trained for? The story of the young mother who was dying of cancer and her relationships with her in-laws had several queries to contemplate...one of which would be to avoid judging others without a pretty a very good knowledge of their personal circumstances. While subtly posing these questions, she told a story full of surprises, intrigue, humor and delight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kingsolver best of our time","review":"Prodigal Summer is an all time favorite.

I read the book awhile ago so I could tell what was missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining & educational","review":"Very interesting way to discuss ecology and mans role in nature. Part of the story was too close to a romance style for my taste, but I still found it to be a good read overall. Characters were engaging and well developed and yet mysterious at the same time. At the end of the book I wanted to know more about their lives, which for me is a sign of a well written novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book that Anyone in Appalachia Can Appreciate","review":"A great way of winding three separate stories together in a fictitious county in the Appalachian region of Virginia. Kingsolver also does a wonderful job of explaining the balance of ecology in this region and parallels it to residents' stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"ENDS ABRUPTLY","review":"Too many novelists watch the word count too closely. When they reach their target word count they end the novel as quickly as possible. In this novel Ms Kingsolver does that in spades and if I had known that before purchasing it would not have been bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nature romance lacks originality","review":"My first Kingsolver novel ... expected much more than formulaic prose where we 1) meet experts of a certain field who 2) confront enemies 3) who conquer and divide quite easily, etc. The book was predictable, and the characters were cliche-ish. The women had the expected traits of feminine heroism, yet with sensitivity towards all life forms. I barely made it through this book. I love nature writing, yet this was overstated, hardly philosophical, except in a very cliche-ish overstated way. The minor characters, the townspeople, were very one-dimensional, portrayed very narrowly, not a complex group at all. The major characters were differentiated from them in a superficial way. If you want to read a much better book which explores themes within nature read \\"Pilgrim at Tinker Creek\\" by Annie Dillard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I am a new reader of Ms. Kingsolver, I just never thought I would enjoy her books. But thankfully, someone suggested to my sister that we would enjoy them so I went back and read her earlier books and was so glad that at the time I finished them her new book was just coming out. Not only do I surround myself with her words, read and read passages just to savor them, but I enjoy the characters, even the ones I don't particularly like. And of course, I always learn something about a subject I didn't even realize I would enjoy learning about. Ms. Kingsolver is a wonderful writer, read this book, and if you haven't read her others, read those too. I envy anyone the experience of reading her books for the first time. I wonder how it will be when I go back and reread them, because I'm sure I will!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entwines fictional characters with info on the laws ofnature","review":"This book, like others by Barbara Kingsolver, started a bit slow for me, but by the end I was devouring it. It is actually 3 stories in one: the independent naturalist who finds romance where she doesn't want it, the suddenly widowed Lusa who finds strength in herself, and the cantankerous old man who finds friendship where he least expects it. I was at first disappointed when I realized that the characters were not actually going to interact with each other, but through various circumstances it all comes together at the end.I THINK THIS SHOULD BE A MUST-READ FOR ALL STUDENTS OF BIOLOGY. Each of the 3 parts of this book has more information about the laws of nature than I learned in college, yet it is woven so intricately into the story that you are left wanting to get outside into the hills without knowing why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the ending: read it for the joy of the journey!","review":"Don't read this book to find out how it ends. Read it for the pure enjoyment of reading. One thing I love about Barbara Kingsolver's books is that I can relate to her main characters' solitude of mind and intellect. Love blossoms from loneliness. Hope blossoms from striving day to day. You'll find yourself yearning for the love interests of the two main characters as if they were your own. The book has a certain harmony to it much like the harmony of life: things are often left unresolved, people cope in the face of unexpected change, and nature continues oblivious to what's going on in my own little piece of life. When I finished reading this book last year, I was disgusted with the ending. But, a year later, I look back and realize that the book could have ended no other way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Language and Weaving of a Story","review":"I have been a fan of Barbara Kingsolver ever since I stumbled across her book \\"The Bean Trees\\" in the public library when I was about 15. This book is certainly as amazing as any of her other work I have read.What I was immediately struck by was the amazing use of language that Kingsolver has. Her masterful use of words slows you down and you want to save them. There is something sexy about the way she describes nature.Not only is the use of words wonderful, but the writing is clever. Kingsolver uses nature as a backdrop to compare and contrast the various relationships she has created; the various narrators that she uses.I also enjoyed that we, the readers, know more about the characters than they do. She leaves the characters with their futures waiting and while I would love to know more about them, I was still satisifed with the end.Terrific Read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agenda driven","review":"In this book Kingsolver hits you over the head with one agenda or another. I was given this book to read because I told a friend I didn't think Kinsolver liked men. This book didn't prove me wrong. None of the women needed the men in their lives. They were almost entirely attracted to men for sex. If I were a man I would find this book insulting and demeaning. The preachiness of the book totally interferred with any story she was trying to tell. But I don't think she was trying to tell a story, I think she wanted to preach."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"After I read and loved Poisonwood, I was anxious to read another Barbara Kingsolver book. This choice was a huge mistake. I listened to the audio version and while Barbara Kingsolver did a good job with the narration, more often than not, it lulled me to sleep. It should have been subtitled: Ecology 101! The chapters involving Luca were the only ones I truly enjoyed. About one third of the way through the book, I just started to skip the chapters about Deanna -- enough is enough with the preachiness -- I was totally bored with her and didn't care a bit what happened to her. It would have been more exciting if the coyotes attacked her!I felt that I was left hanging regarding what happened with the children and Garnett. At least that storyline had potential. This book may have been much more interesting if it were about 300 pages shorter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't stand it","review":"This is the first book I have tried to read by Kingsolver, and I couldn't finish it. The first 100 pages (as far as I could get) read like a romance novel, with all the smelling of pheromones and aching pubic bones. I just couldn't stand it. This is a character driven novel, and I did not like any of the characters. For a story about a woman's sense of place (and insects, for that matter), I liked Margaret Drabble'sThe Peppered Motha whole lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"The book was slow, the stories did not meld together, and for a book about naturalists, I found no new or interesting information. Although the people had professions in the field the information provides was boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL ROMANCE NOVEL","review":"If you expect a witty, funny, interesting or anything along the lines of Kingsolver's prior novels, this book is not for you.If you expect Jackie Collins Romance with a far fetched story line about the classic city girl vs. country boy, then THIS IS YOUR BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my the misery!!!","review":"This book is long, boring and way too verbose!! I read this book for my bookclub and it was torture. I would skip pages, where the author went on and on and on...way too verbose.This one's worth skipping!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"?????????","review":"This was by far, the worst book I have ever read. If there was a way to give it negative stars, I would have. I would not even recommend loaning this for free from the library, its not worth the gas money and the possibility of a late fee, don't bother! If you are politically liberal, then perhaps you might find something to like about this book, but for the rest of us it was a thinly veiled, poorly written, rambling sermon of opinions by the author. I don't ordinarily write reviews, but this book was truly that awful. I did read to the end because I couldn't believe that a published book could be this bad, I thought and hoped (I did spend $9.99 on this!) that there has to be something about the ending.....there isn't. I feel like the author should have paid me to read this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This is a beautiful book. It emphasizes that all things are connected both in nature and human relationships. Even the smallest act can have an immense impact on others. I read this book in early Spring and it was a wonderful start to the season. It was a constant reminder to be aware of all the beautiful changes happening outside as well as a reminder to cherish the relationships in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Great story. Fabulous writing. Couldn't ask for more. Always loved Barbra Kingsolver and this book doesn't disappoint. I would recommend this to all fans of literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing after Poisonwood Bible","review":"I really wanted to like this book. Her descriptions of nature were great. But to me it seemed that her words were merged with the words of a trashy dime store romance. \\"Cole made love like a farmer...he had a fine intelligence that drove him toward earthy scents, seeking out with his furred mouth, her soft, damp places, turning her like fresh earth toward the glory of new growth. Her body,...became something new in the embrace of a man who judged breeding animals with his hands...\\" I did not find the characters behaved in ways consistant with what an actual person would. To live alone for several years in the forrest, meet someone alone in the woods, barely know their name, and then fall into bed with them, is beyond belief. A good story is ruined by badly written sex scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictability","review":"As soon as I got past the first few chapters (which I enjoyed) I realized this was no match for Poisonwood Bible. While it sets a steamy mood--with sex and the climate--the predictability sets in and the characters get boring. After a while nobody and no situation seemed real. The characters were all unidimensional. The sweet smart environmentalists (and I am one!) and the otherwise nice but sadly deluded \\"others\\". Some of the dialog sounded like it came off a campaign flyer or a Darwin special on PBS. A sadly disappointing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waving the white flag!","review":"OK, OK, I get it already. Everything is connected, everything is dependent. Over and over I get it. Maybe I am being too harsh..I am just saying..the message was repetetive. I felt the only reason for changing characters was to deliver the message again. I listened to this book on tape and found myself zoning out a little, so I can't imagine reading the book. I did learn a few things, but feel a little beat over the head."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 ** audio, but 5 ***** reading it yourself","review":"This is my favourite book of all time. I am an avid reader and I have read this book three times. I have not read any other book twice, even. A friend referred me to a link of the audiobook and I cringed.If you do not absolutely need to listen to it, please read it. It makes the world of difference.The voice does not go with the contents because it is too shallow, too young (sounding), too monotonous. My friend, also an avid reader, forced herself to listen to the entire audio version but she said she almost fell asleep a few times.Such a shame, that a fabulous book like this has been voiced as it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bridges of Madison County Meets Farmers' Almanac","review":"What the heck happened? I bought this in hardcover the minute I heard about it: I am crazy about almost all of Kingsolver's books, \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" most of all. I knew it wasn't a good sign when the primary love interest's name was \\"Eddie Bondo,\\" but there is enough about moth sex (yes, you read that right) and the phallic resemblance of flowers to make Kingsolver sound like the Hugh Hefner of the forest floor. Problem is, there's not much else to this book: the dialogue is hackneyed and predictable, and the plot line is entirely uncompelling. If you have never read Kingsolver, this review is a plea not to begin here. If you have, all I can say is: proceed at your own risk. I personally regret reading a work that has so profoundly compromised my love for this author's stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Setting, Fascinating Characters","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this Kingsolver novel. The lush setting was so wonderfully described, as were the farms and the problems the farmers faced. The characters were well-developed, from the youngest to the oldest, and there was more humor than I usually find in a Kingsolver book. The lives and problems and conflicts were all intertwined, as is everything in the physical world. Kingsolver's sentences are beautiful, her chapters well-constructed. There is, however, a slight overtone of lecturing or preachiness in this book. It's slight, but it's there, and each time I encountered it, my feeling that I was within the world of the characters was disrupted: I came out of the story and into the real world. I do, however, highly recommend this book: in reading it, you enter another world, of present-day people who live close to the land and are attuned to it in ways that most of us are not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Mountain Story","review":"Kingsolver's book has been added to my bookshelf alongside my other mountain favorites -- The Man Who Moved a Mountain; Cold Mountain; Orlean Puckett: The Life of a Mountain Midwife; and My Old True Love. Prodigal Summer gives a picture of the wonderful and sometimes complicated life of the mountain people. This book educated me on nature, survival, and how the cycle of life affects plants, animals, and all living creatures. It was an easy and enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"is this the same person who wrote the poisonwood bible?","review":"I've loved Kingsolver's work for years... Animal Dreams and The Poisonwood Bible really struck me with their rich language and beautiful passages.Prodigal Summer, on the other hand... ugh. I only got about ten pages in and had to quit. I am biased; I'll admit that. Intensive nature descriptions bore me to tears. I love the outdoors, but I'd rather go outside and look at a tree than read about one. Therefore, I was sent into blahsville reading the nature prose. The dialogue also felt awkward and I was given the uneasy feeling i had stumbled into some kind of nature/cheesy romance story. So I stopped reading.I would suggest you read any of Kingsolver's other novels. If you want fun read The Bean Trees, if you want serious and enriching read The Poisonwood Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Poisonwood Bible,\\" however I found this book disappointingly formulaic. Similar to another reviewer, I predicted all the outcomes of the book because they were so blatantly obvious. Characters, events, and dialog were far too precious. It's always nice to learn something new but the presentation of ecological lessons and our place on the earth in this novel was so preachy that I wanted to throw the book in the dustbin. All in all, it's a decent read but anyone expecting a book as good as any of her earlier ones will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After devouring Poisonwood Bible, I was so excited to see this new novel appear. It was a great disappointment. It is very disjointed, not affording full character development. I did learn quite a bit about insects, but that was not my purpose in purchasing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Kingsolver's usual standards","review":"Barbara Kingsolver is one of my favorite authors, but this book is proof that even the most talented author can write a mediocre book once in a while. If you are new to Kingsolver, read another one of her books first. This one is not her best effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are no words","review":"There's no reason to analyze this book. I can just say, simply, this book is exquisite. Read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prodigal Summer","review":"I enjoyed the beginning, which is well written and draws you in. At about a quarter of the way though Kingsolver starts showing her bias. Excuse me if you are a fan of hers, I knew nothing of her work when I started, but what was written on the cover. At about a third of the way through I quit the book deciding I owed it no more time and was no longer enjoying myself.Kingsolver's bias were women, environmentalists, nonsmokers, nonchristian, organic farming and other similar causes joining what we would have in her idealistic world. The problem was the complete lack of sympathy for opposing views left a very unrealistic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audiobook edition","review":"I'm a huge Kingsolver fan (though didn't love \\"Poisonwood Bible\\"), and found this one truly lyrical. If you like audiobooks at all, this is one to listen to, especially as it is read by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't engage me","review":"I got about halfway through this novel before I gave up on it. While I appreciate the setting (the mountains of North Carolina) and the themes (what is man's relationship to nature? how do we steward the earth while looking after our own needs?), I could not relate to any of the characters, and I disliked the dynamic of male vs. female, destroyer vs. nurturer that was being set up. I definitely didn't find this novel as engaging as either The Poisonwood Bible or Animal, Vegetable, Miracle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensual and compelling","review":"This audio book, read beautifully by the author, is compelling, poetic and sensual. It's a book of the senses, where we hear the katydids harsh and over-loud in the summer night, and feel the humid heat of a time of procreative fullness. The language of the place and the characters lends a rhythm to the whole, which Kingsolver's reading does justice to. The three main stories, interwoven by characters as well as theme, are complex and memorable, and she has brought us the sense of isolation and also community that all of us suffer from. A fascinating and enviable accomplishment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Preachy","review":"I have to admit that I didn't finish this book. The preachy nature of it and her constant pounding of the issues became too much to take. I read for fun and relaxation, not to be hit over the head with the author's political agenda. I actually threw this book in the trash 1/3 of the way through it. I guess if I were a liberal I'd have loved it. Oh well..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to be read outdoors","review":"In \\"Prodigal Summer\\" Barbara Kingsolver gives us three very readable storylines that tangentially intersect. As a analytic reader, I immediately went about trying to figure out the connections between the characters and storylines.About a third of the way through the book, I spent a few hours outside reading on a nice day. That when it hit me that the power of this book isn't in the characters or the storylines, it is in the storytelling. I found myself more absorbed by the natural world around me. Suddenly I wanted to know the names of trees, and flowers, and even insects (thanks to Lusa).At the end, the storylines all wind up about step before where I saw them finishing, but that might just be a matter of taste. Some folks might like a little mystery and imagination to play a part in the ending of a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening","review":"I must admit I almost stopped reading this book. I have read 3 of her other novels and loved them - especially Pigs in Heaven and the Bean Trees. The plot was not grabbing me, but I rarely stop reading a book before I finish it and I'm glad I finished this one. Not until the end do you realize that plot isn't everything - in this case, theme is - the fact that everything in nature is connected, that nothing is, including humans, solitary. Being a big city girl, I loved all the interesting biological and environmental facts in the book. However, I don't think this book would appeal to everyone. ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I am amazed that i just discovered this author by reading Flight Behavior. Her female characters are amazing and very simpatico. Love the reverence for nature and animals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I crazy? I just don&#65533;t get it.","review":"I have read all of Barbara Kingsolver's books and her best have changed my life. She makes it look easy. Unfortunately, this book grated on my nerves like a sermon that wouldn't quit. I didn't like any of the characters, except maybe Lusa Landowski. All of them were basically two-dimensional megaphones for the message of saving the environment. I believe wholeheartedly about saving the environment, but every page seemed like an onslaught of lecturing. In between the lectures, the characters were minutely developed, and the storylines seemed to hanging together by a thread. The title of this book should have been Preaching to the Converted. For a great and moving story, with political undertones, read Kingsolver's Animal Dreams. She can do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Preachy","review":"Since \\"Poisonwood\\" was the only book by Kingsolver that I had read, was really looking forward to this one. Very disappointing, however. I felt like a 4 year old being given a lesson on ecology. The characters in the book were wonderfully drawn and I was very interested in the complexities of their lives, but the lecture on almost every page about conservation was a little annoying. A little goes a long way, especially if your audience is already pretty well versed in the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, I get it. Every day is earth day.","review":"I love Kingsolver's writing, and I do believe that every writer should be passionate about their message, but this one just sent me over the top. I felt like I was in Sunday School for litterbugs -- the ongoing lectures about nature and conservation and biology lessons -- enough already! Not to mention I could not relate to any of the characters, least of all Deanna with her love of Coyotes and her hatred of humans. I kept reading and waiting for it to get better. I'm not sure it did.I try to remember that every novel cannot be stunning. Even the best among us writes a mediocre piece from time to time. This one is definitely forgivable coming from such a talented writer as Kingsolver, but I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not specific enough","review":"I didn't find this book very helpful.

However there was nothing in here that could not be found in more enjoyable publications. The reading was dry and the book was easily put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic Thoughts","review":"The book seemed to me to be almost condescending and patronizing adding little to no significant information that would effectively aid anyone who might somehow find Him or Herself in a D/s relationship nor does it offer any assistance for those who might be confronted with a partner whom may wish to experience a D/s dynamic. Much more could have and should have been done with this book. Hardly worth the time to either write it or read it and hardly worth the effort to write it or read it and not worth the purchase price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good primer, little else","review":"I think this book is good for someone S/M curious, but afraid to make the first step towards the lifestyle. It gives you a general feel for the philosophy behind S/M and D/s, and makes you feel that you are ok and safe if you want to explore these types of feelings. I found it a little too Pollyanna and politically correct for my taste, which is why I would recommend it to beginners only. It is true that it is geared towards gay leather crowds, but it is imformative for that reason if you know little about the gay Top/bottom lifestyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy doesn't have a clue","review":"If you are looking for information or pleasure reading on the subject of BDSM, don't go anywhere near this author. The 'author', jack rinella, seems to have a very limited understanding of BDSM. It appears that he uses these barely literate books of his as some sort of slurred, unintelligible series of pickup lines. There is a distinct void of information in these books, quite likely because this \`author' doesn't have a clue about BDSM. He seems to view himself as some sort of player and blathers on incessantly about himself, but never approaches an understanding of the topic of BDSM.This book is horrid. So is his other rambling book of ghastly grammar, misspellings and run-on sentences..

Largely unknown in the English-speaking world, Sesto is a mega-star with a voice well suited to the stage.His lyrics are all about women and the love they inspire, reject, nourish, and protect. Rich orchestrations back up a strong, supple, capable voice. In the Spanish-speaking world now middle-aged people often locate formative experiences in their young lives by pegging them to a Sesto song the was current at the time, much as might happen among English speakers via the music of the Eagles or, say, Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young.

The bubble machine broke off less than two minutes after we turned it on. This turned out to be a good thing because, as we saw when the kids started sliding, it sits right in the center of the volcano - directly where the kids' heads hit when they reach the end of the slide. It's a large HARD plastic machine and would have REALLY hurt the kids if we hadn't had to remove it. The slide was fun without it, though. By the end of an hour, the volcano was completely obliterated (which was fine because it's not necessary for the water to work). It lasted for several hours, but then the seams started ripping. We duct-taped them, but the minute the tubes filled up completely they would burst again. If this product was priced at about $10 it would be worth it. It's way too cheaply made to pay $40.

Yeah it is cute but looks can be, and this case, ARE deceiving. The nose is hard to push even for me so of course my baby cannot operate it. It bounces and laughs for a few mere seconds. It is really loud which is OK except it plays the same thing every other time for a few seconds. It is very durable. I have tossed it around and it stayed in one piece. Definitely not worth buying. I would not even donate this. That is my two cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy Cow","review":"I'm sure this toy is great for some, but it is so loud and obnoxious and really creepy!

Both of them got tired of this toy in 2 minutes. The nose is actually a little too hard for them to push as well. For us it was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for kids, irritating for parents","review":"As others reviewers have mentioned, pushing this toy's \\"nose\\" button is next to impossible for a child of an age to be entertained by it. Added to its very short play cycle, this can drive a parent to drink - especially if she would rather not listen to the loud, crazy music that close up. My 2 year old got it for his 1st birthday. He's always found it entertaining - and his 5 month old sister also seems to get a kick out of it- but I often keep it hidden to avoid being endlessly prevailed upon to start it up for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some tracks ok, but nothing of much value for a true Hip-Hop Fan.","review":"I dig a couple tracks on this album but There is only 1 that has a fantastic beat and thats \\"My Phone\\".The Lyrics are bland and lack any sort of real meaning or texture.

I learned all about the different kinds of fat and why my body needs some and doesn't need others and what foods have the best (or worst) sources. The book is not just about fat either. It is about nutrition; eating nutrient dense foods (getting the most bang out of what you eat). So you can nourish your body while shedding pounds. And if you don't need to lose weight (maybe you need to gain a few) or if you just need to get healthy, this book is also for you as it is loaded with advice and menus and recipes for foods that will nourish and strengthen your body. The down side is that the foods you learn to prepare are not your normal fare. You really have to want to be healthy in order to learn how to eat and cook healthy. If you are not motivated, you will quit.

They are very sturdy and well designed. The bike is roughly 50% assembled out of the box and final assembly was a snap in 15 minutes. The only tools required were a few sockets and a wrench to attach the front wheel, training wheels, pedals, hand brake and handle bars. The training wheels work very well. As the bike is only a 16 incher, when the kids do fall off of the bike after removing the training wheels, it's not a long drop. Though well packaged, expect some paint to get scraped off during shipping. As usual with imported bikes, you have a 50/50 chance of getting a leaky tire inner tube, and these were no exception (easily repaired with a patch kit). The bikes DO NOT come with reflectors. Reflectors are an optional item and you'll have to purchase them seperately (less than $5 at any local department store). Overall, they are an excellent value and the kids love the Star Wars graphics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced-WOW What a writer!","review":"There is a lot of sex and violence.

The device also shut off on its own every so often for no particular reason. There is a small antenna that must be attached in order to use the FM tuner. That is not a big deal, but reception was still terrible. On top of the unit's malfunctions the \\"one size fits all\\" design is very uncomfortable. The headset it not adjustable and does not fit comfortably. The concept is great, but the design and function of this particular headset are terrible.

Yes, Frank Sinatra's performance was quite good and the lyrics were poignant. However, I found it hard to connect to the lyrics and the feelings that Sinatra was trying to relate because of the dryness of the music. There have been many sad songs written which were far superior musically to anything here.

I've never needed to take off the top to fit garbage too big for the hole but you can if needed. If you do get a leak in a bag you can wash the plastic inside bottom. It holds some water between the inside and outside so I had to turn it upside down at a tilt for the day to completely dry it out again, but that's a minor inconvenience.

That is my only complaint - not enough of Jennifer's beautiful voice and great writing!! I would DEFINITELY recommend you add this album to your collection, it is a great purchase. You will remember these songs for years to come. This is one of those albums that you'll play a long time from now, and it will still sound great. Personal faves - Usher Me Down, All Consuming Fire, and Peace. One of my favorite CD's, a must-buy for Christian and acoustic music enthusiasts!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Add this CD to the must have list","review":"Jennifer Knapp came with a really big recommendation in my book, she's been touring with one of the better rock acts out there (Third Day.) That was enough to get me to give a listen. With this CD she just blew me away. She has a sound and a lyrical content that I can really identify with. When she sings \\"Relieve me from myself/Bring me into you\\" she spoke to me in a way that I think many Christians can identify with. Whether it's rockin' out or mellow acoustic stuff she does it all well. Add to that a strong Christian message and her music just can't be beat. Thank you Jennifer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Will Grow on You","review":"\\"Lay it Down\\" isn't one of those CDs where you pop it in and the first time you hear it, you love it. In fact, if you've already become a Jennifer Knapp fan because of \\"Kansas,\\" you might be really disappointed by this CD...at first. Jennifer excels at folk/rock type music, and on this CD there are several tracks that step out of that genre...and it takes some getting used to. The lyrics are also less straightforward than they were on \\"Kansas.\\" The best way of describing the difference is that \\"Kansas\\" was a photograph, and \\"Lay it Down\\" is an impressionistic painting. \\"Kansas\\" is more tangible and easily perceived, but there is also a richness in the ambiguity of \\"Lay it Down.\\" So if you like Jennifer, you'll like \\"Lay it Down,\\" but just don't expect another trip to \\"Kansas.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great follow-up to Kansas","review":"In a year of excellent albums, Jennifer Knapp's Kansas quickly became my favorite a few years back. Now, with Lay It Down, Knapp continues her dominance of the songwriting field. Her lyrics match the music very well, and are a little more laid back than in Kansas. My only regret is that the album lacked the stylistic variety of her previous effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"i do love jennifer knapp and this cd is great! my favorite song is lay it down. however it was much easier to listen to kansas. i loved all of the songs on that album and it spoke to me. if you are looking for a great cd to listen to, her other one is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The more you listen.....","review":"At first listen, I was a little disappointed. I didn't think it was as spiritually deep, and I still don't. The problem is that Kansas was a masterpiece, and very hard to follow up. When I listen to this CD and see the number of people who are embracing her work and hearing the Word at the same time, I am inspired and it makes this CD all the more important. The music is stronger on this CD. Lets hope her success doesn't go to her head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Kansas.","review":"I think she put out an even finer album this time around.

They are all great."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll never lay down--Lay It Down!","review":"Well, what can I say Jen? You've done it a gain! Jen's sophomore album definitely builds on the extreme sound of the first. Her lyrics reflect her love of God and her songs are an awesome witness. Her acoustic-rock sound and her raw earthy voice makes her music truthful and from the heart. Her repeats and vocal dips give the cd the KNAPP touch. You'll be behind in the times if you don't get this cd. PERIOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"just as good as (if not better than) Kansas","review":"I didn't think there was any possible way to beat her first release \\"Kansas\\", but I was also proven wrong. I don't think I can pick a favorite out of the two. They are very different, but still just as good as the other. I tried to pick a favorite song off this cd, but I have six favorites out of the ten. And the other four are still great songs too. Once again, her songwriting will leave you amazed. She has such a way with her words. Here's one of my favorite examples from this cd... from the song \\"Usher Me Down\\" ---who could replace You/none I know of/the throne is Yours alone/left to stand unshaken/can't be taken back/can't be taken back --- So, once again, Jennifer Knapp doesn't disappoint. I highly recommend this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as Good as Kansas, but a Good Sophomore Effort","review":"There are some great high moments on this record, \\"Peace\\" is definitely one of them. But my favorite track from this album is \\"Diamond in the Rough.\\" The music is wonderful, there is either a banjo or mandolin accompanying some really nice guitar work. That song is the best song on this record. The lyrics of this album kind of fell flat for me. The music seems to be moving away from the Christian themes that dominated Jennifer Knapp's previous release and more toward humanistic failings. This album was much less inspirational for me, but more about falling and be insecure in your faith. From a Christian perspective it wasn't very uplifting for me. It was almost like an album that fits between faith and doubt, but I did enjoy songs like a \\"Little More,\\" \\"All Consuming Fire,\\" and \\"When Nothing Satisfies.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful sound & Honest lyrics","review":"I love this CD. Jennifer Knapp continues to amaze me with her soulful sound and honest lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Kansas","review":"This is a good CD, but I was initially not very impressed. This may be a result of the fact that I expected too much because Kansas (Jennifer Knapp's first CD) was so good. Although this is still a very good CD, it doesn't match Kansas for lasting play time. There are a couple of very good songs, like \\"A Little More\\" and \\"Diamond in the Rough\\" but overall the CD is probably just good. I just did not hear the same passion that I heard on Kansas. I gave it 4 stars because I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt. I assume I had too high of expectations following Kansas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short And Snappy ....","review":"One of the shorter albums I've got, but that's the only genuine fault with the follow-up to \\"Kansas\\". The music has flow and rythm, it's no better or worse than her last release, it's got a lyrical edge over most other CCM and secular artists, and most of all, it's enhancing the potential that Christian music has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad commentary","review":"Isn't it sad the lengths that a hate-filled zealot will go to - polluting a forum such as this - to put across opinions unrelated to the business at hand, which is discussing the art of Jennifer Knapp. She is a talented singer/songwriter who pours her heart and soul into her music.

His language tends to play against conventional ideas while his words and style are blunt and though provoking; and example of this is his poem Desire, he says, \\"fire is a bad rhyme and a good remedy for desire\\". Rain is definitely a book I would recommend to a friend who loves great descriptive language. Awesome all around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rain: ideational diversity and poetic self-awareness","review":"In his volume Rain, Henry Carlile covers a wide swath of ideational ground, such as the trajectories of loss qua death and divorce, the ideological nuances of camouflage and \\"why poets write so much about death and... not jut go fishing instead\\" with unfailing attention the his craft. His poems exhibit an impressive understanding of the conventions of poetry, and in certain cases they actually gain momentum through a reversal of said conventions, such as in \\"Desire\\" where Carlile turns the usual fire/desire trope on its head, then all but looks up and laughs: \\"In one of the meditation\\" writes Carlile \\"you have to imagine / the object of your desire as her face blisters / and falls apart... You meditate on that, you think of fire. / Fire is a bad rhyme and a good remedy for desire.\\" A similar, though usually less blatant, poetic self-awareness pervades much of the volume.

Probably the second time I went to use this the button in the cover is not pushing hard enough on the button in the base. If I use a pick to press the button the motor will run, but it is impossible to use since the button is covered up when the bowl is in place. It's a very pretty color pink, but that's about it.

If you are not good at processing with one hand don't waist your money.

There are some pieces of cultural information about the Spanish-speaking world that give good insight into that culture.

(If the class time consists of three 50-minute sessions per week, and there are roughly 15 weeks per semester, the student doesn't benefit from these since most cannot be accomplished effectively due to time constraints.)

If your only asset is teaching language, then go teach at a language school; keep out of out of the mainstream eduaction system so the rest of us can learn.

Really? Where does it say that in the bible? Or does God say in the bible that we should eat more protein? I don't think so, but for some reason Townsend thinks He does.

Students don't get a good education, but the university needs their tuition dollars, so it distracts them with the \\"Beer and Circus\\" mentality of big time sports.

Schools and outside parties are selling the first four years of college as an experience..crammed full with extracuriccular activities, and an undeniable emphasis on drinking and partying. Academic pursuits are not a priority and those who are dogged in their pursuit to excell academically, do not fit in with the general student population.

Unlike the previous installments, Stallone shows astonishing laziness in his direction and writing (the thin screenplay fits on the back of a postcard).

(all of them)","review":"This is another very funny comedy concert by Cho, but it is definitely not for the squeemish! A lot raunchier and sex-obsessed than I Am The That One I Want. Blush-inducing to be sure, but wickedly funny. At times you think, \\"where can she possibly go next,\\" and then she finds a direction and is off and running. Not as moving or personal as the earlier film, but a guaranteed good time for the fans. Everybody should try to see her live, it is a real treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"hilarious","review":"i thought she was so funny. i have not laughed so hard in ages. she has a very blunt gritty humor, which i can really appreciate and relate to. lol. she does talk a lot about sex but that doesnt bother me like it seem some of the other sustomers. sex is a natural part of life. there is humor in it and the experiences we endure and cho really captivates the humor in all of it. highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny but a one-note show","review":"After reading Margaret Cho's autobiography, I'm the One That I Want, I knew that sex was a large part of her life. Unfortunately, I did not expect that it would in turn comprise a large part of her comedy routine in this movie, The Notorious C.H.O.I don't have anything against it, per se, it's simply that it grew tiring over an hour and a half to hear all the ways that she has experimented with sex. From going to an S&M; club to being \\"fisted,\\" Cho covers it all, in fairly explicit detail. After the first half hour, I lost interest and it just stopped being funny.I don't watch many stand-up films (the last one was Eddie Izzard), so when I do, I want them to be really hilarious--and varied in subject matter. So, since generally I'm pretty picky, I guess I just lost out this time. I'll probably look out for Margaret's next film, though, just in case, because she is one of the funniest comics working today.Love that cover shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"No-laughs-for-us C.H.O.\\"","review":"I'm a Cho fan, and consider \\"I'm the One that I Want\\" to be just about the best stand-up act ever made... If you like Cho, you definitely HAVE to see that one, her first release. This second one is quite possibly the WORST stand-up act ever made. The lady definitely goes to extremes.Where to begin? The lighting is poor, she looks like she's had a few too many, her jokes are stale reruns, and she's just plain off. I don't know what happened here, but she obviously does not understand the concept of Quality Control.I made a special trip to Atlanta to see this one, being a big fan, and this is one of the ticket purchases that finally made me resolve NEVER AGAIN to buy movie tickets and just wait until things come out on DVD and I can rent them cheaply. Because, most movies are crap!Two stars instead of one because of probably misguided and irrelevant residual gratitude left over from her first stand-up DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed hard and loud!","review":"I just want to say that Margaret Cho is one of the funniest people I've ever seen.Notorious C.H.O. was filmed in Seattle and the show was just fantastic! She's raunchy and sexy and isn't afraid to talk about ANYTHING!The best was the midget lesbian... oh so funny! People should really check her out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have read the other reviews","review":"I bought this DVD because it was supposed to be cutting edge political and racial humor. I should have paid more attention to the reviews that said it was disappointing.To make the comparison to Richard Pryor is what offends me. Richard, like Robin Williams are comedy icons. Richard influenced a whole generation of comics from Eddie Murphy to Chris Rock.Cho is not even close. I didn't laugh at any of the jokes which are targeted away from the audience that who love Richard Pryor or the Kings of Comedy. This is the amateur hour. Not as good as Roseanne Barr or a host of other female comics.Trying to use the hip-hop references is another marketing ploy. No one in the Hood would find this material funny. I agree with those who have said this is contrived and forced. All hype , no substance.I should have read the customer reviews before I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way overrated","review":"I had heard a lot about how funny Margaret Cho was, and finally got a chance to watch her video. I find her way overrated.She does have some funny stuff. She's got a particular knack for doing impressions, and there's some other genuinely funny material.However, the funny stuff was diluted by the greater volume of material that was clearly just pandering to the audience. She does a lot of vulgar material, homosexual-oriented jokes, etc. that are clearly just there for the \\"outlaw\\" value. And she often descends in to abject preaching on topics that seem to either just be things that she's personally bitter about or are designed to ingratiate her to her fan base. It's just... not funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably crude","review":"My 18 year old daughter asked for this DVD for Christmas. I happened to be in the same room when she played it later that week. I couldn't believe the raunch! I tried to keep an open mind, but I had to walk out. I had seen Cho on cable & she was funny, but nothing like the DVD. I'm really sorry I bought this.It's just plain crude."},{"rating":"1","title":"DID I MISS IT ALL, OR IS SHE JUST NOT FUNNY TO BEGIN WITH?","review":"I had high expectations from this DVD that was given to me as a gift, along with a rave review of a Korean damsel trying to do the black comedy jig. In hindsight, I am glad I didnt shell out for this egregiously uninspired performance, to say the least.Ms. Cho can break all the sexual taboos she wants (quite frankly most of them have already been smashed many times over) but a very, very fundamental tenet they perhaps teach in Stand-up 101 is to have some decent jokes up your sleeve, and ideally, not to pause for an eternity between them. Cliched punchlines followed by drawn out and thus piquing stops make for a painfully tedious viewing.If you have a sense of humor even mildly above average, skip this tripe regardless of whatever minority rave you are exposed to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining but crass at times","review":"I found this show very entertaining. I think I would have liked it more, however, with slightly less foul language and fewer graphic references to her sexual encounters. It's not that I get offended, rather it's just not my cup of tea. Fortunately most of it was funny enough that I can easily overlook the gross jokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just call me totally out of it","review":"I really like Margaret Cho, her politics and passion but I wish I had read some reviews before I bought this DVD. Was I surprised!! Call me Ms. Pruddy-Two-Shoes from the mid-west but personally it was too graphic for me. On the plus side I learned about some sexual practices I have never heard of, which as an observer of the human condition, wss pretty interesting (didn't it hurt - or was that the point?). If you are an over 50 woman not into raunchiness and graphic descriptions of alternative sex, be forwarned. For the more adventurous sort, Margaret Cho is still very funny. I would love to hear her discuss non-XXX rated subjects"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather watch paint dry","review":"My wife and I had always liked Margaret Cho, and yet going into this disc we had no special expectations except to have a relaxed evening with some laughs. I didn't have to try to like this show, I had to try to endure it. I don't know where she went wrong. She's likeable enough. I like the raunch factor. I just don't know.... Felt like I wasted my time. Not funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying and unfunny","review":"I am glad I rented this DVD. It actually is not even worth the rental price. It is that unfunny. I think her impressions are horribly annoying. She sounds bitter and evil rather goofy and funny. I would be surprised if a laugh track wasn't used. The camera never focused once on the audience. So who knows if they were really laughing. I think she is unattractive and that adds insult to injury. She think she is all that and a bowl of soy sauce but she isn't. Her only funny impression was when she was making fun of her asian parents. Other than that the best way to describe her unorignal comedy style is that it is comprised of generic and vulgar anecdotes that are more annoying to hear than funny. I think after her shows she is laughing at her audience back stage because she is managing to get away with telling awful jokes and stories and making it huge. She has the last laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Test Kitchen is great","review":"Baught this for my wife, she loves the show. I have watched the DVD with her and have enjoyed it very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low end!","review":"I have been happy with most of my chinese line of guns until I start buying the low-end of the line. Usually these are marketed under \\"Techforce\\", AGI (Air Gun Inc.) or simply \\"Chinese import\\".Most of these when pictured looks alike and the description vague. Seldom you see a model number. The obvious difference would be the caliber (.177 or .22) and the claimed fps. The one I got shouldn't pass quality control, I had a real hard time cocking this break barrel rifle until I lubed the break and play with it. I've shot over 300 shots on it and now it's manageable to cock, still not smooth. I didn't send it back because of the shipping price. This is a full size rifle at 42\\" and weighing at 9 pounds.

For some reason I didn't have hi hopes for this Barbra, mini, concert. But was I ever wrong! The show on DVD is so intimate one feels as if they're really there at The Vanguard. There is a lot of chatter from Barbra, of course, between songs, which I loved! I had the feeling it took her a couple of songs to really warm up but when she did I suddenly remembered why I have adored from afar this woman for 36 years. She blows this small audience away with \\"If You Go Away\\" . Yet, when Ms. Streisand dives into songs like Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered, Make Someone Happy, Nobody Heart Belongs to Me, and The Way We Were, one feels as if they have sailed on a great boat with a great love and have experienced the most satisfying afternoon of one's life. Barbra Streisand rises above the bar once again and I pray our Barbra never goes away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really charming","review":"It's a show we'd never seen before.

And that's what I wanted in this concert. Sad part was, it's about an hour and a half long and she only does 13 songs, with LOTS of talk between each song. Not my idea of a great concert.The \\"concert\\" takes place in the Village at a small place where she got her start. Only a little more than 130 people can even fit in the place. Oh, it's filled all right, but mostly with her friends (including ex-President Clinton, his wife Hillary, and their daughter Chelsea). It's as though everyone attending is \\"honored\\" to be in the audience just to see her.I'm sure there are much better \\"concert DVDs\\" featuring MS. Streisand on them. I strongly suggest saving your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbra's Interesting Performance","review":"As a Streisand fan, I would have purchased anything she released. This one was a little disappointing. The selection of songs performed was adequate, but she was uncomfortable in this particular environment and her voice was not up-to-par. However, I am not sorry I purchased the DVD. I needed it to complete my collection of her work and performances. A must for serious Barbra Streisand lovers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy product description.........","review":"No indication of song selection. No indication of what's on the DVD.

Yes, many can say they have a fan base or sell out concerts but one performer commands your respect and that is Barbra. Excellent Blu Ray but lets be clear if Barbra was to recite the alphabet, I'd buy it. For her fans this video is a dream, makes you think your right there with her. Seeing Barbra's Concerts in person I can only say I felt I was in the room with her with this video. Every Streisand fan should own this video, excellent 10 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS ANOTHER ONE WE MIGHT LOOSE","review":"This one is no longer in print, which is a pity, as it has enchanted kids for quite a few years now.

This scope failed horizontally and vertically, and badly.

This single has a handful of ready-for-the-club remixes; the best of the bunch is from Dirty Vegas, who give the Timbaland-produced track a neo-disco edge. Another standout is a positively trippy makeover of \\"Like I Love You\\" from London's Basement Jaxx. These guys inject an acid-like house groove into this single, originally produced by the Neptunes. At first, I wondered how a song like that could get a house remix, but Basement Jaxx pull it off well. Timberlake is impressively shedding out of his boyband roots by aligning himself with some hip producers and smart DJs. If you like the original version of this single, then you'll be impressed with these remixes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remixes better than the original","review":"Forget the album version and the instrumental. This single doesn't \\"kick...\\" until the Dirty Vegas remake and the subsequent selections.

He is one of the few boy band members who actually has the talent to do his own thing. This single is awesome, I really liked both the original versions of Cry Me A River and Like I Love You, but I have to say that the remixes are actually better, but then I am bias because I like dance/club music. In my opinion the two remixes that stand out the most are the Cry Me A River Junior Vasquez mix and the Like I Love You Deep Dish ZigZag mix. All I can say is if you like pop or club music then this single is for you, and I would definitly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great remixes","review":"Cry Me A River is an awesome song, but it was very overplayed.

Some of the episodes in this season seemed a little clunky or forced like the one where Frasier is haunted by his ex-wives' memories or the one where he attends a retirement party for Cliff of Cheers. However, there are some really good episodes too. I think part of the issue the show faced in seasons 8 and 9 was the partial resolution of the Daphne-Niles relationship and how that affected the story lines. However, the final scene of the final episode is a highly emotional and effective hook based on these two characters that makes you want to rush out and buy season 10.

His descriptions of his parents, boyhood teachers and youthful life in an Ireland recently freed from its colonial past are fairly interesting but too superficial. More intriguing are those parts of the book which deal with his profound anger directed at the church hierarchy and the chapter which describes the evolution of his early research on the sayings and parables of Jesus into a wider quest focusing on the life of Jesus."},{"rating":"1","title":"An autobiography by a well-known NT scholar","review":"Rather disappointed with this book.

Some of the theological musings are interesting but most of this book was just surface level. There is no passion in this book. This book makes Crossan look very shallow. Never does he go into his own spiritual journey or even really his own personal feelings. Much of the details in his life are quite boring as well. Leaving the priesthood is interesting, but he never really goes into why he left the priesthood. Very dissapointing.

In this fourth book of the Hitchhiker series he attempts to include the romance genre. Personally, I didn't enjoy the book as much as the previous three books. The story goes nowhere (which isn't really that big of a deal in these types of books.) But like always, the comedy is great. And comedy is really the main reason for reading the book. There are two great new characters in this fourth book...The Rain God- Who knew that there were 231 different types of rain?Wanko the Sane- In order to reassure people that you are really sane; just add the word to your name.If you liked any of Douglas Adam's other books- you will inevitably enjoy this one as well.

The plot more or less hangs together, but there are some parts that don't do much for the plot and I think are just there for filler material. The love relationship was OK, but went a bit juvenile. I wish the ending wouldn't have been so sudden, it was like Adams was just in a hurry to get it over with for some reason. Poor Marvin! Still, it certainly is worth reading and deciding for yourself if it's good or not; it would be a shame to pass it up based on some negative reviews and possibly miss out on something you might really enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Home at last!","review":"At last, Arthur is home!! I was beginning to think the poor sod was going to die in that dressing gown. I'm also thrilled that he has found love. Fenchurch is good for him.From what I have read about this book, people didn't seem the tone. Also, there were comments about it bouncing too much. I did not find this to be the case. I quite enjoyed it. In fact, Adams knows me(and the other readers) so well that he offered up the chance to skip ahead to the bit with Marvin. I never would have, but I was thrilled to hear that we would encounter him later.

With this weak effort, Douglas Adams proves that he cannot follow it. Only occasionally mildly amusing. Its successor, \\"So long, and thanks for all the fish\\" is worse. My advice is, don't risk major disappointment, stick to the real trilogy and end with the celestial high note of \\"Life, the Universe, and Everything\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the rest","review":"Really, I do believe that this one should have finished the series. It has a good, fulfilling ending(I don't mind unhappy endings at all, but they should have a point, if nothing else to be tragic. Mostly Harmless most definitely did NOT have a point.), and despite the lack of Zaphod, which I didn't really notice, it's a fun read. Was the Guide ever intended to be more? No! It's got just as much absurdity as the rest, if a bit more sedate and sense-of-wonder-oriented, but that's all right. At least he wrote well for the style, and at least he struck out in a new direction. I don't understand the fans who hate this book. I loved it as a fitting closure(trust me, people! Ignore \\"Mostly Harmless,\\" or only read it to know what it says. Don't expect much enjoyment, although you might be interested by the scathing indictment of fans.) to a highly enjoyable little set of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, bad editing","review":"It almost seems like someone translated the entire book into German using Babelfish (the translation program, not the fish) and back into English.

The parts that can be read are quite ammusing, but this was very poorly done."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO LONG AND THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH","review":"I have the utmost admiration for Douglas Adams; his brilliance, imagination and his sense of the absurd are unparalleled and his type of humor is my favorite. Even so after reading much of his writing I began to suffer from a sense of sameness in this book so I wasn't thrilled like I was with his other books and got a little bored. It has been called by some one of his best and I agree. For me its just a little too much of a great thing. If you are new to Mr. Adams it's a must read as any of his books would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, in my oppinion, but...","review":"...I liked it. Douglas Adams wrote a good book, however you don't get very far in any sort of plot.

I would sugest reading it to anyone who enjoyed any of Adams' other books because it is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh....","review":"\\"So Long and Thanks for All the Fish\\" is a catchy title and worthy of the increasingly ill-named Trilogy of the Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but the contents failed to live up to its three predecessors. The reason, perhaps, lies in Adams' attempt to make Arthur Dent less of \\"a real jerk. An absolute kneebiter.\\" Arthur Dent speaks in coherent sentences, gains a fractured but otherwise normal girlfriend, STAYS ON EARTH. We see Marvin only at the end, Ford infrequently and Zaphod not at all. The \\"zaniness\\" just isn't there. If you're sick at home with a cold and have nothing else to read but Volgon poetry, give it a try. Your insides won't strangle you, but you won't be cured as quickly, say, if you read \\"Life, the Universe, and Everything.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"best of the bunch","review":"This book is absolutely hilarious.

The second book wavered on the plot, but it was still good. The third book had the characters, but the original plot was gone. It had been replaced by a confusing, uninteresting, and bad idea that had come out of nowhere.This book has not only thrown away the plot, it also practically got rid of most of the original characters. And the new plot that appeared in its place was poorly done. He doesn't explain what's going on very well, probably because he doesn't understand it himself. What was Adams thinking when he wrote this? I'm going to read the last book in the series, but I'm not sure what to expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"Adams loses, I think, his creativity in this book.

Everything seems to have been a dream for him and nothing seems all that different except for the disappearance of the dolphins. We learn that God left behind a final message to the universe and we journey through time and a couple hundred pages to find out what it is. Without spoiling the ending, I can say that that journey is worth it and, if you have made it this far in the series, nothing should surprise you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but very good","review":"As the fourth book in the Hitchhiker \\"trilogy\\", this is a great novel and a step up from Life, The Universe, and Everything in quality. It starts off very funny, and the first couple of chapters are some of the most hilarous in the series, but gradually the humor slips away (for the most part), and though it is present, the central bit of the plot is, believe it or not, a love story. And a very good one, too. This change from the normal pace of the series makes the book a joy to read, and you'll probably zip through it pretty quickly. Definately read the previous books in this series first, for continuity and coherence (even though it more or less stands on it's own.) The first two books in the series were comedic masterpieces, but the third book started to slow somewhat... So Long, and Thanks For All The Fish is however, an excellent book, and a return to greatness for the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS GAME IS IN POOR TASTE","review":"I'd give it zero stars if I could.

The cast is great and continues to shine in this season. The only downfalls of this DVD set is the lack of extras like bloopers, interviews, etc. However, none of the other WINGS sets included these things, so no surprise that they are not here either. Also, while I rarely if ever used ths feature of \\"Play All\\" on a disc, that is missing from the DVD menu screen.

Instead there are many references to manual drafting which few drafters use any more.

The story of Mary Dyer is a story of spiritual discovery - wrestling with grace and works, choosing conviction over comfort and seeking a personal relationship with Christ while literally laying down her own life to stand against religious intolerance. This book tells the story missing from many classrooms.

This text doesn't offer any of this which is VERY frustrating when you are trying to create nursing care plans.

John Byrne's Herbie is selfish and twice risks serious injury to his mother. The real Herbie would never ever do this. It would be like Superman slapping Lois Lane and then hunting down Lana Lang for more of the same.

I am afraid to say it, but TSR really struggled when trying to make this. The kits were weak. They lacked reason for playing. Unlike the other books, this one did an extremely poor job with kits. It merely described the role and description of them. Whereas the other books added to the suggested proficiencies and special benefits and hindrances. That is what many people are looking for when buying handbooks. It is easy to decide to play an acrobatic thief, but it is difficult to determine benefits and hindrances. Perhaps they could have added something to the extent of acrobat thieves, being members of a traveling circus. Having the benefits of wealth and contacts, but the hindrance of always travelling.

The character subclasses such as cutpurse give such a depth into the game. I have used this to develope a guide run city, with 150+ guide members, from all of the subclasses listed in the book. It gives such depth! As a thief user myself it is now indispensible. Even the new item lists are superb!

This book includes specialized kits (subclasses of Thief), thief-oriented equipment (both magical and mundane), a very detailed section on thieves guilds, and ideas on incorporating more complex storylines involving this class.The one gripe I had with this (as I have with 2nd Edition in general) is the lack of distinction between kits of different classes. For example, you could call yourself an Assassin and be of either the Fighter or Thief classes. There really should have been more of a separate label for such kits in each class so it is clear that when one is an \\"Adventurer\\" for example, you would know what their general class orientation is.Overall, I recommend this book for gamers of the AD&D; 2nd Edition genre who wish to flesh out and expand the role of the thief in their games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a cookbook -","review":"My friend had this book in her collection of cookbooks, so I had the opportunity to go through it before buying.

For the most part, the meaning even of the unusual words seemed to be fairly apparent. The story is much better than I expected, and the Latin more manageable than Winnie Ille Pu or even Regulus.

But, I'm also not too sure about the lack of capital letters: if it's an authentic feel that's needed, we should, perhaps, have nothing but capitals.But I will defend most heartily Mr. Needham's syntax.

The cover of the book clearly states \\"classic shots and how to take them,\\" but the authors' feeble attempt at presenting the lighting setups, at least half of which are totally erroneous, is only remotely informative. Christopher Nisperos, a portrait photographer, includes no recreations of any of the images in the book, which is suggestive in itself, and shares no technical information of any substance. There is no discussion of types of lights used by the photographers in any of the discriptions which would have been fascinating and the lighting diagrams suggest working distances for various lights that are at best misleading. All in all the book is a very superficial look at the creation of Hollywood \\"style\\" portrais and will prove of only very limited value to the aspiring portrait photographer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have been better","review":"I find this book interesting and helpful. One thing though that bothers me is that I think it could have been better if they would have tried their own advice and recreated a couple of the photos using their suggested set-ups.

Photographers will probably be disappointed in the lack of useful technical data. The lighting diagrams are very vague, even so, some are obviously wrong. If the authors had bothered to recreate the photographs, they might have noticed the errors. However, they seemed satisfied with filling in blank spaces with biographical information about the actors. This seems like a very easy book for the authors to produce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Guide for Lighting Analysis","review":"This book is proving to be a good source for learning to look a photo and figure out how it was lit. Each photograh is shown accompanied by a sketch of the lighting arrangement. Of course, the lighting is derived from the finished photo since these photographers are, sad,y, long gone. The author, though, takes care, in the text, to explain the reasoning behind the sketch. If you are interested in making photographs in this style, then I recommend the three books by Kobal (also available on Amazon and very inexpensive): \\"Movie Star Portraits of the Forties\\", \\"Film-Star Portaits of the Fifties\\", and \\"Hollywood Glamor Portraits\\".

Apart from the over use of describing every non consequential detail this book was so ambiguous that I really do not u understand what it was about. I always thought myself as an avid reader with at least a few brain cells but today Henry James you have proven wrong :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies on TV","review":"This story has been one of my favorites since I saw the story on TV in a movie with Deborah Kerr (I believe). I am reading it inbetween my other books and looking for any differences between it and the movie. So far haven't found any. The book is easy to read and I am very glad I have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obscured by prose","review":"I was always told to read James, but now that I've done so it is clear that I won't have to do so again. The characters were ridiculous, the plot seemed to, at times, be written in code, and though I love a good ghost story I felt that this one fell into the could have been better category."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great find","review":"My daughter needs books for school all of the time. It was great to find this book for such a great price and available to be sent during the Winter Break. She was able to start reading in preparation of the restart of school."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT SCARY STUFF!!!","review":"A young woman accepts the role of guardian and housekeeper to two young angelic children for a seemingly uncaring Uncle. Through her instant love for these two apparently innocents our heroine begins to have visions and contact with former members of the household. As it turns out these previous employees are both deceased and so it happens the hero of the book - together with Mrs Grose, her only ally in the building - set out to save the lives - and souls - of the children. No more will be said by me in these pages but be warned this novel is a classic horror story in more than one sense of the word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book is very interesting. We are reading it in my Literature class and I am hooked. There are some very strange occurrences and aspects of the book, but it's still interesting. Since it was written in the 19th century, the book is made up of very long sentences that do take some time to read, so it really isn't something you can speed read through. The book is short though, with only about 90 pages. All in all, it's a great book and I'd definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Handsome Mid-Century Release From Heritage","review":"The Heritage Turn of the Screw is a tasteful affair.Bound in russet or green cloth with silver details in matching slipcase. 12 full page Lydis illustrations, an introduction by Van Doren.

The style of writing in this book is so convoluted that my eyes would read but my brain would quickly trail off trying to throw out the unecessary words and just get to the freaking point of each sentence!! I got the gist of the story but it just took to much mental energy to understand what was being said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror without a single scare.","review":"This is the most bland and boring book I believe I've ever read. The only reason I finished the book was because it was required for one of my college English classes. I was not terrified by any of the passages and through the flowery use of the English language, I realized the only terror was the fact I still had X number of pages to finish. The \\"sexual\\" tension in this novel was comperable to that of a Disney movie like Mary Poppins or Bambi. The unanswered questions were quickly answered by my own brain saying, \\"I don't care\\". This book is incredibly boring and I would rather be subjected to 24 hours of Barney and Friends than re-read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"None","review":"this book was so terribly hard to get through! that i actually couldn't finish it. my mom and i both are part of a bookclub and this book was just pondering much to much on the main characters every moment making way more dramatic then needed to be. the 1961 movie les innocenes is much better. don't waste your time on the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the Best of Its Kind","review":"Time has not dimmed the power of this supreme work of psychological suspense. The true father of the intelligent thriller was not Poe, with all respect, but James. \\"The Turn of the Screw\\" finds him at full force. Not a beach read, but, then, what of lasting value is? This work has never been touched by any work that attempted it's achievement, and it is unlikely that it ever will be. The only problem with the work is that it will spoil you when you try to go back to all of those fast-food \\"novels of suspense\\" that are being published. In this and other works such as \\"The Beast In the Jungle\\" James set the bar. No one has come close to raising it from where he set it yet. Read the book, see the opera, enjoy and be edified."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not scary, but a good read","review":"This may have been terrifying back in the day, but is not now. Mildly unnerving yes, but not scary. That being said, it is a great read. I really liked the slow, elusive style of the story. I was under the impression it was a novel; it is actually a short story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle and thought-provoking","review":"Those looking for horror of the slasher sort will not find it here. \\"The Turn of the Screw\\" is a complex exploration of human psychology and the nature of perception. The central question is, are the heroine's perceptions \\"real\\" or the product of hysterical imagination? James does not tell us definitively, but leaves us to ponder which we believe to be true - and whether there's ever a clear difference. The Victorian language only adds to the atmosphere of a tale redolent with Freudian possibility. Those who enjoy this novel should also try two modern novels that explore similar territory, John Fowles' \\"The Magus\\" and Rand Johnson's \\"Arcadia Falls\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"This \\"classic\\" was a monumental exercise in boredom. I've had more enjoyment whilst pulling slivers out of my fingernails. James takes obtuse to a whole new level with this yarn, one in which he must have gotten paid by the word! Skip to Daisy Miller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literary Constipation...","review":"What is there to say about these eighty-seven excruciating pages? They're boring. They're prolix. Most importantly, they aren't SCARY. Not for a second. (You want scary? Try H.P. Lovecraft.) I shudder to think that this is assigned reading in some classrooms...what a way to permeate an ambivalent reader with an aversion to reading.You've been warned..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like being in line at the passport office","review":"This is a victorian read. James shows his style using his long sentences. I did'nt like the characters in the book. The story is too ambiguous, so expect to get frustrated if your one of those people who like to know what really happened at the end of the book. This was a short read, but it was like waiting in line at the passport office, konw what I mean? So fuggedaboudit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic Crap","review":"While many regard this as an American masterpiece, I can only say that I found the book so boring I barely made it halfway through. James's characters are silly and his words remain firmly mired in an outdated style filled with so many appositives it's hard to figure out exactly what his sentences are supposed to mean. So little is actually said that the reader can only grasp the overall tone and feel without ever quite attaining a sense of individual events. It's too frustrating to make this book an enjoyable read, and I can only think that this book has outlived its welcome on the modern list of classics. It's not completely horrid, though; the style does accurately give a sense of setting, but only in the broadest sense, and it's not enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"You see, the thing is...","review":"OK, you see, the thing is, this was required reading for a Senior Writing Seminar. I was told that this was scary. Hmm, tlet me think... uh, no. Boring. All of a sudden, this chick starts seeing al these ghosts, she thinks that they're real, but the children don't see them which makes you think the kids are in on it with the care taker woman who aids the governess. Then there's the sexual tensions between the kids and the ghosts, rap and what not, then Miles and the governess. Then she suffocates him at the end. Yeah, ok... where's the ghosts?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn of the Screw","review":"I will only purchase books from the bookstores from now on.

First off, there is only one 55 minute workout on this dvd, which is surprising. Second, the instructor is incredibly annoying. Most spin instructors are, but this guy takes the cake. All he does is talk, there really is very little working out on this DVD. He prepares you for two 10 minute intervals by talking about them each for 20 minutes. The music is in no way synced up to the intervals, so you feel like something is not quite right as you're pushing yourself. Then, the dude stops pedaling right in the middle of the last push to talk more! I have had instructors that were pregnant that never stopped. You're supposed to keep going no matter what! Overall I am incredibly disappointed, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."},{"rating":"2","title":"crank it up","review":"This video provides an excellent workout no matter what your level.

Highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spinning: Crank it up, but shut up","review":"I read the reviews on this DVD and thought it would be a great addition. I barely got thru the first 10 minutes. Josh Taylor is way too chatty. I was looking for a workout, not a therapy session. I suppose if I have never worked out on a spin bike, all of his pointers/suggestions/instruction would have been helpful, but too much talking, not enough pedaling. I will try again to get thru the beginning, but what bothers me the most is that if I did end up liking the workout, I will always have to listen or fastforward thru the first part. All of that info, should have been placed in an instructional area (which there is one) or on another disc. It was a big mistake to include all that talking in the main workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but fragmented.","review":"I don't find any infos about this budget 4cd box.If you want buy some from legendary tango (jazz) man Piazzolla, this is small info: only 2nd disc is taken form studio recordings.It is from late 60's.First disc includes concert in Roma 1972 (Piazzolla's Nonet)Third disc includes concert in Milano 1984(quintet)Fourth disc is from 1976 - it is electric Piazzolla.But sound is good.

It would be alot easier to do a Goggle search of electrician symbols than to try and use this book. It is suppose to be for electricians but it lacks any foundation for the electrician. The main reason I dislike this book, it has no substance just electricial symbols, no explanations, no discussion of what the electrician needs to focus on, and the worst part, the graphics are small and not well done at all. Full of useless information, for example, I want to learn about electrical blueprints so they had to include door schedules,etc.etc. just fill material to sell a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Compatible with Palm Vx PDA","review":"I purchased this product thinking it would be compatible with my Palm Vx PDA.

As an opera composer she is very disappointing, to say the least. This DVD is is not visually stimulating at all. I don't think it should even be called an opera. It is some sort of multimedia-slash video art - slash experimental theatre piece base on the Holocaust. I am not sure what the viewer/listener is supposed to take away after viewing this opera.??? Angst, fear, outrage? I was not sure what to feel while listening and watching \\"Pnima\\". Totally confusing for the audience in my opinion.Mode is usually a very interesting label, however their DVD series have so far been mediocre. They've got a lot to learn from the European labels.

It was excrutiatingly slow getting out of the blocks, became mildly interesting about one third of the way along, and then bogged down again. Then, it seemed the author decided to insert a most-unlikely love angle, after which, one fortuitious happenstance after another occur. Then we are treated to the bumblingly inefficient Russian army (how convenient), and an overused, transparent ruse at the end. This is very tedious reading of the sort that makes a reader want to demand a refund, not so much, of their money, but rather of their time. Imagine this: A Russian officer referring to a military blunder as, \\"a cockup\\"! How much more British could that dialog be, for Christ's sake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom one per cent","review":"I don't ask much from my novels. I do, though, ask that there be at least a hint of characterization in the hero - in this novel, however, said spy is scraped off the pages of a bad A-Team episode script, and thrown into a supposed thriller with any number of minor characters who might also have fallen out of a really bad 1980s soap.

Maxi is a spoiled girl, that will be worth millions whether or not she saves the magazine or not. The only desire she has to save the business, is to continue her father's legacy - but even that doesn't seem urgent. However, it seems from the story that her father put his business well above his children.

A great premise squandered by writers who don't seem to know what direction they want to go.This season they got rid of some really good characters and added new ones that didn't click. They aged Isabelle which was a big mistake not only because the actress was horrible but the character too. They got rid of Lily and Kyle (for a majority of the season anyway) and everything went even more downhill after that. Add to this that they also increased Shawn's part which brought nothing to the story or show. Who cares anymore? I don't.I kept waiting for something good to happen and it never did.

There are too many errors in this book for it to be of any value. I found myself referencing what they were saying with other books as I had no confidence at all in their text. The test engine is not of any use either. I got the same question 10 times when I tried the engine. Save your money and wait for another book to come along. I passed the test but it was with the help of the Transcender sample exams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Errors","review":"This book was riddled with typos and errors.

I'll be asking the publisher to rectify this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The typos and blatent logical errors make this book useless.","review":"This book is rife with typos, logical errors, contradictions and completely false statements. I have never read a book with so many errors. Reading this book was a very aggravating experience because I had to second guess virtually every statement. This meant that I couldn't just read something and take it as fact. Instead, I had to verify it by either running the code in Access or looking up the topic in the Access help files. This book is so bad that I fully intend to write a letter to the publisher to complain. Further, I had to postpone my exam and have ordered some expensive test prep software to use as a study tool instead. This book simply doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fair Book to start with but not enough","review":"I passed the exam with 824. This book is a big Cliff's Notes type of summary of major concepts. The CD Sucks! The Exam engine on the CD uses what looks like a V Fox Pro file, too. This book is not enough. Don't pay retail.

ThIS CD and Transcender will gaurantee passing the exam"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had potential but was so unprofessional.","review":"When I first received the book I thought I had struck gold - Hardcover, well laid out with excellent topics and lots of review questions.

Hopefully the next edition will be something useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book. Stay away from it.","review":"We are all used to confusing, inaccurate computer books.

The practice tests cover questions not even addressed in the text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than nothing, just...","review":"Before I read these reviews I sent a email to New Riders describing the problems I had with the CD and asking if there were any bug fixes. They told me they had never heard of the problem, to try the cd on another machine and that the book was no longer covered by their support agreement anyway. The exam is still valid, so why isn't the book? Luckily I have used Access for a long time and could spot the errors, but a beginner is likely to get very confused. Use with caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Embarrassment","review":"Flat out, hands down the worst computer book I have ever read.It is so full of errors that before you are through with 2 chapters you stop trusting what the authors are telling you.Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best option for exam; Worst option for learning and using.","review":"I can see why it's good for the exam. However, it's our only choice. I've read another New Riders book, a VB book. Though not as bad as this book...I can honestly say, I will not buy another New Riders book again, unless it is the only option. In fact, I made sure that the company that I work for doesn't buy anything from New Riders again. It's not completely the authors fault. Although I was somewhat concerned that they didn't have this certification themselves. It's ultimately the publishers responsibility. Obviously they aren't very responsible. Supply and Demand, for better or for worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"It bites.","review":"While the book seems to cover all the required curriculum, it's impossible to see if you're really \\"getting it\\" when you check the review questions. Since it's the only game in town, use it along with a good mailing list to get feedback on your best guess of what the author actually meant to say. The part I really hate is when I get a question wrong because the material was never covered in the book, then I'm advised to go back and reread a section that doesn't mention anything in the question. The publisher didn't even answer my email request for a refund. I'd expect at least an apology. Someone should wind up in Hell for this book. I'd recommend punishment by sorting punch cards in a hurricane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look else where.","review":"This book is full of logic, formatting, and test/answer errors. I NEVER read a book like this before. Beginners will be confused by contradicting text, questions that are jumbled together, and outright wrong answers.

Go to the bookstore, copy down the Table of Contents, then study those objectives on your own with Access and Visual Basic help files. As others have said, the book is rife with errors, but it did give me a sense of what to expect on the exam. The recordsets chapter (Ch. 4) was a helpful introduction and fairly accurate (I think!!!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"So many technical errors and Microsoft approved this book?","review":"The book's front cover has the official Microsoft Certified Professional - Approved Study Guide logo. Obviously, Microsoft just approved the cover and not the book's content. A quick review of the contents revealed too many typographical and technical errors. I downloaded the errata and unzipped the files - an .rtf file containing textual fixes and .mdb files for the Lab exercises. But the errata only covers about two-thirds of the problems! I find it very difficult reading a section in the book and cross referencing the errata document against the book. Overall, the book is structured according to the MCSD prep guide. It is the only book that covers the #70-69 exam that I have found. The book would be a great asset if it was proofread BEFORE it was printed. Could someone at New Riders publishing please hire a bonafide proofreader!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY","review":"I agree with the previous poster.

First, they emphasized the wrong materials and second, some of the information is wrong. I was also unhappy about the test exam. It gave me an error when ever it corrected the test. It also had the same question four or five times in the test. It also did not know how to score correctly. Overall, the book is a method of studing. It is the only book available.

This book would never persuade me to try voluntary simplicity (luckily I already came to it from other sources). Even though I wholeheartedly agree with many of Andrews' points, the book offers little support for her sweeping generalizations.

We love Elmo's World, but are happy for a change from the characters that are in it (ie: Noodle family).This has appearances from celebrities and fantastic songs in it that are sure to be classics. I cannot compare to Best of Elmo 1, but I can definitely say this is one of our favorite DVDs in our collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great...just as expected","review":"This DVD is a classic.

It was the first movie he ever watched at the tender age of 18 months and he loved it.And I loved this DVD. It's charming, sweet, and it features great songs from artists like Jason Mraz, Feist, and Ray Charles. It's essentially a story of how Elmo meets a new friend, Memory Bot, and helps Memory Bot get new memories by sharing his memories of his times with friends. At first B was scared of some of the songs, but he now knows all of them by heart. And I'm more than happy to watch it with him for the music and the lessons therein.We initially were streaming some of these songs off of youtube and just bought the DVD. It's worth it as it supports Sesame Street and well, I don't have to click every 2 minutes for a new song. Of note: THIS IS NOT ELMO'S WORLD. It's much much more than that-- it's a great first movie for toddlers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!","review":"My 8 month old granddaughter LOVES this DVD.

Honestly i thougt it was really good, my only real complaint is that the cd 10 songs with most of them around 3 min, and none over 4 min. Overall the cd is about 30 to 35 min long, and so it seems a bit short. The songs are all very catchy and creative, and the album are is amazing. Its hard to describe, so you must see it to understand. The band is not together anymore, so this is the best you can expect from them. So i gave it 4 stars due to its length and because the music is not something you will probably be listening to 3 to 5 years from now. but if you want a good cd to entertain you while it lasts, be sure to buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately muddled account...","review":"Interesting subject: an insider's look at what it was to be a member of the Hitler Youth. Unfortunately, this short autobiography becomes too quickly muddled and difficult to follow, leaving the reader apathetic to the real drama and heartbreak of the story's reality. I suspect this has something to do with the translation to English...the author's account obviously deserves a better treatment than it's getting here.

The amount of information contained within its covers is quite amazing, even though I believe the apendicies could have been a little thicker. Every important point of the team's history is covered, although Keim frequently gets stuck in the same journalistic-style of writing. There are plenty of photos in the book, although some of the full-page black and white blow-ups are fuzzy in the paper-back edition. Perhaps a glossy, colored photo section would have enhanced the book even more. Either way, it's a great buy for $17.95."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memory lane","review":"My dad had chills while reading this book, thinking of all the good times we had watching the Browns in old, beat-up Municipal Stadium.

I had to keep my finger poised on the fast-forward so that I could spare my young kids unfriendly images such as a nasty teacher smacking a fearful child repeatedly, frequent cruel treatment of Lassie, adults who are nasty and mean and other scenes that just do not constitute warm entertainment for the younger set. Despite the shots of Lassie running through the mountains, I found the scenes in the film to be largely dank, dark and depressing, lacking color and cheer. Never mind that the references to war did not exactly constitute a charming backdrop in a children's movie. We won't be watching it again. If you are looking for a charming movie for young children that does not need parental censoring, stick to Heffalump, Nemo or Shrek. We expected a charming, friendly tale of a boy and his dog, and although this film certainly has the boy/dog elements, it falls flat as entertainment for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"LASSIE COMES HOME","review":"The whole family should enjoy this wonderful retelling of the familiar Lassie tale. Set in pre-WWII England and Scotland, the movie is beautifully filmed, lushly scored, and excellently acted. The dog herself is beautiful and there are times her expressions are amazing. Jonathan Mason as little Joe is heartbreaking; Samantha Morton shines as Joe's mother and John Lynch is fine as the dad who is forced to sell the collie for food money. Peter O'Toole chews up the scenery as the Duke and is marvelous; Peter Dinklage in too brief a role is mesmerizing as the dwarf who befriends Lassie.A few hankies might be necessary but the happy ending is warmly received. A fine family film."},{"rating":"2","title":"an absolutely wonderful movie","review":"This version is even better than the good one which my mother sent me to see - and had to get me a collie after that. :) Degree: at least 6/5.

This is to be expected though considering the times in which the two movies were produced. In the new movie the story line very loosely follows the book, leaving out crucial scenes. And what was up with the Lock Ness Monster?! That scene made absolutely no sense. Why did this movie change the ending? It should have stuck with the story and ending in the book and a better acting Lassie. They even left out the famous swimming across the river scene...the scene that made Pal, the first Lassie, a star.If all you want is lovely scenery then this is a movie for you. But for the rest of you die hard Lassie fans, stick with the book and the original movie.

It reflects perfectly the spirit of that first, old Roddy McDowell film, but this dog is a better actor, as much as I loved Pal! Great cinematography. Great acting from Samantha Morton, Jemma Redgrave and Peter O'Toole, but especially from the new child actors and Mason the Collie. Lovely work on the subtext of the class differences in 1940s Britain.Great, great stuff. Too bad it didn't get more press in it's first release.Good for kids old enough to understand animals and that death, sometimes, sadly, is part of life. Very uplifting ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Done!","review":"I liked how Lassie was filmed where it takes place: Britain. Of course it isn't surprising that it was filmed in Britain, since it's a British movie. I really liked the nice photography of Scotland's highlands. I found Lassie to be exciting, but not too fast moving. Also the dog seemed to be really well trained. Peter O'toole was very good as the duke. Definitely a very enjoyable movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I received this dvd very quickly from the seller.

It's a little dated with lack of today's spectacular FX, but it's still a good, clean, old-time fanstasy based on a fairly tale that the whole family can watch.I liked the story (even though it doesn't follow the actual story exactly, because in the fairly tale there was no happy ending). The music was great and based off classical music and used very effectively throughout the movie. (The piece used as the piper's tune to lure the rats away has stuck with me all my life.) Definitely a movie parents can let children can watch and not be worried about filthy language or horrifying special effects. It also teaches a lesson about honor and the consequences of not living up to it. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"What a waste of money!!

Sad to say, this movie will not please anyone who loves to watch Biblically sound films."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO disappointed","review":"I was so disappointed in this movie. I purchased it to supplement our biblical history home school curriculum. There is very little factual information in this movie. Every character and the timeline are misrepresented.

Orpha's role is completely wrong and the \\"closer kinsman\\" couldn't be any further away from accurate.Please, if you are looking for a screen version of the beautiful book of Ruth, don't waste your money here.

Does anyone know?I also loved the bond that Naomi and Ruth acquired. The ending of this story is the most exciting for me. To know that Ruth was the great grand mother of King David and an ancestor of Jesus just blows my mind. One of the great biblical films in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great film of a great Hollywood period!","review":"The Story of Ruth was released in 1960 and I remember seeing it on a wide wide screen, curved, and in stereophonic sound; it was glorious, as were all Cinemascope films.This film is not the Bible, but a meditation on it, factual, no, but it gets the point of The Book of Ruth across.The best bits are a very moving perfromance by Peggy Wood as Naomi, and some stylish acting by Elena Eden and Stuart Whitman.The Wood scenes are excellent, and Naomi's prayer is quite striking, all filmed in a small house in earth tones...very good. Peggy Wood's many scenes of emotional upheaval are instances of excellent screen acting.The Moabite scenes are crazy, as is all of that Chemosh stuff, but this film has great appeal...for die hards only, and especially for cinemascope afficionados of yore who can re-imagine it all even on the tiny screens we must put up with now, TV and movie alike. Buy and enjoy. Still not letterboxed."},{"rating":"2","title":"romantic vision of a beautiful story","review":"When you watch this film, you have to think back and analyze the time period.

The errors are numerous, and the Scriptures have been changed, no doubt about it. Real shame. Don't waste your monies.HOWEVER, the movie \\"Book of Ruth\\" that's also sold is VERY good overall....and mostly follows the Biblical story line, though it's a B-rated type film (you know...acting is good by some, not all people involved, money is tight for the budget, etc...).

It also shows the kind of person who is made by, and makes, a great revolution.Dreke was a Afro-Cuban teenager of the 1950s who did not know that you can't fight city hall -- or in his case, the presidential palace. He joined the battle against the vicious and corrupt Batista dictatorship, and the social and economic system it defended. In doing so, he joined the struggle of sugar refinery workers and met the militants of Fidel Castro's Rebel Army. He stuck with the struggle for the long term, taking leadership responsibilities in everything from the fight against counter-revolutionary gangs, organized and directed by the U.S. government, to armed combat in the Congo against Mobutu Sese Seko's regime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Removing the Ropes of Oppression","review":"This is a captivating book and must reading for progressive-minded people everywhere. Pre-revolutionary Cuba was a place of discrimination and segregation against Blacks similar to the U.S. South or South Africa's Apartheid. Dreke grew up in one of the more backward areas-- much like Mississippi, the state where I was born.Fresh from having defeated the U.S.- backed Batista regime, the rebel army took down the rope separating Blacks and whites at a celebratory dance. Dreke, an Afro-Cuban, relates how Cuba's revolutionary government policy was to take down all the ropes of oppression and keep them down in Cuba and to help others internationally do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"First-hand testimony of the end of the Batista dictatorship","review":"Written by a soldier who fought in the Cuban revolution, Victor Dreke's From The Escambray To The Congo is a personal memoir and first-hand testimony of the end of the Batista dictatorship and the attempts to create a better government in its place. An insert of black-and-white photographs adds a visual touch to the gripping experiences both on and off the battlefield described in this memorable, gut-wrenching, up close and personal account of the modern history of a nation.

The sticker around the sound hole is slightly off and the bridge is plastic. I thought I was getting this for pretty much a steal but the price reflects what I received. On a lighter note, my son was excited to see it and says that I am extremely picky.

This was also made while Al was at one of his many career peaks. Originally a Showtime special, this movie is an almost-true account of Al's life. Even the FBI warning at the beginning is a spoof! There are spots where this one tends to drag...at the time, Al didn't direct himself yet. However, there are some very memorable parts to this video, especially the AlTV section, which shows several of his skits from the MTV specials that had been made at the time. The music videos are also quite good. This is still a must for any Al fan, but not up to par with Weird Al's more recent efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting yet comical insight into Al's earlier years.","review":"It was a very good video overall; it has a lot of great comedy.

The collection is really well-chosen, with most of the \\"classic\\" nursery rhymes here; my only complaint is that the editor seems to opt for only one verse of most rhymes where in some cases I'm pretty sure there's more to it than that.

Even Taco Bell got it better with the dog. I especially liked the father with the kid on his lap. His mouth literally went up to his eyes. There are no navigation instructions, no read me file, no tutorial, and the program does not even support 32-bit color. You have to change (lower) your monitor settings to play it.

I, personally, loved this game at first...but that was over a year ago. We have trained our minds to think newer is better, and it may be, but our medical knowledge rarely changes on subjects presented in this program.

I bought all 3 episodes and watched half of the first one.In the first episode when someone rolls their eyes: hysterical laughter that lasts forever. When someone says something mildly amusing: hysterical laughter that lasts forever. It gets so bad that a line of genuinely humorous dialogue gets obliterated by the laugh track that preceded it when someone lights a cigarette.While the streaming series is only $4.99 - save your money.

As usual, they are hysterically funny and poignant and, I guess I would say, as real as unreal can get, which is how I think many women really are at heart - we are sort of mythical creatures living in a real world, and it's hard for that mythic part of us to stay vital in the face of reality.

Each episode contains a new classic moment that will make you chuckle after the fact. Some episodes are funny overall without a lot of laughs throughout, but that doesn't describe any of these three. The special features are very good. There's the filming of a PSA or something with most, but not all of the characters that is very funny, but I don't think the final result is shown. That part is packed with big name celebrities. Unfortunately, my dog got a hold of the packaging and chewed it up, though the discs were not damaged, I won't rest until I get a new copy.

First, none of these \\"runners\\" qualified to run Boston. Think of the thousands of serious runners who train for months to run fast enough in an another Marathon simply to qualify. These people don't deserve a spot at Boston. Second, the film made a big deal about these people being able to finish the race. Some of them took 5-6 hours to complete the race. It is not right for people who haven't earned their way into the race to take up space and tie up the roads. If you can't run under 5 hours at Boston, you shouldn't run-period! It's a race. There are plenty of \\"events\\" available to people like these and the \\"Team in Training\\" types where they can pat themselves on the back for running 15 minute miles. Do that.

I kept the kennel in the garage so she wasn't exposed to direct wind, but boxers have no cold tolerance so she just needed something to keep warm. She was rarely ever in it since someone is almost always home, but it only took her about 5 or 6 times in the kennel to chew the wire to the point where it doesn't work (and remember, she's a puppy). The coil is very loosly wound around the cord and there is nothing keeping it tight against the end where the wire goes in to the pad. It took her nothing to move the coil enough to get the wire. I am just glad she didn't shock herself. I was going to return it for a refund, but my husband threw the box away so it just became more of a hassle than anything. I wish someone would make a dog kennel with a heated bottom. Would have solved all my problems.

Edison entirely skips the history and physical uses of each oil, missing the chance to dove tail all the information into a more comprehensive bundle. I don't know if she thought that the conventional stuff had already been done or that none of it was germane. Now later, I may be proven wrong as I learn more, but then there's the matter of the price. This is way too expensive given that the information may be personal to just Eidson.

I purchased this product used because I wanted a short video to supplement my unit on business decisions and entrepreneurship. However, this is primarily a video on money management and investing.

Also, I agree with the prior review about the weird 80's style graphics - they were often distracting. The concepts are very broad and would be suitable for high school, however the graphics and music are so dated they would likely only appeal to elementary school students.

Since it is impossible to translate the rhyme scheme and meter of the poem into English; we must simply be content with a true translation, or learn Italian. Ciardi makes a valiant attempt, but it is futile. In fact he makes a fairly straightforward text almost impossible to understand. He also savages the text in order to fit the words into the meter and rhyme.

This disc is more expensive than others (approx. $52) and since it's been opened, it cannot be returned. Will I buy it if it ever comes out in a U.S. format, probably, but I'm very disappointed that neither the disc nor Amazon.com made it clear that it would not play in the U.S. unless I had special equipment.

The first \\"Cranford\\" was so very good and the story was wonderful...so I was really pumped to see the sequel.

With its splendid pedigree of actors retained, there is no lack of effort on their part but even the excellent cast cannot not fix a script/direction that is sorely lacking in most all aspects and one which renders every situation as contrived and insipid.

What a disappointment it is: ridiculous plot lines, poor writing, choppy pacing, sloppy editing. It contains none of the substance or subtlety of the original and little of it's charm. The actors are the only pleasure yet they are given precious little to do...a waste of some considerable talent. While I can watch Cranford over and over (and have!), once was enough for the sequel.

I have the dvd and have watched it often and find something new in it each time. The story ends with many story lines tied up but also, some options for future story lines as the characters age and grow. Brilliant story and cast. Then comes \\"Return to Cranford\\". I won't spoil the story for you but while beautiful to look at, the story is shallow and meaningless and except for a few moments, you really won't care (everyone is against the railroad but no one has ever RIDDEN a train, soooooo). Most of the original actors are there but it seemed to me it was done out of pity for those of us who loved the original and wouldn't want to see new people in these roles or (horrors!) for the money.

Not good so I stopped.Headed out on the highway to much flapping and at the 3.6 mile mark - it blew completely off and over the hood. I couldn't go wrong with six hooks but because I couldn't make it a snug fit, too much air got under it.

The way that it was described in the back of the book lead me to believe that it was going to be a person who went crazy and killed everyone but that was not the case.

Although not a piece to be looked upon for research material in an upper level history course, it offers young history students and anyone interested in the topic a detailed, provocative perspective of the somewhat forgotten history of Canada during WW2.<Although take note that Canada didn't actually use the Maple Leaf as a flag during this time - Canadians were sailing under the Union Jack - the title can be construed as a misnomer.>"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Canadian Military History Buffs","review":"As required reading for my Canadian Military History class and coming from a military family, I found this to be a very interesting book.

Luman was a very reliable singer, and I would say 90% of the music on this collection is great stuff.

Rob looks old and pale and I'm just not impressed with the songs presented. I'm not really a big fan of Rob's solo work as much as his Matchbox Twenty stuff, but he does some of both.

Parker's work, but many of his later novels have a by-the-numbers quality that make them pleasant diversions and nothing more. PLAYMATES is pretty much a perfect example; there is nothing in this book that I haven't seen in other, superior novels by Parker.Unlike most of the other Spenser books, however, there are no real sympathetic characters in this book. The basketball player is arrogant and annoying, and is not worth the effort that Spenser invests in trying to save him. In many ways, he reminds me of April Kyle in TAMING A SEA HORSE and MILLION DOLLAR BABY -- a character with almost no redeeming features who Spenser forms some inexplicable attachment to.The plot of PLAYMATES is thin and there's very little true mystery or suspense. My advice is to skip this book and try other Spenser novels, such as EARLY AUTUMN, MORTAL STAKES, or LOOKING FOR RACHEL WALLACE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basketball, Bookies and Mobsters","review":"This was my first Spenser book. It was much better than the TV series. I loved the no nonsense character of both Spenser and Hawk. The vulgarity was strong, but believable. Spenser drifts through most of the story wondering what he's supposed to do, since his moral compass is nagging him to correct the wrongs of the world, even if they aren't in alignment with his customer. Will Spenser live to see another day? Given the large number of Robert B. Parker novels, you can bet on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"PLAYNATES","review":"NOT READ YET.

This is a must read for those embracing multi-culturalism, cosmopolitanism and the global economy. One thing for sure is that this novel is a thought-provoking, socially challenging and compelling read. I highly recommend it along with Disciples of Fortune, Sugar Street, The usurper and other Stories, which I found to be thought-provoking and insightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"An effort to finish","review":"I haven't read a book in a long time that I just wanted to give up on. I felt like it had a huge political agenda, which was very confusing to me and not of much interest. The names were very difficult to keep up with as well as the history. I finally finished it out of sheer determination. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless you are from Egypt, then you might grasp it's meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Read","review":"I, quite by accident, came upon this book, and enjoyed it from the very beginning. While, at first it was a bit difficult to follow, soon it became a wonderful and easy to read novel. I found the two love stories to be delightful to follow as well as the politics of the times, and the suprises the author served up made the storyline richer. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read about love or politics (sometimes, they turn out to be the same thing)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read!","review":"I chose this book on since I had heard that it was short listed for the Booker Prize. I ordinarily would not read something that is akin to a 'romance' book. However, I was impressed by Ms. Soueif's writing of the two intertwining tales. It was hard to follow at first, made sense after reading it for a while.The arabic text was great in the book since I have a rudimentary understanding of the language. I do think that it would turn off someone who did not have any knowledge of the language though. I felt that Ms. Soueif captured the feelings of the time periods accurately and it is ironic that modern-day Egypt is seing a surge in nationalism just as it did at the turn of the century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull love story","review":"Dull, dull, dull... The author tries too hard but the characters are simply too perfect to be interesting. Anna and her saintly devotion to her husband did not appeal to me at all.

A slow, difficult read which I wouldn't recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this book","review":"I had a hard time staying interested in this book.

I found it so disappointing that I gave up about a third of the way through it. I found the plots implausible, the characters 2 dimensional, and the poetic descriptions of Egypt beautiful but pretentious. I also agree with other reviewers that the use of Arabic was distracting, and came across as the author trying to prove her superiority to the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fantastic idea, poorly executed","review":"What a great idea for a novel - take two interesting, connected periods of tumult in Egyptian history, and compare them using a sweeping family saga of journals and personal relationships. Sounds interesting, right? The whole thing comes across as an unwieldly mess, unfortunately. I found myself trying really hard not to skip the \\"modern\\" passages, as they are the least interesting - and I am one who always reads cover to cover. The journals are probably the best (italics), as they are more focused and limited in scope. There are better books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anna's journal was the only things that kept me reading!","review":"I had a hard time getting through this book. It just never caught my interest. Half way through the book I ended up skipping the modern dialogue to read Anna's journal. That was easy since those parts were italicised. The arabic wasn't difficult for me because I have tourist knowledge of phrases/words. Anyone that doesn't might find it hard to get through those parts. It just wasn't a book I enjoyed very much or maybe I just wasn't in the right mood for that kind of book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Map of Love","review":"This book is a peculiar combination of bodice-ripping romance novel and historical fiction. The romance novel aspects are, as one would imagine, ridiculous and unbelievable. It was, however, interesting to read the political subplot toward the end of the novel to learn about Egyptians' responses to British (and, later, American) angling in the area. I'm hoping there are better novels out there that deal more meaningfully with these issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't get through it","review":"What a confusing style.

The idea for this novel is excellent and it could have been a remarkable book, but it is not. The intent of the author is obvious (too obvious), but not quite convincing. Anna's diary, quaint and very much late 19th century, saves the novel from becoming a tedious harangue.

Suffice to say, you can hardly recognize Cary Elwes in his make up in the role of Albert Bodine, host of \\"American Crime.\\" Rachael Leigh Cook, Kip Pardue and Annabella Sciorra all deserve better roles than the writers end up giving them.

His role as unhinged-movie-producer-from-hell in the Coen brothers' movie Barton Fink was exhilarating. As was his performance as superlawyer in The Man Who Wasn't There (the Coens certainly know talent when they see it).The only negative thing that can be said about Monk is that it's long overdue. The writing's good. It's very good actually. But some episodes are better than others. In Monk Meets Dale the Whale, for example, the dialogue is badly dubbed and the continuity is choppy and hiccupy. The storylines are mostly standard TV show plots, some even seem recycled from old episodes of Streets of San Francisco or Scooby Doo. So you shouldn't watch Monk for the ingenious plots - it's Monk's phobia-intensive behaviour and case-solving talent that we're after. Well, that and Sharona's great legs. And the theme tune is great. I sure hope those two get it together at the end; Sharona has appalling taste in men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this.","review":"If you already have Season 1 don't buy this DVD it is included in Season 1. I now have this single DVD that I don't need for my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon- watch out for your customers!","review":"I like Amazon and I love Monk, but they are not watching out for their customers by recommending a title that is included on season 1. Do they read their customer reviews? The good ones only come from the fact that the episode is awesome, but why buy one episode for little less than the cost of the whole season. Get it together Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"crazy works for me","review":"Technically, the DVD was perfect. The content? I am embarrassed now to admit that I only caught a few minutes of an early Monk episode and thought 'this guy is crazy! I am not going to watch this show ever again.' Then I found out what the premise was, started watching in the fourth season and was so enchanted that I had to go back and buy the earlier episodes. Cast is great, characters are a heck of a lot of fun and there is development in practically every episode. I recommend this show for all ages and each episode has something that gets missed amidst the laughter so it is nice to have so that I can watch them several times. Something new pops up each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monk - the complete first season","review":"Today, 19th January, 2004, and I see an ad in Vanity fair that announces \\"Monk - the complete first season now available on DVD\\".

When I first started reading it, I FREAKED OUT!!! The material it covers (and not well enough if you do not already know it) is WAY more advanced then the questions on the test. My money was better spent taking the practice test on line and focusing on the areas I needed to review (like basic geometry, basic biology, etc.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"I studied for the NYS CST-Multi subject and I did not need to. The questions that are within the sample tests and the topics that emphasized in this book scared me because they were really difficult and content specific. When I took the test, most of the questions were based on reading and then answering a question that followed. A lot of the questions were common sense. This book was the worst test prep book ever and none of the material was on the multi subject and I consider my studying from this to be a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is a great book purchase, I passed the exam. Look for it yourself and see.

For example, one question in this book asks about tRNA, mRNA, nucleotides etc. I haven't thought about tRNA since highschool AP Bio. Yet this book had me believing that the Multi-subject CST would have all these difficult questions in it. Like a previous reviewer said, most of the questions on the real test are common sense.

She's strong, she uses profanity, but her children know she's only trying to get their attention in their language, she's strong and she knows their every thought. Children don't realize that mothers are like that until middle age and their own children are grown. I love the way she let Cecil go after realizing that she just wasn't stone crazy about him anymore, like she was at the beginning of their relationship. I like the way she realized that the change of life can mean a new life if you just accept the change for what it is and realize that some good can come of it. The best part was when her children and Cecil realized that Viola was still a huge part of their lives and her memory lives on and so will her love for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terry is back","review":"I read this a while back around when it first came out.

My book club \\"Sister to Sister\\" in Sicily, picked this book for Our February read because we wanted something exciting, and we made a good choice. After reading the excerts, I couldn't wait for the book to hit the shelves. Viola and her family kept me thoroughly entertained throughout the entire book. At times I laughed outloud and others I cried. The book touched me emotionally. I must say this book was also very realistic, although most families won't admit it. But inspite of their trials and tribulations,and their individual problems, in the end, they came together as a family,and thats what really mattered."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL GOOD THINGS TAKE TIME","review":"When I read books by Ms. McMillian it takes me home to my family and people in my life. I also live in the Bay Area as does Ms McMillian, and it's wonderful the way she involves our area into her stories. Bottom line: This is just another wonderful piece of work by the Master Ms. Millian! I applaud her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time....","review":"I've never read a Terry McMillan book before because I just watched the movies and was never really interested in reading her books. Reading this one certainly didn't make me want to read another. The only reason I read it is because it was one of my book club selections.This book is very dry, it's toooo detailed and very depressing. It's basically about a mother, her selfish kids and their issues. The first few chapters of this book is the most depressing part because the mother goes on and on and on with unnecessary detail about how her kids and husband have hurt her, themselves or other people. Almost every character in this book, right down to the grandkids has issues. There's humor in this book, also tragedy but it wasn't enough to make up for the poor writing. Also, this was not proofread well because there are an abundance of type errors in it.This was not a good read at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing novel with deep character development","review":"Wonderful. McMillan gets inside the head of each member of the Price family by writing each in first person in successive chapters. May have been difficult to write, but it makes for an exciting and intimate read. The themes -- sibling relationships, spousal relationships, parent-child relationships, self-discovery -- easily transcend cultural boundaries because these themes are fundamental to all humans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terry has done it again!!!!","review":"I was absolutely drawn into Terry's latest novel. I was up into the wee hours of the morning, because I just could not put the book down. The characters are so real and the passion which Ms. McMillan writes her novels is overwhelming. The book was so good, \\"Dare I say'\\", this is her best one yet????"},{"rating":"1","title":"WEAK!!!","review":"This is one of McMillan's weakest books. It literally took me forever to get through it. I read the first 10 pages of this book, then set it down on my bookshelf. That was 3 years ago. I decided to finally finish reading the book this summer (2004). I haven't had to force myself to read a book like that in such a long time. She uses a lot of characters in this novel, so much so that she created a family tree in the inside cover just to keep the readers (and herself) from getting so confused. The story line itself is not as rich as her other plots. I'm a big fan of McMillan and have read all of her novels. However, this book just does not do her writing or story-telling skills any justice. She should have written a caveat emptor in her prologue that read \\"Buyer beware. You'll be disappointed right down to the very last sentence of this novel.\\" I hope McMillan redeems authorship in more current novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacking","review":"This is the third book of Terry's I've read. I felt there was something lacking from this book, and it seems to me that Terry's stories always end so abruptly. It's as if she's trying to keep her books to a 400-page minimum and is forced to end her stories neatly and quietly, rushing to explain and gloss over how the story ends. As I'm reading, the author explains to the hilt, but yet during her final chapter, everything is just glossed over and/or left hanging. And did I miss something while reading this? What happened with Janelle's pregnancy? The author kept bringing it up, bringing it up, and then: we hear no more of what happened. Did she have it, give it away, abort it...? Maybe I skipped those pages where it was explained. The concept was interesting and from the reviews, I thought this book would be a little humorous and a little more interesting. I was disappointed. There was a lot of rambling and the story really didn't fit together too well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath Taking","review":"This book will have you laughing, crying and thinking all in one sentence. The story it self is so real and easy to relate to. Excellent job Ms. McMillan"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the .......!","review":"This book seemed like the watered down version of Momma. The reason I didn't give it a zero was because it had a few good parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it.","review":"I have some of Terry McMillian's novels and they were really good, but this one, I just couldn't seem to get past chapter 2. I tried and tried, but if I can't get past chapter 2 then I don't see the rest of the book being that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much","review":"After reading A Day Late and a Dollar Short, i was disappointed after reading all 400 something pages. Depressing is the first word that comes to mind, because the book saddened me. The characters were angry, hurt, jealous, insulting and disrepectful to each other. No one was happy nor as family members did they like each other. This was a bit much to bear with 6 characters from the same family, from the mother to the youngest adult child. There was some of the usual McMillan humor when it comes to talking about people, and being descriptive these parts were very funny. The most light-hearted part of the story. I have been a fan of Terry McMillan since her first book, waitng all this time for the new book was disappointing. I hope her next book will deliver another message other than people are miserable and enjoying it, not real, not cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mama Knows Best","review":"I hate to put a \\"me too\\" review here but that's what this amounts too. I too think McMillan's latest novel is quite good and one of her best.A Day Late and Dollar Short takes us through the travails of the Price family and they all, including the matriarch of the family, Viola, have flaws. What's endearing about this book is that Viola knows each of her children, her husband, and herself, so well and McMillan does a fine job at building the characters of each member of the family that by the end of the novel, we feel we know them well too. And Viola proves that she knows herself well too and her coda is truly heart warming and uplifting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Engrossing","review":"This book was enthralling. I found that I could relate to it. Personally, felt that I knew everyone in the book as they seemed like members of my own family.The language and dialogue in the book were also realistic, making it even easier to understand and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing read!","review":"This book is one of the best books I've ever read.I laughed, I cried, I went through every emotion with them. Definitely a great read for a female of any age.Must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"This book demonstrates why Terry McMillan is hands down my favorite author.I've read this book numerous times and have yet to grow tired of it. TM's writing style is unique, funny, and unparalled by any other writer alive. This novel will make you laugh and cry because the characters and their stories are just so real and touching.I find it impossible that anyone who reads this book will find it anything less than amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Awesome","review":"I may be partly biased when it comes to this book seeing that I am truly a fan of Terry McMillian. But I must admit this book is truly awesome! Terry has not lost her touch at all! She continues to make you feel like you have known these characters all of your life, and that you are somehow connected to them by blood. I am not a very emotional person but I knew this book was a winner when I found myself crying at one part. It is a must read for all families that are not so \\"normal\\" (are any of us?). Dont miss out on this great read and come up \\"A day late and A Dollar Short\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Venturing away from the norm","review":"Terry McMillan is renowned for her witty yet prolific ways of telling the modern African American love story with its ups and downs. I enjoyed this book immensely because she strayed away from this pattern of writing that has made her so popular. Because she is such a great writer, her readers will follow. This story (as her books in the past have done)is told from many different points of view which makes it strike everyone who reads it. Every reader will be able to relate to the story line of the book. Ms. McMillan totally captivates her audience and draws you into the world of the characters of her book. You will begin to develop feelings for the characters as if they are friends that you have known for years. This takes tremendous talent and Ms. McMillan should be commended, once again. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tamer Taste of Terry McMillan","review":"McMillan's latest novel will once again give fans a taste of her wonderful ability to bring characters to life. Each of her charcters is tragic and yet rises up to vindicate themselves by the end of the book. A Day Late and a Dollar short is not as racy or chic oriented as her last two novels, Waiting to Exhale and How Stella Got Her Groove Back. It's a good read but if you're craving the same saltiness you got from Exhale, hold your breathe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!!","review":"I'm not TM's biggest fan but I must admit... this book is greater than just five stars. I could not put the book down. It was an excellent read. I was a little disappoint with TM's \\"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\\" and was a little skeptical about purchasing this book.. I'm glad I did though. The characters are so real. This book is great, funny, and a \\"must-read\\". With each chapter I kept asking myself \\"is TM writing about my family?\\" Anyway, Please read this book. You all will enjoy it. I've passed this book to several of my friends and all of them enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terry What Happened","review":"I didn't actually buy this book, my sister loaned me her copy. I don't often question my sister's sanity but this is one of those times I considered having the girl drug tested. This book is not Terry McMillan. I think an alien life form invaded her body and wrote this for her. It was awful. The first chapter is as far as I got. The mother in this story spent far too much time bitching about her useless children. After reading complaint after complaint I was ready to kill the mother ,the kids ,Terry ,and my sister. Terry can write better than this. I have her other books and was deeply disappointed by this one. Terry that young man must be wearing you out because you failed with this book. Don't buy it, it's not worth the money or time. Buy her other books you'll enjoy them more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous!","review":"This book is basically the plots of every Oprah Bookclub Book ever written and shoved into one book.

It portrays the family dynamics to which many of us can relate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun","review":"A Day Late and a Dollar Short is a very fun read. It's the story of an American family, three sisters, one brother and their separated parents. Each family member tells his or her story from his or her opinionated point of view. Each story is both funny and sad and every one is well told. The narrative starts with Viola, the family matriarch, who is recovering from a severe asthma attack and is in the hospital. She goes on about all of her family members, including her estranged husband, alternatively picking out their faults and praising them. One by one, each of them chimes in with their own story, but we eventually learn that Viola pretty much had them all pegged in the opening chapter. We learn about family traumas, family squabbles. Each character is likable and amusing, and each will face down a difficult challenge before this novel ends. I truly enjoyed reading this one. Have fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DAY LATE AND A DOLLAR SHORT","review":"This book is wonderful. I think it is the best one Ms McMillian has written yet. The characters are so real and I can see many families going through the same thing. I love the book, one miunte I was laughing out loud, the next I was crying my eyes out. Although the story holds your interest with the interaction of characters the ending blows you away. I have already pasted this book on to several friends and we all believe this is just another movie waiting to come to life. My hat is off to you Ms McMillian."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read- The Best!","review":"Ms McMillan's latest book touched my heart, my soul and my spirit - and what a surprise ending! I have never cried this much from reading a novel- I cried at work and finished it on the subway. The author makes you a part of the Price family and you really get to know, to love and care about these characters.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"McMillan Does it Again","review":"This book was great, there were no slow moments, it just barreled along. The characters were so real, dealing with a lot of issues that come up in not so perfect family. But, I loved the conclusion to it all. It made me laugh and cry, reminded me of a lot of women and men in my own family. It was like Terry McMillan had been at one of my family reunions."},{"rating":"2","title":"TERRY'S BEST BY FAR","review":"A Day Late is a remarkable work of fiction, which does'nt feel like fiction because it's so true to life in so many ways. As another reviewer stated, it is similar to Soul Food, but the Price family is more dysfunctional. Each chapter is told through the eyes of one of the family members, which is helpful because it gives the actual voice of each character with clarity and depth to help the reader understand the characters personality and feelings. The tragic incident in the book really got to me to the point where I had to put the book down for awhile and re-group. This book is about family and how important family is and to be careful how you treat family because you only have one. I had not enjoyed one of Terry's books since Waiting To Exhale prior to reading A Day Late, which is undeniably her best to date. Terry put her foot in this one y'all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Yet","review":"I enjoyed this book from first to last page! Terry, you've outdone yourself! I read it in a day and a half because I simply couldn't put it down. I really couldn't. I laughed and cried but mostly laughed. I certainly saw my family and myself in this book. Anyone who has a family of any kind will relate to this family in many ways. It seems like everywhere I go I see people reading this book. Now I understand why. I saw six people reading it on the bus the week before I purchased it. After I purchased it, at least five people have asked me to let them read it. The word is definitely out on this one.Never has a book made me feel that maybe my family is human after all.Thank you for such a fabulous read. I look forward to the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved It","review":"Okay, Terry is back and she hit the nail on the head with this one. YO GO GIRL! I truly enjoyed this book. The family members will make scream, holler and shout. They were so real and alive. We all know folks like them or maybe we can see ourselves as one of them. The family ties were immensely portrayed. I so no predjudice. Terry can tell this story, our story, her story, not many can. I could definitely relate. This would be a good movie if all were included. No changes allowed! Ms Vy was something but she only wished the best for her children and she didn't mind telling them in life and in ............. EXCELLENT JOB TERRY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of my favorites","review":"I could go on and on here but in my personal opinion i couldn't get into this book because i thought that it lacked character development.

That lack of emotional attachment filtered into the book so it was hard for me to get through. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"A feel-good book that actually felt good to read.","review":"I have a secret soft spot for Terry McMillan's books, even though I have to say that I roundly dislike much of the other books in this category. She writes with an infectious energy, eye for detail, and sense of character that is nearly impossible to dislike. I don't mind the emotional manipulation because it feels well-meant and in the end it's both satisfying and effective. I enjoyed reading this book.Minor quibbles: while I liked the device of the letters, it was a bit *too* pat; the pacing felt off in the second half of the book-- moved too quickly to its conclusion somehow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read","review":"Ms.Mc Millan has done it again.

The way the book is written with each character telling their side of the story, made me care for each of them. I felt like I was apart of the family.

The characters' monologues revealed too much and violated the \\"show don't tell\\" policy that EVERY CREATIVE WRITING STUDENT IS TOLD. A cliche, yes, but it is nonetheless true. Aside from their manner of speaking, there was not much difference in the personality of each character. And the monologues ran on for too long--I wanted more scenes, more action, more dialogue that revealed the character rather the character telling the reader what they are like. The tough issues raised in this novel were glossed over. Why bring up such matters if they can't be handled with more depth instead of being explained away in one sentence: \\"Oh, she doesn't have that problem anymore.\\" All in all, the book was too expository, it was not well written, and it was Mama: The Sequel! Better yet, \\"The Price Monologues.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Just more prejudice from Terry!","review":"This is a bad book.

It is an absolute must for every serious student of Jefffeson or the times he lived in. At times Malone's personal preferences and opinions creep into the narrative. This can be seen most clearly during his discussion of Jefferson's draft of the Kentucky Resolutions. Due to his clear Unionist slant, it seems almost as if he is apologizing for Jefferson's ardent state's rights sentiments. Nevertheless, every important issue and event in Jefferson's long life is dealth with ably and with ample documentation, leaving the reader to decide what he or she feels. It is amazing that one man devoted the last four decades of his life to writing this work. All I can say is that it was a noble enterprise, and that the world is in his debt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential book on Jefferson","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot. I agree with the reviewer that said it was one-sided, but I've never read a Jefferson book that wasn't. (Read Joseph Ellis' American Sphinx to get a more critical view). It reads like a narrative, perhaps the only way to understand Jefferson's complex world. One shortcoming of this style is that it doesn't provide analysis, which I usually appreciate. A lot of it is \\"just the facts.\\" But it is a great portrait of Jefferson as he emerges onto the national scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I bought the six volumes because of the positive reviews by by experts. However, I agree with some of the critical consumer reviews that the text contains too many details thatr sometimes obscure the main events and that Malone sees Jefferson as a great man with hardly any faults. I think that Jefferson is a very interesting, important and enigmatic man and I have tried to find a biography that is more balanced. I doubt if ther is such a biography and that is very odd. Has no historian been able to do him credit?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend this product","review":"This product is labeled for ages 9 - 12 years old, but is very juvenile.

Then, of course, they are banded together by a common enemy, which enables them to work together and form a fantastic, taking-over-the-world team.When I read the back of \\"Tall Poppies\\" to find this plotline articulated on the back, I nearly cried.Why would her publishers, and the readers go in for the same thing over and over again?I don't rate it at all.

If you're hoping to see Leticia Perdigon's full frontal nudity here, forget it. Censored. Ironically this is one movie wherein she bares more of herself than she does in her other films. As for Spanish cutie Veronica Miriel, her full frontal scenes are also cut. At least the censors weren't as offended by breasts and backsides as much as they were by vaginas.

The passenger who started singing(and got everyone else to go along) during a filming of turbulence.

How it managed to be so short and PG-13, I'm not sure. Only complaint about the DVD is there's no trailer, other than that, it was great!

(hey, Murphy and McAdams).The setup was better than the eventual conclusion, but it was a nice two-hour diversion. And if you haven't seen it yet, it's probably worth a rental, not a purchase. The movie doesn't have enough substance/depth to it to warrant a deeper look.

Returning from her grandmother's funeral she meets a man who seems quite likeable, but is really a villian. Lisa works as a manager at a hotel in Miami where the deputy secretary of homeland security and his family are taking a room. Our villian tells Lisa she is to help him put this man and his family in a position to be killed or her father will die. What would you do?At first the movie is slow going as the plot is laid, but once this fiesty woman decides to fight back hold onto your hat.She's stuck between a rock and a hard place but is determined not to be the loser. I felt this movie had a great story, really good acting and I loved the way it ended. A giggle after the suspense was icing on the cake. I think you'll like this one and recommend you give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cillian Murphy is the best thing about this film!","review":"I'm sorry but there are just too many things about this plot that is left to coincidence. How could the bad guys plan the plane delay and what if the Homeland Security person simply refuse to move? Plus the darn missle nearly knocked out the whole floor. Seems to me that it didn't need to be that exact room. I liked the fact that heroine had a steel backbone and didn't need any rescuing. It's also very scary how both parties were able to escape the airport after landing after she stabbed him in the neck. 9/11 hasn't changed much (which is probably closer to reality than I like think).Overall, I can't believe this elaborate plan to kill the Homeland Security director all hendged on a hotel manager--but whatever."},{"rating":"1","title":"D.O.A not that thrilling at all","review":"not once did i think to my self something bad could happen to this girls dad maybe she didint play the part that good or maybe the plot sucked or both. but this movie feels like a rip off of air force one in a sence. if you wanna watch a movie about hostages watch the movie HOSTAGE and if you want to watch a good movie by WES CRAVEN watch a nightmare on elm street"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless Formulaic Snoozefest - Craven needs a blood transfusion","review":"Glossy as any Hollywood cookiecutter thriller, this marks a low point in Wes Craven's career. Wes Craven has disowned his earliest, most twisted works, and his career since Nightmare on Elm Street has been a quest to break out of his horror film cubbyhole. The Scream series was a respectable compromise; he could churn up plenty of rent money by reinventing the slasher film, while demonstrating that he was above it all by cleverly sending up the genre.This movie is not clever, or imaginative, or much of anything other than a waste of time. The plot points are contrived, the director cheats with lazy jumps in the action which undercut any real suspense, and there is nothing we haven't seen done before, and better. Except maybe one scene, and that's not worth the price of admission.Hope ole Wes pocketed some major change for this one. Hitchcock it ain't."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.75 stars","review":"interesting but short, i like it the suspence and the thrill of it the actor who played the bad guy Cillian Murphy just his eyes alone send chills through my body..Not a bad movie just really shortish..."},{"rating":"2","title":"...fast action and short running time makes [Red Eye] a good thriller","review":"Red Eye is a fast paced suspenseful thriller from the director of the Scream movies, Wes Craven, and starring Rachel McAdams (The Notebook) and Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins).McAdams plays hotel manager Lisa who is on her way to see her father when she meets a mysterious man named Jackson, played brilliantly by Murphy, at the airport right before boarding. While they're on the airplane, Jackson reveals to Lisa that he is plotting to assassinate a homeland security official that is staying at the hotel where Lisa works, and that if she doesn't cooperate with him to move the official to the floor where the killers can get him, her father will die.The movie's fast action and short running time makes it a successful thriller. And it's definitely McAdams and Murphy that turn this simple film into a worthwhile spectacle.RecommendedB-"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic film for a fantastic director","review":"when i went to see this movie i thought it would be fantastic.when the movie finished i wasn't at all dissapointed.

Now there are some plot holes in the screenplay, but the set is original and the execution is still very exciting. Mcadams and Murphy are both good in this movie.

So predictable. Characters are not interesting. Story is boring. Just a movie for someone to make money off. Very sad considering the fact it came from Wes Craven. Was expecting much much more. Do not see this movie, it's a waste of time. If Zero stars was an option I would have clicked on that."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Wes Craven film I can remember seeing","review":"Demonstrates to me that he is essentially at sea without a supernatural leitmotif in his movies, nothing wrong with that but he should stick to what he is good at.This was too plodding and predictable to watch, had to turn it off half way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Eye Needs Visine","review":"A child of Wes Craven's carefully designed horror genre, an 80s veteran of a good scare flick that comes with the name, I was physically ill when I found I had to walk out of Red Eye. The old man has lost it. A trite, predictable wanna-be scare flick, it does nothing more than bore. What's worse, public reviews compare the foul flick to Hitchcock. What a sad generation of film goers we must be training if this poorly conceived trick flick ranks, in their eyes, with Hitchcock. What's even worse than that, is the scare tactics the trailers and advertising for the film used to promise me the threat of death, danger, and devastation at 35,000 feet and instead, some prissy girl is merely threatened by a smarmy man. The end. I cried over my lost $25 bucks and a ruined Saturday night. Red Eye requires, as always, some Visine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Eye?","review":"I can think of a better title for this movie: Snoozefest.

As far as \\"Flightplan\\" goes, that one isn't much better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAYBE WES SHOULD STICK TO HORROR FILMS?","review":"The first half of RED EYE is fairly suspensful and absorbing mostly due to the excellent evil-doer acting of Cillian Murphy, who \\"kidnaps\\" our heroine, played by Rachel McAdams, on a red eye flight in order to assassinate a Home Security bigwig. Thriller movies like this rise or fall depending on the quality of the actor playing the villian (and the script backing him or her up). Reference is made to DIE HARD as an example where a strong and interesting villain character made the film. And for the first part of RED EYE we have a suave, clever, smooth, manipulative, dangerous bad guy in Mr. Murphy. Then, suddenly, all that falls apart. Murphy's character becomes a pathetic victim of the super woman heroine. But we won't give away any more plot information. The point is, it went from scary believeable to laugh-out-loud unbelieveable. Wes Cravens, the horror film vet, directed this non-horror effort. Perhaps he should stick to the horror genre in future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Movie!","review":"The director should be arrested for directing such a horrible, idiotic and meaningless movie! The movie looks like its been directed by a partially reformed football hooligan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and predictible ...","review":"I love Rachel McAdams and, therefore, came into this movie with bias. However, adoration for her acting wasn't enough to make me believe that this movie is a must-see.The film begins with a deceiving fast-pace vibe ... you think you're in for a plot-twisting ride only to later learn that all you'll ever get thrill from is what you already saw in the trailer.McAdams does her part, as does the directing, but the story is lacking. There was potential to add more twists and such, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good thriller","review":"This is a really good psychological thriller. I was surprised that there was not any gore, which I don't care for anyway. There were lapses in the action, but this just left time to wonder what would happen next. The actors were very believable, and the chemistry between the two main actors was intriguing. The main character's secret was a good back story; however, some of the villains' motivations were not very well explained. It had a very American feel though, with the underdog fighting back and ultimately winning at the end of the movie. It was not a scary movie, but a mess-with-your-mind movie. Very nice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"i was waiting,and waiting,and waiting,and............","review":"FOR THE YAPPING TO END! when it finally did,i was ready to see a good cat and mouse chase.cillian played a very good bad guy in an creepy way.he did his homework and anticipated her evey move.that is until she picked up that pen(thats all ill type on that)very cool!but from that moment on,he went from cunning crimminal to bumbling buffoon.

Soukous are a style of African music, based off Rumba, that originated in the Congo and spread out across the rest of the continent. After hearing this CD, a wonderful compilation from the Rough Guides, you will definately understand why Soukous were popular enough to spread across Africa! This CD gives a great overview of Soukous, focusing on selections from the Congo.All the music on this CD is dancey and upbeat, like Soukous should be. Several big names, including Franco, Sam Mangwana, Koffi Olomide and Papa Wemba appear on this CD, giving classical performances. Indeed, I'd say that \\"Cooperation\\" is easily one of the most popular Soukous of all time. Old and new appear side by side on this CD. If you are unfamilar with Soukous, or even the music of the Congo in general, you should consider buying this CD. Its a magnificent introduction to Soukous. And even if you don't speak Lingala, you will find yourself addicted to this music."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Scholar style","review":"This is a good book.

The feeling you get when you look at and read this book is a profound longing for your loved one. It is really overwhelming. I was hooked from the author's introduction (and I rarely read the introductions). This book is a celebration of love between man and woman. Some of the stories are humorous sketches from authors such as Mark Twain, or poems from e e cummings or an excerpt from Hawthorn's Lady Chatterly's Lover.

The CD sounds just like a normal CD with added high tones, as if the EQ was tuned to boost high frequencies. The cd is not multichannel, something I think every SACD should be at least, but the worst thing is that it is FLAT in sound. The drums have absolutely no depth nor any body to them and sound processed according to Japanese style. The Japanase don't like fat drums, they like ienimienie-drums.This record has definatly lost it's \\"Soul\\".So if you still have an old record ( LP ) or such from Marvin, then do yourself a favor and play that instead of this.

Unfortunately about 2 weeks ago it stopped working, for reasons unknown to me. It looks like its working, the FM radio works fine, but its not transmitting a signal to my radio anymore.Anyway:Pros-Clear signal, better than any transmitter I've used before.-Uses the iPods power, so I don't have to worry about turning it off or replacing any batteries.-Able to quick scan for a clear signal if the one I'm using changes-Able to program in my favorite stations to use or listen toCons-Can't charge my iPod while using it (fair tradeoff IMO)-Doesn't fit very well if you have a case for your iPod-A little loose fitting, can fall out if you move it suddenly"},{"rating":"2","title":"works","review":"i have a 80g video ipod and i must say, the transmitter works great, only thing, is that i have an ipod case and can charge my ipod without removing the case but to use the FM transmitter i have to remove the case everytime... not a problem, just wish i didn't have to move it each time.all in all, i have no real issue with it and would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"a Great Product","review":"A great product.

It has pretty good reception, but I usually just listen to a play list. This type of thing is great in theory, but most of the people I know who have these types of things always seem to use them a couple of times then leave them in the glove box until the next road trip. I would advise most people to use the cost of this to get a car stereo with an \\"audio in\\" jack, or true Ipod/Car integration. That is a much less aggravating solution to getting Mr. Ipod to play nice with Mr. Car Radio. It does run off the battery of the Ipod, and it suck power at a very fast rate, so keep that in mind before leaving on a 6 hour car ride.

The characters lacked depth and the plot lacked continuity and originality. Sean Dillon, the primary protagonist, is a wholly uninteresting James Bond clone and the actions of January 30, the terrorist troup against which Dillon is aligned in \\"Angel\\", are poorly motivated.

I would have given it a one, except for the action in the first 80 pages. After that it gets boring. The terrorist group January 30 is no match for uber-secret agent Sean Dillon. Not that Dillon is a pushover, but I would have been able to take on this group. There are only 4 members - a bureaucratic KGB man with NO BEARING on the story whatsoever; a double-crossing Parliament official, Rupert Lang (like Sir Frances Pamer in Thunder Point); Lang's lover, Professor Tom Curry; and Grace Browning, actress/terrorist. Hardly The Dirty Dozen. Jack, if you're gonna make James Bond-like books, you might as well create Bond-esque villains who want to destroy England or whatever. Only for hardcore Dillon/Higgins fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I happened to think this was a passable novel. Jack has always been better with historical fiction. Maybe I'm just biased, seeing as how I love the period of WWI and WWII. Read Night of the Fox and others to get the best from this author.Dillon has never been my favorite character. The story picked up a bit toward the end. The KGB agent didn't have much to do. Rupert Lang was pretty neat. I like3d the way his plot wrapped up. I think Jack should have written more of a chase scene or something when Ferguson confronted Lang about the gun. The guy just ran away. Blast! Well, better call Dillon.Tom Curry was taken out too quick. The attempted killing of Keogh was okay. The scenes with Dillon down in the pit were tiresome."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"It's hard to believe that the same man who wrote \\"The Eagle Has Landed\\" wrote this. This book has a choppy, unconnected plot,and follows a formula which Higgins has used for far too long now. His books are now all the same; maybe the names of the villains change, but they all fit into the same category. That may have worked for Ian Fleming, but Sean Dillon is nothing but a cheap ripoff of James Bond. Higgins would be better served if he stuck to writing historical thrillers, such as the two \\"Eagle\\" books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sean Dillon is just too good to be true...","review":"Angel of Death is a lightweight entry into the political thriller field. The biggest problem I had with this book is that the characters were just too cool to be believable.

Miller's playing is very simple and straightforward, and sometimes, as in the title track, monotonous. His tone is very breathy, almost creaky in spots -- nothing like the richness of Mary Youngblood or the complexity of Kevin Locke. The pieces in which Miller pairs his flute with guitar I find to be stronger than the solo pieces. If you want to hear solo flute, listen to Kevin Locke's \\"Dream Catcher\\", Robert Tree Cody's \\"Dreams from the Grandfather\\", or Mary Youngblood's \\"The Offering\\". If you are interested in Native flute in an ensemble setting, with guitars, drums, and voice, then listen to Mary Youngblood's second album, \\"Heart of the World\\" for acoustic music, or Robert Mirabal's \\"Taos Tales\\" for more electric sounds.

While the initial premise brings to mind far superior entries such as the classic Dracula X or Legacy of Darkness, this pales in comparison to those and, even more insultingly, taints the characters from a previous entry, Bloodlines, with their insulting inclusion in this extremely lacking and excessively dull Castlevania. While graphically superb and good sound-wise for the most part, pretty pictures and good music (with mostly good voice acting) do not excuse the terrible story, lacking gameplay, and outright frustrating attempts at accommodating the gimmicky insertions.

An autobiography as told to a professional writer, this text is extremely valuable in showing the real world risks and rewards faced by George Rushby as he sought adventure, found it, and went on to become a professional game warden. While not as action packed as a novel could be, it is hard to imagine a more adventurous life, unless it was the early hunters that colonized the new world.

The DVD interviews and extras really support what I already suspected - that Rob and Chris have a deep friendship that goes beyond roomates or employer/employee. I espcially love the \\"Meaty Reel\\" that just shows highlights of his growth from little pup to full-grown Meat Bag. Skaters may enjoy Rob's tutorials at the end of each disc, but my favorite feature is finally being able to hear the full dialogue without all the annoying FCC beeps. These guys are just fun and funny to watch, and the episodes don't get old after multiple viewings.

I have not had that experience with my iMac or my Maxtor external HDD. However, he has also pointed out that the stiffness of the cable combined with those loose-fitting connectors make it easy to tap the cable and for it to come unseated. This may be a concern for some, but I simply have my backup HDD sitting on my desk next to my iMac and connected with this cable, and I've never had a problem with a cable coming loose.

Both the 800 and the 400 ends of the cable fit very loosely, so the slightest movement causes the connection to be temporarily broken. For most firewire devices, this means that the device will lose synch, interrupt whatever you were trying to do, and spend a painfully long time trying to re synch with the computer. It doesn't help that the cable is as stiff as a coat hanger, so the slightest movement will move the connectors. If anything touches this cable it will break the connection, so you end up tip-toeing around this thing trying to keep it happy. Yes, it does work. If you have to get from 400 to 800, it will do it. But this one is guaranteed to make you angry."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was supposed to be a Tripp Lite cable...","review":"This did not arrive in a Tripp Lite-branded bag, despite the assurance on this product page According to the blurb on this page, I should not accept this, as it appears to be a substitute.

This is not an isolated incident. Other reviewers have complained about ordering this product and only receiving the standard cable, instead of the higher-quality gold cable.

I tested all ports on each device with other computers and cables, which worked flawlessly. Using the Vortex 800 to 400 cable though was a different story:I plugged the 400 side into the Motu unit, and the 800 side into the Macbook Pro. This action instantaneously shut off my Macbook Pro, as if it shorted somewhere inside the computer.This is a dangerous cable, I am resorting to using the USB port on the Motu/Mac, and powering the Motu separately with an AC Adapter.It was shipped and delivered quite ahead of time though, two days ahead of schedule to be exact.

The firebox has a firewire 400 port, and the MacBook Pro has the 800 port, so this cable is just what I needed. It works well and is pretty fast. The only complaint I have is the cable is a little stiff and fits somewhat loosely into the 800 port. You can wiggle it around in the 800 port, but it's snug enough to not come out if you don't mess with it. Overall, great product for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but not the same as pictured.","review":"Basically I will say the same as another reviewer. The cable showed up in generic plastic bag packaging, no Tripp Lite Logos like they boast to have, and the cable is not gold plated, like they picture.

These include the mouse that simply refuses most of the time to double click, or single click, or move smoothly. I'm a PC tech, so all standard troubleshooting was done.

Whereas Mr Sander's humor was understated, with this new guy, imagine getting hit in the face with a 2x4 over and over and over again and that's what his handling of the narrative feels like. It's very sad. So many fond memories...every year, taking the newest Archie McNally book on vacation, reading it on the beach...laughing at Archie's hilarious aside.

Archy shows off his heartless side when it comes to his treatment of Binky (he tolerated him a little bit better in the previous novels). I almost felt sorry for Binky after Archy refuses to go to his party and tries to steal his love, Bianca. This is a colder, harder Archy we're seeing. As for the plot, yes it's very convoluted, and we could have done without the subplot involving Bianca--it went absolutely nowhere.

It is so hard to put this into words, but with the mystery was lackluster and the characters so two dementional I had to actually \\"plod\\" through this book. Thankfully many authors, upon their death, have their characters die with them and I think that is as it should be. I trust like other series characters written in Sanders's life time (Edward X.

The group works well together here. This is a real classic Spyro album. Most Spyro fans I know don't really have a strong opinion on it, but none of them really dispize it. I see where the title of this album came from, but it's a bit unaccurate.

I'd suggest Prep if you are interested in a book about high school life. This Whores book is about reality for girls without parenting.Very dark. Very 80's. Very small town. Also, this book does have many grammatical and sentence structure errors so it is hard to follow. It's not written very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Admiration for the power of literature","review":"This story of Catholic School girls struggling towards adulthood paints a vivid world. Each moment is interesting and forces the reader to continue. A somewhat brief tale, it accomplishes so much more than it's length implies. As unsettling as Curran's portrayals of teenage girls might seem, it really is the author's style that sets Whores on the Hill apart from many other novels. By combining short chapters with gorgeously written prose that portrays the confusion and anxiety of being a teenage girl, Curran's novel unfolds as a series of vignettes that create their own separate reality. A must read for anyone who appreciates well written prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"SASSY","review":"Poolside reading only. This is not a book for casual reading. You want to keep reading it to get to the juicy parts. Does she kill herself? Does she have an abortion? Does she ...Does she.. I don't want to ruin the storyline. I don't think this is appropriate reading material for teenagers but I do think young adults will find the book to be hilarious. The characters will remind you of someone you know. The story is all too familiar no matter where you went to school. I'm not sure why the author has the setting in an all-girls school... that part did not make any sense to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"is it just me?","review":"I don't know why but is seems to me that I am the only one here who appreciates a well written literary work. This book is awesome and actually quite realistic (obviously it is part autobiography). This book was very touching and surreal. What happened in the book was a reality shock and it leaves you with much to think about. I really did come to sympathize with the characters, especially Julie. Out of the three main characters I felt worse for her. Especially the whole \\"Will you take me to the prom now?\\" scene.What I really didn't understand was the whole Deb Scott thing and Thisbee's father thing? Overall I really did like the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A girls life","review":"Colleen Curran offers a true to life look at how girls, who unable to control their lives, resort to controlling their bodies using sexuality, food and self-violence. The characters and plot are action packed, mirroring how teenage girls react to instead of taking control of their lives. Colleen captured the awkwardness, pain and hope for the future we all felt as we became women.I wish Whores had been written 20 years ago. Reading it would have saved my 16 year old life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the plot?","review":"And.....? So the story is about the lives of 3 girls. whoop-dee-doo.Where is the actual story..

I should know--I went to one in Philly. Corran's portrait of the three \\"whores\\" is almost magical. As you watch and feel them living this coming-of-age tale, you can't but to think to yourself: this couldn't be entirely real and you question some of their choices, but for some reason you want to be them all the same. The characters are finely drawn and the plot is captivating. Mostly though, this book embodies a 15-year-old's fantasy of what she fears she is missing. It's almost a love letter to that."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of time","review":"Normally I don't see the need to pick on first-time-novelists. They did manage to finish a book. But on the other hand, this stuff is taking up spaces in bookstores where decent -- or even fun -- literature could be instead. Whores on the Hill has a catchy title and it ends there. It is flat-out poorly written and it's clear it's been a VERY long time since the author was a midwest teenager. The only part that makes me think she's plugged in to how teenagers talk or what they want to read is that this reminds me of a 9th grade writing project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for your child","review":"[...] The content is not what our young readers are looking for nor need to have. There are much better and well-written books out there on this topic. This author has typos and both grammatical and sentence structure errors throughout. It was poorly written and poorly edited by the publisher. This author seems to be a rebel. She seems to have the need to tell her story. I think teenagers seem to have a need to talk to their parents about these issues not read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring book","review":"The characters do not speak to you. In fact, they put me to sleep. After Chapter 3, it is easy to lose interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book - great summer read!","review":"I just finished this book and loved it! I really liked the different style of writing that the author used - it pulled you in as a reader and made you really care and feel for these girls. I grew up in the Midwest and could totally relate to life of the main character - being young is hard and it was refreshing to read about subject matter than most authors stay away from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"Finally a good book! I loved this thing. The girls weren't one dimentional like I was afraid they might be. I could understand why a lot of people might not like this book (or even hate it) but I think a lot of young people would see a little, tiny bit of themselves in this book. Hopefully they weren't as crazy as these girls were! Anyways, I'd recomend this book to any slightly open-minded person who doesn't freak out over little things."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOTY CALL","review":"Wake up girls.

Sentence fragments abound.The stories are ok, but there is no cleverness to the writing.For a more literary experience and better stories, in a seafaring vein, try1) the Horatio Hornblower series by C.S. Forresteror2) Master and Commander, by Patrick O'Brien.These are both wonderful, prolific writers, who write on the same subject as Mr. Kent, with much more style and elegance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book.","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely. Why? because there was plenty of action and the story kept moving along. There was no down time for our hero to sit around and sulk or long for some gal. Bolitho is no superhero either--he's a believable character; your average joe. The adventures were interesting and the fights were very engaging. It's also an easy read--no extraneous detail. Very good book; a good one to start out with if you're just getting into the naval warfare genre. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midshipman Bolitho","review":"The book held my attention throughout. Although it didn't provide the detail regarding the mechanics of the actual sailing of a ship that C.F.

I do recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly made","review":"came apart the second time i rode my bike------------it is junk so please don't waste your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Came apart at seam quickly","review":"I really liked this seat cover, it works great on my Giant spin cycle, however I bought it in mid April and haven't ridden my bike more than about 25 times since (unfortunately), but it already has started to come apart at the seam. It started opening in the back and now the side is splitting and the gel is oozing out. I wrote the seller to see if I could get a replacement, hoping it is defective or a fluke thing. If that's the case, I would be otherwise happy with the cover. In case you're wondering, I'm not obese and it was normal wear and tear/riding of the spin cycle, so this cover should have held up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I am extremely disappointed with this product. I only bought one because my recent seat was stolen. I had it for easily 1-2yrs and it was still in pretty good shape. The one I recently purchased is horrendous. I will have to purchase another after only a month's use. It has ripped at the sides, the gel is coming out. I do not understand how all the previous gel seats I have bought have consistently lasted for at least a year and this one did not last even a month. This was the worst purchase made."},{"rating":"1","title":"good until it melts","review":"I had a little trouble getting this saddle cover to fit tightly, it took some effort to get the ties real taught and to cross tie them under the seat. It worked pretty well for a while, but then over time it felt like the gel was breaking up and then I left the bike in the sun and the gel started to melt an ooze out of the material. That was it, it was ruined. It lasted one season of riding. Felt good when it worked. It did the job of getting me acclimated to my bike seat. After a good season of riding i didn't need it any more, the standard saddle is fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy it","review":"I bought it not for softening my saddle. The fact is I have a Selle SRL Titanium saddle in red color and I wanted something to use as a cover to preserve this expensive saddle during I transport my bikes or when I have to ride in very muddy conditions. So I bought this product purely as a \\"cover\\" and I didn't make much research on this item, supposing that \\"any will fit\\"First of all, I was very unpleasantly surprised by the weight of this product. It is unreasonably heavy, very heavy. It is made very big just to be more universal and fit more saddles, but its not the best idea. If you apply it on narrow saddle, than you cant fix this cover at all. It moves and slips all the time. Fixing strand is another bad idea. In fact, I can't find any positive point in this product thus I can't recommend it. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucks!","review":"Me and my husband bought these covers and they suck.

Neither of us like this cover at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfy - doesn't last","review":"Bought in June. Used an average of twice a week for 20-30 min each use. The seat started showing signs of wear within the first two or three uses, but it was still usable. Now in February it has fallen apart. The seams finally gave and the gel is oozing out.Gave it two stars because I did get some use out of it and it was comfortable while it lasted. But, it's not nearly as durable as my last Bell gel seat, which saw more use each week and still lasted a couple of years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spin in Comfort!!","review":"We purchased this for our spin bike. The seat fits well, does not slide as other reviewers have commented, and just makes riding the bike much more comfortable. Good buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Choice","review":"While the cover fit well around the seat, it did not stay put. It shifted to one side more than the other AND the gel oozed out after only riding my bike for 2 days. I went to my local bicyle shop and they gave me a completely new SEAT (not cover) for my bike. It is made of foam which is so much better in so many ways. Don't waste your $ on this seat cover! Go with foam!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Tail Bone Says Ouch","review":"It's just not enough cushion for my poor tail bone! Perhaps the thin layer of gel may be enough for people already accustomed to riding, but for those just getting into or (like in my case) back into the sport, I'd suggest padded shorts instead. Those definitely eased the pain a lot more than the seat cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"After only 4 hours of use, this seat cover is starting to fall apart.

By the second day the fabric that covers the gel was starting to stretch and tear. By the third day it was almost completely torn at which point I took off the cover and put in an order for a new seat. Do yourself a favor and just spend the extra $10-20 on a new seat. I paid $30 for a seat that has worked great and is more comfortable than this pad was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good product","review":"Not a good product-- hurt my butt MORE when I used it and sat on it.

Also a bit bulky; when you take it off your bike (so people don't steal it) it's not that easy to fit into your carrying bags."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Assembled","review":"This seat cover is pretty thin, improving the comfort of the ride in a pretty marginal way. Also, the seams are loose and the gel insert beneath the nylon is completely visible after one 60-minute spin class.

It is surprisingly bad, relatively to the former. Much less comfortable, and you can feel the seam at the edge after riding for a while.

It is very expensive if you have to buy a decent Tap Wrench along with this $22 set. I know their are better choices for $45+.

Just be warned and save yourself the hassle of Returns!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All Right","review":"Ignore those who claim this is an even-handed doc. It's a promotional film for the christian right thinly disguised as investigative journalism. It would have you believe, as many christians do, that the corruption and incompetence of the dimwit currently pretending to be president is easily overlooked so long as he talks about Jesus in public. A chilling view the triumph of superstition and fear over sanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good objective look at the situation","review":"Whether you're on the side of the Christian right or suspicious of it, this film successfully gives nothing more than the facts about the conservative/fundamentalist's political agenda and its influence on the U.S. political scene over the last several decades. It never resorts to taking a stand. Those on the right will find nothing to disdain, and those on the opposite side will perhaps be more informed about what they fear. The movie gives the entire scenario, much of which I've either forgotten, or perhaps never was aware of, regarding the Rev. Billy Graham's unfortunate support of Nixon, President Reagen's Supreme Court nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor and her \\"disappointing\\" track record (to those on the right), the presidential bid of Pat Robertson and his scarey jump start in the early primaries, and how conservatives feel that George W. is finally, definitely their man. All very interesting and informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out good and objective, ends up as a blatant propaganda tool.","review":"This was a very strange documentary. The first half is a very straightforward, objective and informative history of the evangelical influence on US politics from circa 1950. But by the last half all objectivity is thrown out the window and it turns into a very blatant promotional movie for George W. Bush and his handling of the 9/11, the Iraq War, etc., ending with Bush waving the flag and an interviewee saying he hopes God still has a plan for George W. Bush to help the world.Watch it if it's on TV, but I wouldn't recommend spending money on the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"An objective history of the Religous Right","review":"Actually this is completely free of editorial opinion, nothing beyond a few basic facts are given by the producers. If one has been paying attention over the last 40 years they won't find anything new here, those who get this DVD hoping for a diatribe on the religious right will be disappointed, on the other hand this is not pro-religious propaganda some may be hoping for. The producers do cover the ups and downs - Nixon's fall, how Reagan/Bush Sr. used them, & the PTL & Swaggart scandals. In interviews they let various members of the movement explain themselves as they see themselves. There really isn't any need for the producers to spend time editorializing, because in the end everyone will form their own opinion based on how much they agree or disagree with the objectives of the movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative and surprisingly objective","review":"This was very interesting and informative. I was completely opposed to the Bush administration, and I didn't think this documentary gave a positive view of him or the religious right at all.

Oh, I could list the rest of the tracks too because the whole record is a classic. \\"Fair Warning\\" laid the blueprint musically for several future VH albums (most notably \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge and \\"Balance.\\" I've like all their frontmen (yes, Sammy was awesome and Gary's not too shabby either--people give him a chance) but Big mouth Dave was the man when this dirty water dog was released."},{"rating":"2","title":"The tension album","review":"The fights among the band are starting here and it shows, the music is very angry and Ed's playing is full of fire like the first album. Some of the best albums in history were made under tense conditions and this is one of those great albums that was worth the hell they went through to record it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"FAIR WARNING is the most innovative guitar album of all time. This one is tied with Van Halen's first record and the Ozzy/Randy Rhoads teamup in terms of pure guitar technical wizardry.

Van Halen new condition excellent plastic wrap and sounds great remastered i down loaded it to my pc and im rocking out as i type !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark side of VH","review":"This was acually the lowest selling roth era album, but many VH fans say it is by far their favorite. This album is more dominated by eddie and not dave (Women and Children & Diver Down) It is the heaviest and darkest VH album. The later albums were much more pop oriented. If Van Halen ever got to be a heavy metal band, this was the closest they got. IT'S A TRUE GEM"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Golly!","review":"That was my reaction the very first time I heard this album bustin' through my speakers. It's like they had no intention of trying to produce a hit single, they just wanted to crank it up and play their fannies off for about 40 minutes. Eddie is jaw-dropping amazing throughout all the tracks. No wonder David Lee is caught goofing off during \\"Chains.\\" He knew no one was going to be listening to his vocals on this one. And \\"One foot out the door\\" may be Eddie's greatest lead ever (and that's saying a lot) because it's almost ALL lead guitar. And that, in my book, makes for a great Van Halen album...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"You forget how great this cd/record/tape actually was. It still is one of my favorite DLR era recordings. Enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissenting opinion","review":"This is a mediocre album. Certainly Unchained, Mean Streets, and Sinner's Swing are exciting songs but the rest of the songs on this album are very poor by Van Halen standards. The guitar work is excellent, as always, but most of the songs are just not good enough to keep the interest going. Only for the hard-core Van Halen fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the Roth era by ten miles","review":"This is basically unlistenable junk. With the exception of 1984 & DD, each Van Halen LP after the first great album kept getting weaker and weaker. I could not find one song on this to keep me from getting rid of it and I tried hard to like something on it. Even Diver Down is much better than this because at least they tried to COVER good songs. There's a reason it was their least commercial record, IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing piece","review":"I want to preface this review by letting everyone know that I am a huge Van Halen fan. That being said, let me go on to state that this is one of the worst rock albums ever produced. It is a dismal failure with the exception of three tracks. I don't need to tell you the names of the good songs. They are so easy to distinguish from the rest of the recording.I was shocked by the number of people giving this album five stars. It really doesn't deserve that. Two stars is more than generous. It's interesting to note that this album continues to rank amongst the worst rock albums ever made by many rock magazines.If you want the album to complete your VH collection, then buy it. But be prepared to be underwhelmed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good place to start--for beginners only","review":"This book and card pack is a fun, but oversimplified approach to the I Ching. The I Ching is the oldest book in the world, dating back thousands of years in ancient China. Anything this simple will not do it justice. The I Ching is primarily left to scholars in China, because it is so difficult to interpret. Like other Chinese arts, it takes years if not a lifetime to master the art of divination through the I Ching. Still, it's fun to read the little book and play with the cards. Just don't take it too seriously is my advice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best I Ching ever","review":"I've been a scholar of chinese culture for over forty years and I can tell you that this I Ching is the best ever.

Definitely capable of putting you to sleep. Their follow-up, Stories Without Words, is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oddball, a bit twisted and funny!","review":"The show is a bit of a twisted comedy that stars a woman who is trying to get into the pants of a doctor even though he's married to a woman whose in a wheelchair. She goes through nearly psychotic methods and tactics to sabotage peoples lives and along the way seems to want to aim to be Don's (the doctor she's enamoured with)lover! Very funny and twisted and just a little bit dark. It pokes fun at alot of conventions and plops Jill (the star) smack right into the middle of it right along with her neuroses and nearly psychotic issues. Very funny! The Brits always make such good comedies! My only aggitation is that there wasnt a sequel for format 1!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Brilliant!","review":"Series One was an eye-opener because, as many other reviewers have noted, the lead character is beyond description. You'd never want to meet her like in person because she never fails to find the best in herself--at the expense of others. I just watched Series Two in London, and I couldn't believe the lengths she goes to capture her man. (After you've seen the artificial insemination scene in the hospital you'll understand completely.) Here's a call to the BBC to release Series Two in America. The actress/writer said she can't imagine there'll be Series Three because she's not sure where the story might head. Let's hope she changes her mind and that Cath, Glenn, Don, and \\"Linder\\" will find the light of day again.As to the reviewer who complained about the endless filler at the start, I have no idea what he's talking about. My DVD player zipped through the ads, etc., straight to the show. Ignore that review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"Well I have to say I have never heard of Nighty Night but was actually on here to buy the 3rd session of The L Word (great program) and found the reviews that other people had writen and trust me they are all true it is very funny I have been choking with laughter Jill is a mental and I can't wait to get hold of session 2 it's a classic especially if you like good english comedy this is the best I have seen in along time forget Little Britain forget Black Books forget Coupling just remember Nighty Night!!

While it had funny moments, it was no where near as funny as what other reviews had lead me to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the funny part?","review":"I tried. I really tried, but I was simply incapable of getting into this program. The lead character in Nighty Night is so thoroughly, contemptably self-centered and unlikable she makes Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm seem like a big cuddly teddy bear. This is a person who has not had an unselfish thought for another human being in her entire life. She's also insane. Completely. And not in a cute or funny way. She dosen't live in this world. She lives in one where the entire universe revolves around her, making it entirely acceptable for her to say or do anything no matter how ludicrous, dishonest or rude. She literaly has no idea she's a monster. I can see how that could be funny but not with this show's incredibly dry, lifeless presentation. I never thought I'd say this but Nighty Night could actually use a laugh track to let us know when the producers think we're supposed to laugh. And I hate laugh tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its in the bin.","review":"I tried, I did. Watched almost 2 episodes and then couldnt handle anymore.This (for me) was the most puerile crass utterly unfunny tasteless rubbish I have seen in a very long time.Mind you, it did established a 1st for me, I put it back in its DVD packet and threw it in the rubbish bin, never done that before. Hope the rats at the dump like it. And before any Brits going moaning about 'You don't understand British humour', two points. One, I am a Brit and secondly this was Capital C rap. Nighty Night is about right, crappity crappity is more like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst DVD I ever bought.","review":"This DVD forced me to watch the advertisements for the FBI, studio, and about a hundred other DVDs. All the remote control buttons were disabled. It seemed like hours. My other DVDs all allow either the menu button, next button, or fast forward button to work. Not this horrible product. By the time I was allowed to see what I paid for, I was so irritated, that I could not enjoy the program.Next night, I tried to watch episode two. But, it tried to force me to watch all the advertisements again. At least the \\"Open\\" button worked. The only way to watch this ****, is to insert it before fixing supper. After eating it might be ready to show some entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed for some maintenance","review":"This comes really handy, especially when you have a 6 cyl.

There is no dignity left in the score here. If you want to hear Godspell at its finest, look for the British Cast Recording-- 1999 I believe it was. Exquisitely played by real people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful! Glory to God!","review":"I saw this show during its tour, and I loved it! It was funny, moving, and the music was excellent! When I got the CD, I was ready to go back and relive that experience. I did, and it's been great. I love this CD, always have, unlike the 2000 Off-Broadway Cast album, which I now love, but took some time to get used to. Unlike most peoples opinion of this, I love it, because it is so entertaining, and appeals to the younger generation of \\"Godspell\\" fans. My complaints are that sometimes you don't feel like the casts heart-and-soul are in their singing. During the \\"Finale,\\" Jesus (Joe) doesn't seem like he's in pain when we sings \\"Oh God, I'm dying.\\" But the major plus sides are to the BEAUTIFUL renditions of \\"All Good Gifts\\" and \\"By My Side,\\" which are both my favorite of all verions I've heard. Also, \\"Beautiful City,\\" which just makes you want to praise God! This is a GREAT CD, a good companion to the 2000 Off-Broadway Cast. Get both. You won't be disappointed by either!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What are you guys saying?","review":"This is, without a doubt, the worst recording of this musical. I will even tolerate the opera guy in the original off-broadway recording than this piece of junk. Here are my reasons for not liking this CD.1. All of the cast is majorly off beat with the music. It sounds like a train wreck.2. There is the feeling of excitement, but no feeling of hurt (in the finale) and other places.3. Half of the people can not stay on key. They always go falt and sharp...which drives me off the ricter scale.4. The orchestration are atrocious. It doesn't even sound like \\"Godspell\\" anymore.Please do not buy this. IF you want an amazing recording that is close to the heart of the original Godspell, get the 2000 off-broadway cast. The woman who sings \\"Bless the Lord\\" is amazing. She sounds like the Christina Aguilera of the musical genre. Get the 2000 recording instead of this junk. Please. Don't torture your ears as I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTH???","review":"Ok..first off, let me say I am jaded. I totally enjoy the movie soundtrack, and tolerate the broadway recording from the 70's (I actually think the Broadway production did a better job on Robin Lamont's \\"Day by Day\\"). Yes, I own both recordings and it ends at these two.What were they thinking? They've ruined a classic; between the updated score, arrangements, and the voices being over-dramatic and filled with vibrato, the songs sound forced, and do not echo any of the fresh, happy, if not campy, sound of the original recordings.Some things are classics and shouldn't be touched. Remember when they changed Coca Cola and introduced the New Coke? Ya; enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I received this book as a gift from a friend who noticed my general interest in the origins of words and phrases. And indeed, I was happy when I first saw the title because I do find this subject to be interesting. However upon reading the book I was disappointed.I can't really put my hand on the reason(s) of my disappointment. It could be because of the fact that I was able to point out a few mistakes myself. It could be because of the complicated and unorganized fashion of presenting the information. It could even be because of the poor printing quality! Nevertheless, I was disappointed and did not find this book to be satisfying.It could be because I myself didn't have sincere interest in the subject, but I doubt that."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems","review":"Item description was dead on. If you are only needing one, get the longer cable, I can't tell you how many times you come up a little short on things like this, and just causes headaches for you.

It is a good quality cable for a good price. If you need to connect legacy Firewire devices, this cable will work fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capriciousness, not justice","review":"Alice Hoffman is an incredible writer. Reading her prose is like snacking on strawberry shortcake. Each bite is rich, sweet, packed with unbelievable taste. I marvel at her abilities...However, this book has such a bleak point of view. It deals with incredibly weighty issues of sin, forgiveness, revenge, punishment...and it does it without redemption, forgivness, resurrection or even justice. There is an air of capriciousness about Hoffman's universe. The main couple in this book are \\"punished\\" because they love each other too much, apparently. It's like a Greek tragedy without the fatal flaw. One keeps reading, pulled in by the skill of the author, hoping vainly that something good will come of this tragedy.Some will protest that this is just like Real Life, and to some extent it is. However, most of us read fiction to escape Real Life, not to reaffirm it. We want stories that lift us from the muck and mire of the everyday...not plunge us neck deep into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romantic imagery but little realism","review":"Can we really ever know anyone completely? Even the most loving and intimate partner of 13 years? Jorie, the protagonist of this lush novel, finds out the answer to this question, but she might have asked it much earlier, maybe at the wedding when his side of the chapel was completely empty. Hoffman is a talented writer, and I kept reading, with special interest in the sharply defined adolescent characters, but Jorie's ignorance about her husband's past is unreal and puts a hole in the plot too big to ignore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick With Her Whimsical Novels!!","review":"I really wanted to like this novel -- especially since her last two books, \\"Local Girls\\" and \\"River King,\\" were equally disappointing. Where is the Alice Hoffman of \\"Practical Magic,\\" \\"Seventh Heaven,\\" and \\"Turtle Moon\\" gone?I don't have a problem with disturbing books if they are done well (i.e. J.M. Coetze's \\"Disgrace,\\" or Chang Rae Lee's \\"A Gesture Life\\"). But this is not done well. Hyperbole does not work in this vein and ultimately I could never get past the fact that we are supposed to believe Ethan is redeemed instantly after years of horrible behavior.If you want to read great fiction by Alice Hoffman, stick with her older stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Portrait of a Sociopath...","review":"I haven't read many of Hoffman's novels in the past, but I got through this one in a single evening. The perfect novel for a long plane ride! The main character is a classic sociopath; he does what he does because it's \\"necessary\\". Even for thirteen years' worth. The wife's character isn't fully developed in this story, so we don't know what she comes from or how she managed to stay in a fog for so many years. I would have probably though this a better story had more time been taken earlier on to present the cracks in this so-called \\"perfect\\" family. As presented however, Hoffman still manages to do a great job in showing what lives turned upside down can look like."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absorbing, melancholy tale","review":"The first several pages of Hoffman's new book are spent describing the impossible perfection of the love between Ethan and Jorie; so or course something has to go terribly awry, and it does.Like many of her books, this one has a fairy-tale feel that stays with you until the end. However, I felt like something was missing. Not enough back story about Ethan--he never seemed like a fully developed character, but then again, I guess he was intentionally made a bit of an enigma.This book does make the reader wonder how well she knows her own husband, friends and neighbors."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lyrical Masterpiece","review":"This is a wonderful book. It takes you to its sweet bosom and enchants you with life in Monroe, Mass. all sweet and lovely, then it slams you upside the head with heartbreak. Alice Hoffman has done it to me before but never to this extent. This is a book of life...it is sweet and funny and tender and tragic nd ugly and nasty. I read this immediately after reading We Were the Mulvaneys and what a gruesome twosome. The act of rape is ugly but what it does to the lives of people involved is staggering. A great read, not always fun but certainly powerful and insightful A must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first Alice Hoffman book....","review":"and it just did not do it for me. so over the top in terms of her flowery prose and dreamy reality descriptions. however, thought the story line was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money!","review":"What a piece of junk! I had never heard of Alice Hoffman but decided to buy this book because it looked attractive on display in the book store. This taught me never again to be fooled by the words \\"New York Times Notable Book.\\"I tend not to read fiction because so often the plots seem utterly implausible to me. This one wins the prize for implausibility.Ms. Hoffman needn't worry about my ever again reviewing one of her books. Pffft."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful book!!!!","review":"I truly loved this book!!!!! I read it in 2 days and I must say...Alice Hoffman is truly gifted.

Loved a couple and liked 'em all. Not this one. Trite handling of serious subjects. Bad writing and worse characters. I read a third of the book, skipped to the end and skimmed the rest, looking for something in this book to like and never found it."},{"rating":"1","title":"be warned, leave this one on the shelf!","review":"If you read this review and buy this book anyway,don't say I didn't tell you. I was so dissappointed. I just read 'Local Girls' and loved it. This is a book about a man who is discovered to not be what he has says he is for the past 13 years. One minute his wife and child love him more than life itself and the very next it is absolutely over. That's a little to cut and dry for real life. But, that's not the worst part, there's at least two more books inside this one story that I had rather hear about than this one! Last but not least why does Ms. Hoffman think she has to write a 'Travel Guide' for New England. She tells about the weather, the birds, the flowers and she does this over and over and over, etc. I read a review before I read this one but I decided that they had to be wrong. I'm sorry to say they were not. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was written by Alice Hoffman??","review":"I have read many wonderful books by Alice Hoffman and just couldn't believe how mediocre this one was. If you took out all the superfluous details (how many times is the word blue used?), the book might have been a mere 75 pages. I found all the characters unlikable and lacking in depth. This book was a big disappointment. Read Turtle Moon by this author instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try but no cigar","review":"Alice Hoffman has hit upon a great idea, but the story lacks the depth and fullness of a well-crafted novel. Its trite attempts at poignancy are contrived, and the character dialogue and thoughts have the luster of a wood block. Some of my favorite novels are \\"unbelievable\\" and that's what makes them great (e.g., Tom Robbins' Jitterbug Perfume). Blue Diary, in contrast, is the kind of unbelievable that prevents the reader from getting lost in the story. Instead, I found myself distracted by the preposterous, although intriguing, premise. Perhaps a more creative novelist could have pulled it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"silly fair tale","review":"I usually love Alice Hoffman and her brand of magical realism. But after 10 pages of adjectives about how perfect Ethan was, I found myself flipping pages and getting more and more annoyed. It was ridiculously obvious why she was setting him up and about 30 pages too inflated. We all know she can write, she doesn't need to hit us over the head with it.But worst of all, I never believed that Ethan could transform from the [criminal]/murderer to perfect husband/father."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring","review":"This is my first Alice Hoffman book and may be my last. Her writing style rambles and switches points of view so rapidly I felt whiplash coming on. Her main character, the murderer, is so despicable when we initially see him commit his crime that it is quite unfathomable for us to think he has \\"changed\\" so much. The premise was enticing, yet the story and characters never really developed. Hoffman's writing style is to switch viewpoints every chapter, yet I felt jipped that we weren't in Ethan's point of view longer, if not to help us understand this great metamorphasis we were supposed to buy into. I don't think I'll read another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Listener","review":"As a daily commuter, I listen to audio books and have found them a pleasant and enlightening manner in which to spend the time.When I picked up Alice Hoffman's Blue Diary I was expecting the title to have significant meaning as the plot unfolded. I was sorely disappointed. It was no more than the hormonal musings of a teenaged girl that revealed no impact on her untimely demise or on her murderer.Why the reference to no reflection in the mirror if it is never to be followed by an accurate or believable explanation?Perhaps the enchantment with this particular author comes from reading rather than listening to her work but I will not hurry to check out another Hoffman audio book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very superficial treatment of characters","review":"The storyline was unique and interesting (a woman suddenly discovers after 13 years of marriage a horrible secret that her husband has been carrying), but the treatement of most characters in teh book was superficial and at times, even vague. I was left with the feeling that Alice Hoffman thought of a storyline, and hurriedly assembled characters around it without giving much thought to how people may actually think or behave in a situation like this. I was disappointed since there was a fair amount of hype surrounding the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, Alice Hoffman!","review":"Alice Hoffman's latest work, BLUE DIARY, is haunting. The plot centers around Jorie Ford, wife of the nearly perfect Ethan Ford, and her life in a small town in Massachusetts. When the flaw in Ethan's past is exposed, everything changes for everyone. I read this fast... I didn't want to, but it was so compelling... Hoffman is an excellent writer, and the stories she tells in this novel ring with truth and honesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost me in the middle","review":"I'm not a big fan of Hoffman but thought she would redeem herself when I began this book. The storyline was intriguing and she pulled me in from the beginning but lost me in the middle. The story seemed to sag, leaving me wondering what the point was to it. Maybe Hoffman lost the point as well in the middle. As for the wife of Ethan going to visit the brother of the murdered girl, PLEASE! What was that about? Talk about FICTION, that would NEVER happen. All in all, I was very disappointed in this book, although Hoffman's poetic writing is beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I expected an interesting, unexpected plot, page-turning novel, something the back cover had described... I haven't read any of her other novels, so I thought I'd give this one a try. I was looking forward to the page turning experience. What a disappointment. I turned the pages often in search of a good story. The plot was trivial, the characters one-dimensional, and the flowery prose did not fit with the story.Honestly, this book read like a well written essay from a high school student. The text was overdone, and it seemed she was reaching to create the book into a \\"poetic prose\\" style novel.The forever-mentioned lilies really killed it for me.Try another novel, don't waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An iffy start, a mesmerizing finish","review":"The first part of the novel tests the reader's patience with its fairy tale depiction of Ethan Ford and his life with wife,Jorie. But stick with Alice Hoffman's prose. The seeming perfection is actually an effective setup for what happens after Ethan's pastfinally catches up with him. This is the first Alice Hoffman book that I've read, and I'm eager to read more of herwork after finishing \\"Blue Diary.\\" Once the book began delving into who Ethan really was/is and how his heinous crimeresonated, I was unable to put it down. I wasn't particularly intrigued by some of the supporting characters, especiallyJorie's best friend Charlotte. But overall, \\"Blue Diary\\" is a satisfying read that raises interesting questions about thelimits of redemption and forgiveness."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know which is worse","review":"My book group read this book, and I must say that we unanimously hated it. I don't know which is worse, her self-conscious, cloying prose (first person to third person to first person; you hate the protagonists from the get-go) or the way the plot takes a nose dive.How do these books get published?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking and engrossing","review":"This is not the first Hoffman novel I've read; I always enjoy her. Blue Diary keeps you reading and I like that. Her prose is poetic and her characters well drawn. I'm not going to recite the plot since that's been done in numerous reviews before mine. I just want to add that I think the strength of the novel is that by looking primarily at how other people see Ethan, Hoffman is able to perform the magic of slightly tilting our view, so that the man we saw in Chapter one is not the man we come to know at the end of the novel. The author correctly keeps us out of Ethan's POV most of the time. This is not really his story. He doesn't really change and that is the real surprise that Hoffman has for us. This is the story of the ripples from something he did 15 years ago and how these ripples affect so many people in his world today. I think Jorie made the right choice in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Diary","review":"Alice Hoffman again has a winner with Blue Diary. She has the most interesting characters of any author I have read recently. As each chapter is told from the point of view of a diverse range of characters the reader sees the effects that one lie can have on many people. It indeed shows how interconnected our lives are with others. As always, Alice mixes in a little magic to make this book a delight to read. I highly recommend it to lovers of Alice Hoffman's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow characters ruined this book","review":"The plot was not the most original, but it was the depth (or should I say lack of depth) that really tanked this book. The main character of the story is hardly explored, nor was the son who was also a key character. When I finished reading this book, I felt nothing for any of the characters. Sorry Alice, I will not read your work again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collectors item","review":"This is a great CD if you are a true fan of the Clark Sisters and their mother Dr. Mattie Moss Clark. The CD allows you to truly hear the voice likiness of Dorinda and Dr. Clark. You also hear some of the greatest gospel songs out there. \\"Salvation is Free, Christ is Coming Back Again\\" This was also the last recording of Dr. Mattie Moss Clark with the SWMSC. It is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever Romatic","review":"This is a must for any Jose Jose fan. The way he handles all of the songs is truely extraordinary.
