A movie of emotions and connections set in a sterile, confusing and sometimes hostile environment. The tone of this movie is set by a \\"platonic\\" relationship where two people grow to care more deeply about each other than if they had become lovers. This relationship causes these characters to evaluate and come to important realizations about their primary relationships and themselves. More importantly this movie spurred me to evaluate relationships in my life and myself. Bill Murray is brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to say the least","review":"I had heard good reviews of this Oscar award winner and then sat down to watch it.

Even more egregious than the baseless fawning was the film's trailer, which misrepresented this yawner as a comedy by showing EVERY funny scene in the film. Two stars for the exterior shots of Tokyo (although if you've been there, you know that even there, the film underplays the mindblowing reality)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Monsoon Wedding instead","review":"somparing this film to Monsoon Wedding only goes to show how some hype from out of touch critics can actually lead to a film with nothing to it actually being nominated.

It feels as though Sofia Coppola came to Asia for the first time, had a sophomoric affectation by how different things are from America and proceeded to make this silly movie where the audience is supposed to ponder such things as - the novelty of jet lag - how the Japanese have trouble pronouncing r's (this is really exaggerated in the movie) and many Japanese do not even speak English...TV is different too. Culture shock and introspection ensues. Yes, how profound. This movie is no better than shows like The Amazing Race, where the rest of the world is just an exotic backdrop for Americans to run through and observe such differences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I've ever seen","review":"I should preface this review by saying that my husband and I both have advanced degrees and see 50+ independent films a year. We drove for an hour in horrendous traffic to see this movie, and it is the only film we have ever walked out of in 25 years of adult movie viewing. It is pointless and banal to the point of idiocy. If you are a film buff, it is like the worst excesses of 60s French New Wave. Long shots of actors staring. Little or no dialogue. Brief scenes cut in that have no relationship to the (absent) plot. Long, long scenes where not a word can be understood. Characters you can't care about because they HAVE no character. Characters who are supposedly intelligent who can't think of a thing to do to amuse themselves in one of the great cities of the world. We get it; we get it--these people are ALIENated. Ugh. Don't waste your time. The positive critical response to this film can only be some bizarre plot to hoodwink middle America."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor's New Clothes. Awful.

There was no point to the story as far as I could see. The reviews said this movie was hilarious; I sat through this movie for an hour and didn't find anything funny. It just jumps from one scene to the next with no purpose, this makes for a very boring movie.

This was one of those movies where when the credits roll you look around and think \\"did I actually just waste 102 minutes of my life on this?\\" It is definitely in my \\"steaming pile of crap\\" movie category.

Different because it is an American film pretending to be a European one. How it got rave reviews is beyond me. Is it because Sofia Copolla made it?

Every scene in the movie could have been accomplished in about 30 seconds and instead they chose to make it 5 minutes. It was amazing. One scene shows Bill Murray walking around a golf tee and then hitting the ball. It literally took 2 minutes for this segment that meant absolutely nothing.

Plus, Coppola apparently has a personal bias against attractive blondes. The only people she portrays completely negatively in the movie seem to be blonde American women - first w/Kelly (Anna Faris) and then with the woman near the end who approaches Bob (Murray) in the hotel lobby as he's leaving to say she admires him and is immediately brushed off by him when he spots Charlotte (Johannson).

This is mostly about the atmosphere surrounding a very boring hotel life in Tokyo, where two people meet and share their loneliness. I wish that movie could have been shot, let's say in Paris. At least the atmosphere would have been more romantic (instead of witnessing those phony disco clowns everywhere) and with a good scenario, would have been more meaningful. Something is missing in that movie and it would be very presumptuous to even think that movie would get an Oscar for best movie, best director etc... Sofia Coppola could have done a lot better with the two very good actors she had (Murray and Johanssen) but, unfortunately the result is very boring and superficial. It's a nice try though...next time maybe..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another overrated, boring movie","review":"\\"Lost in Translation\\" is another one of those boring movies that gets praised by film critics who think it is very deep and meaningful. It reminded me a lot of Stanley Kubrick's films \\"2001\\" and \\"The Shining\\". All three of these films are beautiful to look at, but they are otherwise empty in content. About an hour into this movie, I found a book to read. Nothing interesting or exciting happened during the whole movie. It just seemed to be \\"there\\" and did not have a real story to it. What I saw in this movie was a middle-aged man who was bored and lonely. This movie really made me miss the Bill Murray that I loved in \\"Ghostbusters\\". The wit, fun, and cynicism that he showed in \\"Ghostbusters\\" was gone in \\"Lost in Translation\\". It made me feel sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would anyone care if they carbonized this one?","review":"Hundreds of thousands of people gather around in huge circules to watch as millions of VHS and DVD copies of this movie are burnt into piles of carbon."},{"rating":"1","title":"sleeping pill","review":"This movie was terrible. If you suffer from insomnia, rent it and you will be cured. STAY AWAY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lost on me","review":"Definetely in the top 5 of the worst movies I've ever viewed! The movie starts out the same way it ends. Nothing ever changes. After 5 minutes you can turn it off because you have basically viewed the whole thing. Just because a movie is terrible, critics have to love it and call it arty. Its so bad you are drawn into it because you know something interesting has got to happen. The only attention grabbing part is at the very end with the \\"whisper in the ear\\" and even that is a let down. I highly recomend seeing this movie just to see how awfull it really is! Thank you"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is boring.","review":"I saw many good reviews of this movie and I trusted them when I decided to watch this movie. I was wrong. This movie was very boring. The story is slow. Camera work is awful. Music sucks. The ending is cheesy. It reminded me many things about Japan but that's it. It's not really funny. It's not really a love story. It's not really anything. This movie is boring for regular folks like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about a story?","review":"This excruciatingly slow and dull film would have been enhanced if it had a decent screenplay. (To show you how far out Hollywood is, this movie won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.) The plot takes forever to emerge, and then it isn't worth the wait. Deadpan Bill Murray, flirting with a girl half his age, seems to adlib many of his lines. After, say, an hour, the incredible shallowness of all concerned becomes overwhelming.Both of the leads complain of insomnia. They could have been cured by watching this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bill Murray must need the money","review":"Lost in Translation is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. It is two hours or so (I must admit that I couldn't make it all the way through) of absolutely, positively nothing happening. My wife did manage to sit through Lost in Translation just to see if it would pick up and it doesn't at all. There is no character development, no drama, no suspense, and no anything that would make anyone watch this movie other than Murray on the cover of the box. It should be criminal to bilk unsuspecting movie watchers out of their time and money like this. If you decide that you have two hours of your life that you will never want back to waste on this movie, don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth the Buzz?","review":"I felt bored watching this. I am not sure what all the buzz was about. I love Bill Murray, completely enjoyed the Life Aquatic, but this flick didn't do it for me. Scarlett Johannsen seemed flat, not restrained as another reviewer stated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic film, terrible DVD","review":"I'm reviewing the disc itself here, not the movie. If you're unfamiliar with the movie, you can take your pick from hundreds of reviews online.This disc is terrible:1. Universal's decision to bundle ten minutes of ads at the beginning, which cannot be skipped, is classless and grubbing.2. The mastering is poor -- compression artifacts are evident in dark scenes, and the overall image feels slightly blurred.3. The audio is poorly mastered, too, abruptly changing levels several times. Did anyone even supervise this transfer?4. An insert of some kind would have been nice, even just a photo card. Opening the sleeve to just the disc is a mild letdown, and left me wondering if only my copy is like this.It's a shame a movie this enjoyable was pushed through such a shoddy production process. Let's hope another distributor gets their hands on this soon and does it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok movie, not great and definitely not Oscar worthy!","review":"This movie is nowhere near as good as all the hype that surrounded it. The story is weak, and the chemistry between Murray and Johansson was a dry, boring snooze fest. What am I missing here? The plot is something my four year old niece could of created. A girl, whose boyfriend ignores her while in Japan, falls (sort of) for an older guy (not likely, unless of course it is the real \\"Bill Murray\\" and not his character). They be-friend each other and go around to different parties and places hanging out just to keep each other company. The visuals are pretty good and I liked watching all the beautiful sights and hearing the sounds of Japan street life, but it was not enough to carry the whole movie. I found it rather boring, and was surprised considering I like realistic movies that do not rely on special effects and cheesy one liners. Unfortunately this movie failed to peak any real interest out of me. Rent it and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen.","review":"This is one of two movies I will site as creating a desire to have my time wasted watching the film returned to me.

The only good thing about it was the acting, specially Murray's. This movie has no plot, it is way too long (or feels like it), and it is supposed to be a commedy and i barely laughed a couple of times (when they made the japanese people look stupid, which by the way i would feel very offending if i were japanese) When i saw this movie yesterday there were about 15 people in the theater and only 4, counting myself and a friend, went through the whole movie. It was amazingly boring, i don't get how this movie got nominated for best picture and director, and a great movie such as cold mountain was left out. I don't get it, it was stupid, i don't recomend it to anyone. BOOOOOOOOOOORING"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in watching this worthless piece of ....","review":"If you've had trouble falling asleep, this is the film for you. I hav'nt seen a film with this much action since Andy Worhals Empire State Building. I've worked in Tokyo under similar circumstances and had an exciting and eventfilled experience. These principle characters come off as a couple of dull folks from the USA. Why all the fuss about this film? Somebodies pockets must be getting lined. And I'm a big Bill Murry fan. I'd rate this film 0 stars and 5 ZZZZZs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"Oscar? People actually think this deserves an OSCAR??????? I admit, there are some fun moments in this movie, but for the most part i found it boring.

Interesting to see once, but never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Boring I couldn't watch 50% of the Movie","review":"Watch out for this one folks! I didn't think that I could ever NOT like a Bill Murray movie. I think Mr. Murray may have been nominated for an Oscar because he is totally \\"out of character\\" and \\"unfunny\\".

How can a movie like this be nominated for an Oscar? It is terribly slow and the dialogues are far from intelligent. It could have been a very interesting introduction/discovery of the Asian culture. I found it stupid and a permanent demonstration that the american culture is superior to the local one (usually the attitude that ignorant people assume when they visit a foreign country!). I would have given it -5 stars if that option was available!Sofia Coppola... pfff!!! If her name was Sofia Smith she would still be selling popcorn at the theater, not sitting at the Academy Awards ceremony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Ado About Nothing","review":"This film is about nothing. There is no intellect. There is no inspiration. It goes nowhere, and starts nowhere. Instead, it uses the Japanese people and their culture as comedic devices. Unfortunately, it was disrespectful, insulting, and racist. This movie isn't even worth a one-star rating. It's definitely on my worst list. I wouldn't even wish this movie upon my worst enemy. Yes, it was just that bad.It's unfortunate when people have to put other cultures down in order to feel good about themselves. Sofia said she wanted to make a movie in Japan, but she should have left this one on the cutting-room floor. The entire movie is \\"Lost in Translation.\\" Can someone explain to me the purpose in making a movie with no plot, empty characters, and meaningless dialog??? You can't, because it would be a fruitless exercise.Hollywood likes boring, derogatory crap with big names attached to it, and this is all the proof you will need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophia is the \\"Godfather\\"....","review":"It's almost unbeliavable how this turkey eraned so much praise. To all the people who have found \\"the hidden meaning of life\\" in this picture, I just ask the following question: Was that Sophia's intention? Or she just realized she had a bomb on her hands and started to advertise this humorless, contrived, mess of a movie as \\"art\\"? I think this is the answer.LOST IN TRANSLATION is a really bad movie. It's all about holding a camera, telling Murray and Johansson to look bored til death while walking around Tokyo. Useless piece of movie. But, when you have a father like COppola, anything can happen, I guess.."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least it looked cool","review":"Getting a better view of Tokyo was cool, but I think the movie would have benefitted if it had an actual plot, other than Scarlett and Bill having a sulking contest, moping around Tokyo.

It had good reviews so I was expecting something special. I kept turning up the sound in an effort to hear what was being said. I would like to have turned on a few lights to see who was talking. There was no plot and no story line. The good part was you had a feeling of being in Tokyo. Bill Murray is always a favorite but this was his worst role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only for people who have an attention span.","review":"This movie was terrific. I can't quite think of what I like about the movie most. Bill Murray was great and Scarlett Johansson did an awesome job as well. The title of this review is \\" Only for people who have an attention span\\". This goes for the many 1 or 2 star reviews people gave. Some of you say that it put you to sleep. It sounds like alls you like is movies with fast cars and ones that make you laugh so hard you pee your pants. Thats how stupid your taste is. If you don't care for this movie, thats fine. But from what I read on the review is that some people said too slow or that their was no plot. There was a plot! Wake up and pay attention. Not everything has to be spelled out to you.

You can't access the DVD menu. You can't skip to the next chapter. You can only fast forward to get to the DVD menu and watch the feature.If you want to own Lost in Translation on DVD, you should wait for Criterion or somebody else to release it. Surely somebody responsible will release a quality version that will be worth the money.Don't waste your money on this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothingness","review":"1. It's not a bad movie. If it were not for the hype, there maybe fewer people who hate it. Quite some people would find it interesting/different - a little off the Hollywood mainstream.2. Being different does not necessarily mean being great... We are all so often and so easily confused by the two, admitted or not.3. People get tired of Hollywood mainstream - the usually show-off stuff (action, plot driven, nudity, dramatization, etc); when we come across something that lack all of it, more or less nothingness... then we tend to believe there must be something special... We can believe or imagine somethingness from nothingness which dress itself in the artsy clothes at the most...4. It's nice to have family in show business.

If so, this picture will drive you to drink! Personally, I like to SEE the movie I'm watching. 90% of Lost in Translation is lost in the dark - you simply can't see it, which is something of a waste of time in my book. And the supposed \\"hilarity\\" of it was also lost. I did not laugh out loud once. I stuck with it, and watched it all the way through, waiting, waiting for the funny scenes. There was a bit of making fun of Japanese people's pronunciation of English words with \\"r\\"'s in them, but that's a rather old joke. Ms. Coppola must have paid off a LOT of people to get the reviews and nominations that she did, because I just wasted about $20 on the DVD. Clearly, the joke was completely lost on me, which my boyfriend and I think may have been the point of the movie. The whole thing is truly lost in translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"TERRIBLY BEAUTIFUL...","review":"This is an amazing movie, in all aspects... history, photography, music...As someone said here in the reviews, this is not for everybody (and I'm sure you're not everybody), you have to open your soul to see it and love it...

I also lived a similar experience in the same country, so it made me live it a little again...Forget about the reviews, watch this movie and decide by yourself... it's not a common love history but it's the most beautiful that I have ever seen, I hope it reaches your heart the same way it reached mine..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot Hole","review":"I have a very deep interest in any movie that tells a story of human conditions within an exotic environment.I am very sorry to say that this film tries to do so, without achieving it.

Don't loose your time.I appreciate cultural differences, and I am not shy in noticing foreign pecularities. However, I find the movie insulting and disrespectful toward the Japanese society. If at the end of the movie, this is your idea of Japan... I am very sorry to see that the film industry has widely hurt the image of one of the most interesting destinations in Asia.Acting was very good, but you'll get great actors and performances in many other movies, too.The plot is slow, mediocre, predictable and boring.

He is a straight man in search of a side kick to breath life into his act. He has not found one to date.The story is about a man out of his culture. Bill Murray plays the American buffoon stumbling into and around in a land (Japan) totally alien to him. Do you want an in-depth analysis of the story line? I just gave it to you. This film is not that deep.If you are a Bill Murray groupie you will love this film. If you are a Bill Murray groupie you need to get out to other films.

She feels that those who did not like this film are of a lower intelligence then she is. This review pretty much sums up those that have given this movie 5 stars. They are individuals so insecure about their own intelligence that they need to attack others intelligence because of a difference in opinion on a film. How sad someone needs to use a script written by a twenty something, nepotism enhanced, never worked a day in her life, rich young woman to justify how smart she herself is. I reccomend Laurie just take an IQ test if she really wants to know how smart she is.

It is superb. My only problem is, since watching it, I cannot stop thinking about Scarlett Johansson. Bill Murray is his usual brilliant self, but for me Johansson stole the movie. And thank God for no predictable hollywood ending. I was always skeptical that Sophia Coppola was just riding her father's coattails, but she more than proved herself with this film. This is one to own, not rent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, good dvd.","review":"I absolutely adored this movie in theaters and it has become my most favorite film of all time. Now I'm not goin to argue that it is the best film ever made...but it was at the least my PERSONAL favorite. My only complaint with the actual dvd is the changes which have been made from the original; seemingly small yes, still, significant enough to catch my eye. One of the most noticeable changes: the music in the very last scene is different...although they still used a song from the original soundtrack, it's a different one, and it makes an enormous difference in the mood of the conclusion... i guess this just goes to show how much of a difference music can make in storytelling. It seems to me they wanted to make the ending just slightly more optimistic...

It's a beautiful, clean, lively place. That's about all you get here, though. Director Sophia Coppola has created a bourgeois tale about lonely superstars, millionaires and dilletantes in Japan that seethes with poor-pity-me melodrama and American xenophobia (witness the endless 'L' for 'R' gags, or the the gush of verbage quickly summarized by a translator at the photo shoots). 'Lost In Translation' had a remarkable opportunity to build bridges with modern day Japan and blew them to maintain this idiotic sensibility. Aside from cinematography, the film does two things right: the soundtrack is packed with great music selections, and Anna Farris' character Kelly virtually defines the modern young Hollywood actress, with inane banter about body cleansing and the low-carb Japanese diet."},{"rating":"1","title":"a movie about itself","review":"The idea behind this movie is that a formerly great actor goes to Japan for $2 million to be in a Suntori whiskey commercial. He doesn't really put out any effort to make the commercials great and sort of comes across with the \\"I got the money and I'm not going to work hard to make any of this any good\\". That pretty much describes this movie. He got his money and sent his body to sit in for him in the movie, leaving any acting ability at home asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was HORRIBLE!","review":"This movie was NOT slow paced,.............it was NON existent! There was No movie, NO plot, NO nothing. It just went on and on, and there was no point at ALL . A complete wast of Time!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh!","review":"The movie played more like a documentary. I can't believe they actually had lines to memorize for this. It would have been a quite decent documentary if it were one. As it is, Bill Murray the actor seems to be bored and on auto-pilot as the movie drags on. He's wry - which is usually good for him, but I found myself just waiting for the film to finish ... then when it did, I couldn't believe that was all there was to it.The title of the movie is just a ploy to use a cliché to sell it, and it worked as far as marketing goes. But it has nothing to do with its contents at all and is very misleading. There was no attempt by the American characters to understand anything Japanese, and between the Americans there was nothing to misunderstand. I am at a total loss as to why Bill Murray or the movie was nominated for an Academy Award. I didn't hate it, I just didn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bore to sit through","review":"Not for people who like movies with plots. Basically, Lost in Translation follows two Americans who are in Japan on business. Both have their problems (one has a workaholic husband and doesn't know what to do with her life, the other is an actor but feels stuck doing commercials, both have failing marriages), but they are not the highlight. Neither do anything to fix their problems, but they lean on each for support. Meaning, they go to karaoke bars and arcades and drink. There is absolutely nothing meaningful about Lost in Translation.While the back of the DVD case says an unexpected friendship blooms, their relationship is more like that of two people who don't know what they want. Ex. They act as if they want to help each other with their marriage issues, but then wind up sharing a passionate kiss before the guy (I forget his name.. It was really that boring) has to leave for the States. If some development of the romance had occurred, it might have made more sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow..just awful","review":"so glad to see all the one star reviews begin to dent to fake 5 star reviews.

Although there is very little plot the movie works because of the actors, music, and scenery. Bill Murray is wonderful and maybe will finally get the attention for being the fine actor he is. Scarlette is stungingly beautiful and always plays her parts so well. She never over acts and no just how to light the screen up with her bright smile. The movie is an enjoyable treat and worth ever bit of the $9 or so to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost on me","review":"I saw this movie because *everyone* was talking about it. I was expecting a comedy, like everyone says it is, and I went away feeling stupid. It made me feel like its movie more geared towards the upper class.I felt stupid. I honestly think this is a movie not everyone can apprieciate. It makes me sad, because its not often I don't like a movie and I wanted desperately to like this movie. Maybe I was trying too hard to like it.Overall, it plays like Elephant long scenes, hardly any dialogue, and detailed character protrayal. Except, I just was bored with this. There, similarly to Elephant, is simply no plot. However, that was intended on that film, and it just doesn't make sense with this one. At least not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Incredible","review":"Simply put, this is one of the most beautiful and memorible films you are ever going to see. I'm not going to go into details about the plot or explination of the film, that can be viewed from one of the many excellent reviews below. Alot of people don't seem to like this film, and I think that's because they just can't appreciate its realness (there isnt always a plot or dramatic scenes in life, there hardly ever is), or they just couldn't connect with the film. I guess I can understand that. But for those who like out of the ordinary, beautiful, and isolated feelings in film, than you will love this film. The ending is one of the most emotional scenes I have ever seen, and it's not in the typical sense. Just the sheer emotion is enough to make your heart melt. This film has inspired me to visit Japan, something I hadn't really thought about up until now. An absoulte must for any person who can truely appreciate cinema."},{"rating":"1","title":"averaged&uneven","review":"i finally saw this film after all the hype it's gotten.I've always fug Bill Murray&was glad he was finally getting some Props.but anyway this film goes all over the place without making a single statement&becomes one long film that I spent a good hour wondering how it got all the hype it recieved? it has some cool moments,but it doesn't merit all the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't get it.","review":"The rating is more like 2.5 stars, but who's counting.

A true gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"They got it just right","review":"It was wonderful. It came to me at a time of uncertainty in my own life, and it made me feel human again. The imagery and humor made the film come to life, and the performances by Johansson and Murray were perfect.

I can't believe that some people actully enjoyed the film!!! When it was through, everyone in my family were completely BLANK!! We were all mesmorized by the terrific boredness of the movie. The movie is about boring people being bored and it will leave you as bored as the movie.

The funny parts are only funny if you are desperate and there are not that many funny parts.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"great expectations . . . but . . .","review":"I had heard that this was an oscar-worthy movie and was looking forward to seeing it. Although I found it somewhat entertaining, at times, I generally felt that the story was jerky and disjointed. I don't mind filling in the blanks a bit when I watch a movie, but this one was asking a little too much. Bill Murray was quietly entertaining and I liked his performance. I just feel that the movie lets the audience down because it doesn't live up to it's initial promise to be an entertaining ride through Tokyo by two lonely people who are kindred spirits in spite of their many differences. It made a weak attempt at trying to grab at your heartstrings, but the attempt was a little too weak and again, disjointed. Left me wondering if the real heart of the movie was left on the cutting room floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for wasting 2 hours of my life.","review":"This movie is about 2 knuckleheads who have no life, and are boring, not funny get lost in tokyo.Its funny that the academy even wasted ink on putting this movie in oscar ballots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn Inducing","review":"I heard so many people rave about how entertaining it is. They would go on and on and so I thought I should leave everything else and rent the DVD. After around 45 mins into the film and trying my best to find the dull humor funny I still waited for the movie to start.It never does. Now, I dont think I'm closed to experimental cinema but this was just one of the most frustration inducing films ever.Its not torturous but just in plain simple words A waste of our valuable time.I love movies and Im not really picky. I didnt find one scene in the film that made me sit up and take notice. Now , I simply try to figure out what it was that made people like this film. Maybe the actor's really famous but I must say there's absolutely no chemistry in this film.I'd rather watch news from 2001 in French and I dont even speakFrench.

But what a dud! Kept waiting for it to get started and at the end, all I could say was \\"what was that all about\\". I know the critics highly praised it, but I have to be honest about what I saw, it didn't hook me emotionally and it rather irritated me in many scenes. The only scenes that were entertaining were when Bill Murray was doing the commercial. He was very good in that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kept waiting for the PLOT and HUMOR","review":"Granted, Bill Murray can generally make me laugh with just his facial expressions. However, this movie was still looking for a plot when they ran the credits. I have no clue as to how this movie got the nominations and awards it did.

Why stand for it on DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice photography, that's about it","review":"The critics gave two thumbs up, and the box descreibes as hilarious, but I think plot would have been helpful. Oh well, the background shots of Tokyo are interesting, and almost make up for the nihilism, but a travelogue would have worked just as well. The young actress Johannsen is certainly easy on the eyes. Overall, definitely a long, extended rock video with near zero content.

But when I heard it was up for best picture, I thought there must be something to it. WRONG. This was a terrible movie. There was little if any story, none of it made any sense, it was full of scenes that had nothing to do with what was going on (i.e., Bill Murray staring at his razer, Scarlett Johannson sitting in the bathtub staring into space) and I never once felt the urge to find out how the story ended. I am sure that is because there was no story to end. I asked around and every person I found who had seen this movie felt the same way -- it's a dud. I love Bill Murray as an actor, but there was simply no material in this movie and there was no interesting acting (except for maybe the one scene when he was making a commercial). This movie was certainly not worth what I paid for it, and I doubt I would even recommend the $3.95 to rent it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh My God","review":"I've just come back from watching \\"Taking Lives\\", as awful a piece of Hollywood trash as it's been my misfortune to see in a long time.Movies like that make you wonder why you ever liked movies in the first place.Thankfully the memory of \\"Lost in Translation\\" is there to remind me that films can be illuminating and sensitive and contain real human beings that we might actually encounter.I'm heartily weary of movies that have simple-minded bad guys and good guys, and murders, and no sense of believable characterisation for either. \\"Lost in Translation\\" is more like a superbly realised short story. Think of the stories of Richard Ford, Andre Dubus, and Graham Greene. The Dubus connection reminds me. If you liked \\"In the Bedroom\\" for its avoidance of movie cliches and its honest look at fallible characters in a sad situation you might well get a lot from \\"Lost in Translation\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immerse yourself in this film","review":"Are you someone who likes curling up with a book on a rainy day, listening to the sound of the rain in your quiet apartment, completely immersed in the text?You will love Lost in Translation.Like others have said, this is not the kind of movie you watch with your friends for a laugh. It's something you have to let yourself get lost in, and let yourself believe. There isnt a car chase or a sex scene, and this movie isnt going to fight to keep you interested (like some other movies in theaters which appeal to an ADHD generation).But get some alone time, go to a quiet space, and forget everything and everyone as you slowly sink into this beautifully crafted film.Interestingly enough, though this movie is in English, it reminded me of two foreign flicks- Amelie and Pan's Labyrinth."},{"rating":"1","title":"just boring","review":"to state it simply, this film has no plot, no action and no real meaning other than trying to make us identify with a couple of rich and spoiled bores who despite having an all expense paid trip to a wonderful city do nothing but complain about how difficult their life is...it seems like only a girl whose father was a famous director and who never had to work a day in her life could write and direct such a film..come to think of it..that is who directed this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in space","review":"Bill Murray for best actor not sure why?

When I heard this movie might be a bit slow, I still didn't hesitate to rent it. What a mistake! This movie never got going. It was one slow scene after another. There was little dialogue, little humor, and little of anything to be honest.Also, the movie was easy to get \\"lost\\" in. The Quiz show scene and many others were so brief it left one puzzled why they were even included. The acting was okay, but it gave Bill Murray little to do with such a dull script. If you are looking for good dramas I'd recommend Sea Buscuit, Radio, or nearly anything else in the video store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost time...","review":"The title of this film also happens to describe the feeling I got after watching it and then reading all the glowing reviews about it. There is some nice cinematography, a few insights about Japanese culture, and an out of character (but one-note) performance from Bill Murray. Otherwise this movie is a complete waste of time, with no plot to speak of, characters I couldn't care less about, and observations on life and stardom that have all been made a million times before. But then again, maybe something's been lost in translation..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute worst","review":"I have wasted my time and money.

It is also the second movie which pained me so much watching it that I could not bear to inflict the entire thing upon myself. I walked out of Up... this one I just hit the \\"stop\\" button. No way this movie could or should have been seriously considered for best picture. Same with Bill Murray for Best Actor. Much as I love the guy in other movies (Groundhog, Knew too Little) I had a hard time believing he was \\"serious\\" about this role. The more the movie went on, the more it seemed that he would really rather be \\"someplace else\\" (not trying to act the horrible script, for example). The humor was unfathomable and had a mystic, \\"should I laugh here?\\" quality to it.I despised the agony I felt watching this movie. Don't buy it, rent it, or go anywhere near it. If you do, I warned you!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll either love it or hate it","review":"And I loved it. Those who enjoy the typical Hollywood approach to film making will generally dislike this movie. This is no elaborate plot line. The characters aren't extraordinary heroes or heroines. And there are no dramatic deaths, over-the-top angst or drama. What there is, is a subtle, underlying set of emotions that you either will or will not relate to. Like most great things, this movie is not a compromise. It is not written and created to appeal to \\"everyone and their brother\\". And for 102 minutes of your time, I think it's worth the gamble for the opportunity to find a movie that will strike a deep emotional chord that most movies miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hillarious?","review":"So, Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers calls this film \\"hillarious\\" according to the reviews on the box.

I literally was forcing myself to watch it, thinking something would surprise me at the end, but I realized I wasted my time. I actually do not understand how any human being could actually write a story about this. The plot is basically based on nothing. Well, how two strangers meet each other in Tokyo and they are bored together. Great. Where's the twist? Where's the actual plot? There is none. They just drag themselves around bars and parties being bored out of their minds.One thing I really do NOT understand, is why the majority went crazy over this movie and believed it to be a masterpice. I personally, do not find it interesting to watch a middle aged man being followed by a camera in Tokyo, and him being bored the whole time. Where is the satisfaction?Overall, I wouldn't advise anyone to rent this, let alone buy this. A total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I had very high expectations when i rented Lost in Translation, boy was i dissapointed, the plot was non existent, the characters were undeveloped and the whole movie was uninteresting, the only reason it got so much praise by the press and an oscar id because of sophia coppolla's father, had this mess of a movie been directed by any other hollywood director, it would not have had so much praise and it would have simply bombed at the box office, by the end of this movie i was tempted to ask for my rental money back because this movie had been falsely advertise as one of the greatest movies of the year.do not buy this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie for Self-Righteous Snobs","review":"I find it interesting that most reviews that give this movie 1 star bash the movie itself, while the 5-star reviews can't really explain why they liked it; they just bash the people who didn't like the movie. As one person so aptly explained, \\"you need cultere\\" (love the spelling!).Some people like to equate this movie to a good foreign film, but as a lover of foreign films myself, the storytelling in this one was extremely weak compared to just about anything I've seen from offshore. And why the high praise for the camera work -- average at best. Also, this was NOT a comedy by any stretch of the imagination. An all-around substandard cinema experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Buying","review":"While I am a big Bill Murray Fan, and think he is truly under-rated as an actor. This movie was awful! We kept waiting for it to pick up, and be funny, but the laughs were few and far between. Even the outtakes were not funny. Photography and music was very good, but the story and dialogue was terrible. What could have been a really funny film showing the difference in Japanese vs. U.S. Culture was just a hodge podge of scenes thrown together to kill 90 minutes. If you really want to see it, wait for it to come out on Cable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadly dull and hideously overrated","review":"This movie is really nothing too special at all. Bill Murrary sits around and scowls and drinks whiskey, letting us know he is sad. He picks up a sad, hot young number at a Tokyo bar and proceeds to have a half-romantic half-platonic reltionship with her.The film's pace is as slow as a snail and the humor, while often genuinely funny, is given in small and infrequent doses.The ending is really anti-climatic, to boot.I'd recommend seeing this movie, but only because so many others seem to just love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie I ve seen in a long time...","review":"I just loved this movie. If you a real movie lover, you will love it too! The story itself is so simple but at the same time is so complex , at least for the people who are experiencing it. If you have been abroad for quite a long time you MUST see it, Im sure it will put you to think about your own experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"a complete non-event","review":"I do not understand how anyone can rate this film 5/5 notwithstanding the fact the director received an academy award for best director?!When I think of this film, the two words that ruminate over and over again in my head are \\"boring\\" and \\"trite\\".Besides one or two scenes with Bill Murray the film has no value as a comedy. The storyline is weak and amounts to nothing more than a friendship struck between two people in a foreign country...um...with a few stereotypical scenes thrown in of Tokyo/Japanese culture...and then it ends. I just cannot see that the film possesses any deeper meaning or artistic merit than that.I guess American audiences will lap it up but otherwise for those who have a tangible understanding of the outside world you will find the attitude the film has towards Japenese culture and language to be contrived and shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost In Translation","review":"Maybe I just missed the whole point here, but I don't really understand why this movie recieved all of the praise it got. When I rented the DVD, I was interested to see what all the hype was about, but it's still beyond me. It was quite literally plotless. It's a bit like watching a home video of two people's trip to Tokyo. The actors are good, but they have nothing to work with. You wait the whole movie for something to happen, but nothing ever does. It's just a montage of seemingly unrelated scenes. Maybe it's just too artsy for me, but I felt that this movie was a complete waste of time. It was neither entertaining nor amusing. Very much a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Translation...","review":"This movie just proves if that you have enough marketing money...the hype will build.This movie is all dressed up with no place to go.....I saw it in the theatre and I should have asked for my money back.The script stunk. The characters are bored while in exciting Tokyo so they sit in bars and smoke and share shallow dialogue. Gee hold me back! This is one big yawn...This flick makes my top ten list of worst movies I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in Plotless Boredom","review":"What a waste of film and time. Not only did the movie lack any plot whatsoever, there was no climax. I waited for the movie to start, but it actually never did. The movie also inaccurately portrayed Japanese culture by focusing only on the young generation, and only on a minority of that group, nonetheless. It was almost insulting, and the critics who view this movie as \\"pleasant\\" are most likely the ones \\"lost in translation.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-hyped!","review":"I REALLY do like Bill Murray a great deal but, to paraphrase one clever critic of old, his performance in this movie went the whole gamut of A to B. The problem probably lay in the immature direction of Coppola and a creeping, boring script that perhaps tried to be subtle and \\"sophisticated\\" in defining characters, but failed miserably. I think the reasons why this movie got so many nominations and Oscars were, one, the name Coppola, and two, HAD TO award a woman director."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regarding Ballot stuffing comment","review":"To the individual who wrote regarding the obvious \\"ballot stuffing\\" 5 star reviews by a single person here, I would ordinary think it is a joke, but the person (from Seattle) has written a pretty organized and diverse opinion for each post. This leads me to believe that maybe it is not just some fanatic writing these but maybe someone interested in making sure this film does well on amazon..I wonder who that can be? One word of advice..if you are going to take the time to write numerous reviews, try at least changing your location once in a while (watch how we will now get a bunch of 5 star reviews from other locations lol)By the way, I found the film very boring and encourage people to rent it before buying since you are very likely to be dissapointed..unless of course, if you watch movies to be depressed and bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever...","review":"This is a junk movie... no redeeming value, no plot, no anything! Total hype!Like the emporer's clothes, there is absolutely nothing there!!!An ego trip for a no talent wanna be... someone needs their olfactories checked... this stinks to no end...How low can one's level of minimal standards go? This is an insult to all movie buffs... watching grass grow is way more exciting and interesting than this tasteless waste of time and money; an insult to the movie world...Nothing there to get lost..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was tedious not subtle....","review":"This is Bill Murray doing his quiet I am barely here routine again. Like the guy in Broken Flowers, Rushmore and Life Aquatic. Strangely I liked all of those other movies, but this one was boring. It looks pretty and the performances are okay, but not enough happens, it is not romantic and it is most certainly not funny.People keep speaking of all these cute social observations as if they require a meticulous or intelligent mind to capture or something.I mean hello? It is no longer observationally witty to realize that the Japanese are short, have bizarre television shows and run American sit-coms with weird voiceovers. It is not much of a revelation that a person would be lonely in a strange land with different languages and customs.This is not wit or subtlety. It is unfunny and boring.I really liked the Virgin Suicides and I love Bill Murray, but I do not recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A TERRIBLE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Would you consider this a movie? There is no plot. I like movies where there is actually a story line. I can see there was no thought in making the movie. It only took 28 days to make it and plus, it isn't even funny. I didn't even chuckle once. When you buy DVDs, stay 3 feet away from this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Academy owes me $19.99","review":"I would've chose zero stars but there is no option. I bought the DVD because it was nominated for an Oscar. Thinking...Bill Murray in a comedy...nominated for an Oscar...good reviews...Gotta be a good movie. One thing I require of a movie is it must be entertaining or stir emotion or stimulate reflection. This movie does nothing. It is not entertaining, It stirs no emotion (well it did make me mad that I wasted 20 bucks and an evening)and the only thing it stimulated was this review. By far the worst movie I have seen this year. I do, however, recommend that you watch it for yourself as words cannot possibly express how bad this movie is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"The acting is very good, the movie well carfted, but the story, simply put, is not interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Lost in Translation","review":"This movie has the correct title. I tried to watched this movie for 45 minutes and just couldn't take any more. With all the good reviews and nominations/awards that it received, was I the one that was \\"Lost in Translation\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I saw this movie in Marseille in a cinema showing foreign films, and because I didn't speak a single word of French, I could just totally understand what Bob Harris was going through.Frankly, the unbelievable lips of Scarlett Johannsen are reason enough to see the movie.I saw another review saying that the movie shows signs of racism against Japanese people, indicating that they are short and that they don't speak English well. Well, they don't, and they are short, so this is not racism, but just amusing.The mood of the movie is very consistent, some people might say depressing, I would say layed back and inspired by the ability of the actors, especially Bill Murray, to show emberassment, amusement and astonishment about themselves. They are not sure how they got to this point in their lives, and they are even less sure if they like it there.My resumé: a movie that leaves you with more hope than you had before."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I think this movie just passed right over the top of my head. Yes, I know the differences in foreign travel but.....I kept waiting for the story to develop and something to happen in this movie.Sorry, a waste of talent, movie money and my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost on me.","review":"I'm sorry but what's the big deal here? Lots of dead spots. The academy awards nominations were what attracted me to rent this. Bill Murray is amusing as a lonely 50 something man far from his comfort zone. Scarlett Johansson is cute & pulls off being older than her 18 years. She is also lonely in Tokyo. They find each other, bond & have some adventures in the big city. It doesn't become sexual which is good. Their affection for each other is genuine & their parting is a nice tender moment. The real star of this movie is Tokyo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, Bad DVD","review":"The first DVD I have purchased that requires the viewer to fast forward past commercials. Disgusting commercialism mars an otherwise nice, subtle movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie of the Year","review":"This is Hollywood promotional fraud at its finest. During the first 15 minutes my wife reached the point where she could not stand it. Since I purchaed it I perservered to the bitter end. What a waste of time. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Really B...O...R...I...N...G and Pointless","review":"Unclear motivations and poor pacing make this a disappointment. Whatever was the Academy thinking when they gave a Best Screenplay to this film? Turn on the subtitles or you'll miss some of the dialogue that's made so subtle in the audio mix that you really can't hear it. The proufound alienation and artificiality of the characters is mirrored in the treatment of Japanese society. In the end, there's nobody in this movie to care about or even to like."},{"rating":"1","title":"insulting","review":"Having been to Tokyo, and working with Japanese people on a regular basis I can tell you this movie is a disgrace and an insult. I'm ashamed.The plot ? there is none. The movie is boring like hell, and only the constant mockery can keep some people amused. Not me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but brilliant!!","review":"I saw this when it came out and wasnt impressed. Now 10 years later i have the DVD and have watched it about 8 times! Its the kind of movie that grows on you. Plot is simple but the relationship between the leads draws you in and you feel as if you are there with them in Japan. Got a documentary feel sometimes. The love story is so subtle but Murray nails it and the chemistry between these 2 is what makes the movie a winner. Casting by Sofia Copolla shows her insight. The cinematography and music sells it and the fact it was all shot on location in Japan. The original script looks bare( I took a look at it) but Murrays take on it took it to another level! I think Murray deserved more credit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Understated yet Powerful","review":"Sofia Coppola's remarkable filmscript and cinematography make this an extraordinary film. Bill Murray is at his ironic best, an American who is truly lost in contemporary Japanese culture as he visits Japan to film a commercial. Scarlet Johansson, I always thought, was overrated until I saw her in this film, apparently her break-through film. Their observations about life and marriage are insightful, and the relationship that these two forge is exquisite in its beauty and its understated qualities. I saw this film on Showtime in a hotel on a business trip several months ago, liked it so much that I immediately thereafter purchased the DVD, and continue to screen it with friends and family members or even watch it alone. It is eminently deserving of repeat viewings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting...","review":"I watched this movie two weeks ago and I am still waiting for something to happen. It stumbles and bumbles along with no real point. I guess critics like that kind of thing; I found it a complete waste of an evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Boring Movie Ever","review":"I saw this film in the theater. There were only two other people there. It was boring, slow-moving and had no plot. It was about two people being bored in Tokyo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum","review":"What's all the fuss about this movie? Definitely not Oscar material, in my opinion. Neither the acting nor the directing. I'm glad I only rented it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me up when it's over!","review":"When the movie came out I wasn't interested in seeing it. When it came out in DVD I still wasn't interested but I had a 99 cent rental coupon so I decided to give in to the hype and rent it. Well, I should have listened to my inner voice. I kept waiting for it to get interesting and just kept shaking my head trying to figure out why everyone liked it so much. Weak plot, lackluster characters, mediocre acting. Frankly I just didn't get it. Rarely do I stop watching a movie midway through it but after I got to the part where they are singing karioke I couldn't take any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"racist rich girl fantasy","review":"Narcissistic, racist and empty. Japanese people, for the crime of not being American, are sneered at by Murray and Johnanssen for an hour and a half. All those friends of yours who hated it?

This is actually boring, boring, boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh!","review":"Well, after hearing the hype about this movie I was really excited to get a chance to watch it. Two hours later, I feel as if someone owes me my money back! The movie is slow moving, and really has no point. It is just a movie about two sad people stuck half way around the world from home, hanging out for a week, and that's i t . No plot twists, no climax, nothing just ... u g h !"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOKYO OR BUST","review":"Ok they're in Japan and they're lonely they find each other, they have some fun, but I never found these two interesting. Drinking, Drinking, Drinking....go home to your family....blow your brains out...have it out with your inatentive husband...get a divorce. The fake insightfulness of this maudlin snorefest is only saved by the closing credits, which if played loud enough will wake you up and let you know the movie's over."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real sleeper","review":"This disc is great for those who need sleep and are afraid of sleeping pills.you'll be in snooze world before you can say, where's the remote.What a waste of talent.Murray and Johansson deserved better than this coma of a script!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHO IN THE WORLD WOULD FIND THIS ENTERTAINING ??","review":"I sat and watched this until the end which was more than this movie deserved from any brain functioning human being. I had thought that this could have been an interesting film. Ms. Coppa should consider trade school for the liberal untalented Hollywood off spring. Bill Murray should fire his agent and undergo anger management. He can't be proud of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scenic But Goes Nowhere","review":"Interesting view of Japan, and Bill Murray is amusing, but there is no real plot. After a while, it just becomes annoying.I cannot believe this won an Oscar for Best Screenplay - it takes real genius to write a screenplay with lots of scenes of people sitting around, looking melancholy.It had potential, but went nowhere in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad.","review":"If you are faced with choosing between this movie and the \\"other one\\", always choose the \\"other one\\". I do give this movie five stars, however, for its title: the title means a lack of gaining full meaning from communication and this movie itself functions as a communicative medium that presents little meaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this movie!","review":"This is absolutely the worst movie in the history of movie making!I'm no critic but I do have over 300 or so DVDs and this movie is unbearable from beginning to end, the absolute worst thing I've ever seen.Save your money for something else, anything else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back!!","review":"Definitely one of the worst movies I have seen, what is the storyline, really boring from beginning to end, what a big dissapointment, I would not recommend it at all. How did they get to nominate this movie for an award, I should have read the users review first before I have spent my money and waste it. Im really sorry for my comments here but I know which is good and which is bad movies. They don't have 0 out of 5 stars that's why I have to put 1 star!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOSSED IN TRANSLATION","review":"I have little doubt this film depicts what it was like to be an American overseas during 9/11. Although it is never mentioned there seems to be no other reason for the constant inability to leave a Tokyo hotel, spend endless hours watching the tv, allow the camera to repeatedly capture the sight of Tokyo skyscrapers. It so conveys the feeling of being stuck somewhere that I felt increasing impatience and a bit of anxiety watching it. As it started, I was laughing with abandon at Bill Murray's culture clash with the Japaneese, but this initial amusement soon became restless as the culture of Japan is never seen as anything but a stereotype. Scarlett Johansson is sweet but dull as Murray's interest and Murray's character is soon diminished to a meaningless person as the director steers us into what must be her expression of 9/11. Thanks but no thanks. I have my own impressions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too True","review":"This is really how it feels to be American and living in Tokyo. Sort of disjointed and intrigued at the same time. Of course we can't all live as well as Bill and Scarlett, but the loneliness they experience would be familiar to an American whose tried living in Japan. Sofia nails it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoring and Boring Movie","review":"I fell asleep thirty minutes into the movie, and woke up one hour later feeling like I didn't miss a thing. While the actors displayed great character understanding, the dialogue (or lack of) and setting (weird Tokyo) left a feeling like the movie is without meaning. I was sad that I wasted $20.00 on a movie that was hyped up too much. I'm glad it landed Bill Murray a Golden Globe (finally!), but I also think he should have been recognized for other roles he has played in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOST DIRECTOR AND VERY LOST MOVIE","review":"Lost in Translation is probably one of the worst movies ever produced. It was badly concived and terribly executed. There is nothing there but the lack of knowledge, multiple mistakes, and the non-existant talent. Why do we lie to ourselves and to others? Why is it nominated for anything? I do not know anyone who liked it and I hated it. It was so boring, wrong and predictable. Cinemas are empty when they show this film but they still show it. Well, maybe the answer is in the family. This family controlls business and there are many in the family. I wish Sophia all the best but this is not the way to enter business. I think she should try to use talent instead of connections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't sleep...","review":"Just what went on un this film? Supposedly there is supposed to be some kind of spark between the two main characters, but where was it? No dialogue to explain why we should care. A disappointment to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Dissapointing","review":"I was so looking forward to this film. I love Bill Murray and I really enjoyed Virgin Suicides Coppola's early effort. But this film is such a mess I don't even know where to begin. It was trying to explore some very fascinating themes with extremely poor execution. I just didn't care about these characters when it was all over and I knew that that was not the filmmaker's intention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and it's disappointing that people made such a big deal over it. Isolation, I get it.But, seriously...what is the point, and the awkward script leaves so much to be desired. I wonder if Sophia would be allowed to make movies if she had a different last name? Is she just trying to be weird, and find some weird niche? Yes, her dad was ground breaking, so I guess those are big shoes to fill...but, then maybe you just should'nt try.The movie is boring, with little dialogue, and you don't really care what happens with the character. The setting is boring, and the movie overall is weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"The absolutely worst film in history","review":"This film is a piece of crap. I had to give 1 star because I wouldn't be able to post otherwise.I just don't understand why so many people made a big deal out of this \\"film.\\" the story is not there, period. of course, a film doesnt really need to have a linear story, but this non-story has no meaning of being a non-story. Is the picture beautiful in this \\"film\\" even? absolutely not. this film is definitly lost in-between translation (of nothing, I should say). all the misunderstandings between the main characters and japanese people in the \\"film\\" do not make any sense or have any purpose. another example of westerner's blind fascination about japanese culture-- totally blind and empty."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOod movie","review":"This is definately one of the greatest movie last year. If you are the type of person that does not like all the computer graphic (like \\"lord of the ring\\") and wanna see something that touches human inner side , then this is the movie to watch.

Bill Murray's performance is quirky at best (a reviewer's word was \\"understated\\") and the plot, such as it was, took nearly an hour to develope enough so you could see kinda where things were going.Meander is what this film does. The Murray character's life is disintegrating and Scarlett Johansson's character, Charlotte, has been ditched by her photographer husband.

Only an idiot would think this is a great film. Anyone who's actually seen a movie that didn't make the Top 10 Blockbusters will know this is film barely hits mediocre.

I would have given it a lower rating but one star is as low as they go. Words like \\"horribly boring, \\"pointless\\", and \\"why bother\\" would normally spring to mind, but our mind had gone numb with confussion. Why would a geat talent like Bill Murry do a terrile movie like this? Why would anyone spend time seeing a movie like this? People who enjoyed this movie are the sames ones who enjoy watching paint dry.Now for the bad news. This is definitely one of the worst movies ever made. Please speard the word, tell your friend, send out junk email - \\"Don't let your friends see this complete junk\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Lost My Attention\\"","review":"I can't believe this movie got so much hype and a Golden Globe Award. A more appropriate title would be \\"Lost My Attention\\" because the story moved very slowly. Certainly, Bill Murray is a really cool guy and a comedic actor whom we all grew up with. I can't blame him for this script where nothing happens. But his older films STRIPES and MEATBALLS were much more entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent film making with great performances!","review":"I did not have a lot of expectations when I watched the movie but turned out to be top notch. Excellent performances by Scarlett Johannson and Bill Murray. If you appreciate good film making and independent movies, you will really like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars if possible","review":"What a terrible movie. The worst I have seen. The reviews on the pack use words like \\"hilarious\\" no way. This movie is ridiculous. Terrible plot terrible acting. The only thing that's funny about it is if you can stay awake.

Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Positively Pastoral-would make a good screensaver","review":"I really wanted to like it. I love Bill Murray's acting but this movie never gets started...and maybe that's the point...but it's still no fun to watch. It is a strangely compelling flick but in the same vein as a still life tableau. I've also never been so aware of screen changes as I was with this movie, because the scenes don't seem to flow and instead come across as an arrhythmic collage with rather random syntax. With this in mind, it might be more satisfying to put the scenes from the movie on a PC as a screensaver! In the end, however, it would probably be as maddening as the movie. Given the awards frenzy, I just can't help but think that the public has been led down the garden path by the Hollywood establishment promoting one of its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex schmex...","review":"It seems that other reviewers feel that the only reason some might find this movie lacking is the fact that the main characters don't have sex.Not at all. In fact, I think I would have felt cheated had they taken their relationship past where they did.This movie was lacking because it had no direction, woefully poor character development, and did very little with copious resources to create a truly captivating story.Frankly, I think most people didn't like this story simply because it was boring.If you want to see two boring, rude, unhappy white people wandering around a foreign country while apparently appreciating very little of the culture and even less of the fantastic opportunity to expand their horizons, please watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I Rate it a Zero","review":"I rented this one, What a waste of time and money. As I have had the opportunity to travel to Japan I could not believe the self-pitying of the characters. The movie is long, slow, boring, and only really rates an R by unnecessary inclusion of a strip joint. Avoid this one if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Picture? P L E A S E............................","review":"I really wanted to see this film because of all the hype. In addition, I adore Bill Murray. I guess I need to just avoid any movie that the critics like (I did love THE ENGLISH PATIENT). I have actually heard critics say that this movie is better than LORD OF THE RINGS and it should win the academy award. Hello!! Watching LOST IN TRANSLATION was sheer torture. It was so boring--of course this is because nothing happened. And, it wasn't funny (with the exception of a couple scenes). In fact, there was no point, message or even climax during the entire movie. The only thing I liked about this film was the scenery of Tokyo. Before I rented this DVD I checked the reviews on AMAZON and there were over 4 stars. I'm glad to see that the dislikes now total the likes and people will get a fairer overview."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plagarism Rewarded","review":"This movie's director won the Oscar for best screenplay. What no one at the Academy seems to have realized is that it was grossly plagarized from Haruki Murakami's 90's novel 'Dance, Dance, Dance'. Characters are rearranged, subplots eliminated, but the basic themes, settings, characters, and relationships are identical.(Example: in the movie, the young woman is abandoned in a large Japanese hotel by her photographer husband and taken in tow by a middle-aged man; in the book, the young woman is abandoned in a large Japanese hotel by her photographer husband and taken in tow by a middle-aged man.)In sum, the movie is a blatant, shameless, rip-off.Murakami is one of the foremost Japanese authors of our time. The fact that no one at the Academy caught the theft is a sad comment on the insularity of Americans. The Oscar should be returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oscar Winner? How?","review":"Maybe its me, but i settled down to watch this with a lass 12 years my senior, hoping to be entertained and captured by this film, which many have raved about. Instead, frankly, i was bored senseless.Nothing at all grabbed my interest. I neither empathised nor sympathised with the characters, and the only thing that kept me to the end of the film is that i'd made a big deal of it myself to my companion, based on the media coverage and reviews.The story can be covered with a hugely brief synopsis. Two people, of different age-groups and sexes, in Tokyo although not really wanting to be there, are drawn to each other via the hotels bar, and become friends, both feeling gladness at the others uncomfortableness in this culture so different to what they are used to.And thats about it really. \\"Dull\\" doesnt seem to be a strong enough word, but perhaps i over anticipated due to the hype, so i am restraining myself from using the word \\"drivel\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just could not get into it.","review":"Boring excursion into Tokyo lacks a funny bone that could have been needed to keep this movie running along but it get bog down with too much drama, and too much head scratching on what is going on. Bill Murray is fine but he needs to get back to real comedy, Not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"No plot + no direction + 3 mildly funny Bill Murray scenes = 2 hours of my life I wasted. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, Xenophobic, Unimaginative","review":"From all the film reviews I'd expected something more intelligent than the retreaded humor about how Japanese roll their r's, their short stature (actually they're getting quite tall these days, must be eating more McBurgers), and cultural differences played for laughs. Murray's character is a snotty bore, angry and frustrated for being there, and dimissive of a culture that he never really tries to understand. The ugly American in a foreign land who is angry because the natives don't speak English correctly; the nerve!I'd have more sympathy for Murray's character if he'd actually tried to reach out to anyone, got off his sorry duff and tried to reach out the Japanese for a change, use a few lines of broken Japanese perhaps, but he never does and that's the shame of this film. Coppola seems talented and the cinematography was beautiful, but this film still read like a spoiled, jaded rich girl's vision of Japan. It was all about the beautiful surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It","review":"I heard all the accolades this movie received so I went and bought it on DVD without renting it first. BIG MISTAKE. I couldn't tell you how horrible this movie is with just a 1000 words. I am an American that lives in Japan and could relate to the characters the first time I came here, but this movie just never grabbed my attention.We passed this around to our friends who had similiar reactions. The best quote was from one friend who gave it back and said, \\"I'm sorry we didn't get to finish the movie, we had to go change our sock drawer.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy! At best rent. Don't worry if you never see it.","review":"It's a dissapointment. It's a slightly sad whisper quiet dainty snapshot of living life out of a hotel room in a foreign country where you don't have many people you can communicate with. This movie has no crescendo. It's flat sad the whole time. Bill Murray just restrains his actions more to get serious and only gives one joke at a time and the jokes are spaced at least 15 minutes apart.It does make you wonder whether Bill will bag the girl or not and that's the suspense of the movie. I guess also the girl and Bill make each other's time in Tokyo less lonely. I just wasn't moved by this movie. You'd think a guy making $2 million to fly to Tokyo to do a commerical could afford to bring a few friends along so he wouldn't get bored.One of the bigger dissapointments I've seen in the last few years. LIke others have said it doesn't deserve the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-notch advice","review":"McDaniel provides great advice for young athletes from the perspective of a professional player who has been through the wars. As an NFL veteran, he can speak with authority on what it takes to make it as a professional athlete.

Their studio albums are no good to begin with and this is no exception, just like round room, and farmhouse before it, this album is bad. If you like their studio albums you are not true fan and you are an idiout. Do yourself a favor and buy the live albums they are way better, even though phish sucks live now because they incorporate all their new crap. Phish is only good pre '98. Trey only cares about himself and just loves to hear himself talk...my friend does way more drugs than he does"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sound of Tranquility.","review":"I've never known much about Phish but heard their latest single, \\"The Connection\\", last week and loved it. On Saturday I went to go buy Cake's latest, only to discover it won't be released for a month, so I bought Phish instead. Since then, I've listened to Undermind twenty-five times. The bad news is that the CD is uneven. The good news is that at least five of the songs are great. I find the sound relaxing and joyful which is all too rare in music today (in my humble opinion). On the back cover there is a picture of the band and they're all smiling broadly and warmly. That's truly reflective of the mental state the release produced in me. It's also impressive that the musicians refused to adopt \\"poseur\\" stances when photographed. I'll be buying more of their catalogue in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to it","review":"I should prefeace my remarks with the fact that I started listening to these guys in 1990 and have seen upawards of 35 shows.OK, So this my 3rd time through the disc. The first time, I thought to myself, \\"what the heck IS this?\\" Now, it just keeps getting better. Watch the DVD. This does not seem like a band that is calling it quits.This is good music. The band has put their sweat and tears into this album and it shows. The playing is tight and allows for lots of room to play around when they take it live. I can't wait!!Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Waaaaaaa......","review":"Duuuuuude! This aint no Rift. Come on all of you Phisher than thou fans, evolution of music is what it is all about. Maybe thats why the band is dismantling. To please the throngs of those who only want another Junta or Rift would be to stagnate into being just another nostalgic, perpetual money-making machine like, say, the Rolling Stones. Steel Wheels? Voodoo Lounge? Those lame efforts pale in comparison to Undermind.This album is similar to the G-Dead's In The Dark, not musically, but how I feel about both band's final albums - better than most other albums on the market and different in a way that that makes me glad to have been able to witness the best that live music has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth any amount of time","review":"To echo the only decent, partisan review on this page (see M.Cagey's review) this album is just pure blech. The downward trend that was initiated by phish starting past farmhouse and right before the hiatus, is completed here. This is a bland, impassionate studio effort at best. It is really painful to say this seeing as I have been a devoted fan of their work since the early to mid 90's, but this album is really bad and if this is indicative of their passion, then they should be hanging it up. A mere shadow of what they used to be, any other album pre-Round Room blows this one away. No strong moments, and I'm not even sure if Mike even attended the recording sessions. To all you fools who continue to insist that phish can do no wrong, wake up. I'm gonna go put in 12-30-93 followed by 8-13-97 to try and force this abomination of sound out of my mind. The good old days indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good as usual, but not very Phishy","review":"What astounded me most of this album is how unlike it is to every other Phish album. Concededly, it is good, but it is equivalent to the first album of some other band. Some of the tunes are reminiscent of great jams like Picture of Nectar or Lawn Boy, but the vast majority of tunes are (and there is no other way to say it) a lot like Pop. Not really what I expected from the Phab Phour.Again, Undermind is a good solid album and a must have for every Phish enthusiast. Just don't act so surprised when it's not what you expected.One thing is for sure, every album Phish produces is always different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you people all insane???","review":"How in the world can anyone like this album as a Phish album??? I mean, c'mon, this album would be ok by a freshman band trying to break into mainstream radio, but this bubble gum sheet is definitely below these seasoned veterans......their worst outing since the decline started with Farmhouse. I guess the people reviewing this album haven't seen these guyas live, because they are far better than this pile could ever reveal. After a piece of junk like this, I would break up too! In fact, I'd have listened to it, realized it sucked, hid it away and snuck off into the night!!! Mr. Anastasio needs to get back to his roots, and be a member of the band...instead of trying to be the king phish...because he has the ability to make some sweet sounds when he does that. But, hey, fame would go to my head to. I guess when you have made enough money that you don't have to practice, Trey, it shows!!! Still, I'll miss you guys. See you at Coventry."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is not Phish","review":"It can't be real. This is some sick trick.

It's new songs such as Nothing and Undermind are very good bringing the old Phish flair back. Being a huge Vida Blue and Gordon fan i love the tracks Acces Me and the ever popular Vida Blue hit Army of One. Alot of the songs you'll be fimiliar with such as Secret Smile which Trey plays often on his solo shows. As for Scents and Subtle sounds and Two Versions of Me theyv'e been around for a while and any phan knows it, but lucky me back in 11.28.03 at Nassau Coliseum I was treated to a brand new song later to be featured on this album it was the first show they debuted Crowd Control at. So pick up this album enjoy it i will be at 8 of the 13 final sows, see you there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy tunes ... only one solo","review":"First, I'm a huge fan ... first show back in '93. These guys pretty much defined my early twenties.I found it a little shocking that there is only one guitar solo from Trey on this CD. As a guitar fanatic, this is tough for me to deal with.Overall, the tunes are pretty good and sure to become live classics, but I'm a little disappointed with the energy level on the CD. \\"Undermind\\" and \\"Crowd Control\\" are highlights, and \\"Access Me\\" really shows off Fishman's skill ... and Mike Gordon's strange ways ... my personal favorite.The DVD is worth watching. In fact, I understood and enjoyed the album much more after doing so. I keep picturing the mountains of vermont ... piles of snow ... forests ... well maybe even Scents and Subtle Sounds ... now I think I get it. Nice job Phish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Openmind","review":"People come on. Where are all your open minds? Isn't Phish about new sounds and open minds that take you places that other music doesn't? If Phish was putting out albums like 'Junta' and 'Nectar' etc. today, then you all would be ragging them for not having the balls to 'change their direction'. Be thankful that there has been a band like Phish for the last 21 years not afraid to do what they feel sounds right.Having said that, I think that 'Undermind' is good. They have come a long way musically since the early days and I for one am glad. I recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Wanted to hook up my vehicle lights so they worked along with the trailer.

For example, I'm sure I came across 'agitation' three times on one page, and I can tell you I ended up more agitated than Mlle de Chartres ever would be after trying to scrape my way through it.Needless to say, I'll be allowing more time to read these books beforehand so that I don't have to delve into another poorly translated version again.Get it in French."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"Allegedly the music is lost in the translation, and since the novel reads like an encyclopedia entry i wouldnt bother unless you have no choice.

Instead, Gruenwald turned it into much, much more.For the good of humanity, the Squadron Supreme wind up taking control of their version of Earth. Despite their noble intentions, things go horribly horribly wrong. Touching on serious issues, but in a very four-color way, this never had quite the impact or the gritty tone of Watchmen, but certainly had the ambition.Squadron Supreme has been revived in the past few years, but that's long after the fact - Gruenwald was ahead of his time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good guide to CBT","review":"Easy to understand the concept as the author made a very comprehensive approach to lead the readers to explore CBT"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Dummies.","review":"Excellent audio book, found it very detailed, informative and professional, easily understood.

Using numerous examples, though, the author makes very compelling arguments about why software project management is different than conventional project management. In fact, many of his points were so vivid that I was tempted to forward them to my supervisor.Author Stepanek doesn't have a silver bullet that kills the \\"software werewolf\\".

Several archetypes are followed: the grad student who has been there since the dawn of time and his ever-pregnant wife, the wishy-washy grad student, the female grad student who can't get a date, the first-years, and the token humanities grad student.

If you are not in that category of the struggling in need of ego-stroking, then you probably won't be interested. Firstly, it is not funny. After a few pages we get it: grad students are overworked, tired, poor, starving, and mostly geeks seeking dates. How is that different than the life of undergrads? Ok, grad students have an awkward relationship with professors (who don't even know their names and use them as slaves) and under-grads (who consider them authority figures) which gives the grad students an odd mental complex. No much real humor here. Unless you count references to how supposedly great the weather is presumably in Palo Alto which is not really that good compared to southern California.

The strip is immensely popular though among grad audidence and you can see the latest comic pasted on notice boards or across the lab windows or even outside the offices of profs themselves. I feel every one in grad school can relate to at least one of the characters in the strip, and of course compare their advisor to Prof Smith ;).

Anyone who has never had the pleasure of hearing Third Day sing 'Thief' should take the time and enjoy that experience.I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome debut","review":"This is really a fantastic album for any Christian rock fan. If you're new to Christian music, you need to get exposed to the neo-classic stuff - and this album is a great place to begin. This record plays great from start to finish with no duds to bore you. This belongs in every Christian's home."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Music for me!","review":"Growing up I listened to 80's Heavy Metal. I'm now in my early 30's, but unlike my teenage years I now have an awesome relationship w/ Jesus Christ. Third Day has given me the music I love with the message I need. I recently bought the soundtrack for the song \\"Thief\\" and have sung it in my church. The responce was great from everyone old and youg alike. Third Day has helped me get through some deep valleys. I recommend any one how wants to hear it like it is to purchase this CD. I promise you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely God-Anointed...","review":"This first CD by Third Day is wonderful beyond words. The ultimate song on the album has to be \\"Love Song.\\" It is so meaningful, and a wonderful worship song that just displays the power of Jesus' love.

Look for their new album, Time, coming out August 24."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIRD DAY (WOW)","review":"GREAT CHRISTIAN ROCK I OWN MOST ALL OF THEIR MUSIC,ONE OF THE BEST SONG ON HERE & BELIEVE THERE ARE ALOT OF THEM BLACK BIRD IS A GREAT TUNE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overwhelming music is timeless","review":"I bought this CD when it was first released, listen to it constantly, and cannot imagine ever tiring of it! This music just engulfs you with the awesomeness of Christianity. It puts perfectly into words and music everything that I have ever felt as a Christian, and reminds me constantly that I am a Christian by choice, and that is a wonderful choice to make. Many times a listen to this CD will bring to mind prayers that need to be said, and repentance that needs to be made, but it is not judgmental or condescending. Quite the contrary, it so perfectly displays God's greatness, that it makes me want to be as worthy as I in my infinite unworthiness can be. I feel refreshed with each listen. Please, buy this CD; you will not regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian music at it's best","review":"I stumbled onto Third Day from the WOW 99 CD. Their version of Micheal W. Smith's Agnus Dei is one of my favorite songs. The singer can definitely deliver a song. I then stumbled onto them again on the 97 WOW CD, with \\"Nothing At All\\", once again I found it to be the best song on the album, or close to it. This compelled me to go out and find the Third Day albums. I wasn't disappointed at all. The fact is they can hold a candle to any of the mainstream rockers. I recommend this album for anyone who enjoys either good old fashioned rock or Grunge music. Before I found Third Day, I thought DC talk was by far the best, now I'm not so sure.

In fact, I think the word \\"cynic\\" is only used in the whole of the text... maybe twice? It's full of kitschy new-age pop mantras that might work for someone who's used to being happy but has maybe hit a bad streak. I get the feeling this author has never had a cynical day in her life.

There are so many more books on subjects such as 'the law of attraction' that are better value, and humorous books that are funnier, that this book wasn't worth the trouble, in my opinion.

This book tells you to think of you and only you without a thought of others - that is selfish. Yes, we want to be happy, but you can't keep throwing people, work, things away because it is not working the way you want (what are you going to do if the next way doesn't work, get rid of it too?)

I don't have an amp and can't test it with one until I do, but I have tested it with my VCR and laptop going to a surround 5.1 speaker system. They worked fine, nice and loud before but the laptop used to run with a ground-loop hum that was kind of annoying. Now the sound is anemic and has the quality of listening through a soup-can telephone system (phantom reverb, small echos, totally washed-out sound and very weak.) On the upshot, it completely got rid of the ground loop hum. Now I'm searching for an amp that works with 1/2\\" plugs. This may be a goose-chase though and I may wind up returning it to where I got it (not Amazon unfortunately.)

With my other laptop, which does not have an earth pin on the power supply cable (Dell Vostro 1500), however, it adds a serious amount of high pitched noise, clicks and hum to the signal when no noise was present before.

DWJ book by far, & I've read most of them","review":"For anyone so sadly deprived as to have not yet read ANYTHING by the deservedly renowned Diana Wynne Jones- I weep for you. Really. She is definately among my all-time favorite authors. This particular story, however, somehow is my favorite. It's not her longest, or most detailed, or complex, but it is my favorite. It is charminly insane and ridiculously funny. I laugh out every time I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest fantasy novels ever penned.","review":"My favorite book from this amazing author and one of my favorite books of all time. Sophie, a meek, mousy eldest daughter (and therefore curse to never be much of anything) is cursed to be a 90-year-old woman by the Witch of the Waste. Finding herself feisty, she barges her way into the magical castle of the vain, drama-queen, heartless Wizard Howl. Sophie finds herself trying to break the contract between Howl and his fire demon, Calcifer, and also finds herself falling for Howl. Amazing, hilarious book, a unique and magical fairy tale with great character and one of the best love stories of all time. A rare book that is a fantastic blend of humor, drama, magic, and mystery. Also made into one of the best movies of all time, from a master storyteller in his own right, Hayao Miyazaki. Also, the book is followed by two wonderful sequels. Grade: A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book!","review":"Howl's Moving Castle was a wonderful book, but fans of the movie should know that the book is almost completely different. With that being said, it is still worth the read. It's a little tricky to follow sometimes, but overall, the plot was good. ~A. Brown"},{"rating":"2","title":"Howl's Moving Castle","review":"I really enjoyed the movie when I watched it and I was surprised that there was actually a book. I like the book very much, although, some may find it slow and a little convoluted in some places. The book certainly fleshes out the characters more than the movie and I enjoyed knowing them, however I think the movie and the book should probably be judged on their own merit."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I think we should live happily ever after.\\"","review":"I loved this book! It is full of humor, memorable characters, magic spells and fire demons. Not many authors can pull off a novel with the two main characters being a 90-year-old woman and a self-centered and vain wizard. Diana Wynne Jones pulls it off with panache, and leaves readers with a thoroughly contented feeling at the finish.For those who enjoy Caroline Stevermer, Patricia C. Wrede, Teresa Edgerton (sadly out of print) and J. K. Rowling, this book is right up your alley. Jones is certainly an author I shall be looking into regularly in the future. Luckily for us all, she has written several books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Howl's Moving Castle Purchase","review":"The book was amazing,the package arrived safely, and I managed to get hold of the book as quickly as possible.Diana Wynne Jones is a gifted writer for sure"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, Love, Love","review":"Our house is full of Studio Ghibli fans. We had seen the movie so many times without even realizing it was based on a book. When the book came in, there was a fight over who would get to read it first. It was as wonderful as we knew it would be. Sophie's motivations are so well explained, and there is a greater depth to her family life than we had known. A beautiful story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product, poor packaging.","review":"The book came in the mail perfectly fine and not a single bit of harm but I was dissapointed with the packaging. It came in some sort of box flap, partially opened and I kept thinking of all the ways I could have had a damaged product from it. The box seemed frivolous and I new of many other different ways it could have been shipped easier and with much less expense on my behalf. I encourage buying from a different source when it comes to packaging and shipping costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"kids books shouldn't be lame","review":"I enjoy reading fantasy fiction, including titles primarily intended for children, and I applaud the imagination of the author. A full-sized castle that roams the hillsides is a fascinating invention. The author's inclusion of some side trips into modern-day Wales, set in a Welsh-speaking household, were also interesting and commendable.Nevertheless, the poor character development, flimsy story lines, and impausible (if predictable) plot devices made Howl's Moving Castle a painful read at times. The book seems as though it was published before the final draft was ready, and it could use at least one more thorough edit. As a reader, I got the sense that the author felt that this was \\"only a kid's book\\" and that a feeble story with plenty of flash would be just fine.I would like to see Ms Jones match up her strong imagination with a more proven and compelling writer. Such a team could develop some truly wonderful storytelling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Goof for children to read","review":"My brother, who is nine years old, he loves this book. He is also inspired to watch the Japanese movie, Howl's Moving Castle, which is also a good movie. So~ good book, good story, and good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely! I have owned the movie for a few years now and after so many times watching the film it became my favorite of the Studio Ghibli films available. I had to read the book and have wanted to for quite a while. I consider the book and the movie two different animals but like them each(very much so) individually. I kind of like that they were different from one another. While reading, I still had the SG images in my head with DWJ's characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Like many others who read Howl's Moving Castle before me, I wanted to read this book because I loved Miyazaki's animation based on it - who wouldn't? It's extraordinary! And I was so, so happy when I realized I was loving the book just as I loved the movie, even if both versions can, at times, seem different stories. I think Sophie is a lovely, perfect heroine, and Howl is just to cute for words. I'm eagerly waiting for the next two books in this series to arrive in my mailbox, even if they don't have Howl and Sophie as protagonists, for I really enjoyed DWJ's writing and will surely read a lot more books from her. <3"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brain Candy","review":"This was a fun little book. It's easy to read, admittedly, it's a little predictable, but it is a \\"young reader.\\" If you enjoy fantasy even a little you will enjoy this bit of \\"brain candy.\\" Most of the characters were well developed. There were multiple plot lines that were nicely woven into each other. My only real critique is that the book ends rather abruptly. It's almost as if the author was pushing a deadline or simply got tired of writing. Otherwise a delightful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good film always has a great book behind it.","review":"Howl's Moving Castle has become a well known Japanese anime movie. But before it was a film it was a wonderful novel by Diana Wynne Jones. The main character, is Sophie, a girl turned into an old lady by a jealous witch. Sophie has to leave the Hat shop and her life behind to try to seek a cure to her curse. Her journey is in a land where almost anything is possible. Magical boots, fire demons, spoken spells, dirty castles and lots of eggs. Wow, Howl needs to go on a diet.329 pages of delight. Much more detailed than the film and different also. Just because you saw the movie does not mean you should skip the novel. And if you have finished the book get the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"See The Movie First","review":"I go to any Miyazaki movie and so went to see Howl's Moving Castle. The movie ended up quite confusing in places and when I discovered that he'd gotten the story here I bought the novel.Ms. Jones' writing is superb, her imagination impecable and her sense of wonder intact after all these years. While not The Hobbit or Redwall, it is a fine story with more depth perhaps than the other two.However, be sure to see the movie first else you'll be quite disappointed since it doesn't follow the book very closely and loses a lot for that reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful tale of magic by Diana Wynne Jones","review":"Sophie lives in a small village in the magical land of Ingary. Her village fears the heartless wizard, Howl, whose dark castle insists on circling the village--but it is a wicked witch who suddenly places an aging spell on Sophie, causing her to leave the village and, exhausted, take refuge in Howl's castle.Filled with finely drawn characters, this is a book accessible for all ages. Perhaps the best part is when the characters visit our world, and we see things through their perspective.Jones includes bits and pieces of standard fantasy, from fire demons to seven-league boots, but what results is, as always, entirely her own.Highly recommended. Jones is finally starting to get her due as an author, and this is a good place to start reading her works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking forward to reading this to my son when he is older","review":"My son loved the Miyazaki movie of Howl's Moving Castle.

I am very fortunate to have found this sparkling gem of wonder and adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining + re-readable = a very good book","review":"I first learned about the existence of the book after learning that the Miyazaki film was inspired by the story (go ahead and chide me, faithful readers of DWJ). Since borrowing the book from my library two weeks ago, I've read it four times through and have found it equally entertaining all four times. Re-readability is a common factor in my favorite books. Although this is a young adult novel Dianna does not dumb down the content nor the humor. I'm a 20 year old in college and I absolutely love this book. The characters are believable, the descriptions are vivid, and the pace moves rather quickly. I can't stand slow-moving books.Highly recommend this book to anyone. Really, anyone. I can easily see parents reading it with/to their children and laughing out loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I'm 22 and still love this book! One of my favorites!

My sister got this book 10 years or so ago, and I read her copy a half dozen times or so. She's since bought me my own copy from England, which I've also read repeatedly.

Don't ask why- just read it. I'm always rereading this book again and again cause it's too good! And I always notice something new. This book is set in a world of fantasy where the words \\"WElsh Rugby\\" seem mysterious. A curse is made up of John Donne's lovely poem, SONG (Go and catch a falling star), as the wizard Howl, despite living in an imaginary world, comes from ours. THere are wizards, witches, kings, spells, castles, fire demons, invisible cloaks, seven-league boots, and much, much more!

I loved the movie so much i watched it atleast 2 or 3 times in the same week and still watch it about once a week now. All my fascination with it led me to purchase the book a few weeks later. I'm not a big reader at all but Diana Wynne Jones knows how to keep it interesting. The book has so much more to the story then the movie portrayed. It had more twists and surprises that kept you wanting to continue reading. I finished the book in 3 days... which for me... is a huge success story. I enjoy the characters so much and relate so much to Sohpie's personality. I definantly would suggest anyone and everyone to read this tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing fantasy","review":"I bought this book after watching Hayao Miyazaki's animated version, and I absolutely adore it! Each character is distinct and likeable, and the plot offers a very different twist to a modern-day fantasy tale. After reading other (what I would call) flat fantasy series like 'Lemony Snicket' and 'Narnia' (both of which I don't find compare to the charm of 'Harry Potter'), 'Howl's Moving Castle' is a welcome relief that offers substance with its story - the magic itself lies in the wonderful characters. I only wish there was more!After reading 'Howl's Moving Castle' I am definately going to pick up any and all other books by this author. Here's hoping to Sophie & Howl popping up in future novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, Great book","review":"I watched the movie before reading the book.

It was one of those when you're reading it, you want to be in it. A lucky find at a booksale (50c, can't beat the price), it's the story of Sophie, the eldest of three daughters and thus, she assumes, born to screw up. Everyone knows the eldest is the one to make mistakes so the youngest can win the prince and prize. She is cursed by a witch to become an old woman (from 18 to 75 in the blink of an eye), and makes her way to the moving castle of the disreputable wizard Howl. Sophie is a wonderful character, I thought she was funny and intelligent and aware of her shortcomings, which was nice.

She is endlessly inventive in a very satisfying way. (A lot of her work reminds me of Terry Pratchett, another favorite.)But, this book is intricate, complex and at times exhaustingly complex. That's OK, but be warned that this book demands a high level of patience and application, which may or may not be consistent with your reader's skills and aptitudes. On the other hand, this is certainly a big step up from the usual middle grade read, so it is a great next step for a growing reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"EPIC review of EPICNESS by Cainan","review":"I think that Howl's Moving Castle was a very fluffy book.There is not much dark stuff in it.

In fact, they're almost two entirely different stories. The movie maintains the basic characterization and some of the plot points, but it changes other things fairly dramatically. I really enjoyed this story even though I kept hearing the actors' voices from the movie, which I don't think are necessarily fitting for the characters as they exist in the book.I found the characters well drawn and believable even though they remained basically static through most of the story. I also loved the idea of the moving castle and what that would enable those who lived in it to do.This was the first of Jones' novels that I've read and I am definitely open to reading others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oasis Sport Seat","review":"Worked well first time out, light easy to carry, cup holders worked great just hope they hold up over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough info in specifications","review":"Nowhere was it available the weight limit on this item.

Ancient Iraq is extremely erudite and written clearly and lucidly. Reading it and getting involved in the text is not difficult. Ancient Iraq covers the full spectrum of Iraqi ancient history and prehistory, from the Paleolithic through the Neolithic, the Sumerian civilization, and on to the Assyrian and Persian empires. Despite the wide scope of this book, Roux manages to keep the narrative tightly contained and compact, avoiding digressions and wandering. Highly readable, this book deserves to be owned by anyone with an interest in the region. It is poorly illustrated, but this is a relatively minor flaw. This is a true classic of archaeological literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting account of ancient Iraq","review":"I purchased this book because it contains information on The Flood taken from ancient accounts found in Iraq. They are similar in many respects to the account of Noah found in The Bible, but are different in some other respects, e.g., people and possessions that were placed aboard the ark. It is worthwhile reading for people studying comparitive religion (who do not have mindset on the issue). There is no doubt that a large flood occurred in the distant past (recent scientific evidence from the Black Sea indicates an event), but the information contained herein provides a different viewpoint.Besides the information indicated above, there is a wealth of information on ancient Iraq.

This first season got my girlfriend into UFC, which brought us closer together. haha"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"I returned this once because the 2nd DVD wouldn't play. Got the new one and it wouldn't play again. Neither would DVD number 4. Good season, too bad I couldn't see the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Just terrible and not worth the money. The fights are horrible and the fighters have very little skill. Puchase PRIDE instead where the best fighters in the WORLD come to fight.That Matt guy who wrote the first review has no clue what he's talking about. PRIDE is the biggest stage for MMA not UFC. That is a fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this set","review":"If you like the UFC and reality tv, you will like this. Fighters from all over the globe get selected to fight for a UFC contract. They move into the house and all hell breaks loose after that. This DVD includes great fights. If you are fimiliar with the cast of season one, strange brew and Chris Leben eventually get to fight. Other than that, I don't really wanna ruin to much. I highly recommend buying this."},{"rating":"2","title":"not \\"old school UFC\\" as someone said on here, but well done","review":"First of all, the UFC has been around for a long time. I know alot of people didnt jump on the \\"bandwagon\\" until they made a reality show, and thats fine, it was underground and many didnt know it even existed. This, however is not old school. Check out UFC 1 to see old school. No weight classes, just show up and fight. The names Gracie, Shamrock, Severn, Frey, Kimo....thats old school, not Lidell and Coutoure. Now, on to the dvd. Im not a big fan of reality tv, but UFC did a great job on the show. Its interesting to see how these guys worked toward their goal of being a pro fighter, the ups and downs of the fight game itself, and how a guy like Griffin can rise up and become a future star in the making. Unlike the people who \\"graduate\\" from American Idol, these guys actually stick around and become solid pros. I think this is a good buy for anyone who wants to see just how hard it is to become a pro fighter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy,Buy,Buy!","review":"My boyfriends addicted. He didn't have any of the Ultimate Fighters before I bought these, but he loved watching them on TV. He's a guy, they can watch fights over & over & over, it doesn't get old. I purchased season 1 thru 4 & will be getting the rest, very soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"i quite enjoyed this series and recommend it to anyone who might like cop-type tv shows....there are usually 3 distinct threads in each show...the main character and her familyfriend relationships, work relationships and the person who comes into the witness protection program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series.","review":"The story lines and cases just keep on getting better. Mary and Marshall are a great team. looking forward to watching the next season."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Knockout Series","review":"I decided to give \\"In Plain Sight\\" a preview on Netflix as it seamed interesting. After the first disk I decided it was good enough to at least give it a chance so I watched the nextdisk and I was hooked! This show is amazing, each episode has the snitch of the week that goes into Witness Protection and almost every weekly story is a hit. The real beauty of this show is the ongoing family darama between Mary and her family as well as the shenanigans between her co workers. As a member of AA for 13+ years I can tell you the family problems related to this are very real life and they show much of this with enough humor to make me appreciate the honesty. If you buy Season 1 you will be hooked, I have the first three seasons now and will soon buy 4 and 5 to completye my set. I just can't say enough about this show, IMHO it is remarkable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great series continues","review":"The continuing saga of a socially inept marshal holds my interest and is worthwhile entertainment. Interesting characters in captivating situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Entertainment","review":"I was a huge fan of West Wing, I miss all those characters. When I stumbled across this show I was ecstatic. I own every episode, and Thursday is my favorite night of the week, because I can see the new episode. I do not usually watch episode by episode for a TV show, I prefer to wait until the whole season is available, but this show is worth it. Mary is a believable person with a complicated family, and fierce loyalty to the job and her charges. She will lay down her life to protect perfect strangers. This episode is the absolute best one, as it shows her several years back, and how her and her current partner Marshall met, and she decided to become a Witness Protection Marshal instead of a track them down to justice Marshal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season three prompted me to buy season one and two","review":"I had the entire season on my DVR and almost deleted it. Once I watched the first episode I was hooked. The show is fantastic. Season 3 prompted me to go back and buy season 1 and 2. You can bet as soon as season 3 is available I will buy it and watch every episode before season 4 starts. Like every show there have been great episodes and some that were marginal but on a whole the show was well worth the time to watch and better than most of the crap on regular channels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Been watching in plain sight since season 1 and i love it.when will Mary & Marshall get together?i thought that they could of played her almost dying up a little!But i still love dit and would recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screw up a good thing","review":"I have now seen the first two dvd's of season three. It's not good. I gave the first two years five stars. It now gets two. Even the music is bad. The theme over the end credits has changed to a fluffy piece.I see the show has been canceled. No wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Various episodes skipped and/or froze while watching. Of the three disc set, two discs skipped, but the third disc completely froze during the last two episodes which, therefore, were unable to be viewed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, done that....","review":"Imagine my surprise when I picked up _The End to Privacy_ only to find that it offers nearly the identical thesis contained in my book _The Culture of Surveillance_ (St.Martin's Press) published more than two years ago. One would think that Professor Whitaker would have at least reviewed the literature before penning this obviously redundant book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best","review":"I think Reg Whitaker did an excellent job in descriving how our privacy can be infringed on a daily basis. The best part is the second chapter, where he explains that the digitalization and the creation of databases are the main 2 causes of \\"the end of privacy\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking... but too far for my style","review":"It's a very interesting way to consider taste and how to create a truely great taste experience in a dish, and I think one can learn a lot. The elements of flavor are defined up front, then the recipes have tasting notes to see how the flavors build and combine. However, the recipes are complicated multi-step processes involving specific and unusual ingredients, and while I'd like to eat them and compare the tasting notes, I really cannot imagine finding all the ingredients and spending all the time and care (obviously if you subsitute or take short cuts it's not going to be the same)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Elements of Taste Kindle Edition","review":"The thousands of typographical errors in the electronic version of this book render it virtually unintelligible. Do not waste your money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast moving, interesting plot","review":"I liked this book and had a hard time putting it down. The premise is very interesting and gripping, although sometimes the topic gets disturbing. The author did a great job of building the characters and really letting you get a feel for their personalities, resulting in a very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"If you are easily depressed or offended, maybe this book is not for you. But for those of us who insist that a book be lyrical, profound, and mesmerizing, it was a wonderful find. The vivid characterizations including the oddly sympathetic protagonist (and yes, he was quite funny sometimes) combined with the mystery and suspense of the plot made the book irresistable and hard to put down. I finished a library copy late last night and am going out to buy my own this afternoon. That is the highest compliment I can give it. I will also recommend it to friends and relatives. Next, I am going to try to find other books by this author. Bravo, Miss O'Dell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Enjoy But Couldn't Put it Down....","review":"I read O'Dell's \\"Coal Run\\" before I discovered she had a bestseller in \\"Back Roads\\". I loved \\"Coal Run\\"!! couldn't wait to read Back Roads, I mean it was a Bestseller! Of course, an Oprah selection too(which means nothing to me). This book is one not to love BUT it is ONE TO READ! I believe it was written to make the reader uneasy, uncomfortable, however AWARE, painfully AWARE of the other side of life, the dark side. I felt an uneasiness, an anxiousiness whenever I read it, and I was still unsettled when I finished it, that tells just how good it is...it took me out of my comfort zone. I gave it only 4 STARS because O'Dell provided so much more detail to her settings and characters in \\"Coal Run\\" I missed that touch in this one, however I do feel most will find it to be a 5 star!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross Misrepresentation","review":"This may be a great book for people who like disturbing, dark and depressing stories which chronicle how bad life can get and how awful people can behave toward one another. However, I bought the book because it was advertised as funny, heartwarming, etc. No such adjectives apply. If you read this book, prepare to be extremely disturbed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"I have not read a book in quite some time that was as riveting and captivating as \\"Back Roads.\\" Tawni O'Dell did an EXTRAORDINARY job!!! I could not put this book down; the twists and turns NEVER end up or even begin where you once thought! loved it, loved it, loved it!!! Tawni my dear--keep'em coming!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a book!","review":"This is quite a book. I'm in a book club, otherwise I wouldn't have chosen to read it, but I'm glad I did. Once you're into it you can't put it down. Because I worked for the Dept.of Welfare for 34 years, the story didn't shock me, but it made me uneasy as it should anyone who reads it. I thought I had the ending figured out, but I didn't see this one coming! A great read for people with an open mind to the real world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Dysfunction at Its Best","review":"O'Dell's story captures all the facets of an extremely dysfunctional family with raw, shocking realism - outright physical and verbal abuse, insinuated sexual abuse, incest and murder. As the novel unfolds, it becomes obvious that the male narrator is mentally disturbed but it's nearly impossible not to sympathize with his situation. O'Dell also does an excellent job of portraying his sexual frustrations, not to mention the overall confusion and desperation of a young man who has had too much responsibility thrust upon him. I highly recommend this novel. It is compulsively readable and well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic depiction of Western PA...","review":"I bought this book for two main reasons: first, Oprah recommended it and I have thoroughly enjoyed the other books on her list; second, I am from the same area of Western Pennsylvania as the main character Harley and the author are from. In fact, I live only a few miles from the town of Black Lick, PA and the kids from Black Lick went to the same high school as me.I thought this was a disgusting book. I was very upset with the way it portrayed Western PA. I do not know anyone whose life has been at all like Harley's. I think Ms. O'Dell is giving a bad impression of this area through all the talk of murder, incest, adultery, etc. She is obviously enjoying her new life in Illinois! If she feels that Western PA is such a \\"beautiful\\" place (as noted on the back cover) then next time I hope she writes a \\"beautiful\\" story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Left Unread!","review":"Sure, this book has some sensational story lines but not even incest can keep this book interesting! The characters are not well devloped and you don't really care for or about any of them. If you must see for yourself, at least wait until it's out in paperback!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't write a sequel to this one.","review":"I have read several books from Oprah's Book Club and loved every one. But this one, what happened to Oprah's tastes? I initially bought the book because it took place in SW Pennsylvania, which is where I spend the first 26 years of my life. Plus, the fact it was listed on Oprah's Book Club, was added bonus. I was extremely disappointed in the plot because I was waiting for the characters to achieve some depth. I guessed the ending even before all the characters were introduced. The editing left something to be desired given the numerous spelling and grammatical errors towards the end of the book. Frequently, that caused me to read sentences over and over to figure out what the author was trying to get across to the reader. I'm embarrassed to admit I wasted my time and read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"I cannot believe how many individules have given BACKROADS such a high rating. Two weeks after finishing this book I still cannot shake the bad taste it left. I'm disapointed in myself for even continuing to read it, even though I was disgusted not even half way through. It is full of child abuse (mental and physical), vulgar language (how many times can one person say the \\"F\\" word in one sentance?) and least of all where is the plot? I felt as though I was reading in cicles, not ever getting anywhere..just ending up right back where I started. I will not recommend this book to anyone and most certainly will not permit any child's or teenage hands to turn the pages. This was my third \\"Oprah\\" book and the first I was disapointed with. What was Oprah thinking recomending a book with such a disturbing scale?"},{"rating":"1","title":"no thanks","review":"I read the book because a friend said she heard it was very good. I did not like it and found satisfaction only when I threw it in the fireplace and watched it burn."},{"rating":"2","title":"disturbing...but good","review":"This novel was a wee bit disturbing, but it was great...I went through it in 2 days!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"Don't waste your time ready this book. Harley is just as whiny as his sisters. The author used this book to make an excuse to throw in some sibling incest, masturbation and gender violence into the pages. Harley hates his sisters so much that he constantly imagines killing them. At the end, he \\"redeems\\" himself by taking the blame for one of their actions. Oh please. The characters are unbelieveable and very unlikeable. Then, the author puts in a discussion page at the end of her book asking why Harley did this or why his sisters did that. As if this book were to replace classics such as \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" in the classroom. Get over yourself, Tawni O'Dell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very moving and touching book","review":"This book truly touched me. Not only were the characters very thoughtfully developed, but the entire story was very real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different perceptions","review":"Funny? An enjoyable read? Not hardly. Engrossing? Disturbing? I think these adjectives are more appropriate. This story of 19 year old Harley who is suddenly the head of a family caught in the middle of murder, incest, poverty and dysfunction (to put it midly) is dark and riveting. As other customer reviewers have indicated, Back Roads is a difficult book to put down. O'Dell does an excellent job of writing in a male first person voice - something that I think takes a particular talent for writers depicting characters of the opposite sex. However, the continuous trauma suffered by the children in this family only results in more pain. Just when you think there is a flicker of normalcy for them, the candle once again blows out. As the end of the novel drew near, I was looking forward to some redemption, some promise, some hope - and found none. O'Dell has an eviable way with words in her descriptions and dialogue. I look forward to giving her next effort another try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like a car wreck - you can't look away","review":"Oprah has outdone herself this time. This book had it all: 2 murders, sibling molestation, adultry, two family members in jail, one in a mental facility, dog to a \\"foster\\" home, one child forced to live with an uncle because the rest of the family self destructed! Oprah didn't miss anything this time. I gave the book five stars because it was well written and kept me turning pages. It was really an \\"easy\\" read. Sort of like looking at a car wreck- you know you'll see devistation at every angle, but you have to look - to know. Perhaps, it's time to let Oprah's staff pick a book and give the rest of us a break from depression and opression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disturbing book","review":"There was a comment by Margot Livesey on the back of this book that said '. . . This is a fast, furious, funny novel.' There were a few parts of this book that were on the VERY dark side of humor, but the subject matter was so far from humorous that it left me feeling ill.Was it well written? I guess. Did it keep my interest? Like a train wreck might keep my interest. I would never recommend this book to anyone and wish I had never read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Page Turner.......","review":"I couldn't put it down. The disfunction of this familygrabs you. Even \\"JohnBoy\\" would find it..disturbing but yet intriqing. It took me there. I was humored and heartbroken andstressed out all in a few hours. This book is not gender bias. Both Women and Men will be humored and moved the same.I promise!!Whats that... Frank is that a tear in your eye? Its ok, really."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long and Winding Road","review":"\\"Back Roads\\" keeps the reader guessing at every next chapter. It winds it's way through the thoughts and actions of Harley Altmyer, a young man who has made the decision to take care of his three younger sisters in lieu of putting them in foster care. His father is dead and his mother is in jail for the crime. You won't believe the twisted thoughts of this \\"nice\\" young man...or his actions at times...they will surprise you...and so will the outcome of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tale of a Dysfunctional Family","review":"A selection of Oprah's book club involves a family of four mixed up kids and their parents living in Western Penna. among the woods, hills, small towns, abonded coal mines, tipples and railroad tracks. Harley is the only boy and at age 18-20 is trying to work 2 jobs and keep the family together. Mama is in jail for killing her husbnd but she is innocent...who's she protecting? Jealousy and incest are involved in a complicated story of real love. I grew up in that area but never saw any thing like this...not your average family yet the story had a certain appeal as each family member jockied for a place of their own for comfort and security in an unusual family structure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Harley the New Holden?","review":"Back Roads is an amazing coming-of-age novel. I've described it to others as Catcher in the Rye on acid. It examines family ties, mental illness, abuse, sexuality. . .and puts these issues in the perspective of a 20 year old male, caught somewhere between awkward boyishness and responsible manhood. This has become one of the few books that I will not lend out! (But I have bought three additional copies as gifts)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back Roads Revies","review":"Strange but compelling, I thought the main character was twisted at the beginning but by the end of the bok you realize he was probably the sainest of his whole family. He was stuck in a situation he didn't know how to get out of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back Roads","review":"This was one of the worst books I've ever read. I kept waiting for something to happen. I wadded through the problems and woes. It was depressing to say the least. I never saw anything \\"funny\\" in this book. It was so sad and depressing and the conclusion just hung in mid air. I was so disappointed. I picked it up four times before I finally finished it. I would not recommend this book to anyone. When I read a good book I don't want it to end. I wanted this book to end many times while I was reading it. d"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good!","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. i can't even believe it made it on Oprah's list, i am still trying to figure that out. i had just finished \\"The Corrections\\" and that was such a witty, intelligent book and to pick up \\"Back Roads\\" after it was a big let down. There are so many unbelieveable things in this book, it seems the author just tried to throw every type of abuse and dysfunction in this book she could think up. Also, you can tell it is a woman trying to write from a man's point of view and it doesn't work. I think people may like this book due to all the shocking happenings in it, but that doesn't make a good book to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful & Dark","review":"This book started out pretty fast, and I enjoyed the author's storytelling technique. However the unrelenting bleakness of the story just wore me down. One of the reviews on the cover said : \\"A page turner, gritty...funny,... sexy,. It was a definite page turner, but it was like watching a train wreck and not being able to turn away. It was gritty enough for me to feel like I needed to bathe after reading it. I do not find anything funny or sexy about murder, sexual and physical abuse, not to mention incest and insanity. If you enjoy reading books that are bleak, sad, sorrowful and with no happy ending in sight, this is the book for you. Although I don't believe every book should have a happy ending, I read mostly for entertainment, and this book was not at all enjoyable for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast read BUT watch out for ...........","review":"I found this book hard to put down, BUT it truly disturbed me. I read it w/in 3 days. Maybe I just needed to get through it and I was searching for a light at the end of the tunnel. But Oprah has done it again. She has found something disturbing to that will shake the human core. The synopsis is misleading. Go to your local bookstore, read the first chapter, and get a cup of coffee or tea before you buy the book. I gave it a 2 because the author has potential but the context was WAY to disturbing and we don't need that.*** Warning *** She's a great writer but the context is disturbing. Don't we get enough of this on the 5 o'clock news?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Strains credibility...","review":"As other reviewers have mentioned this story starts out strongly but falters as it progresses. The author is able to convincingly develop the character of Harley and he has a distinctive voice.I enjoyed the initial parts of the book, but the subsequent developments were completely unbelievable. I'm unwilling to accept the reality of a story that has two members of one family separately committing murders. The plot does not tie together and is ultimately very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"just didn't like the story","review":"I thought that the writing was good, but the story was awful. It was just an absolutely depressing story about someone whose had EVERYTHING go wrong it his life. The way it ended was annoying and extremely depressing. It was not \\"funny\\" at all as the back cover boasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrenching","review":"This book, while vivid and well-written, was just too brutal for my taste. I am usually a fan of dark fiction, but this was simply too devastating. Tawni O'Dell is talented, all right, because she took me straight to the characters' guts, and I didn't want to stay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.. the ending was a let down","review":"This book was spectacular! This is the kind of stuff that happens to people in everyday life. With a little less of the drama. It really puts the reader in Harley's shoes. The ending is not what you would hope.. but thats what makes it great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my God!","review":"I'm not sure if I liked this book, but it impacted me and caused me to think about it after I was done reading it. Sometimes we come across things like that. Its dark and violent and many people will not like this book for that reason. It is moving and leaves an impression, but not a positive one. Any book that makes me think about it and discuss it with others I believe is good because it does just that. I don't think this book was written for enjoyment but, to provoke thought and think about situations that might be strange in our lives, but also very real for others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whew!","review":"From what I've gathered, people either really love this book or really hate this book. It is very smartly written and I think can almost compare to \\"Catcher in the Rye,\\" in that Harley's quest is as surreal and heartbreaking and truthful as that of Holden Caulfield. This book is shocking. It is written VERY truthfully and does not gloss over real-world issues. I wouldn't recommend this book for the squeamish, or those readers who read to forget the world and feel good at the end. But if you like eye-opening literature with no holds barred, this is a book for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A reader","review":"If you feel that you must read it because it appears on Oprah's list then at least do yourself the favor of purchasing the paperback. This is not a book to keep. I'll give it 2 stars because it passed the time and kept me reading but it's not a book that I would bother recommending to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Back Roads\\" Book Jacket Misleading","review":"This book intrigued me when I first bought it because of the subject matter: a young man trying to deal with raising his three younger sisters in the absence of their parents. But as I read further, I found the content of the book to degenerate and become highly disturbing, especially the incest theme that threads through the novel. When the father is posthumously found not guilty of incest with his daughter, the reader discovers (and has seen all along) that Harley and Amber have an incestuous attraction or need, and this turned my stomach. I was particularly repulsed to discover Harley and Amber having sex after Harley discovers Callie's dead body--and to top it off, he knows his sister is the culprit. Is this at all realistic? I am interested to know whether sibling incest is a characteristic of parental abuse--I highly doubt it. I found the story outrageous and overly dysfunctional. This book sickens rather than intrigues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was not impressed with Tawni Odells syle of writing, I did not like how she introducted the characters. You read the first few pages without even knowing WHO it was you were reading about. She did that as well with the sisters. Not one of my favorite Oprah books. The second 1/2 of the book was better than the first 1/2.....they story kept you going in the end, but getting there was not done as well as I would have liked. Hope Tawni does better with her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Party of Five gone bad","review":"Ms. O'Dell has taken the TV show and transported and transformed it from upscale San Fran to poverty stricken Pennsylvania. (Although it could be any \\"hick town nearest you\\") I guess I owe the book one star as I read it to the bitter end. What a disturbing novel! It is written pornograhy at it's peak. I don't exactly feel enlightened by the twisted incest, adultry, child murderers and detailed descriptions of a 20 yr. old male phyco's mastrubation. Sure, this s**t happens, but the 6 o'clock news is bad enough. We don't need to delve into the sexual horrors of a \\"Party of Five\\" gone bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back Roads","review":"I am surprised at the number of very positive reviews. The subject matter was believable, but I thought the characters were only stereotypes and had little depth. I also found the style \\"cutesy\\" in parts, and I thought that the writing needed much better editing.I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hated this Book","review":"This was one of those books that halfway through you think\\"Should I finish this?\\" --and I am sorry that I did. The book cover was completely misleading in the describing the story \\"In the end, he could never know that his endearing humor, his love for his sisters and his bumbling heroics would redeem them all\\". WHAT BOOK IS THAT--I want to read it. The characters were interesting at first, but the author took them down a very dark road to the point that you are not interested in any of them (though I did enjoy Callie until her ugly end).I think I am through with Oprah books--I've read a few and they are mostly dark and depressing. (Poisonwood Bible is the exception). My copy of Backroads is going in the trash--it is not one that I want to share with anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Last three chapters missing.","review":"I ordered this book as a gift to my sister. I called her and asked how she liked it and unfortunately the last three chapters were missing! She told me not to worry about it but I paid for the whole book and either send her another one or refund my money. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"I read this book before it made Oprah's List. I am a writer and I thought the characters in 'Back Roads' were so good it reminded me of 'Songs in Ordinary Time' by Mary McGarry Morris. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in fiction with believable characters in real-life situations."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Painted House - John Grisham","review":"This was not the usual exciting work of Grisham. It lacked that grasping, take hold, affect his books always have had. Book as a whole was very slow going and and had a lack luster ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oprah did it again","review":"I read this book in 3 days! The title character, Harley takes you through his life in the backwoods of Pennsylvania. It's a little explicit but justifiable for the story. You want to take Harley and his siblings home with you and shield them from the world. You won't be disapointed in this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"As I read this book, I kept asking myself \\"Why did Oprah recommend this?\\" Why is there such a need to write such explicit sex scenes and filth to get your point across. I felt very uncomfortable reading this book. If this was Tawni O'Dell's intent, then she succeded.I did not find it 'funny' at all.I would not allow my teenage children to read this book or recommend it to anyone I know. Will Mrs O'Dell let her children read it and will they feel the same about her afterwards? The insightfulness of Harley was the only positive thing about this book and Jody was a sweet child. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah Trash","review":"The author writes well and can create strong images and convey powerful emotions. But, the good news ends here. It is no accident that Oprah selected this book. It contains the familiar message of the abuse culture: everything evil we do is really the responsibility of someone else who has treated us badly. Murder is OK, if someone (not necessarily even the murder victim) beat you. This is just dressed up talk show trash. It gives you a jolt when you read it - but it's cheaper to go stick your hand in a light socket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I really expected to like this book as it started off with vivid descriptions of locales and characters. But it slowly and inexorably descended into a mixture of foul dialogue, foul situations, and some not-to-be-believed character interactions. The climax and ending are totally depressing and left me with a bad taste in my mouth. This book is headed for the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdone and gross","review":"I recently read this book, and I was dissapointed. I saw that is was part of Oprah's book club, so i took a chance and decided to read it. What i got was a book overflowing with over-the-top dirty and disturbing content. Normally, I find one or two disturbing twists exciting, but there are so many in this book that after you finish it you feel nauseous. The character was not likeable, the ending was terrible, and the book is innapropiete for people under 18. I would only recommend it as a book to scare you... and not the good healthy kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"O'Dell is the master of the literary metaphor","review":"This book was like an addictive drug for me. The torture Harley had to endure just trudging through his everyday life hooked me and made me want to root for him even as he entertained his violent fantasies in his daydreams. As an author, I wish I had the talent for creating mood through landscape and metaphor that O'Dell does. I would recommend this and all her books to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coming of age soap opera","review":"This seems to be a popular title for both movies and novels. This one is about to become a major motion picture though I have doubts that even the author will recognize it when Hollywood is finished with it. In my library for a decade before I got around to reading it I will admit to its being sensational enough to carry one along intently to its crushing conclusion. This is not a feel-good kind of story. One is moved to feel empathy for Harley's plight realizing the while that he is hopelessly in over his head and that the outcome is not likely to be a good one. Along the way we are thrown several plot twists and unexpected turns of events that keep it interesting. What this book brings home to us most vividly is the woeful state of our social work system with its overworked and under-paid employees and the fact that justice is what can be proved in a court of law, not necessarily truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not funny at all","review":"In a word...Heartstopping. The anguish and pain Harley Altmeyer succumbs to is by no means humorous as the hard cover jacket would have you believe. Immediately, I interpreted his vivid descriptions as his slow decent into mental illness. My heart ached for the poor boy. Responsiblity and adulthood are prematurely forced upon him as a result of a murder of passion. The consequences and TRUTHS revealed in the wake of the murder are disturbing enough to send any adult to an asylum! Non-stop reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"What one would do for love.","review":"As I continued to read, each page brought a different reaction as to how I felt about each of the characters. Especially toward the end.I started out accepting what the outsiders had to say, then I realized that there were many family secrets which changed how I felt about the father, and the mother.The middle children were driven by jealousy of the rest of the family, and parental love was not enough to save what was needed to keep the family unit together."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN ABSOLUTE TRAGEDY","review":"Always fearful that the next Oprah pick might be the best one, I try to read them as soon as they're announced. Back Roads is once again Oprah's typical survival against all odds type of book but I'm not sure I could call any of these characters survivors. They are all tragic in their own right -- even the poor dog Elvis. O'Dell is certainly a gifted writer challenging the reader to dare to stop reading her book and consequently taking the chance of never knowing how it ended. While it was dysfunctional at best it was also riveting. I would have given it 5 stars if I would have liked the subject matter a little more. I found so much of it disturbing but I kept on reading and have to admit, I'm glad I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark","review":"This book was well written and the characters fully developed, however, I found the story to be a bit over the top for my taste. I did not see one thing funny or sexy (as portrayed in some reviews) about incest, adultury, or murder.The story is dark and disturbing, without redemption. The character's extreme dysfunction was not quite believable (even in our present day society where this behavior seems to be rampant, their behavior was bizarre).Although incest, murder and adultury occur everyday, the sequence of events in this book impacted me as though I had witnessed a bad accident. The senseless wreck of lives has, unfortunately, lingered in my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy reading, hard thinking","review":"Tawni O'Dell has written a masterpiece that will have you struggling with everything you think you believe. This book is a roller coaster of emotions. It challenged me to look at my beliefs and to shuffle everything to a new perspective. The subject matter is not easy, but the writing glides through it so easily that you feel sucker-punched when yet another of your nice tidy explanations for human behavior hits the trash.I can't imagine anyone who would not be changed by reading this book. As a Mom, as the mother of daughters and a son, as a woman and as a member of a community, this story made me rethink it all. If you think you have it ... wait five minutes.Counting the days until book two from this author ... unbelieveable talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turner","review":"This book was great. I read it quickly and I thought about it for days afterwards. I think O'Dell got the thought process of the character down and the plot was very intriguing. I had only one complaint, it was hard to believe Harley was a male. He included WAY to many details about \\"girl stuff\\" , granted, he grew up with 3 sisters, but there were many times I thought that there was no way a guy would take note of these things. I think it can be forgiven because the rest of the book is so good,not to mention the fact that most of the readers of this book are probably female due to the Oprah endorsement. maybe I was just spoiled by the believablity of Wally Lamb's \\"she's come undone\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could not put this book down","review":"I couldn't put this book down until I finished it. This book grabs your attention in the first chapter and never lets go. Harley and his sisters are victims of child abuse and neglect. Harley is thrust with the responsibility with raising his younger sisters after his mother goes to prison for killing his father. Harley eventually learns the truth about his father's death from his mother and that is the biggest surprise of all. Harley's sister's Misty and Amber both crave love and attention from him. They seem innocent but they are nothing but that. The pressure of keeping his family together is overwhelming for Harley and he finds solace in his lover Calliie and his shrink Betty. Back Roads is a very suspenseful novel with many twists and turns"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I rushed out to get this book for my holiday. I managed to finish it, but it did not relax or enlighten me. I was surprised that Oprah selected this book. The story line was just too much, although I did enjoy Jody, the youngest sibling very much. I looked for her in every page. I felt for this family but it was too disturbing to be an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak...","review":"This story was boring and useless. It was very unbelievable and repetitive. I kept hoping the story would develop, but it never got off the ground. I found myself tired of hearing about the main character, chapter after chapter. Rent - don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"An introduction to suicidal thoughts.","review":"Read this book if you are in serious need of feelings of depression and suicide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragedy and Trash from Oprah's Book Club","review":"I bought this book primarily because it was an Oprah Book Club selection. The comments on the dust cover indicated it was a humorous story of a teen age boy rearing his younger sisters. If a mom in prison for killing the dad, incestuous goings on, adultery and the boy being nabbed the for murder of his lover is humorous, I guess I have become something of a prude. For the same amount of money, I could have had the latest book from John LesCroart, John Grisham, Steve Martini or David Balducci. We live and learn, don't we?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disfunction-Junction!","review":"Was looking for an escape from reality ----- murder, incest, adultery --- just read the newspaper! I really didn't like it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"puts \\"dysfunctional family\\" into a new stratosphere!","review":"I don't get all the raves. This book kept me interested, but the last 100 pages were just over the top and wierd. And some of the resolution just didn't make sense to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story Great Characters","review":"From the first page you are hooked. Great story, No extra characters, they are all necessary and well developed. Read this book it is outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put this book on the back shelf","review":"After reading the first ten pges of this book,I thought I'm not going to like this and that turned out to be the truth,This book actually made me sick. These kinds of things happen in families but who wants to read about it . This entire family had issues including the aunt and uncle.The mother's problems started when she was a child and had lost her own parents.harley and his sisters never had a chance with an abusive father and a mother who would allow the abuse.I dont know why the neighbor had the hots for harley especially when he was all nasty and dirty.there was nothing funny in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to order","review":"I can't believe how difficult it is to order now, there is no place to put something in a cart, it is all about this kindle stuff. I want to place an order and cannot fiqure it out. There is nothing in the Help dept. and no where to put these two books in to my cart."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIFIC","review":"Reader beware: The main themes of the story are incest, abuse and murder; the ending offers nothing in the way of redemption. The main character is a hateful young man with fantasies of sex and violence towards his younger siblings. The setting is a dismal village in rural Pennsylvania where each resident almost competes to be more hopeless than his neighbor.I am no prude and I have no problem peppering my library with a little dysfunction every now and then, but I actually finished this book feeling like a worse person. As far as I'm concerned, the only thing this author got right was picking out the cover image; a back road that leads to hell.Rating: One \\"trillionth\\" of a point.Suggested With: A pair of running shoes, a jet pack, a concord plane, anything that will get you the hell away from this book as fast as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just started reading......","review":"I don't have any comments quite yet. Just started reading this book yesterday. It is kind of hard to get into. Depressing with Harley taking care of his 3 sisters while their Mother is in prison for killing their father. Will have to come back and give a thourough review when I am finished with BACK ROADS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new, nothing gained.","review":"Having grown up in the region that O'Dell is writing about, I was eager to read this book. But BACK ROADS could be set anywhere that people are poor and more rural than urban. The setting was almost incidental, and I was disappointed. The characters too, tended to disappoint. The writing, while technically fine, tended to disappoint. There was nothing new explored here, not in terms of the family, the region or the male or female psyche. I could predict everything, which is for me, the ultimate disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Backroads","review":"This book takes an intense journey into the mind of a psycho. I found the scenes in this book disturbing and pervertic. The book grossed me out considerably and should not be available to anyone under the age of 30."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"Today's pop culture has lead many writers to introduce story themes that are both fluffy and predictable. Don't count on that with this novel. The characters and their continual struggles with lives that are far from normal, leave you breathless and heart-broken. There is a neck-breaking turn with each new chapter that forces you to reevaluate the opinions and conclusions that you had previously held. Yes, there are some disturbing inuendos and suggestions in this book, however, that is exactly what makes it so intense and volatile. This book will make you believe that are good authors still around and at the same time you will make a new best friend in one of the most vivid and endearing characters I have ever encountered in a novel, Harley Altmyer. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unpredictable....","review":"I had to complete this novel in one day. Harley stayed with me, I wanted to understand him, his outward self so conflicted with his thoughts. I am usually pretty good at predicting the end of a book but I did not predict this one. The scenerios I came up with in my head were no where close to where Ms. O'Dell took the story. The book was a little disturbing and I felt that Callie's motivations could have been explored more, but otherwise, this book was a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book--Keeps you coming back for more!","review":"I read this book in a matter of days. (For me, that's pretty good! :0) I was horrified at some of the events that happened in the book to this poor family, and it greatly sadened me. Harley, the main character, given what he had to deal with, did a good job. You couldn't help but love him.At times it felt that I was right there in the middle of it all. This was a book that was certainly hard to put down. The author, Tawni O'Dell did a fantastic job in writing this book! Everytime I had this story figured out, it turned on me again and I was thrown more into the story.The ending shocked me and was completely unexpected to me. At the end, this book left me wanting the story to continue going on. This is a great summer read for anyone wanting something that will keep them thinking. This is a book you'll remember!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book","review":"I believe this book was the most depressing one I've ever read. I saw no light at the end of the tunnel and couldn't figure out why someone would write a story with absolutely no redeemable characters. Everyone in this mess is completely screwed up from either domestic abuse, incest, lies, irresponsibility, poverty, desperation, mental illness, you name it. I only finished it to see where it ended and hoped like hell SOMEONE was going to get a happy ending but alas, no. Read this book only if you like reading about non-stop misery and unhappiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did Oprah love this book?","review":"I am still trying to figure out why this book would beconsidered enjoyable. I found it very disturbing and uncomfortable.At times I wanted to stop reading because I felt like it was a trashytalkshow in words. I read email about how people loved Harley (found him endearing) I found him repulsive. The character did not even bathe. I feel that the author is a very good writer and very descriptive but the story was over the top when it came to dysfunction. I know people are saying it is true to life, but how much murder, incest and sickness can be in one family. I feel the story could have been more uplifting in some way..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book of the Year!!!","review":"Tawni O'Dell begins her book with one of the all-time best first lines and continues with that momentum to the very end. Powerful images, characters and situations. Bravo Ms. O'Dell! Thanks for the great read!Karen Albright Lin"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Shocking!","review":"This book is constantly making you second guess your own opinions. It is always changing and something vital is always surfacing and changing your views about everything! I think it is a wonderful book and I would definately recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read \\"Here on Earth\\" Instead","review":"This was a big disappointment. It was too disturbing, too dark, too depressing. I am sure that there are a lot of poeple out there who could relate to the characters, but I sure couldn't. Read \\"Here on Earth\\" instead. That was 100 times better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter disappointment","review":"This could have been a great book if the characters were better developed. I felt almost cheated the further I read on ... realizing that the mystery and vagueness of Harley and his sisters' personalities were leading nowhere. The book left me feeling empty and disappointed.I find it interesting that that there is even a Reading Group Guide with 'Topics for Discussion'. Does she really believe this to be great writing? Don't flatter yourself Tawni, you're only an amateur."},{"rating":"2","title":"mesmerizing","review":"I could not put down this book! I was mesmerized by it! Full of secrets and surprises, it was a real page-turner. Some of first thoughts of reading this were, \\"my God, these poor kids raising themselves\\" but then it went deeper. Mental illness, incest, infidelity, its all in this book. I couldn't help but feel sorry for Harley, becoming a man, a father, and dealing with a horrible tradegy all at once. It's no wonder he was crazy! I think of the time that had passed until all of these secrets came to light. Its scary to think how long a person can keep secrets, tradegies, buried until they really start effecting your life. It makes me realize how important CLOSURE is in my own life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"Deep and sad with a thought provoking and powerful ending. Definitely not a light read, and a page turner to the end. Makes you reconsider the chances we think we might want to take or the things we might want to do. The characters are extremely well created, and the descriptions take you right there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good read","review":"I won't go into the summary of the book, as other reviews have already accomplished, but I will go into how I felt while reading this book. I felt compelled by the book's honesty, grit, humor, and integrity. The dysfunction of the character and his perception of those around him are shocking at times, but reasonable in thought at other times. The book certainly is entertaining, well written, and makes the reader aware that love can exist where dysfuntion lies, and that love can be perceived in more ways than one. The perception of the main character is compelling, interesting, dramatic, violent at times, perverse, and compassionate, but he stays true to his feelings which are totally and completely real. I believe you will not only enjoy this book, but will remember it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should be titled \\"In the Gutter\\"","review":"I did like the writer's style and found the character of 19 year old Harley to be likeable. However, this book really goes to the pit of society and paints a graphic picture of incest. If incestuous loves scenes do not bother you, or perhaps thrill you, then this is a very good book for you. If on the other hand, you find this kind of thing disturbing, then I would not suggest this book. Also, this is a dark book with a depressing tone throughout and a depressing ending. I wasn't quite sure what type a point the writer was trying to make, if any."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good one...sorry....","review":"I read alot...I am usually 3 books behind for Oprah's book club. If Oprah recommends it, I want to read it...Well this one I completely hated. It was a page turner. It kept my interest, because I kept waiting and hoping for something good to finally happen for Harley. But...wow...If you think your life is bad, read this, and you will feel better. Thanking God that this is not real, or your life. The ending made me so angry. This is one book, after I finished, I wanted to speak to the author, and ask her \\"what happens next to Harley\\"? Please say, he was able to get his smallest sister and move far, far away. Very depressing. Completely sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment!","review":"When Oprah announced this selection on her show and offered a brief description, I was intrigued by the theme - a teenage boy caring for his sisters after a family tragedy. I really wanted to like this book. How disappointed I was! Although compelling for about the first half, it seemed like the author just didn't know where else to take it. The incest theme seemed to be thrown in as almost an afterthought,and yet was supposed to be central to the actions of those involved. Very disappointing! Not at all like many of Oprah's other selections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh the melodrama! Poor, poor dysfunctional us!","review":"Oprah pick or not, this book was a waste of money. The author seems to have some talent, but there was only one sympathetic character in the whole book (the woman with whom Harley is sleeping), and even her behavior was odd at times. This is a family with some serious problems, and it seems as if they just whine and mope and feel sorry for themselves. Harley comes across as some kind of half-wit without sense enough to realize that his sisters need the care and guidance of someone much more mature and stable than he is. I was very disappointed by the ending, because with all the melodrama and carrying-on, I was hoping for a better resolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"This book is dark, depressing and morally wrong! There is nothing about it, that was suspenceful or entertaining. Nothing enjoyable about this book,nothing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Haunting yet trashy","review":"It has now been two weeks since I finished \\"Back Roads\\" and although some of the images have stayed with me and haunt me, I must say that I find the language and the content of the book to be disappointing, almost to the point of disgusting. I feel that the disfunctional family theme both in movies and in novels has just about run its course. It is a sad commentary on American society that such families do exist, to be sure, and we should be aware of their existence, but I fail to see the ultimate point of the book. I shall remember it to be sure, but I dare say that I do not have any desire to read Ms. O'Dell again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that grabs you and leaves you begging for more!","review":"I found this book to be so captivating I was reading it (or trying to) in the dark as we drove across South Dakota. I will have to say that it was slow in the first chapter but once it grabbed me it just wouldn't let go. Her characters were so \\"real\\" you just couldn't help but feel for them and want more than what life had dealt them. Harley tries so hard to make life better for himself and his sisters. The twists and turns are sharp, and they make you gasp out loud. I highly recommend this book!! Tawni O'Dell is a writer to be watched and read! I look forward to reading more from her in the future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It started out great and then unravelled......","review":"This book was so GOOD at the beginning!

(There IS a Donnington Castle, but that is actually the ruins OF a castle, in a different county.) After the first 'MOR' Polydor released a compilation album, on vinyl and cassette, featuring at least one track from all bands on the bill (save for Judas Priest, who declined to be featured, it seems). Those tracks were recorded live on the day and the sound was raw but very good. Saxon's track was 'Backs To The Wall' and I had hoped this release was from the same source as had been used for that Polydor release. It patently isn't. Treat it as anything other than a cheap bootleg, providing a useful chronicle of the band's performance at the start of a legendary series of festivals, and you'll be disappointed. Now, Polydor, DO you still have those mastertapes?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best place to start with Saxon","review":"Good points- It captures Saxon at aruably their very freshest point, after the Wheels Of Steel album.Bad points- the sound quality is so bad that frankly I'm a bit surpsised that it was releasewd in this state. To anyone not familiar to Saxon the songs might just seem like a muffled nosie coming from the stage a lot of the time. I have a high end hi fi and even with headphones it's sometimes difficlut to make out exactly what's going on, especially on the closer Machine Gun. I's such and intnese song on the album, and it must have been incredible onstage at Donnington, but it sounds like someone brought a cheap tape recorder to the show and recorded the set with the tape recorder stuffed under 5 pillows.I give the bands performance 5 stars, but sorry, this CD itself has such a poor bootleg quality that I can't really recommend it and I give it 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lo","review":"This face cream is amazing!

Clunker list, IMO: \\"Teenage FBI,\\" Furslide,\\" and \\"Pain.\\" Tracks that make the purchase VERY worthy: \\"Buffy Theme,\\" \\"Close Your Eyes\\"(any Buffy fan knows this classic instrumental tune), \\"Temptation Waits\\"(yeah, Garbage!), \\"Transylvanian Concubine,\\" \\"It Doesn't Matter,\\" \\"Wild Horses,\\" and \\"Strong.\\" Only one more gripe: I want a completely instrumental soundtrack by Chris Beck! The only track on the CD that almost matches the greatness of \\"Close Your Eyes\\" is Nerf Herder's \\"Buffy Theme.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Hearing is Believing","review":"This is a wonderful CD, whether you are a Buffy fan or not. The music selections are a wonderful mix of chilling darkness and teenage fun. A personal favorite is \\"Transylvanian Concubine\\" featured in the second season episode \\"Surprise.\\" Fans will drive themselves crazy trying to match song to episode, and everyone else can just sit back and enjoy the music.The only downside to this CD is that there is only one track from the show's resident composer Chrisopher Beck. \\"Close Your Eyes\\" is the beautifully haunting love theme for Angel and Buffy, featured in several second episodes (most prominantly in the finale)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's Cibo Motto?","review":"Although I wish those tunes that I associate with Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Spoon and Sugar Water by Cibo Motto, Full of Grace by Sarah McLachlan, etc.) would have been on here, there are a LOT of new songs. \\"It Doesn't Matter\\" is great, I remember exactly in season 2 (\\"When She Was Bad\\") when this song played, and \\"Wild Horses\\", who can forget when Angel and Buffy danced at prom? So, 4 stars, I just wish Nickle was on here..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is as good as it gets...","review":"Seriously, the \\"Buffy\\" soundtrack is one of the best albums released recently, starting with the fab theme, and then through \\"Wild Horses\\", \\"Charge\\", K's choice, Four Star Mary (the band that is responsible for Oz' band songs), Bif Naked and just about any other song. Very rock, very funk, very quiet, it's got everything. A MUST BUY for Buffy fans, and a great offer for others."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Soundtrack","review":"This is exactly what soundtracks should be. Tracks 1,2,3,5,7,9,11,13,14, and 17 are really good, and the lesser known bands have a huge amount of potential. I am a huge fan of the show, and the soundtrack completly lives up to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BtVS- album","review":"The case ended up being cracked either in transit or it wasn't mentioned by the seller.

A MUST HAVE! a great companion to the # 1 show on tv!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BTVS album is so good, your ears will bleed!","review":"If you are a fan of the WB shows(Dawson's Creek, 7th Heaven, etc.), then you will really be able to bite into this Album. It has numerous soft rock/alternative songs. The album fortunately has a lot of variety into it, so you will be able to listen to the whole album while slaying vampires, without stopping to change the track. If you like the Dawson's Creek soundtrack, which was also exceptionally good, then you will like this soundtrack because they are so similiar, which is good! I'm out of here, because the album is so great, that my blood shivers when I don't listen to the soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, I'm a happy Buffy fan.","review":"Though I would have liked more songs that have actually been on the show (Cibo Matto, Nickel, Louie says, anyone?), I like all the songs on the soundtrack except one (Face to Face's \\"The Devil You Know (God is a Man)\\"). I got the tape b/c I was so anxious that I had to listen to it in the car. The tape is cool, it's like nothing I've ever seen. You open it like a box of cigarettes. Interesting. I'm listening to The Sunday's \\"Wild Horses\\" as I type. Very happy am I.

The music gave the listener a very good idea of what the show itself it like. There were many great bands that are finally getting the attention they so deserve (such as Bif Naked, and Four Star Mary). My favorite on the soundtrack in Lucky by Bif Naked. I do wish there would have been a couple of songs by Sarah McLaughlin and Cibo Matto on there, but the soundtrack in still excellent. This soundtrack is something any real Buffy fan will enjoy, and is well worth the money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best I've heard in ages!","review":"It is just what a Buffy fan was waiting for!

The other songs i liked much where K's choice one , Face to Face one , Bif-Naked and Hepburn one . The songs i nevr listen to are \\"Rasputina\\" , i don't know why , but i didn't got into this one ...the second one i don't like is VelvetCahins one : i hate it ...All the other songs are really good ( Garbage , Furslide ... and so on )If you like a cd where music goes from kinda slow to songs with a nice \\"rythm\\" ( pain !!! ) then this cd is for you !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer and its Music companion","review":"This is the answer to 'What do you get a buffy-fanatic that has everything?'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampires","review":"This is the only sound track aside from the musical sound track for Buffy.

I think they could've done alot better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"And they say romance is dead. - Or they just wish it.\\"","review":"This cd is heaven. I can't believe that first I was doubting whether I should buy it. I'm glad I did, because these are truly some of the best songs who were in the Buffy-series. I especially liked Four Star Mary's 'Pain'; I haven't stopped singing... well, more something like screaming it, and also the song by Rasputina, 'Transylvanian Concubine'. Of course, the love theme 'Close your eyes' is heartbreaking, and the song 'Keep myself awake' by Black Lab is one of the most beautiful lovesongs I know. But as you know, Love is a funny thing. All the Buffyfans should buy it, and also the Buffyhaters, and also the 'yeah, Buffy's okay'-ers, or else they'll find their bodyparts for weeks. The only thing I missed on this CD was the song of Sarah MacLachlan, and Spike singing Sid Vicious' 'My Way', because that must be *the* musical moment of the past millenium. And they say romance is dead. Or they just wish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This book is great! I have already made 3 of the menus and it was incredible each time.

Usually I listen to Amazon samples of the CD before odering. I mistakenly thought this was a Phoebe Hines album and didn't review the songs. Otherwise, I would have discoverd that various artists were on this recording. With the exception of a few other songs, I have played the entire CD only once.

This book is a very good book that coincides with the Titanic, it is a book that shows the passengers that went on the Sophia for her voyage, to the last trip, and the sinking. If you want to read a book that is about a little known diaster, but still has the qualities of a big sinking.Read it! It is thought provoking and very well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, It's Judy...","review":"I bought this from Half Price Books and I listened to all three cds that afternoon. Let me tell you Judy is just...um...Judy. She had a beautiful soprano sound when she was young. Then when she got older, well lets just say she got an older sounding voice as well. Its a good collection of Judy songs. The best songs in it are of course Over the Rainbow, Swanee, Battle Song of the Republic( although she cant hit the last note), Chicago, and You'll Never Walk Alone. Pretty good. If you like Judy Garland , then you'll like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Watch the MiniSeries!","review":"I usually love adaptations because they go more into detail than the actual film.

Save your pretty penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new in book compared to movie","review":"I am a committed BG fan, but this book was a waste. I expected it to have expanded detail and sub plots not included in the movie. It didn't. I could have sat in front of my TV and written this in no time.

It doesn't have that much more info than the series though."},{"rating":"1","title":"screenplay hack","review":"This \\"book\\" is bascially a rewrite of the screenplay for the miniseries with little to nothing contributed by the \\"author\\".

As a rule, I find that most abridged readings are stale and uninteresting. However, I really dig BSG so I thought I'd give this one a shot. I didn't care for it very much. It told the story... it got the details right. However, it seemed to me that Jonathan Davis was just going through the motions and wasn't putting any emotion behind the words. This performance was significantly bit less than stellar. I didn't hate it... but it's priced low for a reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than the original","review":"When I read this book, I thought I would gain insight into the minds and hearts of the characters that could not be expressed on film... this book did not give that. It's more a printed version of the Battlestar Galactica mini-series/pilot and nothing more.Another thing that disappointed me was that I personally enjoy the differing viewpoints of religion in the show and in this book it is so inconsistent that it's almost jarring when I find it. When most of the Colonials say \\"Gods\\" it's spelled as \\"God's\\". I have to wonder if Jeffrey Carver actually saw the show to know that the Colonials' religion was polytheistic while the Cylons' were monotheistic.The 2 stars I gave were pretty much for its association with Battlestar Galactica."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Fans of the Show","review":"I got this book for my husband, who read it in record time (for him, that means about a week).He's not as wordy as I am, but had this to say about the book: \\"If you like the show, you'll like the book.

Fiona is totally unsympathetic. Within a single paragraph, she thinks she's being dismissed by her family, then she likes them, then her feelings are hurt by some perceived slight, and on and on it goes. I thought it was carelessly written; it felt very lazy to me - it could have done with serious editing. Plus, I couldn't shake the feeling that the book was set in the 40s or 50s, which is fine, if the book REALLY were set in those decades; I had to keep reminding myself this was supposedly set in the current day. I finished the book because I just had to see if it was going to be ludicrous to the very end, and it was. Even the \\"happy ending\\" was apathetic and tacked-on.I've liked the author's other books, so I was most disappointed when I finally got my hands on this one.

I read Morris's Oprah-chosen novel and liked it well enough to pick up her new one. This is a let-down! All of the characters are predictable and one-dimensional.

The story line was transparent - there were no surprises whatsoever. I had it all figured out about 1/3 of the way through and just slogged through the repetition and confusion so I could see if it got any better.

There are too many characters, however, and past the 200th page you kind of stop caring whether Jack wants to live up to his fathers expectations, or that Elizabeth is torn up inside about her feelings. Fiona keeps making stupid decisions and having sex with every TOm Dick and Harry that knocks on her door. Not to mention the fact she keeps associating herself with Patrick, after what he's done to her. She acts like a battered woman, but meanwhile she's supposed to be some sort of strong, outspoken diva. Perhaps it shows up her different faucets, but afer the fifth time she hangs up on Patrick and the thrid time she gets caught trying to get in some guy's pants, it gets kind of annoying.

With her life revolving around one man to the next, she never takes the time to evaluate her own NEGATIVE choices and take stock in her own worth as a human being. I kept reading simply for this hope, but it never arrived. In the end, Fiona still takes pleasure out of seeing other lives destroyed. Only skillful writing could have saved this character, and unfortunately Morris has failed. Fiona's story is thinly constructed. Morris's novel is devoid of any quality literary technique.

I think the story was valid, and worthy of being told, in half as much space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric, read like a bad romance novel","review":"I am not a snob, but I do have high standards, and I believe the author wrote \\"down\\" to us . . . nowadays, the population is fairly sophisticated. I found many editing mistakes and was surprised that Viking/Penguin had published it. There were too many contractions - speaks to the entire book being poorly written. Ms. Morris - I challenge you to rise above mediocrity.Why does this all of a sudden happen in Fiona's 30th year . . . what on earth has she been doing for the past 12 years since HS graduation? She is shallow, petty and childish, and not a character I care to read about.Less than halfway into the book, I figured out the ending . . . so much for plot twists. There's an incredible amount of foreshadowing.I am honestly surprised so many readers enjoyed it, but I doubt if my views are in the minority. However, since it was an Oprah book, my hopes may have been too high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Finally done with this book! Fiona Range is by far the worst book I've read by Morris. It was near torturous trying to finish this novel with its multitude of typos and grammatical errors. Whoever attempted to proof/edit this novel should be fired. I found the story boring and the characters lifeless. I couldn't wait for Fiona to slice her wrist or do something equally stupid given that her sole talent in this novel seems to be her ability to make one stupid decision after the other. The book's ending did not surprise me; I'd predicted it before halfway finishing the book. If you're interested in truly experiencing this author's talent read Vanished or Songs in Ordinary Time."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read","review":"I just loved the character, Fiona. She was tough yet soft. She was a true survivor.

She is a 30 year old brat. Her feeling of being an outsider is self-induced, and the constant episodes where she is \\"acting out\\" are repetitive and exasperating. The other main characters are equally repellant.The book suffers from sloppy editing, as well.No one hits a home run with every book, but this one doesn't even make it to first base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy book to read; too soap opera bubbly for me","review":"I must say I was a little disapointed with this book. I got more excitment when Billy Ray Tuggle and Opal were introduced years ago on \\"All my Children\\". At least they could act. Fiona was a whiney woman who just made me sick instead of sorry for her. Her cousin was a poor excuse for a human being constantly crying and acting like a two-year old. I felt like I was reading a book about two woman who where psychiatric cases. That premise would have been interesting if I actually had any feeling for these characters. The only person I had any interest in was Fiona's father. He was an interesting character study. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something to take up time on an airplane or bus ride. I think I would have been more satisfied reading a Harliquin Romance or watching Spongebob Squarepants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Experiencing the now","review":"Bugental's book serves as a great reminder that the healing essence of therapy is found in the living moment between therapist and client. Striving to explore the client's experiencing in the here-and-now (instead of collecting facts in a \\"who-done-it\\" type investigation), this humanistic-existential approach to therapy invites the client to find their own truth, while in the safe and ever-present company of the therapist. By helping the client to engage in the living moment in the therapy room, the therapist can ultimately help the client to engage fully in their relationships with self and others outside of the therapy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Must Have for the Existential-Humanistic Therapist or Therapist in Training","review":"Bugental's book is captivating and inspiring for any therapist wanting to work on truly bringing the therapy into the room.

He never gives the kind of detail you need to really begin thinking about all that must be considered when launching into a huge project like building your own house. At points, he says in essence \\"I could spend pages talking about this subject, but I won't.\\" Okay, then where is the reader supposed to get all the stuff the author couldn't be bothered to include?Again, I'm not saying this book has no value.

This great land is simply too vast in size, and rich in history and cultures to be described by any one author at any one time.

Michael W. Smith is such an awesome Christian songwriter and performer. Love his work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous!","review":"Gloria is an absolute masterpiece.

Regardless, I bought the CD due mainly to the Boys Choir - extremely talented group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Traditional CD","review":"I bought this CD years ago and still enjoy listening to it a Christmas time. It has a number of traditional songs and is very instrumental thoughout (don't worry, you hear lots of Michael too).

Siebel contends (arguably based on enlightened self-interest) that companies must either employ new eBusiness tactics or perish.

I admit that I am a relative newcomer to Underworld, but they did \\"rock my world\\" when I first discovered them. They have had such energetic, innovative songs. For this reason I feel it necessary to warn future buyers that this album is not related in any apparent way to their prior musical sounds. Though I respect them, this album sounds like George Michael through and through. If you like George Michael, then you will enjoy. I was hoping for something \\"Underworld.\\"If you, like me, are hoping for something new and creative, you will be disappointed. Perhaps the title \\"Underneath the Radar\\" is fitting.

They keep getting better and better - \\"Dirty Epic\\" was the first cut I heard and I was hooked!

If anything it's a testament to their longevity. Other than that this album holds no value for fans of this band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neurotica","review":"Compared with Karl Hyde's first band Freur (producing 1984's acclaimed album \\"Doot-doot\\" and a hit single of the same name), Underworld's debut is somewhat of a disappointment. And there's certainly no resemblance to Underworld's music in the '90s. The band comes up with a limp electro-rock style, clearly lacking the hit appeal and catchy melodies that distinguished Freur's work. Most of the music plods along boring anti-rhythms, plastic guitar riffs, and ludicrous lyrics. Rupert Hine, who has worked with bands like Rush and Saga, gives a flawless, dynamic production, but the song material just doesn't catch fire. Nevertheless, I think the uptempo \\"I need a doctor\\", the lofty \\"Bright white flame\\", and the title track are quite rewarding. \\"Glory! Glory!\\" was released as a single, but it failed to chart just about everywhere. Of interest only to hardcore fans who are looking to buy anything with the Underworld name on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh the shame!","review":"The album Underworld wish would disapear.This is a terrible 80s Depeche Mode meets Yaz rip off.

Buy any (and every) Underworld album EXCEPT this one!You have been warned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Actual Music!","review":"Don't get me wrong - I like the techno Underworld stuff on Friday nights when I'm anticipating a party weekend. But the other 90% of the time when I am not in party mode, I prefer something more melodic, and this album fits the bill.I disagree with comparisons to Yaz and Depeche Mode. This album has a little bit more mature funk to it. If I was to compare it to another band, I would say it sounds more like Ministry before they went hard industrial. And, similar to the early Tears for Fears albums, all of the songs are strong enough to make the entire album playable.If you like 80s pop, this album is a must. But if you like the edgier techno of Underworld, you might be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album you've never heard of?","review":"Glory! Glory! Sounds like Culture Club, only this rocks more, and has a lot of Soul/Gospel influences, yet dancible. Most greatest hits albums, especially of the \\"'80's music\\" genre, don't have as many outright winners as this fine album. It's one of those rare albums by somebody most of us never heard of (I heard one single once on a radio station I could barely receive) that's truly excellent. Why it wasn't more acclaimed back in the day I'll never know. Pricey at the current lofty price ($18.99?), but still well worth it.

Typical fugazi songs that go nowhere new, which isn't necessarily a bad thing except that all their sheep-like fans always claim that fugazi is so cutting edge.

Boring. Not funny. Bad music. Full of cliches. A poor copy of Love Actually. Lame kid. Lame lead (Ashton Kutcher? say no more) Obligatory stereotype gay and Hispanic characters. Julia Roberts must have had a mortgage payment or something due for the weak cameo she puts in as a thoroughly unbelieveable soldier on a plane ride that never seems to end (at the beginning of the movie, as the day opens in LA, the captain says there are 6 hours left in the flight; they land and it is nighttime in LA); she sleepwalks through her lines, but undoubtedly got paid many hundreds of thousands of dollars for it.

The film has no cohesive plot structure, just a series of meaningless(except Julia Roberts and Bradley Coopers)stories that are supposed to make sense and connect, but are really just boring.

I didn't find it to be at all as good as others had informed me it was. The role of Taylor Swift was basically the only amusement I received from this film. The rest of the movie jumps around way too much with this too huge cast. By the time I'd get slightly interested in someone's story, it would jump to the next couple. I actually found the movie to be quite annoying. What with the cheating, and the break-ups, and the arguing, I hardly found it a film to enjoy with my husband on Valentine's Day. It was a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"great comedy","review":"Valentine's day was a fun and at times unpredictable movie about love and unexpected romance.

Fifteen minutes into it, I wanted it to end, but I stayed with it because because my partner enjoyed it.My list of phrases to describe this movie could be endless, but let's go with a few: pretentious, cliched, predictable, boring, cliched, unfunny (except see below), cliched, poorly acted, forced, sappy, cliched...etc.And please...who casted this movie? Julia Roberts as a U.S. soldier?!? I couldn't stop laughing at this ridiculous piece of casting every time I saw her in uniform. Bradley Cooper and Eric Dane as a couple? What, no two more gorgeous actors in Hollywood to cast as the gay couple?

I am still trying to get over how bad the acting was. The story line wasn't horrible for a romantic comedy but the actors just killed it.

Who can even tell them apart???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Am I a sap for liking this?","review":"This perfectly enjoyable trifle from director Garry Marshal maintains its warm refrains setting us up with a variety of scenarios, from the guy who proposes to the married couple about to re-invoke their vows (Hector Elizondo is a great, underappreciated actor), from the youthful culture through to the advanced, that offer different glimpses into both romantic and (more importantly) committed loves that form the bedrock of our society. It doesn't try to say too much and is only cloying when it plays the audience for the fool with a too-good-to-be true (and handsome to boot!) Bradley Cooper being humanly kind to an enlisted woman on her way home (Julia Roberts) and so raises expectations of possible romance only to surprise us with Cooper's character being involved with another man. Still, good for our friends (Ashton Kutcher and Jennifer Garner) being friends who fall in love: the best kind!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Valentines Day","review":"This is a clean, fun movie to watch. I liked the whole story line and the actors in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Towering Inferno","review":"This felt like one of those old fashioned disaster movies that was crammed with stars. Unfortunately the movie was a disaster of epic proportions. At first it was fun to spot and name all the stars that popped up. Then as you watch and realize how weak the plot and story is, you end up feeling terribly disappointed at the waste of talent. It seems like they just asked as many actors as they could to appear in the movie to cover a terrible plot. Basically the movie stars Kutcher and Garner, the rest of the actors put in a few days of work each and get 10 or 15 minutes screen time tops. I wish I could have liked this one, but the story is so lame, and the moral messages so heavy handed it really just ruins the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valentine's Day","review":"Great movie for couples, and also came with the digital copy so now I can watch it on my ipod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great actors weak story.","review":"This film isn't short on talent.

Not only was it filled with underdeveloped characters who were barely even two-dimensional (don't even try looking to find one who is three-dimensional, you won't find it), the plot doesn't come across as very well-developed either. Clearly the creators thought that if they put enough celebrities in the film, it would make up for the failure of a story and people would still pay to see it and like it. It does have some actors I like to see, but so glad I saw it for free at home instead of wasting my money in the theater.Best advice - skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I am a fan of Gary Marshall, the director, which is why I bought this movie. I had not seen it in the theater and was going entirely on reviews and previous Gary Marshal films. Big mistake. The film rambles. It is hard to identify with the characters. There are too many poorly defined characters. My wife and I couldn't finish it. I think maybe we got a third of the way through before we had had enought. Don't buy it before watching it first on netflix or some other sevice. You will spend a lot less money for something you may not like at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"actually very good","review":"I was skeptic by getting this from the redbox for free. To many bad reviews. But I am glad I did. This was very good. From start to finish I loved it.

All in all very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ensemble cast in a busy yet weak movie","review":"With a female cast of Jessica Biel, Jennifer Garner, Anne Hathaway, Julia Roberts, Jessica Alba, and Taylor Swift -this is a guy's dream come true. I'm sure the same goes for females with the male actors. I can handle the occasional \\"chick flick\\", but this one just had a bad story with annoying characters. Ashton Kutcher and Jamie Foxxx are really lame in this movie, as are most of the characters and situations that are squeezed in to give all the stars enough face time. I thought it was interesting to see Julia Roberts in an army uniform, never thought I would see that. The movie doesn't even really end with that much of a \\"feel good\\" ending. I thought it was comical that someone as gorgeous as Jessica Biel could possibly be a frustrated single that can't get a date. I don't think Jessica Biel has ever had to go without a date ever. The movie has plenty of attractive people, but the movie itself is pretty bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"touching and light!","review":"the minute i saw this movie in theaters i knew i wanted to own it. it is light a funny while having nice touches about the power of love. i was able to find it for a great price and it shipped in about a day! if your looking for a good laugh,a lot of people, and fun twists, this for you! great buy1"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly watchable...","review":"I am not terribly picky over romantic comedies. I usually just grin & bear it and usually end up talking myself into thinking it was a \\"pretty-cute movie.\\" Not this one. With about 20 minutes left in the film, I was getting furious that I had wasted an hour of my life and was contemplating pulling the plug on in. I hung in there but the general vibe of this movie is very sloppy and rushed. The acting, writing, filming, editing...everything. I picture the writer sitting down with a friend and writing it from start to finish over a quickie lunch.I got two light chuckles from this movie, the rest was pretty much awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Actually wannabe","review":"This movie seemed like an American rip-off of \\"Love Actually,\\" even to the appearance of the little boy experiencing his first crush. \\"Love Actually\\" is a much better movie. \\"Valentine's Day\\" is the kind of movie you'd expect to see on the Hallmark channel; while there's nothing horrible about it, there's nothing particularly engaging or memorable about it, either. Even the plot twists are predictable. And Jessica Biel repeatedly dateless on Valentine's Day? Puh-leeze.You might be drawn to the movie because it's loaded with celebrities. Someone obviously had the clout to get both reputable and currently popular actors on board. But most the stars in the film have done better work on TV or in other films. And if you're looking for a romantic comedy with a predictable plot, there's much more entertainment to be had from a slew of Bollywood films--at least then you'd also get music and dancing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Valentine's Day","review":"This movie was a waste of an hour of my life that I never will get back.

Perhaps it's because I am Australian, and we have an English culture base, that I believe this is such a poor imitation of other films that have really delivered.

No stars and no compliments to anyone involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Sadly, unwatchable.

Don't fall for it.","review":"Not only are there too many stories but half of them are god awful and absolutely POINTLESS. Taylor Swift/Taylor Lautner's story for example, added NOTHING to the over all plot and it was just another way of cramming more familiar faces into the movie. Also half of the stars that are first billed appear in the movie for only minutes. It's pure exploitation and an obvious attempt to snare a huge audience. Unfortunately for the world and for the sake of film, it WILL snare that audience and most will come out liking it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dramedy version of Crash","review":"The reason that I liken Valentines Day to Crash is all the big name celebs..in a contrived attempt to make it look like our lives are all intertwined in some way. The only difference is that there is no message to Valentines day accept to say that it really shouldn't even exist. Not that I care if it does either way. Regardless of whatever holiday is being exploited in a film like this, this one really left me feeling a little peeved. At who? Julia Roberts, Queen Latifah, Ann Hathaway, Shirley McLain, Patrick Dempsey, Ashton Kutcher, and all the rest of the highly regarded actors. It was only their names being attached to this stinker that made me waste my time and money.

It was like, ok let's get a bunch of actors and put them all in one film and everyone will want to see this. I was told this was pretty bad but found myself bored and with nothing else to watch...I should have rewatched something good. The acting was just poor and it truly seemed as if no one in the film wanted to be in it!

I recently learned that the average number of days of filming per actor/actress was 3. Let me tell you, it SHOWS.The dialog is written by what seems to be an alien who has learned about human behavior by watching Saved By the Bell episodes.Every single scene of this movie looks like the first take. The only thing more obvious than the plot is the lame attempt at humor, each and every joke comes at you like a freight train. Despite the collective talent of this cast, none of them can save the impossibly cheesy dialog or improve about the hopelessly thin plot lines.Please save yourself the 2 hours and watch a test pattern instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie","review":"I have never written a review before. I was compelled to do so for this movie in the hopes that I would stop anyone wasting their money on a truly awful movie. Its terrible. Myself and my partner both went hopeing for a Love Actually or a Notting Hill or something similar. It failed spectacularly. It is poor poor effort. No chemistry, no plot, no laughs. Terrible.

It is your basic romantic comedy with the ups and downs of relationships. The plot is a little unwielding, focusing on what seems like two thousand people living in Los Angeles. It tries to tie in a bunch of storylines into one neat package and flip flops all over the place. That being said, the film is enjoyable as mindless entertainment. The cast puts forth maximum effort (though Julia Roberts seems to be there only as a thank you to director Gary Marshall for making her career in Pretty Woman) in the paper-thin plot and they are quite likable. Ashton Kutcher and Jennifer Garner stand out as does Jamie Foxx with many other recognizable talents offering solid support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Bland","review":"Romcoms are all the same.

I will say that most of individuals involved in the cast did a good job. However, there were a few that just left a bad taste in my mouth.

Topher Grace is usually intriguing to watch; he was mostly just annoying in this movie. Ashton Kutcher's acting wasn't too bad, but his character was so pathetic, he was difficult to watch, as well. Jessica Biel, Jennifer Garner, Patrick Dempsey - all yucky characters and ho-hum acting. I could go on, but won't. The only redeeming personality in this movie was George Lopez' supporting role.

To take a line from The Princess Bride: \\"I do not think that that word means what you think it means...\\"Some of the tips are well known (see above) and some are new, at least to me, and some are creative rehashes and combinations of various well-known rules of writing.I have not finished reading yet.

(And for those who don't know, it's not about physical abuse, it's about being in an emotionally manipulative relationship, and being comfortable with it. It's written by 3 points of view: the abuser, the abusee, and a bystander (I believe).) ANYways, the \\"Push\\" import single also contains an acoustic version of \\"Busted\\"-awesome if you love that song (like me), and the amazing \\"Tired\\".

The mammoths went extinct precisely where they'd have had no food supply to build their population to such high levels, nor indeed to support so much as a herd.In other words, they didn't go extinct because of conditions that exist today, but they did go extinct due to natural conditions. And not due to fictional bands of ravenous human hunters.This book should appeal to the knee-jerk reactionaries who sanctimoniously hand down judgments about the lifestyles of the rest of us. This book is worth less than fossilized mammoth dung."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ward nailed it!","review":"Some truths are self-evident. That human beings are likely responsible for the mass extinctions of the Pleistocene megafauna is one of these truths. That we are still in the process of exterminating the remnants of the Pleistocene megafauna is another of these truths.Mr. Ward, in addition to being a fine scholar, is also a very talented writer who adds a generous touch of humanity to what could have been a very dry and intellectual read. I highly recommend this book. It's eye-opening, sometimes frightening, but largely on target. All in all, it's the best book on the disappearance of our era's megafauna since Leakey's THE FIFTH EXTINCTION, and the two books will share shelf space in my office."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine fairy tale but scientific rubbish","review":"What a disppointment. The author, a geologist, falls flat in this book. He strays into areas of expertise with grand claims and zero proof. He does not refer to his ideas as theories but as fact. Aside from the joy ride around good questions, the book is filled with extreme political correctness... Why are SUV's, Republicans, and present day humans always the ones that are to blame for extinctions that happened thousands of years ago (now you get an idea of what light that this book was written in). Pure rubbish as a science book. Great for \\"politically correctness\\" fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Application of theory in the field.","review":"Engineering applications of hydrogeology is a new subject in our country. As a research assistant, we had some problems to show the practical use of hydrogeology, especially field hydrogeology, to our students. This book may solve many of our application problems. Although, English is a foreign language for us and our students, this book can easily be followed. Most of the mathematical formula frightens students, but as this book was kept away from them, students will easily get the hydrogeological point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early work - unimpressive","review":"I am a HUGE fan of China Mieville. I have read Perdido Street Station, The Scar and Iron Council. Those were GREAT books, but this is not in the same league.The book was interesting at the beginning, but there was not enough going on to keep me interested. I forced myself to finish it, hoping that it would get better. I would not recommend this book to anyone, since he has written far better novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"...not by a long shot...","review":"Sorry, folks, but this book does not hold up. It's starts off with a fast pace and characters and a story that just sucks you in. But as more (annoying, pretentious) characters are added...well it goes down hill. This was a chore to finish. The writer is clearly trying to appeal to the hip, cool, gothic youth and is kills what should have been a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking & Enjoyable Read","review":"I read the book in a short amount of time...The concept was interesting.

Even when it's not something you'd really want to smell or sense, Mieville lets you have it full on. I enjoyed Ann Rice's early works for the same reason. I knew how the curtains in a room would feel under my fingertips, and how musty they'd smell. Mieville is much in the same vein in that regard, one of the best sensory descriptive writers I've encountered yet. A gripping story, too. Read his newer work!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not compelling","review":"I read \\"The Scar\\" as my first taste of Mieville's work, and was blown away. I have to say that this work is not up to the level of his later work, but still evokes interest and images.While dark, it did not grab me by the throat the way his other work did. And I felt very little association or empathy for the characters.This is a good book, but worth reading more as a glimpse of where the author started from than as a work itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Urban Fantasy","review":"King Rat is truly great urban underground (and I mean that literally) fantasy in the tradition of novels such as Dark Cities Underground by Lisa Goldstein and Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman. Feeding off the drum and bass culture in London combined with urban myth, King Rat is a very hip but very dark book. Despite liking books very similar to it, I did find it somewhat hard to get into but once I did get fully immersed in the plot, it was hard to put down. Great action, incredible use of language, and an interesting explanation of an age-old myth. For fans of urban fantasy, this one's a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apathetic, shallow, and not at all ground -breaking","review":"What a ho-hum of a book this was. I was waiting the entire time for some sort of depth or astounding revalation only to find that the author drivels on with all the writing talent of a 10 year old hastily tossing together something for the teacher.Not at all a book I'd reccomend to anyone who is *truly* looking for a unique read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story, dissappointing execution","review":"Great premise, great start....then we get the language of the gutter in it's fullness. This is not a book for kids, and if you are not into bad language that jumps off the page, neither are you! I loved Unlundun and decided to try this one....not the reader friendly book I imagined. The story is great, a wonder and brilliant in some areas...but there isn't a need to drive a story with such a good premise off the road with bad language. Sorry.....but it would have been a great book with out it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 100-word book review","review":"First novel by inventive left-wing fantasy author China Mieville, in which young Saul Garamond comes to terms with his true identity as a half-rat superhero, after the murder of his father. Set in the shadowy, seamy underbelly of London, this novel is also about the esoteric world of drum-and-bass music. The characterisation is fairly flat, and there really should be a bit more of a background to Saul; King Rat is not quite in the same league as the Bas-Lag novels, but still displays a brilliant imagination, and a rather anarchic mix and match approach which I find very stimulating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read--exceeded my expectations","review":"I'd describe this as hybrid of The Alienist and the recent X-Men film--but rather better than either. Much more finely written than the pulp thillers that sell so well these days-- I hesitated to pick it up based on the \\"horror genre\\" label i had seen it associated with, but it's really fairly classy gore, what there is of it.

This dictionary is split between three volumes. The volumes themselves are taller than your average book, wider as well. Being split over three volumes takes this dictionary out of the \\"overly-large and unwieldy\\" catagory, but you'll still want a table surface to place the volume you're perusing. I aquired a used copy of this dictionary, and in the 36 years of it's existence, the pages have only yellowed very lightly (and has aquired it's own unique older book smell).

Now she has an adorable skirt and they just had to ruin it by adding an ugly pair of ankle tights with rainbow stripes. Yeah, the accessories are fine but to make up for it they gave her NEON (yes, N-E-O-N) high-lights. If anyone thought that looks good, you need a reality check!

I would have to add that it goes very slowly so it is best for someone with limited programming experience. It is clear from some of the other comments here that people have tried to work with this book without having proper SQL knowledge. Yes there are a number of typos but the the associated web page for the book is mentioned many times and the first page has all the corrections.

I was careful to not use more than the recommended amount of flour, and when I phoned KitchenAid they said that I must have used too much flour and that they couldn't help me. So - having not taken a video account of how much flour I used, I resigned myself to my own McGyver skills, and popped a round beer coaster into the base of the mixer. That's tightened things up to the point where I can use it for everything but yeast bread doughs. Cool, but that's when I like to make the most!

It holds a diaper bag on it's handle and will not tip backwards. It looks different in a very cool way. The only drawback is that the underbasket cannot hold large items due to a large X frame. But it holds many small to medium sized bags.

The foot rest also adjust to keep her little feet supported until they are long enough to dangle comfortably. The handles are easy to hold onto and there is plenty of room for me to strap on the diaper bag. It is a very sturdy stroller. We had trouble with the canopy, I think it became distorted when it got too hot in the sun, but Baby Planet had a new one to us within the week so we did not have to miss any outings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good purchase for the money","review":"I reviewed strollers, like other mothers, for a few weeks before I decided on this one.

It has a really cute look and comfy padding for my son. It folds rather small and quite easily. It's light. My only issues were this: I wish it had a carring srap(it's kinda akward to hold in any such way), the visor could provide better sun coverage(the weather shield would be good to come with it or buy after), and the strap between the legs is just to far back. The part where it meets the fabric to keep it in place is too far back and makes it uncomfordable for an older child. I just took the strap out from the seat and made it a 4-point harness instead.

Sure, it was slow to get into the story, but worth reading because the author was carefully building a solid foundation for the conclusion. I'm left feeling desolate and saddened by the ending, yet it was fitting for the situation and characters and teaches important lessons to the reader.

Thank you, James McEachin, for coming up with this unique method of story-telling! Please write more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"POWERFUL","review":"I have read this book twice - once several years ago and again at this time. The book haunted me with an otherworldly memory and needed to be revisited. I found McCachin's skill as an author and storyteller compelling and very deep. Some passages verged on sheer poetry. The plot unravels in such a way that, just as the reader senses predictability, new surprises arrive.Good characterization also deserves note. Each person is iconic and simply but well developed. Mildred is the old fearful aristocracy and Archy is the change agent that victimized the South. Ben came forth as the old guard slave, Ms. Pratt the voice of hope, Moses, the new generation of liberated slave, and of course there was the ever present representation of ignorance and hate. The last chapter deserved two readings.I am hoping that the author continues to write. I am also hoping this book is made into a screneplay. I would love to see it acted out."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not find the characters compelling","review":"The book seemed to me to be a morality play with characters that I never cared about as individuals.

If you are not familiar with Nakano's work then this movie will come as a shock for it is not your classic samurai movie. Instead Nakano breaks away from rigid tradition and does something different for a modern century.

This one should definitely have a place on your shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst films ever made","review":"This movie was awful do not recommend buying this renting this or even looking at the cover. I hated every momment of this film. It is not funny, has a terrible soundtrack an is poorly acted. The story had potential three ninjas in a love triangle. But the sillyness of the whole film makes you not care at all about the characters. The main characters are more like the 3 stooges than 3 ninjas. The fighting was silly and weak.

And--thanks to other writers like Wallace Stegner and Hemingway and a little bit of Thomas Hardy--it is about how our natural surroundings have a lot to do with how we get defined.

Yes, there are excellent issues she brings up regarding sweatshops, racism, corporate greed, etc., but to deny a little girl a dream of wanting to be a princess for a day is ridiculus!

This excellent book opened up my eyes to what goes on behind such a supposedly \\"beautiful\\" occurrence in females' lives. This book not only opened up my eyes to the wedding industry, but to other matters as well, such as child labor, animal abuse, and sex trafficking. White Weddings was an inspiration to me to go out and see what I can do to help change the world in order to make it a better place.

The author is ranting instead of calmly stating a realistic argument. If I understood correctly, she believes that the Wedding Industrial Complex (with some vague notions of society and government) CAUSES women to desire marriage, view themselves as princesses and then spend as much money as possible on the wedding.Although her argument is far-reaching her facts are extremely narrow- (she spends a chunk of the book repeating herself with magazine advertising statistics).If her point was to let us know that many business owners within the wedding industry do not operate out of good will but are in fact out to make as much money as possible, point taken. But I knew that before I read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ingraham's critic is too narrow","review":"I read this book while studying both contemporary North American and cross-cultural weddings and marriages. Ingrahms book describes the \\"white wedding\\" a white upperclass affair as discriminatory and exclusive.

It is a beautiful story of overcoming obstacles, increasing one's faith, and the redemption of mean-spirited people as they recognize goodness and truth and leave their unkind ways. It makes one's heart leap for joy with its Christian message. The writings of George MacDonald had a major influence on C.S. Lewis, and you will understand why when you read this Victorian classic.

It is difficult to read in that it has quite a bit of dialog written in scottish dialect which slows the story down so much that you forget what you are reading because it took so long to figure out what the character was actually saying. I am sure it is a lovely story but I could not get into it and I am glad I didn't have to pay for this edition.

Though not quite as good as \\"In on the Killtaker\\" or \\"Red Medecine\\", this is a worthy addition to the Fugazi catalogue and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steady Diet of Stagnation","review":"Other reviewers have said that \\"Steady Diet...\\" is perhaps Fugazi's most cohesive effort. They would be right, if by cohesive they meant stagnant. Yes, that's right; this album, though a solid rock album, is definitely no stand-out of Fugazi's. Sure, there are good songs on here, and the band does tackle the subjects of women's rights (\\"Reclamation\\") and war (\\"K.Y.E.O.\\"), but these simply do not stack up to classics like \\"Merchandise\\" and \\"Suggestion\\". A song like \\"Nice New Outfit\\" simply does not contain the enthusiasm of a song like \\"Bulldog Front\\"; while both were indeed written about the same topic, the former seems like it was simply being made to emulate the latter, with the end result being that \\"Nice New Outfit\\" falls tragically short.A good album nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great Fugazi record","review":"I bought this record when it was originally released back in 1991. Fugazi had been getting a lot of attention around that time due to the success of the Repeater record, which I believe came out the year before. I this thoroughly uninteresting record. The music conforms to the Fugazi template with droning guitar sounds, pseudo-dub drumming and basslines, and the annoying Ian/Guy lyrical dichotomy: Ian writes the straightforward preachy stuff while Guy gets all esoteric and weepy on us. Kids, take it from an old fart: this band is really just Phish for the hardcore set, managing note-for-note renditions of Ted Nugent classics (compare \\"Stranglehold\\" with any Fugazi tune - pathetic huh?) most fifteen year olds have never heard, let alone forgotten. So scrape some loose change together and go buy a 'Noog record off that needy dude who hangs out on 7th Avenue in Brooklyn around the corner from the D train.

Jeronimo was an awesome 'heavy rock' German ensemble. Tunes here that undoubtedly make this CD reissue a keeper are the *ss-kicking title cut \\"Time Ride\\" (also, great guitar work), the six-minute \\"There Are People\\", \\"Indian River\\", the (sort of) tripping \\"Do You Remember\\" and \\"Ice Dream\\". Line-up: Michael Koch - guitar, Gunner Schafer - bass and Ringo Funk - drums & vocals. Jeronimo is often tagged as krautrock, but this trio is clearly more in the vein of progressive-like straight-ahead rock. It's likely linked to the krautrock genre because fans of Gila, Jade Warrior and Twenty-Sixty Six And Then would probably get a lot out of the band's three CD's. Heard they have a fourth album out - somewhere but I doubt it's ever been reissued on CD.

Those two lenses are great, this one is a complete dog. Unfortunately, we have been so busy with the other two only recently have we had the need to use this one. The clarity is simply poor at all focal lengths and F stops. Does not matter if hand held, or on a tripod with a wireless flash, it's a dog. Just tried to return it, today is the 31st of May, and Amazon says my return window expired yesterday. Now I'm going to have to deal with Sigma I guess.

Spend the $30 and find yourself an official nintendo expansion pak, be it on Amazon, eBay, or from a local seller.I opened this pak up to see if maybe there was a problem with the heatsink, or if it needed to be repasted, and the \\"heat sink\\" is just a piece of the aluminum casing screwed to the pcb pressing against the chip with a glob of paste in between them.

Shwan's dad working with the police which has given Shawn more challenge to be accepted in cases.Juliet is in the picture and finally they do it, they kiss the longest and funniest kiss and not in the US, in Canada! Where the romance is everywhere.Ep.1 Starts with a Kung-Fu Chinese gangs theme, even the Opening credits you can find the names of the actors written in Chinese, which is funny.Other episodes are all funny, from racing cars to polar bears, you can't even get bored.In conclusion, this series is one of the best on TV and we are waiting for Season 6 and I am sure it will raise to our expectations and even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT","review":"My son is a big Psych fan and has watched this series a couple of times since receiving it.

Season five lost all of this. The little detective work this season has tends to be bumbling with successes primarily coming from luck instead of a clever assembly of the miscellaneous facts.Even worse, the characters seem uncomfortable with their lines like you might expect during the first year of a series. I don't know how that happened after they have been together for five years. Nearly all the personalities have shifted enough so they look and sound like actors instead of characters.In the end I don't know if it was a director change or a writer change or both but I got too bored to watch all the episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the show, dislike what I got...","review":"I love the show, no doubt about that.

I own all the other seasons and never had this problem.If you can get past that, it's great fun, and its gratifying to see Shawn and Juliet finally together.

What kind of ends would said hero be willing to go to in order to satisfy a love so intrinsic to his being IN REAL LIFE?Trust me, if you read the book from this point of view, you're going to want to continue reading just to see how far Heathcliff is willing to go to satisfy his desire.YMMV."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not worth the $5!","review":"I am sorry for even hearing about this novel and i am very upset that it was required reading in my high school.

I had an old Shure Mic and if I use that old power supply adapter, the hum is gone.I faxed Shure about the problem but they will not sent me a new DC power supply adapter and wanted me to send back the power supply with the \\"hum\\" first to check it out. Shure will not pay for the postage.The problem is:- a 12 volt power supply adapter costs less than $10 and if I have to spend over $5 to mail it, it just does not make sense.Right now to get the two wireless mics working, I am borrowing a 12V power supply from my hard drive. So my hard drive cannot work when I am using the two Shure microphones.If it were not the bad Shure warrenty, I would have given the product a 5 star rating.(P.S.

But... the cable that hooks the receiver into a power source has a short in it. As if it couldn't handle a bend? So whenever the cable or recover is touched at all, the power shuts off and back on again. This is my second unit since the first one was stolen from a gig, and the older one did the exact same thing. The second main issue which has led me to purchase a whole other system altogether, is the fact that I can only go about 20 feet from the receiver before I get dropouts and lose signal. 20 feet!

We got it when they were about 18 months old (they are now 22 months old). Our biggest issue is getting them in and out with shoes on. Their feet are constantly catching when trying to get them out and the two boys, who are larger, are much more difficult to get out. Several times my biggest, who is only 28lbs, has scraped skin off of his shins and knees when trying to pull his legs out.

A half hour goes by without even realizing it! She's not very easily entertained so this swing is a lifesaver! The back comes up high to support her neck so that it doesn't snap back every time I swing her and it is very sturdy and durable so that I don't have to worry about her safety.It's also a sinch to clean off.

First of all, the height of the swing is just perfect for me to get hit in the face with my toddlers feet. I haven't actually gotten hit because now I push from the back. The swing is crooked and swings diagonally, which doesn't bother my daughter, but makes it a little more difficult to push. I am not a fan of this swing.

This album was missing the slightly corny sound he had on Go West Young Man. I 2 (eye)is very emotionally moving, especially, for me, the track The Other Side. In this song, Michael is talking to his old friend who he knew before he was Christian and telling him how he has changed. It's haunting. You can hear the desperation for his friend to get saved in the music. Michael's early work, songs like Rocket Town and Lamu, as well as this album, showed his depth as a songwriter. That depth eventually was glazed over as the CCM movement took over and his music became a little predictable. Pretty much everything after Live The Life i haven't owned. He lost the emotional depth that i connected with. Oh well,this album will always represent my early Christian development years, and stand out as his best, most moving album ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"His worst album to date.","review":"The only song I like on this album is Secret Ambition.

It does however have some excellent material concerning the war in Iraq, and the author's ideas on how effective \\"mobile\\" sniping teams can be in modern warfare.If you are looking for a reference work on sniping this is not the book, and others such as Out of Nowhere by Pegler and Sniper by Gilbert are better.

It surprised me how flowing the narrative was in this book, seeing as it was a biography,and autobiography at that. Shooter has none of the long drawn out side paths to the story, nor setting up one part of the characters life, then another. There is a bit of set-up in the form of the first chapter, and some side paths to the story, non longer then a page and most a single paragraph. The bulk of the story focuses on Gunnery Sgt. Coughlin's envelopment in the training and invasion of Iraq.There is the occasional cliche' and the book is as gung-ho as would be excepted from a Marine, but the smoothness of the storytelling and the Coughlin's clarity in retelling events far surprised those rather minor complaints.A quality book all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Shooter","review":"Good true to life story but a little sanitized which is OK since it isn't always necessary to be overly graphic.

To see someone make money off of lies like this is heart-breaking. The public will read this a think it is true and pass this fish story along.

He was a Plt Sgt with 1st platoon and had no sniper duties. The reason he was left behind when 3/ 4 went to Okinawa is 100% BS. He was left behind as the main point of contact for the unit while they were overseas. He handle the Red Cross messages, the Key Wives and other rear party misc duties.

Now I know why - it's really not an easy thing to do. This is the story of Gunnery Sgt. Jack Coughlin, a veteran sniper for the Marines, and Capt. Casey Kuhlman, also a marine. Think about what a sniper does. Apart from being an expert marksman, this job cannot be easy, for many reasons, and this book explains why. Coughlin tells a touching story of his father's work ethic, which he in turn learned, his own passion for baseball, how he was nearly blinded by a sharp stone thrown by neighborhood kids, and how he joined the Marines at nineteen where he discovered he was a great marksman despite never having used a gun before. There's more to being a sniper and his comment, \\"...there is no such thing as a stupid sniper,\\" resonates well throughout the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"There must be better books of this sort out there","review":"This book was certainly a fast paced narrative. Basically, it's a walk through the author's experience in the second Gulf War as a Marine Sniper. I don't particularly think it paints him in glory, and actually found some of his insubordination and whining when things weren't going his way borderline appauling. In places it's as if he's tried to humanize himself by talking about his reaction to certain events and his home life, though the latter gets at best a thin treatment. The writing itself is somewhat forced at times and the language occassionally getting stilted. In general, it was an OK read at best, and even then only if you've got an interest in snipers. I'm not an avid reader of the genre, but I have to figure there are better books of this sort out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted more","review":"I got this book hoping for an eye into the mind and heart and process of the \\"shooter\\", and I sort of got that. But I have to say, his writing style is SO bad that I just could not finish the book. Though some of his stories were interesting, he really is not a writer, nor a story teller. Maybe someone else will be better at getting the story across, this guy was not the one. I applaud his efforts though, and I wonder why the publisher ever released it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shooter Review","review":"Shooter is an excellent book, filled with plenty of real world action, but that is not the strength of it. Shooter puts you into the mind of the sniper, as you attempt to understand the conflict of emotion a sniper endures. When reading through the book, you often have to stop, and remind yourself, that this book is written by real people describing actual events, not some fiction tale typed up by someone who hasn't \\"been there\\".

If you want to kill in a war zone,it is easy, it doesn't take skill. It does however take skill to fulfill your mission, your duties to your men whilst ensuring that no life is taken needlessly. This man only takes life, and I wonder how much was necessary. Did he really feel remorse for shooting civvies or does he feel that is just the right thing to say.

He seems more concerned with looking bad in front of his fellow Marines while at the same time, beating the drum for the mystique(his in particular)of the scout/sniper.He takes many cheap shots at \\"Officer Bob\\" and takes exception to his being awarded a commendation medal and a bump up promotion.Obviously, higher ranking officers must have thought differently than Coughlin regarding \\"Bob's\\" abilities including Coughlin's own CO(McCoy)who could haved disapproved both awards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book by a horrible writer","review":"Seriously? Let's pat ourselves on the back a little more, shall we? I really wish I'd read the reviews on this book before blowing the money on it. As a sniper in the U.S. Army, I've read almost every book on snipers, and this rates as the WORST on my shelf. It was a complete waste of money. I have never wanted to tell an \\"author\\" (if you could possibly call him that) how badly I hated their book until I read this drivel. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, in fact, it should be taken off the shelves. For all of us professional snipers in the sniper community, there's always one or two of these guys who want to glamorize their little insignificant roles they may (or may not) have played in the big picture. Coughlin gives us REAL snipers a bad name with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY","review":"This book is full of contradictions and tales. It well known among Marine Sniper Instructors that the author isnt listed on any of the graduation roles at Camp Pendleton,Camp Lejeune or Quantico. .The self proclaimed title of top rated sniper is joke and insult to the sniper comunity and the Marine Snipers that have done far more and been awarded for there acts to include the Silver Star. Dont waste your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite disappointing","review":"As a former Marine I couldn't wait to read this book, hoping it would be the next classic, perhaps on par with 'Marine Sniper' by Charles W.

Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story. No nonsense.","review":"I personally liked this book despite its sometimes choppy writing style.

Coming from a Military rich family, I enjoyed the book even though my Great Uncle, Who was part of the 506th and despsised the Atlantic theatre marines, taught me to think Army before the corps. However I needed to do a project for my AP US history course and this book hit the spot when it came to the Iraq conflict. In response to other comments about how Sgt. Coughlin was a cold blooded killer, I would like to say that somebody has to do the Job and I think that the Gunny didn't enjoy it, but he was good at what he did and he saved alot of Marines during his tour of duty. The Book takes you to the Roof tops of Africa to the Back of a Humvee and into the idea of the 21st century Mobile Sniper Team idea.

Being in the Army since 2007, I was able to connect with him on a lot of his struggles and completely understand exactly what he was trying to say. I also have experience with people of his type and as a result got a lot of humor out of the book that most would have missed.If you gave this book one star, you have never had live rounds fired at you and have definitely never been immersed in the military culture for months on end.

If you like India Arie's work, do yourself a favor and go get Anthony David. When I first heard 'Cold Turkey' on XM radio, I immediately thought \\"This dude reminds me of a female India Arie\\". Well I did my research and come to find out, they are actually very good friends and also writing partners. He shows up as Tony Harrington in the credits on her CD's. Where her music is more produced (dont get me wrong, I love India), Anthony's music is more raw, like its just him and his guitar. I went and bought the CD having heard 'Cold Turkey' only at that time. Risky move but well worth it. This is one soulful brother with a kinda raspy voice 'a la Anthony Hamilton' that you feel in your bones. I would love to hear him perform live. Anthony, please come to the MD/DC/VA area!!!!!!

I look forward to more sounds from Anthony David in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great find!!","review":"I got this cd after hearing only a sample of 'Yes'. I was more than pleasantly surprised by quality of the entire cd. Anthony's lyrical depth and musicianship and a breath of fresh air - after enduring the mindless drivel that characterizes so much of R&B/Soul music. Anthony mixes it up with a variety of musical styles - soul, reggae and even hip-hop but is all works.

However they discontinued the station, so it was months until I heard it again. When I finally found out who the artist was I had to get the cd. This cd was everything I expected. This guy has a rich and soulful sound. I like several tracks, of course Spittin Game and Cold Turkey, but Cheatin Man is so heartfelt. You really can visualize the story that's getting told. Believe Me, Water/Fire-the flute is on point, GA Peach, and Crooked Cop are great also. I also liked Can You Be A Part of My Life. I actually heard India.Aire's version first, but they're both nice!

Of my hundreds of CDs, I am having trouble finding anything better. \\"SMM\\" is written so cleverly and uniquely that I am amazed that China Drum hasn't landed on any top 10s, or hit it big. Nearly every song is has \\"Hit\\" potential. I encourage giving \\"SMM\\" a try because you don't know what you are missing.

This albumn is faultless, \\"fiction of life\\" is an anthem for the late nineties, \\"Down by the River\\", \\"60 Seconds\\" what a record, and I foolishly thought that their cover of \\"Wuthering heights\\" couldn't be bettered before the millenium, well they've written a whole albumn to prove me wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"The drum are back","review":"When I first heard this record, I was a little disapointed because the last one 'Goosefair' is one of my all time favourite albums, but after a while it really sings through. The opening tracks 'One thing' and 'Guilty Deafness' are not typical China D but convey a more darker side to the band, but not that dark to be not China Drum. From then on it gets more happier and typically China Drum , particularly 'Fiction of Life','All I wanna Be'and 'Down by the River'. The track that makes this album however is 'Stop it all adding up', thisa is one of the best songs I have ever heard. This album is great and a great follow up to the last effort, I can't wait to see what comes next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game.","review":"It's funny to watch the game then and watch a game now, video is so much crisper.

I usually didn't like to read until I started reading the Paige Turner Series. I found this book while shopping with a few of my girlfriends. This book is helarious, and kind of pulls the reader into the story. I loved it. When my little sister--who hates to read unless she has to--picked up this book from my shelf, and read it, she loved it (I thought she was a lost cause). After she was done with it, she read the next book in the series, and now both of us can't wait until the next one is released!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Approach to Mysteries","review":"If you read the two Paige Turner mysteries, I suggest reading this book first and then Murder is a Girl's Best Friend; that's the order they were written in.These are great mysteries set in the 1950's with a feisty young woman writer for a detective magazine trying to solve murders herself. Mercilessly teased by her male co-workers because of her name, Paige Turner takes matters into her own hands and tells her stories in humorous and detailed ways. She has strong character and will plunge ahead in her wild schemes even though she's usually terrified. The thoughts that go through her mind are so charmingly appropriate.The disappointing aspects of these books are the inappropriate uses of the Lord's name, occasional swearing, and Paige's oversexed best friend, Abby. Abby is a cool character except for her 'loose' ways. Nonetheless, the books keep you very interested and you can't help but to fall in love with Paige."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matetsky does it again!!","review":"Amanda Matetsky has truely done it again.

The characters do, for the most part, stay true to the show, and there are many funny clips that are enjoyable. The fun, however, stops here. The gameplay is very poor, and for me, extremely frustrating. It pretty much plays like a low-budget game with poor camera angles, sub-par graphics, and annoying and pointless tasks.

I say that because the way the game plays is not drastically different than other games where you play different levels as different characters.What makes this game fun is how basically all of the characters in Springfield are depicted and used throughout the game.

Since the only reason anybody would really want to buy these DVDs is for the Joe Bob commentary, I consider this a very big negative. Somebody in the quality control department is obviously sleeping on the job at Media Blasters, and with three more Joe Bob DVDs slated for release before the end of this year, I fear for my fellow Joe Bob fans.Avoid this DVD and tell Media Blasters you'll continue to avoid their future releases until they get it right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not much different than Nunsense","review":"The play is good...but I was disappointed that the \\"extra characters\\" were not given new lines.

Otherwise, I'd have never subjected myself to such pulpy drivel. This is awful. The author can't maintain a consistent direction. He doesn't appear to have any idea where the story is going, he just writes it as it pops into his head. He has done a pathetic job researching mental illness, and he creates unrealistic sub-characters and situations. Why this book was made into a movie, I'll never know, but to the credit of the filmmakers, they did a much better job telling the story.

The movie is slow-paced at times but it's an good movie with an interesting plot and twists.I saw this instantly online I believe on youtube the whole thing.I am going to buy it,cause' it's on dvd I've seen and it's not $40-$100 which is ridiculous.Movie is worth watching,one of the better of the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"The spark of life","review":"This book starts out fine as to laying out the different scenarios for life's origins , but one has to read it cautiously because it is filled with the biases of the authors, occasionally lacking a balanced scientific perspective on the origins of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enthusiam","review":"The best thing about Orbiter is Warren Ellis' impassioned forward. I have doubts about the space program, myself. I believe in pure science and exploration, but I can't help but wonder what we might be able to do with that money on the earth's surface, when so many people are so impoverished. Still, Ellis' arguments catch my imagination, and I hope we can afford both.The story itself... well, it's a lesser work. Hard-SF speculation about gravity drives and relativity isn't my cup of tea, though Doran and Stewart do an admirable job of infusing the panels with inspiration and momentum. I feel like the living-spaceship concept has been done too many times for the extended treatment of it here. There wasn't much of a plot or a resolution. As always, Ellis gives us some lovely moments and some great lines, but it didn't add up this time. Stunning cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strange book","review":"I got this book for a modern literature course, and it's a surprisingly good read.

Rich's lyrics are as powerful as ever but as a musician he was so far ahead of his time that because of his acoustical style, I honestly think Reunion Records did not do his musical genuis justice this time. For hard core Rich fans this is a must addition but for those who are more interested in the way a song is crafted I can't recommend this one. I think Rich himself said that \\"Awesome God\\" is the worst song musically he'd ever done and I'd give my arms and legs to have him back among us but Rich's technique and sound improved like good wine with age.

For one thing, how could a girl of nine, so quickly dismiss her family's death and turn to Juan as her new father? She was not a baby. She knew how to speak English, so why did she develop that thick Mexican accent?Royal was so wishy-washey that he almost made me sick.

D+ For this movie!","review":"Let me start this review by listing some things that make this movie horrible!1. Amature acting2.

Some of the dialog is too modern like \\"She has nothing on you\\"!4. Werewolf and werewolves are obvious cgi's5. Stealth and camouflage This wasnt even used in ww1 no longer anytime in the 19th century!Despite all of the flaws and mistakes both historical and technical. I found this to be a movie that is slightly entertaining and I watched it with curiosity.A few tips to the filmmakers of this movie.1. Next time hire actors not random people you pick off the street who want to be a actor.2. Get your historical facts right! Do some bloody research!3. Use better cgi software!4.

My last bokken broke so I got this pair, since I'm a little bit out of money. Didn't expect much for this price, but I also didn't expect it to almost get me killed.Like others said, I kept the black one and used the hard wood one for training. It broke in two and sent splinters up my face, almost piercing my eyes. I was lucky my partner was skillful and aimed higher, else I would have lost my eyes. When we examined the wood it was blackened and rooted to the core. Check the customer image for details.I'm returning this thing even though Amazon might not accept it.

However, being used to fine worksmanship, I was pretty disappointed with these. Both bokkens have lateral curves to them that become distracting when you are at a guard stance. The manufacturer (Made in Taiwan) didn't sand the wood (oak) well before they painted/varnished it so it looks and feel pretty unfinished and the grains stand out. If you're a martial arts purist, don't get this. Pay more and get a better one or make your own. This is basically a curved stick... not that there's anything wrong with that for basic practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality control, returned","review":"The black one looked fine. The natural colored one had cracks on both ends. Some as wide as 1/4 inch. Both bokens were wrapped in hard plastic. I can tell from the way they are packaged that the damage did not come from shipping. So they probably decided that a split end boken (on both ends!) was okay to sell. Amazon really made return easy. Just click on return, and print out the return shipping label. Since this item can not be replaced, I had to return the set and order another one. I will post review when second set arrives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality, badly sanded, badly varnished, moldy","review":"Last year I bought a previous set of two training swords, and I thought I bought the same set again with this purchase. Unfortunately not. There were three problems: (1) they had been shrink-wrapped in plastic prematurely. When these arrived and I peeled the plastic off of them, one stunk from incompletely dried varnish or paint, and the other was covered in mold/mildew and also smelled. (2) They don't have wrapped handles. (3) They were poorly sanded and had a very rough feel to the hand. The one good thing I can say about them is that they were nicely weighted. Oh well, as another reviewer stated, \\"you get what you pay for.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Hoped For.....","review":"I ordered these swords because they looked cool, but up close, there nothing special. First, the swords came WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY late to the point I forgot that they were even shipping to me anymore. Second, they messed up my order by sending me 2 of some hybrid crappy sword between the two shown. Im almost positive that they are hollow and i garrentee that if i hit them against a solid surface with any force what so ever, they will shatter like a glass vase. Not impressed at all, the only good thing about them is that at a distance of about 10 feet, they look slightly intimidating. I wouldent buy these swords again if i could but then again i could have just been unlucky. That's all i have to say, unimpressed, see ya."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two of a perfect pair.","review":"Both items arrived wrapped in shrink wrap, and securely boxed. The guards were tricky to get on but recommend slipping the retaining ring to hold them in place while the clear wrap is still protecting the Bo kens. If you want to get fancy, a small drill to make holes in the retaining ring and the shaft followed with small screws should keep them secured enough to practice any moves you might wish to attempt. They are training Bo kens in the sense that they are excellent weight and balance for your Kata's. If you are looking to do full contact I don't see these as the item your looking for (unless of course you are heavily padded and don't mind dinging the heck out of the swords.), they are more the slow Chi building and control exercises type, combined with a flurry of quick movements while you learn not to hit yourself with the weapon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Perfect.

Absolutely perfect for training purposes.the only downside (kinda) are that the swords are different. the black one is significantly lighter and a bit shorter than the brown one, but thats about it.even with the small downside, i would definitely recommend these to anyone who is looking for high quality, affordable bokken."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but uneven.","review":"These bokken are sweet. I haven't figured out why one is heavier than the other yet. However, they are perfect for your personal progression in practicing swordsmanship at home. If your ceiling is high enough of course. The ONLY con, and this is a cosmetic issue, is that the tsuba on the brown sword does not fit. Yes, you can improvise and reverse the other one for it, but then it is too low on the handle and doesnt give you enough hand space when wielding the sword. Other than that, I love them, particularly the heavy one. Good for muscle development and stamina. I hope you enjoy them too."},{"rating":"1","title":"2��5��","review":"Lasted a week or two. Then the \\"hardwood\\" proke on one made of pine. If you are going to by boken just go buy the polypropolene ones.

The author depends too heavily on Multisim for explaining his work. This is most definately not a beginner's book on components. There are not enough pictures, formulas, and background information for a student to proactively learn. You had better have agood understanding of electronics before attempting this text."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is written in Latin","review":"I agree with Ryan Eggen's description of the book, especially since I am in his class. I, too, am an avionics student and this book is extremely hard to understand. I feel lucky if I can go one page without having problems understanding the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"This is a really tight, interesting book. We get into the characters quickly, and the many interesting things that happen are believeable and fast-paced. I especially enjoyed the word-play between the two 'main women' (don't want to give anthing away here).A good thing to read this summer, then you can work your way through her other books, that's what I'm doing. It's good to read about more 'regular' women, like us, not always the super heros, and how their lives work out and get crazy like most lives. A very good story, with a bit of mystery to chew on."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this book","review":"My mom made me read this book because I expressed an interest in psychology. It was pretty good; I took it to the beach and got laughed at, though. I like Husserl and Hegel too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenology of Perception- Brilliant, timely, everyone should read.","review":"This book is a beautiful bridge for those who still adhere to the cartesian gap theory. seating the phenomenal experience of man in and through 'body'...Merleau-Ponty opens the narrow lens of 'mental' perception to include 'the human'. An important work for our evolutionary reach forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this edition","review":"This is a great work of philosophy that I highly recommend. However, do not by any means buy this Routledge edition. The pages of my copy began to fall out the first day I started reading it. I don't know why Routlege would release classics that are so poorly manufactured that the glue binding can't even hold up to a *single* reading. Total scam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have been quite disappointed with this book. I expected some more depth in getting across what it felt like, and was really like to live in America in the 17th century. Its ver superficial. Another very annoying aspect is that when the author quotes something to back up his points its just another modern writer.I would of expected sources from the timeframe of the history, not just another author's commentary. It comes across to me like something a college student could put together.I expected to read this book and have a real sense of what it would of been like.Its just not a very good book. I had never heard of Mr. Hawke and there was no \\"About the Author\\" page in my copy. So when I looked him up on the internet I was quite shocked that he is a professor emeritus. While reading the book I pictured a thirty year old amature historian as the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"I bought this cd since it has a great Shudder to Think song on it since it is slightly rare and they would not sing the song when they were on tour.

The musicianship is superb. The closest comparison I can make is somewhere between Los Fabulosos Cadillacs and Carlinhos Brown."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Brazilian Music","review":"Karnak is a contemporary group from Brazil. This album is quite a surprise if you expect Sambas and such. Their music takes off on all directions (sometimes at once). For example, the title song starts with a \\"russian opera\\" them launches into a latinized rock guitar riff only to become an upbeat Samba. And back and forth. Karnak uses samples of various world instruments and styles. You'll hear throat singers, asian instruments, arabic influences, all rolled into one. Listen and you decide how to define it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wierd color shading","review":"Very comfortable shoe. But, the color would change with foot temperature. Being that your foot doesn't heat evenly, you would have these dark (very dark) patches on the shoe. Once you take the shoe off, the color would go back to its original color. Don't like them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgiving","review":"I enjoyed the time period and all the historical notes. Though a few times she referred to sending mail by Pony Express. The PE, only survived from 1860-1861. The story takes place in 1876.I would've enjoyed this much more if it was shorter. Though to me Sarah was likeable, she developed into a pathetic character after Addie left her job. Her constant nagging on Addie was annoying. Did she expect her to change in one day? And her depressed way in the end, just didn't fit. Was she depressed because of what her father did to Addie? Or upset because she didn't know how to love Noah?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgiving","review":"I love when I find a book that gets me so attached to the characters that I hate for the book to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Village History","review":"First and formost this history was compiled by a local historian named John Gott. Ms. Evans was brought in by the publisher to finalize the work with Mr. Gott who was quite ill and has since died. Mr. Gott was raised in the area part time because his mother's family was in The Plains vacinity. The books is dilligently researched and offers a fine histoy of a now incorperated town that was never planned. Much has happened since the book was published and a visitor to The Plains, Virginia, will find good food, beautiful shops and a small village atmosphere. Mr. Tom Kee now owns the Rail Stop.

By far, \\"The Big Picture\\" marks the pinnacle of MWS's early years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soundtrack from My Teen Years","review":"In the 90s I listened to this cassette so much I wore the ink off of it. Now it's great as a MP3 album! And, no more worries about wearing it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is ok","review":"i recently reviewed this \\"modern classic\\" in Christian music and was somewhat impressed with some of the work. I think one of Smitty's strong points is that he has always been able to stay with the current popular sounds. Unfortunately, on this album he went a little too far with the then-popular 80's sounds. Screaming guitars, sappy synthesizers, and uninteresting melody lines are the norm on this album. I did like songs such as \\"Lamu\\". My favorite track is the last track because here a truly genius piece of music is displayed - had he only used such originality in his lyric songs, I think I would have liked this album more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very detailed!","review":"Great how-to!

I finally found the settings and changed it to english, but all the alerts and alarms were in spanish still. I got little to no reception. 90% of the day the phone would read, emergency calls only. It feels very cheap like your gonna break it just dialing a phone number. My girlfriend used it for 2 days and i finally threw it away. On the plus side it did come with headphones and lets you download quite a bit of music to it. Also the wall charger was these two thin prongs, but came with an adaptor to fit in regular outlets.

My reasearch into occultism leads me to belief that demons are masquarading as such beings to propagate some lies, therefore I wouldn't put much trust into such revelations."},{"rating":"1","title":"A blatant fraud","review":"Before you buy this book, watch this woman speak on YouTube so you can see how incredibly phony she is. I made the mistake of trusting the user reviews which are overwhelmingly positive and had someone buy this book for me as a Christmas gift. This book is completely devoid of integrity (she talks to aliens but they seem to beat around the bush and try to be as vague as possible) and extremely repetitive. To be frank the book is total nonsense and I regret getting it. There are much better options out there to help you in your search for a more honest accurate version of history.

As a Bible reader and her mention of Cain and Abel's origin of conspiracy and me knowing that Cain and Abel are fraternal twins of Adam and Satan from the original sin of the Garden of Eden, I was highly disappointed.

At the beginning of a couple songs they have a measure or two of a guitar part, but it is always the most trivial part that anyone who can pick up a guitar could figure out (It is literally a WHOLE NOTE \\"fill\\" in some instances - but then they leave out the intro, chorus, and verse tabs). I transcribed more in one hour the day after the CD came out than the folks at Hal Leonard did in the year and a half it took them to publish this.

The characters in this film tell a believable and striking story about how love and passion vanquish doubt. It is also an undeniably refreshing microcosm demonstrating the relevant double-edged sword that homosexuality is in society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep and funny","review":"This is a finely written and acted movie. The situation of the young protagonist, a boy who longs to be a cheerleader, is a direct and compelling challenge to myriad adults in his orbit. It is their varied responses to his quest, sometimes amid their own personal struggles or ideological limitations, that provides so much humor and emotional depth. The boy's mother (played by Carrie Preston)is really the main character in the movie, however. Most of her struggles with work and family are independent of her son's ambition. My own favorite moment in the movie is when she talks to a priest in the confessional. The long, quiet shot of her face as she reveals her doubts and struggles is a precious bit of acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a delight with terrific heart","review":"I didn't know much about this film when I went to see it at the Palm Springs International Film Festival (which I almost didn't get into because it was SOLD OUT).

At times it reads like what I would imagine a Harlequin Romance would be like. The book is just dreadful and completely inappropriate for the target market, i.e., girls from 6 - 12. As other reviewers have stated (thorvald's and RoseFan's take below are spot on), Rose is no longer the self confident heroine but a confused follower. She falls in with the wrong crowd. I guess a parent who is reading along with their daughter could use this as a learning lesson, but the subject is too adult for the bedtime story age child. I suggest you avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"too rushed","review":"Thoroughly charming, but rushed at the end. Having read a previous volume written by Mr. McBride, I realize, however, Rose's life quickly becomes more adult, and thus, less appealing for children. She is just as fascinating as her mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good ending to the series","review":"I've read most of the rose years. The books before this one are interesting. In this last book, I was very displeased. Rose leaves home and boards in a small isolated room which leaves her with no friends. Although she makes friends towards the end, she ends up doing things she shouldn't and loses her engagment with her childhood sweetheart because of her new friends. This book was a disappointment to me after enjoying the books before this. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent portrayal of a young woman...seeing the real world","review":"I think \\" bachelor girl\\" is excellent. It manages to portray an young adult's frustrations and dilemas almost accurately.The way Rose felt frustrated about not doing anything useful, when she lived with her parents and then her struggle to work and support herself...May be this book is not appealing to children as it deals mostly with an young adult's mind...and even the temporary loss of confidence in Rose is perfectly natural as any young and intellectual adult will go through that phase atleast once. I'm very impressed with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"This is the best in the Rose series. Finally we find out what happens to her although the ending is not clear.

I've taken to weighing myself 3 or 4 times in a row and then averaging the results. Even the average doesn't seem accurate. I've had friends weigh themselves with similar results.Given the fairly high price of this scale, I wouldn't recommend it for anything other than a modern decoration for one's bathroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult for those in the high weight group","review":"I bought this scale because it could weigh people over 350 lbs., which at the time of purchase, I was. However, I found it very difficult to use. Bending over to tap the scale hurt my knees. Keeping my feet so close together, as required by the directions, made me rotationally unstable. I had to hold on to a towel rack to not keel over. When you are in the over 350 lb category, you need a wide stance.

It fits in a compartment of a hard case or a gig bag easily.

One of the previous reviews has a response from a 3M representative, saying \\"Please give our customer service department a call ... and we will work to resolve this quickly.\\" That's OK, but I think I'd like to see something a bit more proactive; something that makes me think the next tape that I order won't have the same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Worthless","review":"This \\"heavy duty\\" packaging tape does not stick to anything!

I use this tape to attach PayPal labels to my packages as well as taping the packages themselves. They work very well, and the clear tape allows me to use paper labels rather than more expensive self-stick labels. What I like about this tape that it is not as thin as some other packaging tapes I tried, so it is easier to control - it lays evenly where I put it and does not stick with bubbles or to itself.Given Amazon's excellent return policy and a statement from the manufacturer that they will remedy the problem (posted as a reply to some of the complaints) this product is worth a try. The chances of someone being stuck with bad tape permanently is not an issue.

Seriously, I wish I would have read these reviews before buying the tape, but why should I research reviews of tape before I buy it? I went to the store, this was the priciest tape and said \\"heavy duty\\" so I assumed: best tape!Big mistake. So the thickness is 20 times as strong as other tapes? Who cares if it doesn't stick to simple freaking cardboard boxes! I taped my boxes up one weekday evening, put them aside to move into my storage unit on the weekend, and then come Saturday I see the ends of the tape peeling away from the cardboard! Upon further inspection, the tape just peeled away from the cardboard without even stripping the top layer of paper!

I send a lot of packages to soldiers in Afghanistan. In the past I purchased Tartan brand tape on Amazon and was very happy with it. No, it's not nearly as strong, but it sticks well, and I always make sure I once along the seam, and then twice across the seam (like an \\"H\\") no matter what type of tape I'm using, and I've never had a problem.Also, the cost of this tape is CRAZY EXPENSIVE. No only look at the cost, and the number of rolls. . .but also how much is on the roll.

While this may be a very strong (labeled 20x stronger) packaging tape, it's not much good if it won't stick to the package.I had previously used an off-brand very inexpensive packaging tape and never had any problems with it not sticking. In fact the cheap tape was very sticky, so much so that if you pulled it off the package, it pulled the top layer of the cardboard with it. On the other hand, the expensive Scotch Super Strength tape pulls off any package with no problem. I am using 2-3 times as much tape (criss-crossing it) as I did with the cheap tape. So the Scotch ends up costing me 4-5 times as much. Overall a real reputation killer for Scotch brand products."},{"rating":"2","title":"The timing could not be better","review":"With the approach of another holiday season, having sufficient packaging tape (preferably of the \\"suoer strength\\" variety) is especially important...and appreciated. Members of our family accumulate holiday gifts throughout the year and then, shortly before or after Thanksgiving, begin to gift-wrap and package those to be shipped. This product really does offer exceptional strength and is easily applied. We will be sharing rolls with three married sons and their families who live here in Dallas. In addition to shipping purposes, we have used the tape when boxing up warm-weather clothing after removing cold-weather clothing from the same boxes. In fact, we have dozens of uses for this tape and will replenish supplies whenever needed. For the price, given what it prevents as well as what it ensures, Scotch Super Strength Packing Tape is also quite a bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad stuff!","review":"This tape is strong and clear and doesn't curl up. That I like. But it is very hard to use in a dispenser gun because it is difficult to tear on the blade one-handed.

So pros and cons.Update a few days later: worst tape I've ever used! Yes, it is strong and clear but it REFUSES to be cut in the tape gun. Maybe it is TOO strong! I have to manually cut it every time. I won't buy this stuff.Further update after using it numerous times: I can't believe all the great reviews!

I purchased four rolls of this tape, and so far one has absolutely NO adhesion, and the other I would rate as barely sticky. I got these for a little over two dollars a roll which was a great price, but I would have been fuming if I paid the $6-$7 these cost in retail stores and had the same problems.For a company like 3M, which generally sells some of the best products, to have such a lapse in QC and allow this type of inferior product to hit the market is sad.

The whole point of a tape dispenser and packing tape is to use one hand to hold the box, and the other hand to apply the tape.

So I was drawn to this product's \\"Heavy Duty\\" and \\"20X Stronger\\" labels. I do find it exceptionally thick and well-behaved in that it goes where I want it to and does not move around nor wrinkle very much.But this tape simply does not seem all that strongly adhesive to me. In fact, I am able to tear it off from a cardboard box quite easily with practically none of the cardboard lint coming off on the tape.In general, I look for the best adhesion at a fair price. This is OK adhesion at a not-OK price.

It would be nice if the wrist strap or necklace could fit inside the case...the flip side of course is that the case fits like a glove and protects the camera.

So many artists crank out \\"music,\\" but many of them lack true conviction in the songs. I have not found this with any of Rich's songs.The two I like most on this CD are:1) \\"Hold me Jesus\\" I play this song on especially hard days as a prayer to the Lord. It is genuinely up lifting and a blessing on any day, not just the hard ones!2) \\"Peace\\" Holy Communion has always meant so much to me. This song talks about laying down our masks and coming to God with each other at Communion. When we do, we gain Peace from our Heavenly Father and He reaches down, touches our lives, and sets us free! A very powerful and moving song.I highly recommend this CD.

Smith(no offense to either of these artists) but the real talent for the Christian music industry was found in this man. Next to Kieth Green in talent, he was one of the best in quality of both lyric and sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Color Green","review":"Rich just had a way with words. A humbleness. His lyrics, and even his music, had humbleness about it. A humbleness that gave way to an intense beauty. Not the flashy, showey kind of beauty, but the humble, honest kind. Rich seemed to be who he was in his music very well. And who he was was a great man of God. The songs on this album show that. A gifted lyricist, and songwriter, Rich crafted some of his best work on this album. The Color Green is one of my personal favorites. Hold me Jesus is another. All the songs working together though is what makes this album such a classic. There is no \\"filler\\" here.

And I'm very pleased with the stability and ease of set-up of the Bosch table. Besides, it's less money now than the Rigid and Amazon doesn't sell the Ridgid (not now, anyway). I'll probably have to adapt the miter hole patterns to the new saw frame, but that's minor stuff.

The switch is quiet and the only thing you here when in use is what your supposed to hear... the voice in front of it. I highly recommend this mic if you are trying to stay on a low budget.

Forsyth examines the leftwing fanaticism that was then dominant in Britain's Labour Party and the probabely very realistic possibilty of infiltration into that institution by the Soviet Union . He paints a picturesque setting of all the places where the novel takes us , and added to this is an exciting and fast paced spy novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forsyth's best novel, by far ! (contains SPOILERS)","review":"I've read all of Frederick Forsyth's novels, most of them more than once, and this is far and away the best he's ever done.The plot is very plausible, remember it was written during the Cold War confrontation between Thatcher and Reagan on the one hand, and the Soviet Union on the other.The smuggling a nuclear device into the UK with the intention of exploding it near a nuclear arms base makes for a very intricate series of events.The false-flag recruitment, and the subsequent chase, from London to South Africa, and back to London, with the professional \\"Shadowers\\" team, is gripping.The car and motorbike chase for the Soviet spy throughout England, all of it hingeing on a traffic jam, is one of the best I've ever read, even better than most scenes in movies.Most of all, Forsyth's ability to bring all the threads of his novel together at the end, is unparalleled.Thank you, Mr. Forsyth !"},{"rating":"2","title":"At a pace that draws the reader in","review":"The novel begins with a British informant to Russia who exposes weaknesses in England. The protagonist, a British special operations detective, investigates the death of a Russian infiltrator. His mission is to thwart a Russian coup to subvert the British parliament towards Marxism, by electing a sympathetic to the Left president. This will of course serve to weaken Europe and strengthen Russia. The tide is already moving toward socialism, and the arms race is the answer. There are many plants, but ultimately, the hunt is for the top dog, Russian infiltrator; and the Brits have their own, unconventional spy.Forsyth keeps a pace that draws the reader in. A fascinating read of detective work.True to life here in America; we have(had) avowed Marxists working under the executive.God blessScott"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good entertainment","review":"The book is written in a great style, in a quite superior form to some American best selling authors.I found it a liitle descriptive in some passages but I believe that they will be informative for some readers.

Very much in the mold of Tom Clancy's Cardinal of the Kremlin, this great spy tale by Frederick Forsyth certainly belongs in the same class as Clancy's best. It is an entertaining tale of nuclear threats, a terrorist plot engineered by a faction in the Soviet government, and some great police work by an enterprising British agent who finds himself up against an unknown foe in a game with high stakes. This book is a great read, with a good plot and solid characters. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun, Quick Read","review":"If you are thinking about or are planning a trip to Glacier National Park, I highly recommend buying this book.

The big one was easier to clean out, but the large size kept having food stuck up toward the small end. This cleaning brush worked perfectly! the brush is shaped exactly like the interior of the Kong and once inserted, it cleans out any residue left by the dogs. It works well on the big one, too. The little mini-brush in the handle inserts into the top end of the Kong and frees up anything left there. I was concerned because one reviewer said that the handle broke when using it. I haven't found any problem with it, but I do use it with care after reading that review. The suction cup on the bottom is a bonus.

This is a shame since most Adams recent reprinted works have been pretty good (Deadman collection and Batman volume one). I would think that this is a printing error on DC's part as the colors look too dark for me and artwork gets lost sometimes; I maybe wrong though.What's most interesting is this volume has not been selling in my area; in fact it went on sale not too long ago; the shop had so many these. it may be a neal adams book, but if it's not done right well watch out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will the REAL Batman please stand up....","review":"Okay, here's the scoop.

I enjoyed watching the film as it captures the moods and tones of the book so brilliantly - especially thanks to the excellent acting performances. However, the film's leaving out details such as the summer outing and the sudden going away of the Keaches somehow seemed to distract from the superbly well balanced story conveyed by the book. And I'm not quite sure which style and period the mural in the film would be! A nice film for a melancholic afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth waiting for","review":"This is a beautiful adaptation of a near perfect book, and a long overdue addition to Pat O'Connor's oeuvre of humane films available on DVD.

First, though, the problem with this film is that it isn't completely true to the novel and drops important plot points. Therefore, it becomes rather obtuse. However, it's brilliant for what it is. Read the book and see the film and all your problems are solved! (And the book is so short, it won't take but a moment to read and is well worth lingering over.) The scene that I found the most moving -- one that hasn't been mentioned yet -- is the close conversation between Firth and Branagh in the pub in the village. Branagh is wilting into his beer in a private moment when Firth sees him and joins him at table. Branagh is literally incurably sad and, in a moment of raw honesty, tells Firth why. When he bemoans the futility of war medals, my heart breaks a little bit. His eyes fill with tears and so do mine.Oh, see this film!!! But, read the book first."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stinks","review":"I bought this cd awhile ago thinking it was the real songs, but they're nothing but chessy remakes that sound awful. Its hard to tell that these are remakes until you open it and listen to it since the group...the countdown singers have small fine print on the back.

It has become one of my all-time favorites. Nearly every track is amazing, and most of the album serves as a showcase for Kathy's soaring vocals. It is fitting, and somewhat ironic that her last big push in the secular market ended with one of her best christian songs \\"My Life is in Your Hands.\\" Simply beautiful. This one's a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kathy WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO...","review":"Being a Kathy Troccili fan, I still found it very difficult to get into this album.

The really weird thing about the book is the fact that they are working entirely in triangles instead of quads. It's close to impossible to really see your mesh flow and get proper \\"edge looping\\" in areas like the shoulders and knees, an issue not even mentioned in the book. The models may look nice, but when rigged, they will move like crap. Deformation is not even mentioned and like the above reviews state, all the pages talk about \\"Extruding\\" the edge profile. That's just a start. What about poly clean-up and edge spacing? You could easily trim this book down to about 10 pages. I recommend GAME CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT WITH MAYA(even for max users) instead because Antony Ward goes into \\"deformation testing\\" while modeling a character with proper edge loops."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good for learning low poly modeling","review":"This book has to many vague descrpitions that will leave the reader referencing every other reading material they own in order to figure out what the authors are talking about.

Is it possible for a book to be completely incoherent and confusing during and after reading, but still keep your finger on the next page? Apparently so, as this is certainly not the worst book I've read. It's unmemorable, sure, but John Hawkes at least exhibits a style that's free of the outright pretension that befalls authors like Pynchon and DeLillo.

Ethnic cleansing was used by Serbs in Bosnia to define what they felt they were doing, getting rid of people of the same race who had converted to Islam and, in the eyes of the Serbs, gone over to the enemy side, committing racial treason. Whether or not one agrees with the Serbs, they had a specific meaning for the term.

Too bad this band didn't do more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Band That Really Cooked!","review":"I only ever saw Head Hands and Feet Live once at a pub in North London back in 1970; Chas Hodges and Albert Lee stood out then as they do today and both contributed to this terrific Album. From a really upbeat start with \\"lets get this show on the Road\\" to the whisky swilling hiccups in \\"Jack Daniels old No. 7 to the wistful acoustic \\"Rhyme and Time\\". Great variety, superb musicianship and I MUST get this on CD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chas & Dave live on","review":"One of the few albums I bought on vinyl when it was first released that I have actively hunted down on CD. I feel privileged to have seen the band live just one time at the Lyceum in London quite a few moons back. Excellent production for it's period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter and Rundgren","review":"Good CD. Todd offers up tunes that sound Beatlesque in formula, but would probably have been given to Peter and Gordon to record instead of by the Beatles themselves. (\\"World Without Love,\\" style). The Beatles knew the good songs from the very good songs, and gave away a number of hit singles because they were too syrupy, bublegum, etc. It is this sub-category of the Lennon/McCartney catalog that \\"Deface The Music\\" sounds most like to my ears. The album picks up speed from \\"Take it Home\\" on through to the end though, which leads me to believe that the album should not be seen as an attack against the Beatles (as some reviewers have seen it), but as a valiant yet somewhat flawed attempt to recreate the Beatle magic that has had such an obvious influence on Rundgren's music.Imitation is a very sincere form of flatery, isn't it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did he do this?","review":"Previous to \\"deface the music\\", the Brit group ELO had released a very popular \\"face the music\\" in 1975. Todd considered this to be \\"halfway ripping off the Beatles\\". So, he said, if you are going to rip them off halfway, why not go all the way! So here you have it: Probably one of the greatest tongue-in-cheek albums of all time! It's in the title, folks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sheer pleasure","review":"If this CD doesn't evoke a smile --- or a dozen --- then it's time to hang it up. What a fun, joyous bunch of songs, all clearly influenced by \\"that band\\" ... but all sung and performed with Todd and Utopia's trademark style. You can almost picture Todd and the band giggling and jumping around the studio while they are playing these songs. Maybe some of the Beatles purists will be turned off by these obvious labors of Liverpool love, but if you are a fan of Todd, or just pop music in general, you NEED to get this brilliant and tuneful album. Every single song on here fills me with joy and happiness. And isn't that what pop music should be all about? No deep thinking or heavy analysis required; just sit back and listen and enjoy every fabulous song."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as I remember it on vinyl.","review":"I grew up with the Beatles and became a Todd Rundgren fan over time.

My wife said I should try it. Might loosen me up a bit. I was wary of relying on sandals for daily wear because I've never had a pair I liked much. I don't like the feeling of pretending to have prehensile toes, constantly clinched to hold the sandals in place. I like to be active and sandals never fit the bill. Most of all, I prefer the comfort of real shoe inner soles rather than the hard pan platform of regular sandals. Well, let me say this, these Reef's are the most comfortable properly fitting casual sandal I can imagine. Except for doing chores in my rubber boots, these are my new \\"go to\\" footwear choice.

This wasn't like a one time thing. EVERY TIME THEY GOT WET. Complete garbage for an expensive pair of sandals. It looked like I had a crazy foot disease. An it was hard to wash off. Anyways, I threw the reefs in the trash where they belong and got myself a pair of Kustoms. Cheaper, lighter, more comfortable and NO MORE BLACK FEET. I put up a picture of my stained black feet.

Cannot believe such catastrophic failures from what is supposed to be a good manufacture. I guess that's why I will be going back to purchasing only rainbow or olulukai sandles as Reef has gone gimmick over quality.* on that note, be careful!

Familiar with pro surfer Mick Fanning and being a surfing fiend I grabbed them! I still wear that pair every day as beat up as they are because they're as advertised, \\"Ridiculously comfortable.\\"'Twas time to get a backup pair. The price for these here was extremely reasonable. I ordered the exact same size as the old pair. Tighter more supportive fit than the old ones. Things like dog poo will caught under the bottle opener so you may want to reconsider using it for that [opening bottles, not picking up dog poo]. The arch support is incredible. No chaffing or any soreness after running, walking, or standing for long periods. Simply a long lasting quality product at a good price. Arrived on time, with all tags, in perfect condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"So comfortable.","review":"This is my 12th pair of Mick Fanning Reefs. I don't care about the bottle opener novelty. These are just the most comfy Reef style they make. After about 2 years they go \\"flat\\" so I generally buy 1 pair of brown and 1 pair of black about every 2 years. Be careful with the metal \\"key\\" bottle opener on bar stools, etc. as they will scrape the surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"These have fallen apart.","review":"I have never had a pair of Reefs that has fallen apart so quickly. First the leather lining comes undone on both sandals, then a few months later the nylon part is broken. My past reefs have lasted at least 2 years if not 3. This pair broke in less than a year. I wonder if the manufacturing process has been compromised. My sons Reefs bought at Costco had to be returned after about 2 months because the leather was delaminating from the sole. What is up with Reef?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best flip flop I've ever owned","review":"Great style. Great quality. Super comfortable. Very sturdy. Textured insole prevents your foot from slipping out when wet. I bought 2 pairs. One to wear around the house and one to wear when I go out. I always wear these when it rains. You could swim in these and they will not ruin. The material used doesn't harbor foot odor and its super easy to clean.Never had to use the bottle cap opener on the bottom but its a conversation piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Color slightly off, but still a keeper","review":"The brown trim is a bit lighter in color than what's depicted in the picture. But, my husband still loves these Reef sandals and always requests a new pair once his old ones get worn out. Even though I think using the bottle opener is a little bit gross, we've resorted to using it on several occasions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good flip flops","review":"I purchased these as a replacement for my croc flip flops after reading the reviews. These flip flops are very comfortable and provide much more support than my prior ones. The bottle opener on the bottom is fun, although I've only used it once just to try it out. Overall, I think these are very good flip flops. My only gripe is that I think they are price a bit too high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay attention lots of FAKE reviews!!!","review":"I bought these based on the high number of reviews and high ratings, but I was in for a surprise. You see this sandals that everyone's \\"husband\\" and \\"boyfriend\\" likes so much and that last \\"for 10 years\\" (just check the reviews and you'll know what I mean). Aren't all THAT good.They are a bit large, first I ordered a Size 11 (my normal size) then had to exchange them for a pair size 10. Both times they were shipped fast, no complaints there.The second pair had a good fit, but they make my toes bleed. After wearing them for only thirty minutes or so and some moderate walking around, I had a wound on the second toe on my left foot. The straps between the big and second toe is also quite uncomfortable and quite frankly a bit painful.Overall, I wouldn't call them total garbage, but certainly not that good and not worth the current price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun and Stylish Flip Flop","review":"I bought these flip flops for my husband.

They are very comfortable sandal. So, I decided to buy the same sandal, same style, same size but a different color. These came and they were too tight for my wide feet. Amazon was kind enough to allow me to return them. Do not buy if you have wide feet. I got lucky on the first pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"Reefs come in third place behind Sole and Olukai flip flops. However these are solid performers at this price point and the Fanning is likely their best although not the most expensive in their line. I would like more forefoot cushioning and a better arch design. They take at least a full day to dry out properly when wet. I have about 4 pairs. I still have and own my first pair of Fanning Reef's. They are showing signs of wear but no breakdown. It is a quality sandal and the value/ price point for this sandal is outstanding. I aways buy a full size to half size up in just about any flip flop design. Can't go wrong with reefs. Very durable shoes and I like the air max tech they have in the heel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas gift...","review":"They seem to be of nice quality and matched the pics.

Very comfortable, looks great for kicking around town, and perfect for a day on the boat. Plus, you never have to worry about forgetting your bottle-opener. Also, shipping was quick and painless.

I thought they would be more comfortable but not what i expected. This added to the fading logos make the sandal look like at least 1 year old.I should return these, im thinking. For the price, i definately got ripped off. I bought Adidas sandals in the past for the same price i got these, i still have them since Dec 2007 and wore them until i got these and they still look VERY good but i just thought it would be a good time to buy new sandals, either i was wrong or chose the wrong brand. =( Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best looking cool sandals and comfortable all day","review":"I've had these for 2 years and have done everything from stand at a bbq all day to play volleyball and they feel great.

Having has Reef's before, I ordered a size 13 thought I typically wear a 12 (size up). These are nice, comfortable, and I like them. However, the Xs-1 blows these out of the water and in hindsight, I would get the Xs-1 (more comfortable, drains water quicker, and better arch support). That being said, these are still quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sandals while they lasted","review":"These were very good sandals while they lasted. Mine lasted ~ten & one half months. The outer side strap on my right one became unattached from the sole - all three foci. It looks like they might have been glued. I did get them wet a couple of times. Mine cost U$42.31. I think I should have gotten more out of them than that. I can buy a lot of rubber flip flops for that money."},{"rating":"2","title":"boys love them","review":"my dog chewed up my older sons blue reef fanning's so i replaced them with this pair. the leather on this pair makes them look so much more expensive then the blue pair he did have.

I can't believe that no one commented on this in all the reviews that I read before making my purchase. Did everyone else buy them to wear to the mall off of Rodeo Drive? I missed the window to return these but I will definitely tell everyone I can not to buy Reef sandals. The stupid bottle opener gimmick on the sole of the sandal will scratch your hardwood floors if you wear them inside. Amazon or Reef, please credit my account! I would be happy to pay the shipping cost to return them - far less expensive than a lifetime of therapy after I slip on a wet floor, crack my head open, and end up a TBI patient. I can't believe I paid $44.00 for this scam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Bottle opener on the bottom comes in handy all the time (maybe that means I have a problem) but trust me you'll look like a boss when you pop a top off with your shoe and everyone else is trying to figure out what they can use.

Unwearable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely comfortable, as advertised","review":"I walked twelve miles in my Reefs today. I walked seven miles yesterday in them, and ten the day before. My feet have thick tan lines where the straps are, and not a single blister. My other pair of flip-flops destroys my feet, dying my soles black and cracking my skin. These don't; they're comfortable, even for walking long distances.The only problem is that they can get very, very smelly, even though my feet are traditionally non-odorous.

I read it because I try to read whatever Father Morrow writes, as he is a faithful, clear and engaging Catholic writer. The book was up to my expectations: well structured, with concise summaries of each chapter, and vivid expressions (\\"Don't commit until you commit. And then really commit!\\"). The book provides food for reflection not only for Catholic singles looking for their soul mate but also for anybody else wanting to understand what Catholic courtship and marriage are, and why each spouse is called, first and foremost, to help the other achieve, with God's grace, what really counts in life, i.e. eternal salvation. In this respect, the second chapter of the book, on understanding the real meaning of love, is enlightening. The book is enriched by a sample wedding program and by footnotes that are short and to the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself the time","review":"I am a practicing Catholic a college student who is engaged to another practicing catholic and my advice is don't waste your time on this book.

And the ridiculous sections on pet names to call your husband names such as: \\"You big gorilla\\". What is \\"oversexed\\" is this book! Not only was offended personal but my intelligence was also offended, and my sense of humor. But MAINLY this book does a great disservice to the beautiful Catholic teachings on sex, marriage and family.

And some of the suggestions, frankly, left me scratching my head.I am a middle-aged man who finds himself single again, yet able to marry in the Catholic Church. Little of the suggestions or advice in this book apply to someone my age. And since I was married before, I can say that some of the suggestions regarding married life are more likely to cause trouble than solve it.I suppose a younger person, who is exceptionally psychologically stable and well-adjust and in an environment where there are many \\"dateable\\" people would be able to employ *some* the techniques in this book.

It smells a little like someone's grandmother and it's VERY strong. I also have sensitive skin, so I ended up with a terrible red and blotchy reaction on my cheeks. If you are sensitive at all to perfume in your moisturizer or several different kinds of alcohol then definitely go a different route.I may not have written this kind of review if there had, at least, been any option to return or exchange this item, but once you receive the item, allergic or not, you're stuck with it.If I helped one person be more attentive than I was when buying this product, I'll consider this bad experience a success :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"By far -- my least favorite in the collection","review":"I have the whole collection and I like it a lot, overall. But this particular volume is not recommended.The book centers Mike's character who, in my experience, is not the typical grad student. I could not identify with his plights and behaviors. He is exceptionally lazy and sleepy. I do not think a person like that could survive in real grad school, but the unfunny jokes about his experiences occupy 85% of this book. I can relate much better to themes like Cecilia's frustration with grading and her relationships with her family and enjoy the depiction of Prof. Smith's interactions with his overworked and never prepared student. However, these themes were undeveloped in this volume. Overall, I therefore found this book not funny and not insightful. Other books, particularly the 4th volume, are much more on target and resonate with what grad school experience was for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Can't think of any reason to keep this book.

And it's something to be survived. It is an apprenticeship, in every sense of the word. And let's not forget that being an apprentice to HIS BROTHER made Ben Franklin run away from home.As I read through the strips, it's easy to see different aspects of my own time in grad school, whether it's the pile of grading, the (seemingly) carniverous undergrads, the long hours, the lack of a life outside of the lab. But it's all there.It's important to remember, that it DOES end, one way or the other. And that Ph.D.s are awarded , not to the brightest, but the most determined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very accurate","review":"Having just finished a PhD thesis, I must say I always found J. Cham's strips very accurate and witty. Of course most references are to the U.S. grad system, but it nevertheless applies to international students too.

Brighty and some of the characters in the film are based on real historical people and events at the turn of the 19th century, in fact there is a life size bronze statue of Brighty at the south rim that was donated by the producer.

Its only a description of the methods i mean.. if you are reading about the function echo() you will read something like. \\"ok, you should use echo in this way \\"echo \\"this book sucks\\", echo is for show you some info on screen, or if you are reading about loops, like for.. \\"ok. for is for looping! like 1 to 10\\".. that's it! now you are an php expert!!!.. if there was a posibility to rate this as -5 i would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for novice...","review":"This book shouldn't be advertised as \\"from novice to professional\\", since it start assuming that you have pretty complex knowledge of C++, HTML, etc. The book doesn't even have an ordered structure: when you are in the first chapters, it start using functions that will be explained later, just as if you should know them before.Sometimes very complex, other times it just seems like a big appendix of functions descriptions instead as a guide to use them in real program environment.After reading the whole book, and having it at sight, I tried to create a simple program and it was just impossible, because I learned useless and too complex functions but I couldn't make the simplest program without looking for help at php forums.It may be a good option for not-novice, but if you're looking for a novice book, DON'T buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good PHP introduction book","review":"First off, this book is completely useless to you if you have do not have adequate OOP programming background. It jumps around different topics and does not really explain why things are arranged a certain way. This book pretty much assumes you have knowledge of either C, C#, Java techniques - which makes PHP extremely easy to understand. If HTML is all you have under your belt, this is probably a terrible book to buy.Coming from an adequate background, this book introduces plenty of useful features of PHP and offers a good guide for reference and parameters. Since the book is titled PHP and MySQL, it is expected that the reader should know basic SQL syntax to understand how PHP works with a database.Overall, this is a good starter book on a very broad topic and it has gotten me started on writing my own scripts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too many typos, syntax errors, and gaps in explinations","review":"I bought this book on recommendation. I have a background in programming, and I just needed a book to cement together all the concepts I had picked up in developing PHP apps. Less then 2 chapters in the errors became so frequent in the code that the author no longer holds my confidence. Its hard to be confident of his explanation if it lacks the care to make sure its correct.The writing and explanations, though following a clear format, are at times wildly inconstant in explaining the parts of various functions.

We never hear about them except in the negative. Sally Pipes would never be allowed to speak in our system unless she came with a satchel of critcisms of her own system. That was her ticket - that's how she got on stage. There's a pervasive sort of censorship going on here made all the worse because people in this country don't know how pervasive that censorhsip is.

It has a lot of history before each section as well as descriptions before many of the recipes to tell where the recipe came from and how it fits into Irish tradition. It had the overall effect of making me feel as if I'd traveled to Ireland and visited the kitchens of chefs and housewives alike.The only disappointment was that at least one of the recipes I would like to try is written with antiquated measurements (ie. use two stones of flour).Still, I would highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical","review":"My friend wanted an Irish cookbook, so I began looking around for the perfect gift. I looked at a few options, but quickly discovered that she, being single and on a college student's budget, wouldn't be able to use many of the recipies in most of the cookbooks.Then, I found this one. It still has the nice recipies (from Christmas Cake, a.k.a. fruit cake, to a million and one things to do with duck and game to which the typical northwesterner doesn't have daily access), which will be very handy if she ever has to cook duck.What I like about this, though, is it has the practical, traditional recipies. It has soda bread (multiple types), it has blood pudding, it has buttermilk pancakes, it has soups, it has a Christmas dinner, etc. Because it's Irish, you've got to expect the bacon...it has that, too, along with a few funny stories in each section."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than soda bread","review":"I purchased this book for the soda bread recipes only, not knowing or caring for the rest. The minute I started browsing through the book, I was captivated. Throughout the book there are wonderful images of scenery, historical snippets surrounding the why and when of Irish cooking and delightful quotes from well known characters. Recipes range from the humble or plain (me) to the more fancier dishes (not me). However, I rather think the more I read this book, the more I may stray from my comfort zone and try one or two of the not so plain or humble recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Effort, Overpriced!","review":"While having some good material for anyone considering entry into the Family Day Care business, there is very little information provided which cannot be found in books selling for half the price. The only things I found in this book which was not in three others I have read on the subject were the copies of government forms which might be used by practitioneers once they have opened their home day care business. This does not add the enough value to the book to justify the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Fluffy you could use it as a pillow","review":"I have to admit that I only read the first chapter before giving up. The book starts on the terrible note of misquoting the Rede as 'Harm None'. And by page 17 the reader is expected to say a dedication, dedicating themselves to the Goddess and God for the rest of their lives, before even having a clear idea of What Wicca is.All together a misleading book for beginners and far too shallow for even a moderatly experienced practitioner."},{"rating":"2","title":"For what it is!","review":"I bought The Wiccan Way \\"way back when\\" when I first started practicing. I enjoyed it very much. It is what it is. Its not an indepth, methodical, study of the Wiccan path but it is insightful for the beginner and the pictures (being an artist myself) were very inspirational. I loved the little Puck/Pan sitting on the fence playing his Pan pipes. If you bought the book thinking you were getting alot of substance, I suggest from now on you browse THROUGH the book first. You get what you get...and it is what it is, So I dont rate based on my expectations..I rate on the content!!! The content was a bit fluffy in that it wasnt an indepth study as I said before...but I knew this from the outset....so I wasnt disappointed. :)Puck"},{"rating":"1","title":"nice pictures, but...","review":"If you are Wiccan and are looking to read and learn more this is not your book. There is no depth of discussion in this book, nor is it a very complete accurate beginners book. If you are looking for seasonal crafts and activities this is not your book. There are some cool paintings and drawings, but there are also pictures that look so stereotypical with a barefoot long haired woman in dramatic ritual poses that it is hard to take seriously. I signed on to sell my copy, but there are already copies listed for 1 cent. That sort of says it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am new but...","review":"even I knew evertthing in this book.

Keeps my skin healthy and happy, even against harsh winter weather."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good phone","review":"I like the n75. It has a nice screen, good features, and some cool apps. you can run on it.However, it's not too good for mobile games. The directional button is too close to the music button and it quits out of the game if you press it. Also s60 v3 wont run old n-gage games like I thought it would.The camera is not too good for stills. There is very long delay after you hear the shutter and when the picture is taken. Making action shots impossible and \\"posed for\\" pictures always seem to be after the subject smiles. Video, on the other hand, is pretty impressive.Battery life is not the best on this phone either. But not as bad as reviews lead me to beleive.Music player functions are good. Nokia port instead of standard jack really sucks though. It is a pain to plug things into that thing. Nokia is behind the times in this area.Overall I would recommend the n75 to anyone that wants a s60 v3 phone with music capabilities and doesn't mind the nokia port."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blueberry Hill Cookbook","review":"I have enjoyed reading and using this cookbook.

It's flat, simple, uncomplicated, and might make some women entertain the idea of taking off to the Caribbean with their boss if the chance comes up.Sexual and young."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pretty Good Read","review":"It's a pretty good read.A little bit erotic. Some parts I'll admist made me blush lol but they were very well writtin.Great for a summer read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, no!","review":"The subtitle for this book should have been: How to Ruin a Perfect Premiss for a book.When I read the synopsis for this book I thought 'Wow! A pregnant girl loses her bf but her boss falls in love with her! What could go wrong?'Everything.I skipped pages, forced myself to read it (which is very rare) and with a feeling of defeat, I confess: I put the book down and never finished it (and never will).The storyline is corny, brainless and insulting. The main character, Mandy is a complete loser who doesn't inspire any compassion.Don't even get me started on Damien, her love interest! If he was a real guy, he would be the type of nutcase who stands outside your apartment, in the rain, rocking back and forth, grinning at you while singing a scary little tune.Wanna read chick-lit? Get another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty weak and predictable","review":"I really thought I was going to like this book as I am easy to please when it comes to chic lit novels. This was pretty bad and it had like 4 or 5 sex scenes that literally went on for a whole chapter for each of them. Its like the author couldn't think of a plot or good dialogue and just decided to fill the pages with rauchy sex scenes. I like romance and all but this was overkill - I found myself skipping pages by the third one. It was weak, totally unrealistic and predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute read","review":"This was a great example of Erin McCarthy's ability to add humor to her books and keep the reader entertained. She has the right mix of plot, character development, sex and humor throughout the book. I definately recommend this for someone looking for an entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh Out Loud Hilarious!!","review":"I abso-freaking-lutely LOVED this story. It was hilarious and sweet and steamy. How she did that? I have no idea. I'm not one to really want a funny romance, but Erin McCarthy made this work for me.

You will NOT be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a keeper!","review":"While overtly graphic, this book is wonderful! This is the frist book I have read by Erin McCarthy but I'm hooked now! Short version: Mandy finds herself in a pick (jobless, dumped & pregnant) but her friends help her find a job, where she found love. While this would RARELY happen in real life, this makes this book all the better to get lost in. I'm sure you'll agree...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to like.","review":"The plot was fun, but I didn't like the characters. Mostly the hero in the book. I just thought he was a little bit of a sissy so I couldn't really get into the book. It wasn't one of Erin's better books. At least to me. The plot was fun. The guy wasn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, fun read!","review":"Since I read You Don't Know Jack first, I had to give this book only 4 stars just because, I liked the former better in comparison. Having said that, this book is also a fun and wonderful read. The story was cute, the charcters were fun and so were the secondary charcters. My only complaint was that it wasn't hot like it could have been. Erin McCarthy's men are tender and charming but they are not the alpha males that Lori Foster pens. Other than that, it's a book worth picking up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Crude","review":"I started this book really into it, thinking it would be a great read. And it was, up until the Caribbean trip. The sex scenes were so overly graphic, you'd think a teenage boy had written them. And the characters just got dumb after that. It was really hard for me to finish, and I agree with some of the other reviewers who saw the ending from a mile away. Initially I was going to try some of the author's other books, but this one was unnecessarily raunchy in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor character development, lots of explicit sex","review":"I didn't know enough about any of these people to care if they lived happily ever after or not, but I'm sure they will, despite all the poorly resolved problems they have, because after all, the sex was amazing. A much better read with the same basic plot line is Morning Glory by LaVyrle Spencer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This book was horrible. Jus plain porn with no plotline nor argument at all. It has gone straight to the dustbin, and I could not wait to finish it to do just that (I tend to give the books a chance up to the last page in case they improve and have something to tell, this was not the case). This is not a love story or a comedy, it feels fake, and the characters have no depth. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick, Fun, Hot Read","review":"I just found out I am pregnant, so I thought the topic of this book came along at a good time. Mandy has just found out she's pregnant, broken up with her boyfriend (the father) and sold her business. She wants to find a stable job with health insurance and take the best care of her baby that she can. She does land the job...but just barely! After puking her way through the interview Damien \\"Demon\\" Sharpton he decides to hire her. Now, she just has to avoid him until she's ready to tell him that she's pregnant.This story is really cute and fun to read. It is semi-predictable, but in a good way.

A much better book, with practical help in the renovation process, is \\"What the Experts May Not Tell You about Building or Renovating Your Home\\". Similar titles, but while \\"What No One Ever Tells You\\" is full of anecdotes, \\"What the Experts May Not Tell You\\" is full of concrete and practical, step by step processes for handling renovation as an owner, including insights into relationships between the parties (owner, contractor, architect, inspectors, lenders, etc.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Money","review":"If your looking for practical advise on renovating, this isn't it.

It's a book about when, where and what to remodel. It's about permits and contractors. It's about what a remodel will gain you when you sell the house. It's about the real world, not the world you see on the remodelling shows on television. It's about what you can do yourself, and what you want to get done (unless of course you're an expert).This is not a big book, and it isn't expensive. Before you even think about getting started on the big project buy it and read it carefully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remodeling sound like a pleasure cruise?

Do you think your upcoming remodeling project is going to be executed according to the carefully laid plan that you've spent eons putting together?If so, then I would recommend this book, it will help ease you into some of the realities of home remodeling. You will get the opportunity to read about people who planned, and budgeted, and then found that much of their work was for naught for a variety of reasons that you probably haven't thought about. But that doesn't mean it can't be fun, just be aware.If, on the other hand, you realize that no matter how carefully you plan, the plan will be changed, and that no matter how much you make sure to budget for, the budget will be broken, then I would give this book a pass, unless you just want a good chuckle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good stories but no help if you're remodeling","review":"This book has some interesting stories, but there wasn't a lot of practical advice.

It is a collection of late 80's to mid 90's cliche metal complete with unoriginal lyrics and music.I respect Uriah Heep for the excellent music they made in the early years of their career but just don't feel they have adapted too well in maintaining a fresh sound. True fans of the band and those who loved the metal sound of the 80's to 90's may still enjoy this but I'll stick with Demons and Wizards and the other albums made in that period to appreciate the Heep sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uriah Heep alive and well in the nineties","review":"Heep's 1995 album, currently being released in limited quantities in the U.S., is being hailed as the best effort since the band's classic days of the early seventies, and with good reason. The current lineup has lots of exeprience and use it to create masterful hard rock. \\"Mistress of all Time\\", \\"Spirit of Freedom\\" and \\"Love in Silence\\" are all stunningly beautiful, exemplifying the kind of power-ballad that this band has always done so well. However, there are a good dose of harder rocking numbers to show the band aren't all light and no shade. Great album. Although the days of Demons and Wizards and The Magician's Birthday are long gone, this is as much as a Heep fan can hope for from the boys in the nineties."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST","review":"This album has to be one of the best Heep has ever put out! Having been a fan for a long time, this album is so \\"mature\\" but still rocks. Phil Lanzon and Mick Box are a great writing duo a la Box and Hensley. It took a few albums, but they are at that point now. Standout tracks are \\"Against All Odds\\", \\"Time of Revelation\\", \\"Logical Progression\\", \\"Fires of Hell\\" and \\"Dream On\\". The latter being the best ballad that I have ever heard. The follow up \\"Sonic Origami\\" was given 4 and a half stars. This one gets 5+! I would recommend it to any Heep fan, rock fan or prog fan. The song writing has caught up to the musicianship finally-AGAIN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rediscover Uriah Heep","review":"This is the first Uriah Heep original music that I have bought since Abominog came out 20+ years ago. What fantastic music that they have recorded. While this was released in 1999, I just purchased it recently. The harmony is better than the golden years of 1970-1976. Looking forward to their next CD which is currently being recorded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipes sound great but ....icky poo!!!!","review":"I am also stunned as is a previous reviewer over all the great reviews of this book. It was given to me as a gift and I was so excited when I got it. I found a bunch of terrific sounding recipes and flagged them to try them out. Needless to say,almost every main dish recipe has turned out HORRIBLE not matter how good it sounded!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also, not too healthy.The desserts are OK but really, we don't eat dessert for dinner. Anyhow, I thought this book was a bit deceiving...also, it's not THAT fast. A better book is Cooking Light's Superfast Suppers so I would suggest that for healthier and more tasty meals."},{"rating":"2","title":"A VERY SIMPLE COOKBOOK","review":"This is a very simple cookbook with mostly very simple recipes. I don't like time-consuming recipes, so I love this book. Most of the ingredients are stuff you will have already in your pantry. It also has a lot of interesting information about cooking in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I recieved my copy of this great book 2 days ago. I have read through it and everything sounds wonderful and easy to prepare. So far, I have made the Spaghetti Cassarole and the Beef Stroganoff.

You won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I made a lot of these dishes and never had leftovers.","review":"This is a great book with the taste of homemade.

Easy reading andcooking!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for a busy person....or anyone!!","review":"This book is an absolute godsend to a time pressed kitchen-phobe like me. It has made making and planning dinners easier and <gasp!> FUN!! The Dinner Doctor is just what the doctor ordered for everyday people to make great meals with simple items from the store or items that you already have on hand. I devoured this book when I got it, even my husband was excited about dinnertime again! I highly recommend this book to anyone who works and even those who do not. It has definitely taken everyday food items and made them exciting. And the recipes are easy to follow and in plain english. Anne Bryn also offers helpful tidbits, humor and substitutions along the way for those red meat, cream and butter phobes like myself. In summation--GET THIS BOOK...you (and you family) will be glad you did!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This AMAZING cookbook will be your new kitchen Bible!!!","review":"I didn't have very high hopes for this cookbook when I got it as a gift. I thought it would be unimaginative, uninspired, or at best contain ideas that I probably could have come up with on my own. BOY WAS I WRONG!! Every recipe in this book is interesting and mouthwatering. The dishes are a lifesaver when you are pressed for time in the kitchen. Believe it or not, even your kids will like them!The only reason I didn't give it the full 5 stars is because the book didnt contain a nutritional breakdown for the recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at best","review":"I really tried to like this cookbook but the recipes are hit or miss at best. Mom's pot roast with Vidalia onion gravy was a different spin on your every day pot roast. The Souffleed Sweet Potatoes were excellent but the other recipes were awful. The recipes were both bland and time-consuming. Popcorn Soup sounded like a fun idea until you are eating soggy, tough popcorn in your corn chowder. As for the Southern Cranberry Salad, suffice it to say, it was thrown out before my guests could have it for Thanksgiving.For a cookbook, the layout of the book is poor. There should be concise instructions for the cooking part. In this book there is so much extraneous verbiage on the page that it is difficult to follow the recipe. In all, a good premise with poor execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money to buy her cake books","review":"I LOVE her cake mix dr books but hate this one.

With all of the pre-washed salad-in-a-bag available now, these recipes make preparation a snap. I like the variety, and of course, the easy and quick preparation. She has included a nice palette of flavors to help get me out of my salad rut! I do, however, wish there were pictures to provide serving ideas. The way food looks is important to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Useful","review":"I cook constantly for my family; I find this book not very helpful. It is supposed to be tailor-made for someone like me, I suppose, who could use some easy, quick recipes for those uninspired evenings when dinner looms. But I find that these recipes call for ingredients I would not have on hand, and the shortcuts are off-putting. You need so much grocery-store-prepared food to pull these recipes off, it seems. I'd rather cook simply from a few scratch ingredients. Besides quality control issues, grocery-store-made foods are expensive. And usually pretty bad health-wise (salty & sugary.)I was given this book as a gift and I have enjoyed reading it, but I find it wordy and overwhelming. I don't find it practical, or very enticing. I made the angel hair pasta with roasted red pepper sauce (p. 272) and it sorely needed salt, more moisture (I used chicken stock) and Parmesan cheese to bring it to life.I'm sorry, but I think this book will be in my next give-away pile."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent recipe book for home chefs on a time budget","review":"Expertly written by Anne Byrn (the nationally known \\"Cake Mix Doctor\\" and author of a number of bestselling cookbooks), The Dinner Doctor is a time and money saving guide to creating delicious meals on the go utilizing convenient supermarket foods.

An excellent recipe book for home chefs on a strict time budget, The Dinner Doctor is a welcome and practical contribution to any kitchen cookbook collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that quick","review":"This book purports to give us QUICK and EASY recipes. I just received this book through amazon's used books and I'm highly disappointed. Most of the recipes that sound good to me ask for ingredients that I don't necessarily have in my pantry stock. That means one needs more planning for the recipes, shopping for specific ingredients, etc. - which means they aren't that QUICK."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I thought the Cake Mix Doctor by this author was just great. How could this book be such a dud? I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book will make you reach for the takeout menus","review":"I like the dessert-related Doctor books, but this book did not appeal to me at all. In fairness, I cannot say if the recipes were good or bad because I didn't actually cook anything in this book... none of the recipes appealed to me enough to do so. Most looked boring or unappetizing... is a recipe for pork fried rice really necessary? Poppy Seed Chicken Casserole sounds yucky. Despite the book's substantial size, there are not that many entree ideas which is what I was looking for. There is a chapter devoted to pastas, but other books such as While the Pasta Cooks have much more appetizing recipes that can be prepared quickly from fresh ingredients. A big section of the book is devoted to desserts, which is territory already covered by Byrn's other Doctor tomes.People with busy lifestyles would be much better off using quick and healthy recipes from Cooking Light or some other publication. Byrn should stick with desserts."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Christmas special gets better and better with age!","review":"I remember watching this film as a child and thinking that it moved a bit slow, especially when compared to the Rankin & Bass Christmas specials. Unlike R & B specials it has no evil villain to fear or hero to cheer for. The songs were not as catchy either.However, now as an adult I seem to enjoy the laid back simple story. The songs are good and I like the introduction and ending with live actors. I think what makes me appreciate this special even more are the so called Christmas specials that are produced today. I have children of my own now and neither they or I like what we see today. Thankfully they also like the Christmas specials I remember from my childhood.This Christmas special is not aired that often anymore and it seems to drift in and out of availability for DVD and VHS purchase. If you see that it is airing on television you may want to record it as it hard to come by these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this cartoon!","review":"My brother and I loved watching this when we were kids.

Horrible DVDR (copy) missing scenes and poor quality.","review":"I don't know how they are getting away with this, but it's not a real DVD. It's a cheesy copy in a poorly made case and laughable art. The thing skips and when you finally get it working, you notice the entire section with the real Ranger is missing and the end is cut short, with sections just gone. The release is inexcusable. It's a film in public domain, so that means anyone can release it I guess.

But one flash from her defiant green eyes in the rearview mirror soon put him in a better frame of mind. The Houston Billionaire liked nothing better than a good challenge, and when it came in the shape of a feisty Texas tomboy called Michealann Frazer, it was enough to make his blue blood run red."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now made in China, and not made well","review":"I decided to buy this toaster after seeing a review stating that it's an excellent, made-in-the-USA product. When it arrived, my wife immediately pointed out the made-in-China logo. Well, the new manufacturing plant doesn't appear to be able to build this product right. When we first started using it, it seemed like the five darkness settings were: 1-warm, 2-toast, 3-burn, 4-carbonize, and 5-self-clean. But within a few weeks it started to toast less and less, so we had to turn the knob higher. But then it started to produce more-or-less random results. The other problem is that the darkness fades from left-to-right across the bread; it seems the heating element is stronger near the controls than at the far side. The only plus to this toaster is that it lifts the toast up high so that it's easy to remove; otherwise this would be a one-star product."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lemon","review":"I bought this great looking toaster back in June of 2006. I first noticed that it toasted darker on one side (when not on the bagel setting), but I was willing to overlook that \\"problem\\". After just a few months of use, the lever pops up after a few seconds and I have to push it back down 2 or 3 more times in order for it to toast my bread. Back to West Bend it goes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"We are very disappointed in the peformance of this toaster. The bread will toast good on the inside but barley on the outside. I sent email to West Bend and was told the maybe the bagle switch was stuck--no help.

FYI"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toaster","review":"I was in the market for a new toaster to match my new stainless steel kitchen and when I saw this toaster from West Bend I fell in love right away. It's sleek and the brand name is not large so it doesn't take away from the toaster itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"First of all, I try very hard NOT to buy Chinese goods. The ad for this toaster led me to believe it was US made. NOT! I plugged it in, and it stunk like burning plastic. OK, it's brand new, so I'll try a few cycles. Then some more. Still smells like burning plastic. I complained to the seller, no response. I complained to Amazon, they got the seller to refund my $. They didn't want it back, so in the trash it went."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not toast well","review":"This simply does not toast very well. I was very disappointed that this West Bend appliance, despite its nice construction, good design (the controls are right on top) takes a very long time - on the highest setting - to only half way toast whole grain bread, which I must then re-toast. If all that you make is toast from light, white flour breads it may be okay.Another problem: the toaster's power cord is very stiff - it is supposed to be an 'industrial rated' cord, a good thing perhaps, but it is so stiff that it will push the toaster around on your counter, and toaster will not sit flat unless you wrestle with the power cord. I put my toaster away when not on use, so this is a real annoyance.."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Made in America","review":"I purchased this item and it came in....the item is listed as being Made in China.

(Our first toaster lasted 25 years.) I also like the rather neo retro style. The outside of the toast is a little lighter than the inside so I just put the peanut butter or marmalade on that outside. Problem is solved for me.

This was supposed to be a big comeback album, but the deal with the record company fell through. The tracks here are great. Into the Rising Sun, In the City, and of course Paradise; these are among the band's best. The guitar work on Law is a bit Guns and Roses like compared to the band's other work. The sax is barely noticeable, but good songwriting makes up for it. The one point where the album falters a bit is that songs like Chemical Head, Burnout, Killing Ground, and Krystalize are kind of lacking in the refrain department, normally a strong suite for Kirk. The songs are still impressive for the most part, with great melodies like on When the Bull Comes Down, and good lyrics like on Killing Ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this man a prophet?","review":"This is Kirk Brandon back to his cheeky best. I bought this album by mistake, when trying to purchase a book about voyeurism of medieval poets (hence only the four stars). Even so, I have been quite chuffed with this happy little accident.On track 8, Spear of Destiny have a song that has never sounded so relevant as it does now (Babylon talking). As many will know, Babylon is the old name for Baghdad, and that has certainly been talking recently. Similarly, track number 11 is Captain America. And we all know who's boss now. Track 12 is \\"chemical head\\" (warhead, more like) and 14 is Burn Out, evoking pictures of oil fields burning. Really, this is the Nostradamus of all albums, spookily predicting the current Gulf War at the same time as using a clever acronym in its title. What more can you ask for? (A good voice and nice tunes would have been nice, but perhaps it's churlish of me to point out the chinks in a prophet's armour.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awfully Disappointing","review":"Unfortunately, this turned out to be a wasted opportunity to describe and analyze the actions of a critical leader of Turkey. Ismet's genius was in temporing Ataturk during the transformation of Turkey, but also guiding Turkey through WWII and the creation of multiparty politics. Too bad none of those actions were even described in this work. Apparently this author proceeds from the premise that words are more important that actions. In an age of euphomism, the critical reader will see that all sorts of actions can be sheilded or \\"spun\\" with just the right speech. Whether that occurred with Ismet is not regarded. Too bad. We will have to wait for someone else to take up the challenge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Time Us3 Fan","review":"I have been a fan of Us3 since Hand on the Torch came out, and I have to say this cd is an utter dissappointment.

READ -Nellee Hooper sucks- The best of the worse is \\"thinking about your body\\" remix. It at least sounds different than the original. You want something cool from Us3?

Most of all, I find Motorhome enjoyable reading.

My favorite is \\"Blessed Be The Name (from Job).\\" This CD has truly inspired me to press in to a deeper and more meaningful relationship with Jesus. It's great that jazzy music that is well done can draw you by the Spirit of God. Don't underestimate this CD, it is mightily anointed and I can't say enough about it. I like it very much.Thanks Brent for bringing your talent to the Christian music world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a great and talented musician","review":"I suspected, but was not sure, when I bought this CD that it was Christian in focus. I generally do not tap into this genre (Amy Grant excepted) as I feel it can be too saccharine, but this is such a fine album musically, with such crisp, clean production, that I cannot help but listen to it repeatedly. To be completely honest, I feel a little disappointed that Bourgeois has chosen to limit himself lyrically to this genre, because he gets no radio play (at least in my region) and no one knows how great his musical talent is! I actually thought he had completely stopped recording (his 1990 self-titled release is one of the best albums I've ever heard). I am so relieved to read, in the other reviews, that he is still in the music business. Do another album, Brent! Best track: Blessed be the name (from Job).

The beat is usually simplistic on early albums, but these guys seem to accelerate into the changes. 'Tripping' instead of trippy. Which is good. That said, the production on the vocals is off. Fuzzy, in an irritating way. Songs like Change of Mind, Blown Away and Brown-Eyed Pickle Boy are better because they allowed the vocals to occasionally break through. Miles and Miles of Pain is best because they slowed down and boosted the vocals. I'm harsh on this CD (2 stars) because I rate based on how often I figure to listen to it, and in this case, not often. I'm really hoping their final work, Tripping Daisy, is re-released or comes down in price because I like what I've heard from it.

It would not hold a charge for an hour. I was not able to take pictures for two weeks because I was on a raft trip down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. I checked the return policy.

The genuine Canon NB-4L, as many should know, performs very well and doesn't necessarily warrant a review. But like many buyers here, I too received a counterfeit Canon battery. I received mine in the white/red Canon package, looks very genuine. But once opened, I could see that the battery itself was scratched and looks used. Compared it to my other original NB-4L batteries and it completely looks different. I can clearly see that the plastic housing was made of some cheap plastic unlike the original Canon ones. The connector pins were not in the same spot and were bigger to accommodate that fact. And the printing on it was a bit blurry and faded. I took it to my local BatteriesPlus store to get a second opinion, one look and the guy was convinced it wasn't a genuine Canon battery.

The impression is that the film was intentionally made to worsen the viewer's life to somehow even the playing field of all human existence out of some sort of morally relativistic sense of justice. It doesn't. Whether the film-maker had this intention or not makes no difference. The end result is inhumane garbage. The act of creating suffering or pain for another person doesn't guarantee any kind of revelation on the part of the one enduring the pain. I understand the value of shock. I understand our need for art to wake people up. I agree that our world is often relentlessly harsh. But no matter how noble the intentions, this film makes things worse.

This film is arthouse in that it's non-linear with fast-forwarding and tangentially related images popping up everywhere. I never read Sartre's \\"No Exit\\" but in the way that the three main characters seem trapped in a space, I wonder if that book was the influence.

This is an advanced reference with very few examples, but it covers topics that you just can't find anywhere else, and furthermore, presents the topics in a detailed, to the point, lucid manner.There is no better RMI book for the advanced RMI developer who is wishing to learn the \\"under the hood\\" workings of RMI."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a medical journal","review":"I can't discourage this book enough.

Some of Michael W. Smith's Best Songs came from 1985 and earlier..... but he very conspicuously ignores those songs, which I think is rather odd. (And the Friends version is a remake from many, many years later... not the original Amy Grant/MWS version from this time period.)Just off the top of my head, he left off Wired-for-Sound, Rocketown, Hosanna, I Am Sure, I'm Up, Restless Heart, Could He Be..... ALL major hits on the 1983-85 charts. Perhaps he should have used TWO discs instead of just one disc to cover his first decade, so that he could more accurately represent his Discography. As it stands now, a proper title would be \\"1987-93\\" since the early years are so poorly represented.Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a permanent marker for your blackboard","review":"This chalk is extremely difficult to erase, at least on a Quartet porcelain-on-steel board.

Yes, I could have picked it up and put it away, but that just didn't happen most of the time.Thought if hotels had these wall mounts, then they might be available out there. We have purchased three of these for different bathrooms, had them for quite awhile now and never had an issue with them failing after a few months. Easy to mount.

The main problem I have had on EVERY one is that the small plastic side pieces that hold the dryer into the wall mount will eventually crack and break off. This will cause the dryer to no longer securely attach to the wall unit. This was mentioned by other reviewers as well, so it is definitely a design flaw. Otherwise, it is a good little appliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"good thing we kept the old one","review":"got this Conair Wallmount hair dryer about a month ago to replace the one we had for about 15 years that finally blew up. It's the most convenient dryer you can own. Didn't even have to replace the wall mount bracket. New unit was exactly the same as the old. But - gotta say I'm really glad we kept the old unit. The rear filter screen on the new unit fell right off out of the box. The 2 little tabs that snap the screen onto the main housing were like melted smooth and could not be fixed. But the screen on the old unit was an exact match. So - snap-off, snap-on, and viola, back in business. Lucky for us. And Amazon. Or they'd have to pay for an exchange. And we'd be stuck using a clunky, 10 pound albatross dryer for bout a week or so. Amazon's delivery was 1-2 days quicker than I expected. Good price too. Oh, the built in night light is real handy too. Worked great for at least 15 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great but does not hold up!!","review":"I purchased two of these dryers. One dryer glowed red hot after 8 months. I threw it out. I purchased another one and the plastic tabs that hold the dryer on the base broke. Customer service was horrible!!! They practically accused me of breaking it myself. The representative said that she owned one and my problem never happened to her. Anyway, after calling back I spoke with another woman who said to mail the dryer at my expense($9.00) and they would send me another dryer.

The story line hinges on one of the characters behaving in a way that is highly unlikely and to put is plainly -stupid. There is also doubt that the villain would be able to behave in the manner described. I won't go into further detail for fear of spoiling the book for others. Despite all this, there is nothing special about STILL LAKE. There is little that is original or remarkable. As far as suspense, I had no trouble whatever putting it down and was never caught up in the suspense.Anne Stuart has done much better in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story","review":"The mystery is easy to figure out but that's okay because the story is mainly about the developing relationship between Sophie and \\"John Smith\\".

The 75's were retired when the wires had broken right outside the plug, the self-tangling cords were an irritant, too much twist, too sticky! but they had survived ~500 uses. So I'd assumed that these would have the same size transducer cage and roughly the same fit , but apparently not. the OMX-70s have a larger metal cage and won't go into my ear properly even with the ear clip's rotation, extension and springiness .

I should've returned the item at that point. I didn't, and over the next 45 days the right earphone followed suit. Also, the rubber rings around thephones fell off and were lost.These may be common problems with earphones, but at $40.00 this is a terrible value. My $7.00 Sony earphones sounf as good and have not shown to be as fragile."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Never Received my order.....","review":"Hi guys.

I bicycle three to four hundred miles a week and have found them all day comfortable and great sounding. They don't stick too far into the ear as to obstruct all outside noise, which is handy to hear traffic. They even stood up to a few pretty heavy showers during rides. Works for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great, not horrible","review":"I try to use these for running, but not good. The design prevents me from running the cord down my back and staying put on the ear. It only stays in place when the cord is hanging down my front. The sound is poor. These are not as good as the apple ipod headphones these replaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"My recommendation is not to buy these","review":"The arms that go around the back of your ears are too soft/flimsy to hold them in position, and the earbuds are a little too large to fit into your ears (my ears are average) so they do not stay in place.It's annoying to have to reposition your headphones during athletic activity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones but not very loud","review":"I bought these headphones for running. They are wonderfully comfortable...to the point you can forget you have them on. Honestly, who cares that they're green, they're headphones, not a fashion statement. The little arms that go behind your ears are very soft and flexible. I did not realize that when I bought them. Super comfortable, I really can't say enough. I've even worn them to bed listening to an audiobook. The one drawback is the volume. Even if you crank it up to max is about half of my sony earbuds. That is okay for audiobooks, and it's great if you're running. It's good to hear noise around you ie cars or rabid animals. But sometimes you just want to crank up that music and go deaf for a little while, you really can't do that with these. There is no such thing as loud on these earphones. So YES buy them, but don't throw out your spare loud obnoxious ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound but a little difficult to fit over the ears","review":"The headphones are great. The sound is great and I love the color. Only slight problem is the way the earpiece sits into your ear. It takes a bit to get them to sit in place. But maybe they will get better over time with all that extra sweat they will be subjected too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try before you buy.","review":"I guess the title says it, but it's impossible when you buy online.Anyway, I got these headphones 6 months ago for working out, mainly cause they are waterproof. I really like the behind the ear design. But these don't fit at all. Not sure if my ears are too big or too small, but the only time they work is if I'm sitting perfectly still. You can forget about working out and running is out of the question. Even when they don't fall out, they fill like they are.The sounds quality is OK, but the bass is really lacking.I'm sticking with the Philips SHS3200. They usually stop working every 4 - 6 months, but they only cost $10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"After hearing good things about the sound quality, I broke down and bought a pair of these. I usually run with similar Sony headphones available at one-third the price. Sound quality was marginally better with these, but I was severely disappointed to find that within thirty days of moderate use, the outer insulation cracked and separated at every contact point: at the plug, at each earphone, and even at the Y splitter. For the money, and as \\"sports\\" headphones, this material should be tougher and more flexible and not prone to tearing like this.Fortunately, the seller refunded my money without question or hesitation. But it will take some convincing to get me to try a Sennheiser product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, great afterservice but has failed twice","review":"Sennheiser product quality is well known and respected. Therefore, I cannot understand why within eight months of use (workouts on bicycle, Ellipticals, Treadmills)I continue to have failure problems. First one side goes out and then the other.

I would strongly suggest looking at an alternative.The sound quality is good which is typical of Sennheiser, but they have to improve the materials to justify the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, horrible fit!","review":"I thought that the over-the-ear design would be the way to go for a pair of gym earphones, but I've found that it's more of a hindrance than a help. The ear buds always come out of my ears - sure, the over-the-ear arm keeps them sitting ON my ear but without the buds being right into your ear canal, you get no bass. This results in a very washed out, tinny sound.If you hold them in your ear (or if you're not moving), then they sound great - but unfortunately, my experience (over about six months) is that they just don't fit properly. The over-the-ear arm puts the ear buds at the wrong angle, which makes them pop out. I suspect the twist-to-fit MX75 ear buds -Sennheiser MX75 Twist-To-Fit In-Ear Stereo Sport Headphones- would be a better purchase.I would not buy these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate them","review":"I tried these out for the sole purpose of running - terrible fit. I spent half my time running trying to get them to fit securely and comfortably in my ear. The feel like they're constantly going to fall out of place. The sound was okay...until today when the left earpiece completely stopped working, after all of 2 months of use. They are going in the trash today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable, great fit - best I've found","review":"I run an hour a day in all weather. I've tried over 20 brands and styles of earphones for running. These are the most comfortable, most stable fit I've found. In winter, simple ear buds with a hat to keep them in place are good, otherwise these are waterproof and the best I've found. Sound is good too. They come with a clip, convenient case and three alternatives for fit. I just ordered a second set."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good fit for small ears","review":"I just bought a pair of these and took them out for a run and I couldn't get them to stay on comfortably. I have pretty small ears and have trouble with the over-the-ear style but I thought because these were adjustable they would work. Not the case. Sound quality would have been ok if the speakers would have stayed in my ears. The buds were also hard and not comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy","review":"I use my headphones while running.

The price was perfect, right in my budget. The part I like best is how they stay on my ears with the hooks that go behind so that I can move around. The sound quality is fine - I'm not a fanatic - you could spend way more and get better, but these are just great for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor wiring","review":"Wiring became exposed within first 2 months... to bad because the sound quality was pretty good.I wouldn't but these again because of the poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"Long time runner here, these were terrible. The fit was mediocre even with the so called features. Not even close to good sounding compared to a 5$ head phone. Stay simple, skip these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice in theory, but not in reality...","review":"Product would sound fine, if it would stay in or anywhere close to the ear canal. But it really doesn't. The 'adjustable' ear pieces really aren't that adjustable, only in moving the positioning up or down about 1/4 of an inch. There is not much flexibility in these things and they don't feel that great in the ears. I bought them for running and the stay on the ear, but again, no where even near to being in the ear and enjoying what you're listening to. Another thing, if you wear glasses, these are NOT for you. Do not buy these as they will not work at all around your ears and the frames of your glasses. Even with my glasses off, they weren't really that good. I bought the v-moda's and have been super happy with them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, headphones that stay on!","review":"I have more expensive earphones for long plane trips or sitting quietly on the bed reading but none of those earphones/headphones which cost much more work at all when I am active.

Audio quality is good for the price, but the earbuds WILL NOT stay in my ears. I have determined that this has to do with the fact that I have a pronounced Tragus. If you're perplexed right now search for it on wikipedia. It's the flap of cartilage that hangs over the opening of your ear.

The front wheel always makes the jogger go to the left, so you are constantly having to compensate for that. The handle is not very comfortable either.

I should have spent the extra money and purchased one with a better front wheel."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disapointed","review":"Though the price was right, I now wish I spent more and got a higher quality one. On most joggers, the front wheel is staionary, so that didn't bug me, infact i wanted it that way for dirt trails. However, it would go straight do to the poor design. The tires it came with will not inflate correctly and if they are fully inflated their is a huge lump in the tire. Normally, little tykes stuff is great but not with this. don't try and save money, get a quality one, this was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Product","review":"I just bought one second hand - should have read the reviews first. I have used several jogging strollers, but this one is very poorly designed. the front wheel attachment is very unstable, and as a result, the jogger has a tendency to pull to the left - spent more effort trying to keep it in a straight line than pushing it! Also, front wheel shows premature wear and warps. As a bike trailer only, it is adequate. However, attaching it to the bike can be challenging - best if you can do it once and leave it on. All in all, disappointing product from Little Tykes. You get what you pay for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheesh!","review":"In the 2 years that I've had the cruiser behind a bike, both the wheels have already warped.

I tried various fixes and couldn't get anything to work. So it is now worthless.

I called Little Tikes, and was told that no replacement parts are stocked for this product. Since I purchased over a year ago, there is no warranty, and I was told to throw away the bike stroller.

Note: if this happens to you, be sure to download the owner's manual for the saw, the parts list and diagram for the saw, and the owner's manual for the TS2000 stand.Everything was easy to assembly so it took about an hour to do so. The collapsible table is really a plus as I can move the saw against the wall in my bedroom-converted-to-a-shop when not in use giving me plenty of room for my other power tools.

Everything stows on the saw when you put it away. Don't get me wrong, this is no Unisaw, and like all portable saws, it's noisy. But it's a great saw for the jobsite or small shop. Combine this with a good miter saw, and you can do most anything. As good as this saw is, I was even more impressed with the new gravity-rise stand. I have a good fold-up-and-wheel-away stand for my miter saw, but this stand is just amazing. It is very solid, beautifuly built, and folds and unfolds easier than anything I have ever seen.

It was packed very carefully and well. I had no problems putting together the stand and then mounting the saw on it. Very clear and easy to understand directions. Took about 25 minutes. It is very high quality. I had just one problem-setting the saw arbor parallel to the miter slot. It was off. You must do this to avoid kickback. It took me an hour to finally get the arbor parallel. Once that was done, it was time to go to work. It did great on plywood, oak and ash, both ripping and crosscut. The rip fence was a big surprise-its parallel to the blade and its rugged. This is not a stationary heavy weight saw. Its made to be portable and even has a dust chute that gets about 90% of the chips-not bad. Get a vacuum hook-up or the bag they sell for it. The folding table adjustment is awesome. If not for the parallel problem, this saw would get 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Saw","review":"The build quality of this saw is unreal.

The fence, no matter at what distance from the blade was 1/16\\" to 1/8\\" off at the front of the fence when measured to the front and back of the blade. I am very discouraged and am considering returning the saw for a full refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding saw","review":"This saw is a pleasure to use. I had a good 30 year old cast iron 10\\" Delta Contractor's with wheels and a belt driven motor. I loaned it to a friend for several years and it had vanished when I checked to get it back (long story). Now, after having just bought and used this Bosch saw, I wouldn't take my trusty old saw back even if it somehow shows up again. The features, accuracy, and portability of this saw are outstanding. I did disassemble the fence and put in a shim (a piece of electrical tape) so the fence is perfectly 90 degrees vertical now. It had leaned to the left a tad and it was just a 10 minute operation to correct. Plese excuse me now, I think I have something to saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"died too young","review":"Bought my saw 2 years ago at amazon, thought it was the greatest thing ever, UNTIL last week.

Overall, it seems pretty fun for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"drawing to the conclusion of the series belgaried","review":"There are get characters as always in an eddings book, but they have very long stories that goes for many books. In this book, Garion and his family, belgarath and polgara are still looking for the missing stone, that they believe no one can touch unless of pure goodness. their search takes them all over the place where the map becomes very helpful. It nears the conclusion but not quite, the ending is predictable but sweet in the fifth book, and final of this series"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Elite few...","review":"Not the first book,but certainly one of the best,Eddings has acheived the status : Elite. I read this book during my lunch breaks, ( I was always late returning to work). It was delightful to have a dining room full of people look my way when i could no longer hold back my mirth at some witty comment made by one of the char's, and burst out laughing....Extremely delightful!! Thank you David for putting some humor back into life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprise! You're the Savior of the World!","review":"Against all odds, Garion manages to be surprised at the fact that he is the heir to the long-vacant Rivan throne, and hence the one destined to duel the evil god Torak. He deals with this with reasonable equanimity, all things considered. Then he takes the two most interesting characters he can find (Belgarath and Silk) and heads off to get the duel over with.The womenfolk are left behind to rally the armies of the western kingdoms, which thankfully all have different colored uniforms and completely different, though complementary, military strengths. But the whole campaign is really a diversion, you know... the armies of the West marching against hopeless odds to divert attention from the one bearing the dangerous artifact to the heart of the land of darkness... say, haven't I read this story before?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the eason Garion has been going around the world on a certin quest","review":"Castle of Wizardry is about a boy named Garion. Garion is a young wizard that has to go on a long quest that is in the prophecy for him to kill the evil god Torak. On the way to kill Torak, Garion has to get the Orb of Aldur to Riva. once he got the Orb to Riva he has to put the Orb on this great sword when he did the whole world shook. When this happen the God Torak awoke from his slumber and started looking for his Sword. Garion has to marry Ce'Nedra. Before he can marry her he has to set off to kill Torak and save the world from total destruction. The reason Garion and Torak have to fight is because Garion is the child of light and Torak is the child of darkness and destruction. Garion does not whant t fight the god but he has to because this is all describe in the prophicythat is fortold"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meeting the Requirements, and Conditions","review":"In the fourth installment of the series everything finally comes together and is getting to the point where everything can escalate into a climatic ending. Finally Garion (and friends) reaches Riva, gets Iron Grip's sword, and becomes who he really is. The requirements of the prophecy have nearly all been fulfilled, and nearly all conditions are met. The only thing that really needs to happen now is the final battles, and the meeting between Garion and Torak. In \\"Castle of Wizardry\\" armies are raised, groups split up, the kingdoms of the west unite and Garion, Kheldar, and Belgarath head out for the Mallorean continent to greet Torak with the sword of Iron Grip.A very exciting book that sets up everything for the climax of book five, and instantly captures your imagination, time, and attention, and then won't let go until you've finished the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like saga's--get it.","review":"The 4th in the series the Belgariad by David Eddings. This book completes the quest of retrieving the sacred orb of Aldur started in Pawn of Prophecy. Eddings' further develops the characters of young Garion and Ce'Nedra as they assume their destiny and the final battle that could end the world. The consistency with which Eddings develops his characters is amazing and fun to read. A good story for adults, and teens. Teens will identify with the main characters 'teen angst' in a world beyond their control and adults will appreciate the wry political commentary on a cold war that is no longer going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science fiction will never be the same. EXCELLENT!","review":"Eddings throws you, yet again, in a fantasy world where the characters will become as well known to you as life-like friends and the mystical aspects of this book don't seem cartoonish or petty. The beauty of Eddings works is they're all taken from a realistic start without any fantasy and incorporates it slowly and very believably as well. This book, as well as his other Malloreon series (which is a continuance of the Belgariad) MUST be read. Eddings is the only sci-fi type reader I will spend time with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Simply great! The action really becomes intense in this book and everything starts to wind down to the final conclusion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The story great! The characters lovably! Never dull!","review":"I enjoyed this book, this series, and has become one of my favourites. It is is light or heavy read depending on how much you want to get out of it. His characters have believable personalities, especially the ones who have lived thousands of years. Belgarath and Beldin have enough sceptisism and hope in their characters to make them truely lovable. The story itself is full of twist that kept me coming back. The only disapointment was Errand/Eriond, I guessed his fate before the end, but still wasn't to big of a disapointment, it finished so well. Eddings will be hard pressed to dupicate the sucess of this series. I hope he writes more with these characters. Did I detect a bit of sarcasism ? Mr. Eddings Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eddings really captures the essence of the characters","review":"The entire Belgariad series was excellent as was its sequel, The Mallorean, and its pre/sequel, Belgarath the Sorccerer. Eddings paints stunning mental images of the characters, giving them their own personal idioms and idiosynchracies, as well as letting them evolve, change, and adapt. His ability to write such long epics is elite. You are quickly enthralled in the stories, and just when you think the plot could end in Book 3, here comes Book 4 with a new unexpected twist. As was the case with Castle of Wizardry. It was another shining example of fantasy literature that can stand on its own, but will leave you needing to read the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best in the series, but still worth a read","review":"Once again I wish for a \\"half-star\\" rating, as this deserves a 3 1/2. I love the series, but this was the weakest of the five books in my opinion. There were interesting parts, and the dialogue, the sense of humor and even some of the twists and events are really enjoyable. I like the interaction between the kings as well, which is quite interesting.I will say that if there were an area of criticism for Eddings it is in the lack of variety of some of the people. I have heard others call it his \\"Star-Trek Worldbuilding\\". All Alorns are \\"this way\\" all Mimbrates are \\"this way\\". A little more depth in this area would have made this a masterful series and book.Even without it though this is a series that should not be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first real suprises of the series","review":"Eddings gets better and better as we follow the journey of young Garion toward his battle with Torak. In \\"Castle or Wizardry\\" our young hero reaches the end of the quest for the Orb of Aldur only to discover his greatest challenge lies ahead. He will be put in a position so far beyond his humble beginnings that his mind will reel. In the meantime the company of heroes we've followed through the first three books face very different challenges in the days leading to war with the powers of the East. The most daunting task is set for Ce'Nedra in a twist you may not see coming. Mysteries are revealed and new adventures begun. This is a great addition to an epic that will remain a favorite for a long time to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Heaven's sake, don't go near this atrocity!","review":"This is truly one of the worst attacks on Classical music ever perpetrated by the philistines of this world.This is not good music, not a good interpretation and not respectful to the composer or his music.If you love Soul and Hip-Hop, that's fine.

The Floesheim retailer does not have these and the guy at Florsheim can't tell me who has them. I took a chance on Amazon. The shoes fit just like a 10.5 D is supposed to. Amazing! Stiff, shiny leather. They cut under both ankles and were close around the ball of the foot for a few days just like they were when you could buy them back in the '70's. Preventative bandaid on the left heel for only one day. Two weeks later I have great looking, broken in shoes that actually fit. My feet aren't tired and overworked after walking around the office all day. I only wish they were made in USA. Nevertheless, the shoe has twice the character of the rubberized footwear so commonplace these days. Thank you Amazon for a great price on a real pair of shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"These Shoes are ok but they are overpriced. I have a pair of Bostonian Maldens and they are similar quality. The Bostonian cost less than half of the Florsheims. These shoes are average and I do like them but they do not compare to other 225 shoes on the market.Florsheim customer service was hit or miss. I bought the shoes from the Florsheim website and had them shipped to Canada. Half the time I dealt with with a good customer service rep the other half not so much. My big complaint is that I tried to leave a 3 star review on the Florsheim website and they didn't approve it. It seems they screen all their reviews and if they don't like what the customer has written they will not publish it. I think this is extremely misleading and dishonest.If you can find these shoes for 150 bucks and don't have to deal with Florsheim directly then I would recommend them. If it wasn't for the price and service I would have given 4 start review because the shoes are nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable Florsheim Shoes","review":"I'm really disappointed with the quality and workmanship of the Florsheim shoes.

Then, kodak came out with the DCS-14n as a replacement. It was a huge mistake. The DCS-14n's sensor is simply of lower quality, shadows sometimes come out magenta. There is also a flare issue. Grey gradients, depending on the density come out green or yellow. And there are other issues as well, but you get the point. In conclusion, the DCS-760 was a far better camera.Kodak recommends the use of a good lens with the DCS-14n to eliminate flare. We used the same lens to test both cameras, and the tests were performed under the same conditions. The results were very clear to us: keep the DCS-760."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera, but now serves a very limited need","review":"I purchased the Kodak Pro SLR/N a good number of years ago. It is the successor to the featured Kodak DCS-14N. Since then, I have purchased five different Nikons to replace the work performed by the camera in my studio. Most notably, I recently purchased a Nikon D800 and a Nikon D800E.And yet, I keep a spot open for using the Kodak with a Zeiss 25mm for super sharp wide-angle, high resolution macro shots. Because I have restricted the camera to studio use, it's only failure is of little consequence to me. A full charge on the OEM battery is worth about fifty (maybe fifty-three) shots. Otherwise, the photos it produces are excellent - no noise and great color. For all my work, I keep the ISO at 400, or less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absoulutly fantastic \\"A++\\"","review":"The perfect digital camera ever made with over 13 mega pixels, this is the best and the only camera that any professional photographer should have.Very easy to use, much lighter than previous DCR-760 and much cheaper (about $... without lens)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adventure Story","review":"This is a wonderful story with beautiful illustrations.

I intertwined them with silk flowers and plastic ivy and hung them around her fairy themed bed. They do not get hot, they have a soft warm red/pink glow, and they are fairly sturdy.

Chapelle tapped into the same vein when he dreamed up his blind black white-supremacist sketch. 'Night of the living Street Pimps' inspired many a halloween costume and Keenan Ivory Wayans as Jeri-Kurl is the funniest (...) ever, period. This movie is brilliant on so many levels and there's nothing else that compares to it.

Rich affected me and my family deeply. I still miss him a lot even though we're approaching the 15th anniversary of his death.

That cassette got stuck in my player one day and I knew I couldn't go long without replacing it with a CD. Rich Mullins music strikes a chord deep in the heart of the human spirit. He walked the earth with humility, living a no-nonsense, deep, practical faith in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Last night I listened to it before bed and every song flowed into the next. My favorites are \\"If I Stand\\" and \\"Step by Step.\\" I love finding videos of him in concert, just him and his piano. His voice was so earthy and alive.

But anyone unfamiliar with the incredible music that Rich put out during his too-short life would do well to start their education with this CD. Many of his best songs are here: Awesome God, Sing Your Praise To The Lord, Sometimes By Step, Hold Me Jesus, Creed. When this set was compiled, however, it included some of Rich's best early work, too, like Verge Of A Miracle, alrightokuhhuhamen, and Elijah. I didn't give the collection five stars simply because there's no way one CD could have encompassed the essence of Rich's music. This is an excellent album, and a good one with which to start a collection, but I hope that listeners won't limit themselves to the music here.

You just need to have it. I've had it since my freshmen year of college and 5years after, i still listen to this cd frequently.Some of the songs are stuff a person can relate to. Some will make streams of tears flow down your cheek. I think Rich Mullins is someone who didn't just make music. His heart was in it and he shared his belief and faith through his music. Too bad i was too young in the 90's. Nevertheless, i'm glad i have this cd - it's something i'll use to remember this great legend.

Both are masters of timing, but in their own way. I'd forgotten just how funny this movie was until it reached the train robbery scene.I've watched both actors (especially Owen Wilson) in many movies since this one's release in 2000, but I can hardly say they've improved as their comedic stylings were as solid then as they remain today.(I cannot vouch for all of Wilson's films because some seemed too silly to watch, but the ones where he's half-serious half-funny are classic in my mind)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun movie","review":"Easy to watch for a nice entertaining movie when you don't want anything too intense.

When you put the DVD into the player the first thing that shows up is the warning that if you make copies, sell them, and get caught you'll go bankrupt from court ligigation with Disney. The second thing on the video is previews. Here is the problem. I couldn't fast forward through them. I had to press the menu button to get past them. While you may think that's fine what's wrong with that. I say what if there were 4 previews and 3 were for bad movies but one was for a movie like \\"The Sixth Sense\\" you wouldn't want to skip the previews for a movie like that.

It's for the days when you don't want to think much about what's going on, and don't want to watch movies where people undress.That's about all, though. Owen Wilson's wide-eyed naivete was over-used, and Chan's athleticism and physical comedy were under-used. The plot was adequate to keep the characters moving and to alternate between bad guys every now and then. Still, it's not the kind of movie that will keep you up late with its deep philosophy - or even with its bad puns.Perhaps the funniest scene is the bathtub drink-off (no nudity, lots of bubbles).

This is a film that makes you wonder why there were so many serious westerns, with so few spoofs of them. Jackie Chan does a very interesting thing by taking the classic western story, and spicing it up with his own unbelievable stunts. There are many sequences here that make you realize what a talent he truly is, and makes you wonder why he is not a bigger star. Owen Wilson is also fit for his part, playing somewhat of a nieve cowboy, with a good heart and his mind in the right direction. Anyone who has seen this or is interested should know that the film was not made to be taken seriously. There was never a point where you were to expect this film to be deep and insightful, you were only supposed to see it as a film in which you have fun watching and enjoy yourself. This film holds true to both of those ideals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool fights and a few good laughs...","review":"While it's no \\"Rush Hour,\\" \\"Shanghai Noon\\" is still a fun two hours filled with sly laughs and kick-you-in-the-face action that never lets up. Owen Wilson, who I like better every time I see him, is an outlaw who comes across Chong Wang (Jackie Chan), who is on a quest to save a Chinese princess (Lucy Liu). The two play off each other well and we have the usual buddy-film banter, but Wilson and Chan have a unique chemistry that disguises the movie's cliche flaws, making the movie tons more enjoyable. The film is well-shot and surprisingly fast-paced. There are frequent laughs and Chan's always-excellent fight scenes.

When the author was describing how the characters reacted to a situation or comment from another character she was very redundant. It seems like everyone was giving Sharp looks and Piercing glances it just didn't make the characters seem real made them all seem alike.I'm still not done with the book only about 50 pages left, I don't like to leave a book unread once I start it not even a poorly written one.

I understand it can be taken apart but not quickly or easily. But you shouldn't have to. My theory is that the impact from each shot breaks apart the glued together line of staples in the magazine and then they get whopperjawed and cause a jam.

This book fascinated me when I first read it and today is still worth multiple subsequent reads. The first few chapters are easy to wrap your head around, however in subsequent chapters Mr. Dunne uses graphs and table to explain vastly complex notions about time. If you are good at variable-centric math or sciences and enjoy a good book on the nature of reality, this is a good book for you.

I was very disappointed in the main part of the book. I had read it before, 75 years ago when I was 14, and found it very interesting on precognitive dreams. This second time of reading I realized that only one small section of the book is really about that type of dream, the rest is Dunne's own idiosyncratic rendering of an obscure, impossible to grasp, theory about time. It reads like a badly written engineering manual for deaf-mutes. I wanted the book for a collector's item and for reference in an article I have written on precognitive dream theory. As such it was worth the $70 to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic study of precognitive dreams","review":"The reader who was \\"sickened\\" by this book apparently didn't notice that it was written about 80 years ago. That reader also missed a central historical point: People have been reporting precognitive dreams for a very, very long time and trying to grapple with how to understand them in scientific terms for about a century. Dunne was one of the first to write about his experiences, and his training as an engineer led him to a thoughtful series of analyses and fledgling theories. Anyone who has had precognitive experiences will find this book interesting. But if you strongly believe that such experiences are mere coincidences, or logically incoherent, or impossible, you should avoid this book because it will just make you angry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very insightful yet flawed.","review":"Dunne is onto something very important. The first half of the book is easy to follow and very insightful. It is an important work that, in my opinion, successfully demonstrates the precognotive nature of some dreams. I am perhaps more easily convinced than others as I too have had similar experiences. However, Dunne goes beyond proving the existance of such dreams and attempts to explain how and why they happen. The infinite regress argument seems to be flawed. He claims it to be proof of God's existance. I do not feel that he has successfully proven this theory about the how and why of time. For a very good analysis of Dunne's theory, see \\"Man and Time\\" by J.B. Priestly.

As a rule, I generally avoid books in the business genre, but, my friend assured me, this one was different. Well, she was right. Mr. Levy's private writing exercises are a great way to jump-start a bogged down brain. Everyone has an internal editor that usually gets in the way of good ideas; these exercises remove those barriers and show anyone willing to try how easy it can be to have a 'genius moment.' As a professional in a creative field, coming up with unique, fresh ideas is my bread and butter. Now I have another very valuable tool in my arsenal.

There is nothing more than an overview to any subject when it comes to amounts, dosages for supplements or nutrients and the amount needed. About half way through I quit reading it since it was of no help other than a broad spectrum overview.

I looked for replacement chargers on different websites and ordered one from an independent site (not Canon) at a less expensive price. It was EXTREMELY flimsy and the charger unit itself had a cord and did not plug into the wall directly like the original. Thinking I was saving money by going with an independent site specializing in batteries and chargers, I ended up asking for a refund - the darn charger didn't work AT ALL and was so cheap that the company didn't even ask for it back!!I am very happy with the charger sold here on Amazon - it is the real deal, not just an imitation.

Canon products in general have always impressed me, so this is a no brainer. I purchased this because my son \\"accidentally\\" spilled coke all over our old charger that came with our Elph, and it works just as well as our supplied charger that originally came with our camera. It should also be noted that this can charge several types of batteries (we have the SD200), but it can charge the SD630, SD600, SD450, and others.I would always go with Canon for accessories, as opposed to some cheap third party knock off.

The one I received had a slightly different model number (2B-2LVE) and was an obvious fake. It even came with a second-hand dusty power cord. The charger had scratches on it and its construction was very crude. Definitely, not like anything you would expect to come from Canon. The counterfeit job would probably go unnoticed to someone with poor eyesight, but to me it was obviously crude with its poor molding, gaps between the plastic, and cheap prongs (the ones the power cord connects to). I didn't even try using it because I'm certain it would have either damaged the battery or started a fire.So why 2 stars? A counterfeit item should receive ZERO stars but... I called Amazon and, right away, the customer service rep issued a refund and apologized for the inconvenience. Amazon is amazing in that regard.

Welles has a very small part - under fifteen minutes of screen time. However, Orson Welles is all anyone remembers, or rather he is the first thing people remember about this classic film. Released in England in 1949, \\"The Third Man\\" didn't open in the US until the following year. Too bad. It would easily have been the best picture of 1949 - possibly winning the Oscar over \\"All the King's Men.\\" But, no. It came up against \\"All About Eve\\" and \\"Sunset Blvd\\" - and wasn't even nominated for best picture of 1950 (neither were \\"The Asphalt Jungle\\" or \\"Panic in the Streets\\"). Still, Orson should have won the Oscar for supporting actor over George Sanders in \\"All About Eve.\\" Buy this video. See for yourself. Orson shows why he truly was one of the greatest movie stars off all time. You'll never forget him."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the all-time great films","review":"This was one of the very first films I purchased on DVD. I was lucky enough to see this on the big screen when it was re-released to theatres after the restoration. The quality of this DVD is outstanding. Seeing the widescreen version is truly sublime. Robert Krasker's cinematography is stunning. The Anton Karas score is haunting. The direction of Carol Reed and the screenplay by Graham Greene could not be improved upon. (film lovers will also want to see \\"The Fallen idol\\" by Reed and Greene). Cotten, Howard and Valli are great in their parts, but Orson Welles as Harry Lime steals the film - he should have won the Oscar for his brilliant work here. A work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"what did the Swiss give us?","review":"Great stuff from director Carol Reed.The sense of mystery that is generated around the character of Harry Lime is terrific and Harry's first appearance on camera is one of the stand out scenes in the history of cinema.Anton Karras's marvellous music adds greatly to the atmosphere.Brilliant from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies ever made","review":"As usual, the Criterion Collection has issued a disc with some amazing and obscure Special Features you can't find anywhere else. But unlike modern DVDs, which one might be inclined to buy just for the 1300 hours of Special Features, the focus of this DVD is the film itself, which deserves to be included in everyone's top ten list. The DVD features a new transfer that makes the film look better than it ever did (I've seen the laserdisc version-yikes!), enhancing the beautiful and haunting noir photography.There is so much to say about this nearly flawless movie-from the unique zither score to the tilted camera angles to the perfect evocation of postwar Vienna to Harry Lime's (Orson Welles) memorable entrance, this films stands as one of the best film noir thrillers ever made, and among my top five favorite films of all time. If you are a true film buff, you need to at least see, if not own this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable!","review":"Many years ago,back in a time when VCR's were new and dinosaur's roamed the earth(Ok,I exaggerate) I happened to be one of my group of friends who owned a VCR. One of the guys called me to say that the movie \\" The Third Man\\" was going to be on TV and asked if I would record it for him. I had never heard of it before and my only knowledge of Orson Welles was Citizen Kane and his radio show of the Martian invasion that had people panicked. Well, I recorded The Third Man on my Zenith Betamax recorder and before I gave my friend the tape, I watched it. From the first few moments, I was mesmerized by the remains of post-war Vienna,the haunting zither music and the great perfomances of Joseph Cotten,Alida Valli,Trevor Howard and Orson Welles himself. Needless to say, many years later I bought the Criterion Collection DVD and still find the movie haunting and the last few moments terribly sad. As my title says, it is unforgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Third Man","review":"Movie was good, not great.

Cotten and Welles are a great on screen duo and give outstanding performances. The bonus features include a great comparison of the original English version and the American version of this classic.Criterion makes the best and most informative DVD features. The amount of material on this disc is amazing considering it was made over 50 years ago.Worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"a truly great oldie","review":"orson wells plays harry lime a totally evil man. you never see this evil but you hear about what he's involved in. once you know the implications of what he's involved in the only villain that's comparable is bruce willis in: 'the jackal'. [i have to say: the best villain is heath ledger as the joker.]by todays standards this film is a bit slow and films that were used to transfer it to dvd were not in mint condition.basically it's about boot legging in post WWII Vienna. the city is divided by occupational zones-- american, british, french, and russian. a down on his luck writer-- played by joseph cotton-- is invited to Vienna to work for harry lime. when the cotton arrives harry is dead and all the occupiers want him. cotton deals with the brits.now the mystery begins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best intrigue movie ever made.","review":"Welles did not make it: Carol Reed did. Screen play by Graham Greene (before he turned it into a novel in which Holly Martin is English). Show almost stolen by Trevor Howard, even Bernard Lee (\\"M\\" in first Bond films) is great. Valli is everyone's kind of girl. Joseph Cotten we have to identify with. Best line: \\"Unwise..Holly.\\" This is the best intrigue movie ever made. Placed and filmed on location in post-war Vienna, rubble and all. Actors from the German (Viennese) stage are used for main small parts. According to a recent murder mystery set in Vienna when the film was made, the cafe scene where Holly displays a copy of his Western to identify himself to a \\"friend\\" of Harry Lime's is misplaced. Direction, mis en scene, acting, music, setting, inter alia, are beyond compare."},{"rating":"1","title":"DisappointingI","review":"Great film. Rough soundtrack.

Or has he? This classic film noir thriller plays on national loyalties during the Cold War. Orson Welles is prefect as the manipulative Harry Lime, a black market drug dealer and Cotton does a great job as the quintessentially brash American. The underground sewer sequence is extraordinary. The film is scored with a haunting theme by Anton Karas on unaccompanied zither to an eerie effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointing transfer","review":"'The 3rd Man' is a wonderful who-dunnit. It is a gritty slice of life of European existence right after World War II. The story and the acting are awesome, but this transfer is terrible.

I absolutely hated this film, and actually give it 0 stars. I have seen a few Orson wells films, and have not liked any of them, and I think a boring script, and bad preformance from Wells brings this film down.

Cool thing that what is considered as THE finest American film ever made (Citizen Kane) and THE finest British film ever made (The Third Man) both star Orson Welles AND Joseph Cotton.

Lo and behold it arrived on Christmas Eve and I was able to give it as a present! Amazon ROCKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good film, good DVD","review":"This DVD title is a nice transfer: the picture is clear and the focus is sharp. There is minimal grain to this clean black and white mpeg2. The image ratio is 1.33:1 (standard) and many repairs and digital editing had been done to restore this classic film. This is a fine quality DVD (as are all of Criterion's Collection).The film itself is heavily stylized with rolled camera shots, extreme close-up shots, and many night scenes with wet cobblestone roads and smoky interiors. This is early film noir with a classy European touch. The real gem of the film, aside from brilliant acting, a terrific cast, memorable characters, an intriguing story, and fabulous cinematography, is the score: sort of quasi-gypsy instrumentation that gives the film a genuine local flavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"A fantastic story (Graham Greene wrote the screenplay), terrific acting and first-class cinematography (full of camera shots that are utterly riveting) make The Third Man a must-see classic. The score is a little heavy-handed and obtrusive at times, but almost sixty years after its release, The Third Man remains a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"This is a superb digital transfer and a great \\"making of...\\" documentary together on a two disc package. Well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Genuinely Great Film","review":"Filmed in post-war Vienna, \\"The Third Man\\" is filled with an atmosphere that can probably never be captured again. Carol Read's directing (evidently much influenced by the work of Orson Welles) is superbly coupled to Robert Krasker's cinematography. The \\"look\\" of the film is perhaps as much of a leading character as those played to perfection by Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten. Intrigue, black market dealings, slippery Central European criminals ... it all comes together in an absorbing story centered around the mysterious figure of Harry Lime (played by Welles), charming and treacherous. The insistent zither background music is perhaps the most distinctive movie music soundtrack ever recorded. Of particular value in this DVD edition of the movie is an otional \\"commentary\\" track which is a reading of Graham Greene's original treatment for the film script, showing how the original vision became transformed into film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dark film for a dark place","review":"Truly, one of the best films of it's genre, ever made. When you consider the year in which it was made, it is even more impressive. Tough questions are asked, but only to be answered by the viewer, such as: \\"what's more important, friendship or responsibility?\\" I don't know if the film even has a hero. Timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God they are re-mastering the classics...","review":"This is THE film to own on DVD if you are a classic film buff. I've never seen so many supplementary materials on a disc. Anything from watching the cameramen capture that curious kitty who \\"only liked Harry\\" for 6 hours on a still, to seeing Anton Karas play his zither in a bar on newsreel footage. Unbelievable! THE THIRD MAN is even better now, with sights, sounds, and scenery actually witnessed for the first time through the magic of DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bona Fide Classic!!","review":"Oh, what can I say about one of the greatest films ever made that hasn't already been said. \\"The Third Man\\" is a classic with a capital C.

The plot is incoherent, the music makes your skin crawl, and I'm not so hot on the acting either. Like another reviewer stated, it seems more of an ego trip for Orson Wells than anything else. So what? So they run through the streets and underground of Vienna using odd camera angles, lighting, and that annoying zither music. I have tried to like this film. Sorry, can't do it.Lucky"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie, cool cinematograhpy","review":"This movie was hard to watch because of the constantly intrusive and annoying zither music. The acting was wooden and the absurd plot moved very slowly. The cinematography was good however. This might be better as a silent movie: turn off the sound, you don't bother with the silly plot, just enjoy the images and shadows of post war bombed out Vienna. A best friend of a corrupt man learns of his crimes, betrays him, and finally shoots him. Just like real life."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's something about you guys that I don't understand","review":"I just don't like this movie, and I can't understand why everyone says it's a classic. It's totally uncinematic. The whole story is told through dialogue. The cinematography is fancy all right, but its fanciness is hardly necessary. The movie doesn't even really need an audience, because it finds its own story much more interesting than I ever thought it was. Joseph Cotten comes to Vienna immediately finding his friend dead, hit by a car. Before you can blink, he's obsessed with finding out the details of the incident and turns into a regular Philip Marlowe. The movie treats Harry Lime's death as if it's as important as the death of president Kennedy, AND WE MUST FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MAN QUICKLY BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE! COULD IT HAVE BEEN...GASP! MURDER! Who cares?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, underwhelming film noir","review":"I may rouse alot of ire here, but somebody has to give innocents abroad fair warning about this lousy film. Contrary to all the gushing reviews here, The Third Man is Orson Welles at his worst. The mysterious character, Harry Lime, when he is finally seen (after much buildup) is completely uninteresting and shallow. His trite dialog shows a character with no depth and reveals a writer with no imagination.And that AWFUL zither music!! This film must win the Golden Raspberry for worst soundtrack of all time!If you are an Orson Welles fan, like myself, stay away from this film. Pretend it never existed. It is not a film noir except in the most amateurish sense. You want to see a great Orson Welles film noir? A Touch of Evil is the film for you. Trust me, you'll never look at Charlton Heston the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very much to say.","review":"I'll Make this short and sweet to the point; This movie does very poorly and it's no wonder why people {excluding critics} think that this is boring right up there with Citizen Kane.

However, I almost ordered this DVD by mistake not realizing that it is in fact the older version.

What the others say about this movie is true; the acting, and especially the camera angles are first rate. And who could forget that fabulous zither?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a Classic","review":"The Criterion DVD of this film is easily the best version to see, but the vhs video, while the picture is not the best, is worth while. An amazing story from Graham Greene and amazing performances by Joseph Cotton, Orson Welles, and the rest. Vienna post-WWII is a perfect location to symbolize the moral decay the story presents, the idea of manipulating a city in ruins following war. Welles's face in the doorway remains one of the greatest film \\"shocks\\" in history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who is this Third Man?","review":"Set in Vienna after WWII, The Third Man pits a burned out novella author from America who comes to Vienna to seek out his friend, Harry Lime who requested his presence in Vienna. Upon arriving, our protagonist finds out that his friend Harry has been killed in an accident. Based on his doubts that there really was no accident, he tries to seek out a mysterious third man seen at the scene of the accident. The movie features Orson Welles as Harry Lime and some excellent filmmaking depicting a post war divided Vienna. The sewer chase scene at the film's end is not to be missed. The DVD also features two different film openings and also contains two radio broadcasts of Welles reprising his role of Harry Lime. This is a great movie for the mystery/suspense addict."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute nutjob...","review":"Fritz Donnelly creates a jocund narrative with mellifluous style yielding some of the most on crack hilarity I've ever seen.

Some of the tips are good: smoking isn't healthy for you. Other tips are bad or dubious: esential oils are better for your skin than almost any other products. Then there's the tips that just fall into the \\"just weird\\" category: wash your face only once a day... or... showering for more than 5 minutes is destructive to your skin.I would have liked to see more discussion on exfoliation and antioxidants. The authors seem to entirely overlook the benefits of Beta Hydroxy Acid (BHA) products, focusing largely on AHA exfoliation. They also push moisturizer for all skin types, which seems kinda unnecessary.Instead of this book, I'd recomend Paula Begoun's \\"Beauty Bible,\\" which seems much more effectively presented, researched and documented. Note that Begoun is not a medical doctor, which makes her expertise in this area even more surprising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor pronunciation","review":"From the audio sample I could tell most of the singers were not native Italian speakers.

Churchill is a gifted writer and his descriptions of the events he writes about are wonderfully vivid and riveting.

Bad choice. My Kindle 2 immediately froze. The trial file wouldn't even download without major problems, and nothing else on the Kindle would work until I rebooted it.

So I bought the CD recently. I am amazed at this singer's ability to lead people to Christ by his music and his voice! After all, Smitty is my number one all-time fave male singer, and this CD proves what he actually does as an amabassador for God. I love the trilogy hits, especially \\"The Other Side of Me\\". This song is a beautiful tribute to his wife, Debbie. The songs, \\"I'll Lead You Home\\", \\"I'm Waiting For You\\", \\"I'll Be Around\\", and \\"As It Is In Heaven\\", are just some of my huge faves! Overall the album proves that Smitty has made an incredible impact on the lives of music fans, believers and nonbelievers alike!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD!","review":"This Michael W.

Smith (also called Smitty by his fans) has become one of the most enduring Christian artists, putting him with such company as Stephen Curtis Chapman and Bryan Duncan. This 1995 release has Smitty's fingerprints all over it, bringing us his usual mix of pop songs and musical interludes.Each of the 14 tracks on this album clearly show where Smitty's heart is: pointing to the Lord. The wide range of messages found on this album will result in one or more of them hitting the heart of all who listen.His most popular album since his 1990 effort, \\"Go West Young Man,\\" this CD is a must for all Smitty fans and a good one to start with for those who have never heard of him before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical information at your fingertips","review":"This book is a must have for anyone put in the position of creating or supporting an eDirectory implementation.

I think everyone else who gave this 5 stars pretty much covered it, but I thought I would just give it yet another 5 stars. I am also sad more people won't hear this.I saw these guys in concert on this album when I was....19? Funny, because I hated the album when it first came out, but for some reason couldn't stop listening to it. And its like...each and every apparently random riff, moan, clap beat, chant, feedback is actually so well placed and intentional that it just blows me away. When you just listen to the music, without expectations but just hearing the music, you start to see the forest for the trees, and then the trees all over again; and so on.Please hear this record many, many times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blows big time","review":"This book, like all of the Riftwar Legacy novels, is a painful read of scripted, wooden characters that have absolutely no life to them. The plots are more like children's books, and everything is extremely predictable. The hero's are heroic, the bad guys are overtly evil, and the action is just as cartoon-like and predictable as anything being shown on Saturday mornings...It is best to skip this book, and the rest of the Riftwar Legacy along with it, and pretend it doesn't exist when you read the rest of Feist's Midkemia novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed with this effort","review":"I loved the Riftwar saga, and the previous trilogy. I loved the character development and scenarios that were painted - but with this book \\"Tear of the Gods\\", I don't know...it felt like it was created by some inexperienced creative. The characters were bland. Seriously, I wouldn't care if they all died..and that is one of the reasons I don't like this book.Some of the most powerful evil creatures to grace Feist's books were so ineffectual and inexperienced in their motives/skills that they were being thwarted by the most assanine solutions.Ultra powerful liches, vampires & skeletal warriors being killed in short order because their cleverness in hiding their soul gems in addition to just being plain impotent in their abilities. I'd expect something like this from Gary Gygax or something...which isn't bad, its just not what one expects from Feist.Are we sure he wrote this book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a diehard Raymond Feist fan, have read everything he's written, so I think I have the perspective to say this is NOT his best stuff. I really felt he phoned this one in. The man who brought us Pantathian Serpent priests is now resorting to vampires as villans?! How pedestrian! This work was far less imaginative than any of his previous books. I really began to wonder if perhaps Mr. Feist has run out of gas with regard to storylines for the world of Midkemia (I hope not!). With the success of his video games perhaps his focus is less on writing these days and more on other creative pursuits. This book did have the feel of a video game. Every couple of pages the 'good guys' did battle with 'bad guys' and after awhile it got quite tiresome. Where the political intrigue and finely drawn characters that make his earlier work so engrossing? Mr. Feist is a master of creating believable worlds but he just took us to a very boring corner of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going through the motions","review":"Feist's story line has become derivative and it appears he has joined Clancy in losing interest in pleasing a devoted audience. I am amazed at the amount of repetitive phrases he uses in this book (how many times did James almost lose his head; how often did he sidestep to have two opponents get in each other's way?). As I recall, in \\"Magician\\" and his other earlier work there were a number of underlying plots and twists. This book could not have been more predictable. Actually, the \\"trilogy\\" could have been one book. But then we wouldn't have had to read three novellas and pay for all three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, just horrible","review":"Im a big big fan of Raymond Feist, his Riftwar and SerpentWar Sagas were totally amazing, as were his 2 \\"in between\\" books. Unfortunatly this hasnt carried over to the Riftwar Legacy. I had high hopes for the Legacy, that it would fill in some holes about Sidi and the Crawler that was only touched on in the Serpentwar saga. Unfortunatly it doesnt resolve anything, in addition the tear of the gods is single handidly the worse book ive ever read, and especially is Feist's worst book. Betrayl was good, Assassians was also good, but this book bit. Im not sure if its just becuase he was restrained by the video game, or if he just didnt care and just wanted to bust out a book about the game as quickly as possible, but either way, the only reason why you should read this book is to finish the series,and even then id think hard about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointed","review":"I've read every book writen by Raymond E Feist, and enjoyed them all.

This book, on the other hand, is pure drivel.I fully agree with others who have panned this book. It smacks of basic D&D; computer game plots and is just not worth reading. Please, read the first 4 Riftwar books, the Daughter of the Empire series (wonderful & underappreciated), but skip this whole sub-series.

Having followed the various series of Feist over the years, I am becoming disillusioned with the quality of writing, plots and characterisation in his Krondor books. Tear of the Gods reads like a second-rate boys' adventure story - laboured, predictable and internally inconsistent particularly with regards to the use or non-use of magic to solve problems in deference to the brute force approach. Subtlety is not part of this book and I closed it with no sense of engagement with the story and felt it added nothing to hte History of Krondor."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more $25 hardcopies of doublespaced-14 font PC games","review":"I also was hooked since Magician Apprentice and have bought everything since, but it ends here. I really wanted to like this, but this is the third time I've plunked down $20+ on a Krondor hardcover with nothing in it except that it's written in a huge font and reads like the cheats to a roll playing computer game. If Feist didn't write this, then he really doesn't want to write about Krondor anymore. There's no feeling for the characters, they go from town to town solving riddles and quests that I really don't care about anymore. I'll go back to rereading his earlier work, but won't go for the new hard covers anymore. This will be a pamphlet when it's released in paperback. I suggest you wait for it and read it inbetween class or on the train. I was really dissappointed. I feel taken. I'd be curious to know why some people liked it(though I have a feeling that being short or helping them solve the eventual PC game might be the best reasons)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"As with other readers I was extremely dissapointed by his latest 3 works, The Riftwar Legacy. About 8 years ago I picked up a hardback book at a yard sale of Feists Magician Apprentice and Master. I was so taken away that I immediatley bought every book he had and waited eagerly for the next. Anyone who knows Fesit knows him as a gifted writer, able to make his readers love and understand his characters. I even wanted to cry as Jimmy died, and felt my own blood rushing as Arutha defended Crydee. Alas this new series has none of that. It has left me to think that Feist has only taken a video games plot and added a few more words for the sake of it. I only hope he will continue the series as it was and continue to amaze us with the skills that make him one of the best ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far the worst in the series","review":"You have to read it because it is part of the series but it comes across as a throw off.

I don't know if this is going to be the quality of all future Feist books, but the Riftwar Legacy as a whole and especially Tear of the Gods are WAY below his normal quality level. Tear of the Gods is the first fantasy book that I almost didn't finish because it was just so monotonous. There was so much action and adventure that by the time the climax actually arrived, I could barely tell from all the wild adventures Jimmy and his friends had already had.

Connell, according to the inside cover is a fictional tour de force of rich historical re-creation and spectacular prose. A love for historical fiction, the description on the sleeve, and all of the great reviews on the back of the book convinced me to purchase this book. I need not have bothered. I found this book to be unreadable.This book was most definitely not a rich historical re-creation. There was absolutely no historical atmosphere in this book. This alone would not make the book so terrible. I have read other historical novels that did not have a good medieval feel and still liked them. However, Connell seems to have gone out of his way to make this a hard to read book. The prose is not spectacular, it is incomprehensible. After attempting to read this book, I am convinced that all of the reviews on the back could in no way be about The Alchymist's Journal. They must be describing a different novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe's Word...Deliciously Odd and Murky","review":"What I especially like about this quirky short novel is the tone which is evocative of LA's darkest secrets and most peculiar characters. From start to finish, it is this tone that permeates the writing and draws one in to a very strage world. Can LA really be like this? I suspect so. City Lights' choice to include Stromme's novel in its new \\"noir series\\" is indicative of just how unique this work is. Don't expect a compelling plot line and it won't change your life but be prepared for a dreamlike excursion to places you may not want to visit in reality. It's a refreshing take on the noir sensibility with a dreamy overlay of a well understood and slightly disturbing place.I heard Stromme do a reading from the novel at City Lights a couple of months ago and can attest to the probabilty that she may well be as eccentric as her characters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not what I was looking for","review":"I really like sara Ivanhoe so I bought this after I'd been doingher hips and thighs video.

But this is five-star pop music, and it's gotten so much play on my iPod that I had to zero out the play count because it was taking over my Top 25 playlist like kudzu.The cover of Cyndi Lauper's \\"Unconditional Love\\" was better than the original, because Susanna could hit the high notes. I'd have a hard time picking out a favorite song off the album; I usually just play the whole thing, anyway.I liked this one much better than her follow up self-titled CD, since her voice didn't sound as good on that one.

Fischer's work in these stories is emotionally evocative and simple in style. His descriptions of rivers and trees and other wonders of the natural world are so vivid and distinct that each setting becomes a character whose subtle effect is felt throughout each story.

I tried so so hard for so so long to like this cd, but I never could. The musical and lyrical content is weak and insipid. There is nothing new or \\"ground-breaking\\" about it, which is Bowie's hallmark. I have always admired Bowie for his disconcern for the status quo but this cd is music for the masses; a printing press for money. I do NOT recommend this cd if you have a mind of your own. If you want to baahh along with the other sheep, go for it.

I never bought Let's Dance on cd, so when it came out as a hybrid SACD, I decided to get it. I don't have the original cd to compare it,with, but the SACD sounds great.

Each chapter (5 in book) is from a different perspective. The book is written in the first person some times and other times it is told as a story, sometimes changing within a single paragraph. It's a very unique writing style and I found it hard to follow.Although the book uses names of people and places from the bible it contains virtually no actual facts or events (other than the crucifixion itself). The story goes something like: \\"She ate a piece of bread\\", \\"She pulled up her blanket\\", \\"She walked down the road\\". It's as if the entire \\"cast\\" was moved to the Dark Ages - the picture the author paints is very \\"dark\\". Characters all seem to dislike each other. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk.","review":"They didn't give \\"no stars\\" as an option or I certainly would have selected it. This is a complete waste of money. I was shocked to discover that this is not even a real book. It appears that someone printed this out in their basement, then went to Kinkos and had it bound between two pieces of cardboard with plastic. I've handed in college papers that looked better, and contained more than the sparse 40 pages this does. Reduce the font and this is probably 15 typewritten pages at best. Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORTHLESS!!!","review":"This book only presents a sequence of screen shots, from MS Windows.

A previous reviewer mentioned the quality of the book, and they are correct; it does appear as if it was printed on a laser printer in someones basement. The pages are printed single-sided with a very large font. All in all, the content of this book is easily found in any book on tcp/ip; just take any chapter on subnetting, enlarge the font, print single-sided on a laser printer, and you have this book. Only purchase this book if you are an ABSOLUTE beginner. If you are looking for many concrete examples, I would definitely pass. I have returned the book for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"TCP/IP Addressing & Subnetting By Example","review":"This book has been a tremendous help on a subject that can be so confusing. It give step-by-step instructions and examples of addressing that are written so very simply that anyone can understand. Even beginners like myself. The one thing that really got my attention is that there is not a lot of unnecessary text. In other words it sticks to the subject - there are no cute funny stories about the author - nor does it like a novel. This is the most straight forward book on TCP/IP I have ever found. Understanding has never been made easier. Kudos to the Author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strictly for the novice - 1 hours reading","review":"this was printed on a laser printer in someone's cellar.

It covers the same stuff and a whole lot more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last promise","review":"Felt like I was in Italy myself, good reading, just a little predictable. The food sounded so good, wanted to run to an Italian restaurant."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Promise","review":"If you want to visit Italy and can't afford the time or the cost just buy Richard Paul Evans book. Not only will you feel like you are in Italy, but be so wrapped around the characters, the beauty of the countryside and wonderful use of the Italian dialogue (which is translated in English) that you will have to stop working just to get back to reading this great book. I read it in a few days and finally finished it late one night. I haven't read such a great book in years. I miss the characters already and wish I was back in the pages of The Last Promise, because it warmed my heart with love, suspense and Italy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should have had a Harlequin warning on its cover","review":"I have really enjoyed other Richard Paul Evans books--such as the Carousel, the Looking Glass, and, of course, The Christmas Box. But, after reading this book, I wondered if Mr. Evans has been attending mindless romance novel workshops."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Promise","review":"Good, enjoyable book. I hadn't read anything by Evans in awhile, but will read more in the future. This book held my interest and even though the outcome was predictable, the path to the ending was not. I recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful love story","review":"After finishing this book, all I could say was \\"Wow...\\" Evans has successfully touched my heart with his novel. I just simply could not put the book down! I like how he puts the English meaning of the Italian phrases next to each other. That made reading very easy.This novel has opened my heart and made me realize all the things I take for granted in life. It made me realize how much love means to someone.I recommend this book to all of my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't lose interest...or the urge to puke...","review":"The Story story was just interesting enough to keep me reading, but I have never been so thoroughly put off by the protagonists of a story. Everything was so perfect about Eliana and Ross that I found them way too contrived/artificial, although supposedly based on a couple of bona fide homo sapiens, and certainly exceedingly boring. I have to wonder if the author didn't use the same device - the \\"real life\\" fictional interview - that others have used to try to make the story seem more true-to-life; even with this, or even if the entire story were true, it's not much of a story. At least the studly Ross's capacity for 70+ consecutive push-ups was explained by his exhaustive physical training regimen while he...uh...had nothing else to do. Glad I bought the book at a clearance store."},{"rating":"1","title":"The last promise","review":"I never got this book. I am still researching if I paid for it or not.

I always love reading his works, and The Last Promise was no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absorbing!!","review":"I've always been a fan of Richard Paul Evans, and his mastery of story telling has never been better!Set in Italy, The Last Promise tells the story of a lonely wife and mother, Eliana, who is forced to make a horrible choice after falling in love with an American who moves in next door to her.In pure Evans fashion, you become totally absorbed in the lives of these characters. No matter where you are when you begin this book, you heart and mind are thwarted into classic Italy, with images so vivid and rich you swear you were there.For simple storytelling that will take your breath away, The Last Promise will soon become a prized volume amongst your collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SOAP OPERAS ... EAT YOUR HEART OUT","review":"Not to be too cynical here but, puhleese! This book is melodramatic, predictable, and sappy. Richard Paul Evans' use of intricate detailing paints a pretty picture but, essentially, adds nothing to the story in terms of character development and plot progression. More than halfway through the book the reader still knows next to nothing about Ross Story OR Eliana except that extenuating emotional circumstances, and the added convenience of locality, brought them together. And, of course they find each other attractive and stimulating - heaven forbid the guy that moves in next door be a troll. If you want a realistic love story ... go read some Richard Yates, or even John Irving. These are two writers who really know how to get at the core of human emotion. Richard Paul Evans, for me, misses the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Romance","review":"I felt this was a top notch romance novel. It was different than Richard Paul Evan's other novels. My only reason of not giving it 5 stars was I believe in \\"till death do us apart\\". I realize Elaina's husband was a real jerk. But I have a problem with the high divorce rate and don't like it when books seem to make marriage not a serious commitment. Although Ross counter weighted this by his complete commitment to Elaina. So far I have read and own all of Richard Paul Evan's books and this is one I will read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"My Italian boyfriend gave me this book for christmas. The plot seemed promising. However, before getting to the first page, we started to find errors.For starters, see \\"acknowlegments\\" second page---John Pitanzo, buon fortunata (sic) with your book. We decided to ignore it. Sadly, the errors became rather too common. Many of the proverbs in Italian contained grammatical errors. We wonder why the author didn't ask one of the numerous friends he acknowledges to correct his Italian. The story did prove to be interesting, but the errors created too much of a distraction. We expected more from a published work and don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous book","review":"I love Richard Paul Evans books.

He tells boring stories about how great he is \\"Look at me, look who I'm friends with\\" \\"Look who I slept with\\", ect. ect. I expected a lot more outta this book. I did however read it from cover to cover but then I threw it in the trash which I rarely do with a book. I had a couple of friends who were mildly interested in it but I told them I would be wasting there time by giving it to them. Don't buy this book, it is horriable.

He spends every chapter talking about himself and not really contributing any gossip at all. I mean, who doesn't know Mickey Rourke is a mess?AJ is merely massaging his own ego, endlessly bragging about his sexual conquests, and his limited friendships with has-been stars. To add insult to injury, he's trying hard to come across as a macho man. Well, he fails miserably. Real men don't kiss and tell. I was hoping this book would be a lot more entertaining, but it's merely a vehicle for the author to brag, brag brag about himself the silly way teenage boys do. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"We All Agree","review":"It seems everyone here all agrees that this is a lousy book and that A.J.

But everyone must understand that these people (gossip columnists) play an essential role in making celebrities into . . . . celebrities. Tabloids and columnists help careers and though they won't admit, PR agencies need the tabloids and columnists. Celebrities are whores for the notoriety. AJ shows us that. He helped made some stars into who they are today. AJ made a name for himself. He made relationships. It's all about having the relationships and the balls to capitalize on them. This book provides a somewhat entertaining insight to the NYC club world / social life from a guy who had to earn his front row seat. I wish him all the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is as sickning as A.J.'s TV appearances","review":"The ego trip this guy is on is disgusting. If you saw Politically Incorrect, you've read the book. It's all about A.J. The world revolves around HIM! There is no substance to the book, the man or his character. Having seen the girl that appeared with him on PI on Larry King the week before, I was looking forward to hearing more about her life in the Mob, but AJ's ego wouldn't let her talk! HE had to be the center of attention. His book is the same way. If I had not already read the book before seeing that show I would have had a better clue what was between the pages.

I work on oak, and cannot get the 1\\" or 1 1/4\\" brads to penetrate fully. I tried 2 hands and putting my weight into it, but still no good. The nails are very difficult to set by hand as they bend easy. When I tried to remove the brad, it would snap in half!

Since you need to use 2 hands to drive the nails (if you don't every nail will bend at about the halfway mark) you always need two people to install molding. It was a small job & I was able to get it done but still had to set about 1/2 the nails manually. Pulled it out again this week to insall some 1/4 rounds & it quit working after about a dozen nails were driven halfway into the wood. Since it was too late to return the defective T200 & being the enterprising person I am, I decided to go & purchase the same exact model & then return the old one with the current receipt. Arrow outsmarted me, the new T200 quit working after I put up 3 short pieces of 1/4 round. I think it burned up as I could smell an odor coming from the gun. Will be returning the new T200 asap.

I foolishly banked on the Arrow name. The gun fired three 1\\" brads then did absolutely nothing. Only one of the three brads penetrated the plastic baseboard and drywall into a pine 2X4. I was sure that I was the problem, but the instruction manual had no trouble-shooting section and gave no hints.I didn't have time to fool with this thing, so drove 65 mile to Lowes (again) and exchanged it for another one. Same model - same result. It fired three (3) brads then NOTHING. Still sure it must be my fault I turned to internet reviews only to find that this experience is common and the tool is JUNK.Tomorrow I will drive 65 miles to Lowes (3rd time) and return it, but I won 't get cash back because it takes Lowes 2 weeks to figure out if my originak check was good - even though I spent $6000. dollars there in the last 2 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no use for this","review":"There isn't a conceivable use for this product.

I chose the electric because of the major price saving. It worked great on soft woods: I installed skirting boards around the house without any jamming and without problems. The convenience of just being able to plug it into the nearest outlet was huge.However, when i used it on oak trim - five eighths thick, i found the inch and a quarter brads would not go all the way through; the head stuck out. 1 inch brads worked better but a couple of heads still poked up.All in all i think it's a great tool for the weekend warrior but it does lack some of the power of a pneumatic nailer."},{"rating":"2","title":"very mysterious","review":"this vol adds more foreshadowing and alot of excitement and alot of laughs-just ignore my laughs thing-. you're going to find out that hiro is going to be a big brother and find out yuki's in love with tohru-which i don't think it a very big mystery-. you get to meet kureno and see how close is mayuko shiraki-yuki,kyo,and tohru's teacher-to the sohma family. you'll discover who the short haired girl with hatori in the side pic at the end of ch 56 and the little boy who rescue little tohru."},{"rating":"2","title":"YAY!!!","review":"omg when i read the last phrase in that book i got tingles!! yuki n tohru would be so cute!! i love this series so much im madly in love with fruits basket i cant put it down!! the charecters remind me so much of my own life! i love it so mush i can really relate to some of the things their going through! i find myself adopting some of their habbits too its quit funny actually lol right now im half way through 11 you MUST read it kyos feelings finally become clear but then akito just has to- well ill just let you figure it out for yourself ^-^ but yes this is defanitly a MUST READ!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fruits Basket 10","review":"The book is in great shape, no wear and tear on the cover or any of the pages.

I found that I couldn't follow the directions for simple things like casting on, casting off, switching colour or starting a new ball, and ended up watching video demonstrations on YouTube to get the hang of all these things. Another reviewer has noted the shortcoming in the instructions -- so to speak -- for picking up a dropped stitch. Similarly, telling someone to tie the yarn ends together when swtiching colours is useless if you don't also tell them how to go about switching the yarn in the first place, nor is it clear from this book exactly how one switches needles in the middle of the project. What I do like is the stitch library, and for me the book is worth owning for that. For apparently more complex things, like cable knits, I'm going to have someone teach me in person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't heat evenly...sticks to the bottom!

I don't know if it is because of the stainless on the outside, but this cooker doesn't heat evenly at all. The temperature knob jumps by itself, too! Nice feature...NOT! The nonstick coating is VERY THIN, and things do stick to the bottom of it. I've never used metal utensils with this pan, yet the coating is peeling off. I say, don't buy it! It is very hard to control the heat to a good simmer, and with the jumping temperature knob, it really makes things worse. I would not trust leaving this alone in my home without supervision. So to sum it up...food sticks on the bottom, doesn't heat evenly, temperature control knob moves on its own, nonstick coating is thin and cheap, and peels off. This is an insult to the West Bend name!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of coating peeling","review":"I purchased one of these after having 2 of the older models which I loved. I was so disappointed in the new stainless steel version. The non stick coating bubbled up around the handle rivets and started to peel off.

It was given to me by my father-in-law and was about 20 years old. I splurged and got the most expensive one in the store thinking it would be the best. I have tried several items in it and they have all been way undercooked, even on high temps. I have to continue to cook in the oven or stove to finish it off.

I made a roast and tried to brown it on the stove before slow cooking, but my stove is a glass top and I had some problems. As the pot heated it started to spin on the glass top because it is oval shaped and my burners are round (I think that's why). So I used a bridge burner on my stove to provide more even heating and that improved the problem, but didn't eliminate the clumsiness of use completely. Second item I made was a roast using the heating element on the pot to start the browning, but it is not designed to get very hot so it didn't really brown the meat, but the food turned out great anyway. Last I made pancakes on the skillet portion and it doesn't have temperature levels so I wasn't sure how high to heat it, but I figured out a good level and that dish turned out fine as well. SO overall success was great, but feeling a bit new at the details has caused a little concern."},{"rating":"1","title":"There may be better choices","review":"The first time we tried to use this slow cooker, my wife and I learned that the bottom of the bowl bowed badly when it began to heat. Once full heating occured the surface area hitting the heat unit was so small that the cooker dangerously rocked side-to-side!

I prefer this type of slow cooker instead of a tradational Crockpot. Traditional Crockpots are heavy and food tends to stick to the stoneware insert. I like that when you prepare a roast for slow cooking that you that you are able to sear on the stove top and then put it on the base all in the same pot. Also, when your dinner is cooked you can take the pot off the base and put it on the table for serving. The teflon lined slow cooker makes for an easy clean up too! I don't usually use the bottom piece separetly as a griddle...I think it is too small for french toast or pancakes if you are cooking for a family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best slow cooker","review":"I have had the stainless non stick slow cooker with glass cover for 5 plus years.

I cannot use it anymore as it has been leaving little black pieces of the coating in the food. It is an inferior slow cooker as the inside coating should be permanently bonded with the metal of the pot and definitely should not peel off so easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what we wanted.","review":"We have had a couple of these over the last 20 years.

It was always hard to find the right temperature. So after a year we bought this West Bend. It's nicer than our last one -stainless steel. But it performs the same, which is very well. We love that we can just pick up the pot and bring it to the table. The glass lid is clear so you can easily watch whatever your cooking.

To be honest 'versatility' was the last thing on my list. I have never used a slow cooker before so was reluctant to buy the one I really liked (the All Clad one) because it cost twice the amount that this one did.When I opened the box I wasn't too impressed because I compared the pot to the quality of the All Clad pots and pans I have (not that you would get one of those for this price either). BUT, after using it for a couple of months I am quite impressed.I haven't used the pot on the hob that much, only to reduce liquid at the end of the cooking period and haven't had any of the problems listed, maybe because the pot is already hot.I don't regret my purchase at all although now I know that I am more comfortable with the concept of slow cooking I will probably buy the All Clad one if this ever breaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I've used this a few times and find it quite nice as a crock pot, lots of spare room!

By far this is the worst one as far as durability that I have owned. In the past the interior bottom of the cooker has worn and the coating has become scratched and has worn away in spots after YEARS of ownership and use. However, I have had this one far less than a year and have used it only for spaghetti sauce and heating already made beef stew, chicken/biscuits, etc. I have never used any utensils that would scratch the interior and yet there is an obvious line about 1.5 inches from the top on one side along the length of the cooker where the surface has obviously worn off. WHY would it have worn??? I have only used wooden spoons and do not stir along the cooker's interior. I have been very conscious of this one since it was very expensive compared to past prices and I intended to keep it a long time. I would not recommend this cooker in spite of the many nice features. No telling what is in the coating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Overpriced","review":"I bought this slow-cooker in Sept. 2012 and have used it three-four times per month since then. Despite the light use, the nonstick lining has flaked off around the handle rivets. I always wash it by hand, so I'm at a loss for why the nonstick lining is coming off. I expect more from a high-end product. Also, it doesn't regulate temperature well. If you have the temperature set to anything other than 'warm', the dish tends to boil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pot deforms when heated","review":"When cold, pot lies perfectly flat on the heater (or any flat surface) and makes good contact. When heated, within 15 seconds, pot deforms and makes very poor contact with the heater - it rocks noticeably back and forth when the handles are depressed. Thus things take forever to cook.

I made it as far as chapter five before I just peeked at the end to see whodunit. It was not at all surprising.

This is supported by the fact that their lyrics propagate that southerners all attend the Church of Christ, a denomination which would frown upon any song with any instrumental accompaniment. You Do Your Own Thing provides ammo to those who would criticize country music for catering only to right wing rednecks. My friends, there are better CD's to spend your money on. This non-melodic power country melodrama is as far from the roots of country as Iced-T. Just because an album includes a steel guitar, a fiddle, and some low octave country licks on the Telecaster, does not mean that it is worthy of a place alongside Waylon on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant and living","review":"I discovered Doug Anderson's collection of poetry _Blues for Unemployed Secret Police_ when he was invited to teach a poetry workshop at my high school several years ago, of which I participated in. Doug talked to us about his poetry, his experiences in Vietnam, read some of his poems (from this collection) to us, and then helped us with our own poems by providing critiques. His manner, his poetry, and his humility--as well as his willingness to come to a high school and teach to a bunch of self-important high school students. Doug's poetry is riveting, it draws you in, and its beautiful in its humility. I recommend this collection to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect transaction!","review":"The product which I received was just as it was described, and it arrived in perfect condition in a timely manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIFE AND DEATH ON THE MISSISSIPPI","review":"There is so much wrong with this disaster I don't know where to start. SOUND MIXING- horrible. You can barely hear the dialogue (which may be an unintended blessing). But if you want to hear the sound of clanking dinnerware, the click of a recording button, or mosquitoes at deafening levels, this is yourt picture!The director also uses lengthy fades to no avail and shot the film in black and white, green and white, sepia and white, and color??? The lighting is so bad you can't see what's going on, and the plot (?) is so incoherent, the movie makes no sense. And the whole thing is BOOOORING!Avoid this at all costs!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kill Me Please","review":"This film sucks balls. It's hard to hear the actors and I had to adjust my volume continuously throughout the film. Maybe if the director spent time doing his job instead of jacking off he would have noticed. I have nothing personal against homeless hippies and crack whores, but damn... the cast of this film were awful. I recommend setting yourself on fire other than watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beneath the Mississippi","review":"This looked like it might be a somewhat decent movie, if you could hear it.

The movie is so dark, choppy and confusing. They rarely speak throughout the film and and the sound is off. I can't say enough how this movie is a waste of time. If there was a zero on this rating it would be less than that. It is not even the kind of bad movie you can't help but watch and laugh at it. So disappointing! Insult to film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beneath the Mississippi","review":"I wish I had read the other reviews before this. I made it through half of the movie- I was watching it on headphones while everyone else played a game. I kept making so many \\"omg this movie is so bad\\" noises that kids were coming over to check it out and laugh at it also. I have no idea what was going on, the film was really hard to see and to hear- and it had no plot. I thought it was a documentary- I still don't know what it was! I sure hope they just remove this movie as a choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read series!","review":"Excellent reading!

No matter how many times I've heard this song, I just can't help but to laugh out loud. Perhaps it's because she's actually trying to sing rock, maybe it's because she's singing with guitars and not crappy drum machines, or maybe, just maybe this is the song that shows Samantha for what she really is, a big breasted, blond, British, bimbo (that's a lot of B's) that sizzled her way from Page 3 to the airwaves.Hey I like Sammy, I really do. She's sexy and beautiful, all of her albums had at least two or three songs that I liked, and who didn't make out with their girlfriends in the back seat of their dad's car with Ms. Fox on the radio? Sam is what she is and we love her for it. I'd put her up against flat chested Britany any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aural exploitation","review":"Sex sells.

I was two years old when this came out.The songs are fun ,but the ones that sound the best for this year are: TOUCH ME, DO YA DO YA WANNA PLEASE ME, ROCKIN' THE CITY,and HE'S GOT SEX.

Too late to return it, according to the Amazon return rules, so I guess it goes in the trash. Sometimes it will start, but once I set it face down to sand, it just stops. Not very powerful, either, much like a 5 inch, so I'll buy a stronger one next time. But maybe not a Bosch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Heavy Heavy","review":"Excellent sander, but not a palm sander. If you try sanding old fascia still hanging with this one, you are either a world class weight lifter or you won't succeed.

Good tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with this sander","review":"I've had this sander for about a year. I purchased this based on the many glowing reviews. In general, this is a high quality unit. The spin-break went out almost immediately. The spin-break is the thing that keeps the sanding disc from spinning out of control. I'm hoping that they get this unit back to me soon as I need a 6 inch for work around the house.The reviews stating that the unit sands smoothly as well as the dust collection are accurate. I highly recommend the thin vacuum hose if this item is purchased. Regardless, if the sander doesn't get fixed, it's not much use.3 year update....I received the unit back from repair, and the sanding disc started spinning out of control almost immediately. I sent this item back to the factory for repair, so there should be no question of who was working on it. I still have the sander but simply can't use it like this. Did I get a lemon??"},{"rating":"2","title":"best 6\\" sander for the price","review":"I'm a professional woodworker making furniture and cabinets, this is my second Bosch sander, the first one lasted 4 years being used almost every day!! so I'm happy with that.(I could still fix it if I wanted too)This is an awsome sander for the price, dust pickup is great, I use my mostly with a vaccum and there is almost no dust.

Rigid is Way better and made in Germany compared to Bosch ( not sure but it seems it is made in China ).Rigid is a high end sander at low price and I felt I paid too much for bosch..Try Rigid 6\\" and you will be lot happy for flattening joint boards, panels and lot more.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool for the price","review":"I just finished 3 hours of sanding on a 70 year old oak floor that has never been refinished. Full of pits, scratches, nail holes, splinters, old varnish ect.. and believe it or not some knuckle-head years ago even starting painting a large corner of the rooms floor with white primer. Using 80 grit paper this thing ate through the old finish and paint like a champ. After 3 hours my arms and hands feel fine, no tingling or numbness, smooth and easy one hand operation. Changing my grip on the tool to different hands and different positions during operation was seamless and comfortable, it was actually a pleasure to use this thing. As long as I emptied the hepa filter dust catcher regularly dust kick-up was minimal. This is one of the few tools I've bought that I was 100% satisfied with."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I wanted...","review":"I have read all three of Garcia-Aguileras other books, and liked them all. The only thing I liked about this book was visiting Miami and hearing from Lupe again. The story was just not believable. Many questions were left unanswered and I felt unfulfilled when I finished the book. For example, Lupe goes through the trouble to apply (and get accepted) to a retreat at the nunnery, and then she never goes, and it is not addressed again. Hmmmm? We never find out why the murderer feels the way he does about Cuba, or why the triplets are under his power. I would definely read the next Lupe Solano mystery because I think Garcia-Aguilera has great potential, but this book was not a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read and enjoyed the previous books in this series, and this one is a big disappointment.

For a contemporarty (he is twenty years younger than this reviewer) reading his stories reverts one to long forgotten times, when fiction was just that - a product of fantasy.These well translated stories, dealing with absolutely fictive persons and events, are a pure delight. They take the reader back into times, when chivalry ruled, when sad facts were just that. They are highly recommended particularly for a reader overfed with infantile fantasies of writers who aim at youth, but are careful not to step on any or most facts of life.A book to be read for its pure pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Get One of These For Your Car!","review":"Along with it being handy to store toys, it is also wonderful to protect your seat from unfortunate spills and sickness.

Not only was this one of the most fascinating women I have ever read about, but she and her husband together, moved in circles with the \\"shakers and movers\\" of their generation. All of the famous Bostonians you hear about in historical lore were a part of their lives. Henry L. Higginson, who started the BSO was married to Belle's college roommate. John Singer Sargeant, was one of her closest friends and painted her twice. They were related to the Lowell's the Peabody's and the list goes on. Her museum, in Boston, (Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum) is one of the treasures of the art world. Her taste so impeccable that her museum was chosen for one of the most famous art robberies in recent years.

But this book was not up to her usual standards. Combine an over use of superfluous adjectives with a weak story line and an unexplained passage of time by the end of the book you earned five stars just for sticking with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ramses and Nefret are just too annoying...","review":"I am a big fan of the Amelia Peabody series, but this book I could have done without. I am having a hard time caring too much about Nefret, who comes off as totally spoiled. And Ramses...what happened to all his charm? He's now just a sullen taciturn young man without emotional intelligence or maturity.Sigh...I miss Amelia and Emerson!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly disappointed, yet still hooked","review":"It's a mark of something Elizabeth Peters has done right that I can't wait for the next book, but I find myself irritated and disappointed with the forced ending. Nefret's actions were completely out of character, and Ramses has become a little wooden man--would that he could have some endearing character flaw, like Emerson's temper, or Amelia's stubborness! Ramses is painted like a saint and Nefret, like a silly Victorian piece of fluff, nervous breakdown and all.The mystery in the series is paling (how many times can Amelia be shot at in the desert--and missed? how many tombs can be robbed?) and the romance only works if we care about--and believe in the integrity of--the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Betrayed at the Portal","review":"I can't help it - I have to put my two cents in. I finished this book 3 days ago and can't get it out of my mind. The plot was vintage Peters, but the emotional wollop of this book was, I feel, a new device for her. I simultaneously wanted to throw it away AND buy the sequel as soon as possible. I appreciate all the other readers' comments. I've read 20-30 of the other reviews and find soalce in them. I do not feel alone in my emotional tantrum. Amazon -please, please try to interview Ms. Peters - I would really like to understand why she sandbagged the plot of Ramses and Nefret. I'm feeling that she betrayed characters her readers have grown to love over many years. I only hope the ususal wit and genious of her plot machinations will come to light and explain it all in the sequel(I for one, won't be satisfied with anything less). I'm rooting for Ramses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too upsetting!","review":"As a true lover of the Amelia Peabody series, I found this one to be far too upsetting, not to mention the unfinished dilemmas. I cried shamelessly over the loss of Abdullah in an earlier book, but found this one to be much worse. What has happened to Nefret's intelligence? Are Amelia and Emerson getting too old to participate in the adventures? One of the main attractions for me in this series is the humor- what's happened to it? Let's hope the next one gets back on track!"},{"rating":"1","title":"-The Falcon at the Portal","review":"While I've only read three of the Amelia Peabody Mystery's by Peters' (and totally enjoyed each one) this paticular book left me with a sour taste for the book series. The situation with Nefret and Ramases is sad. And Nefret is made out to be well to lack of a better term a \\"Hussy\\". I want to read the next book in the series but I don't want to be let down again.I hope that the mystery and allure of \\"The Ape that Gaurds the Balance\\" my favorite in this series so far comes back in the next book. After all it's the mystery that is what brought me to these books and well maybe the romantic life of Amelia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Amelia Peabody !","review":"This series DOES go in order & progresses through the life & adventures of Peabody & Emerson. Do start with Crocodile on the Sandbanks and work your way through the series in the correct order. I expect each book is stand-alone excellent, but it's more fun to read through in order. The series is about a wealthy Victorian lady who decides to travel. She ends up in Egypt & meets an Egyptologist & falls in love & marries him. The rest is one adventure after another. You will learn some Egyptology along the way as well. Great series. Check ameliapeabody dot com to get the series in order & learn more. It will make you want to go to Egypt !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good one for the series","review":"I very much enjoy this series. Nice twists and surprises in this one! The give and take between characters oftens makes me laugh out loud - love it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ramses and Nefret do NOT belong together!","review":"I'm one of those very few people who feel that Ramses and Nefret just shouldn't be together. It's too pat, and Nefret just has no substance. She's a fluffhead, and Ramses deserves much more than that. I keep hoping it's just a passing fancy, but I guess maybe it's not. I kept hoping Nefret would end up with David, but I guess that's shot. Anyway, the only reason I gave this book less than five stars are because of Nefret's ridiculous actions. There's not enough of the interplay between Peabody and Emerson, because that's what make the previous books such fun!! I miss the Master Criminal, and I keep hoping to see him pop up again. I loved the intro of Sennia, it makes Ramses more human, and I love the way Peters explored the often prickly but deep relationship of Ramses and Peabody. Absolutely wonderful!!! I cannot wait until the next book to see how everything turns out! Keep up the great work, Ms. Peters and thank you so much for these great books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh so perfect(ly) BORING","review":"This might be the end of myaffair with Amelia.

Couldn't stand the ending (though the rest of the story was great!) because of all of the loose ends. I guess it just gives Peters another book to tie it all together in! Great book, leaves you hanging, but altogether another Peter's mystery caught in the folds of Egyptology."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is really only part 1","review":"For devoted Peters fans, this book is hard to read: well-loved characters are put through Hell, and it has an ambiguous ending.New readers of this book need to realize that it's not really a stand-alone novel. It's volume one of a two-volume book, with HE SHALL THUNDER IN THE SKY the second part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter disappointment","review":"I know that there is no guarantee of a happy ending in real life. However, I had been lulled into expecting a happy ending in Elizabeth Peters' Amelia Peabody series (at least for the main characters). Wrong again. What was even worse, was that the behavior that brought about the unhappiness was completely contradictory to all previous character development. (I'm not being specific so as not to give away the story.) I was bitterly disappointed in this installment.On the positive side, I get the impression that the author may be planning a spin off series with Ramses as the lead. An undercover agent of the police force?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Already read it.","review":"This was a book I read years ago, but it was presented as new.

Having said that, I didn't like Nefret marrying Geoffrey. I thought she was smarter than that. I hope all is made right in the next book. Other than that, Good Job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super book","review":"I rarely read mysteries, I prefer novels like THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, or Oprah's books, or even the occaisional Grisham book, but Elizabeth Peters is such a wonderful tellewr of tales and plots her mysteries so superby that I simply Can't help but read her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have never liked the character of Nefret. I wish it had never been introduced to the Peabody series. I hope the future books are better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"And We Have Another Winner!","review":"I'm not sure how she does it, but Ms. Peters/Michaels has created yet another sparkling addition to the Amelia Peabody series. The action is swift, the dialogue witty, and the mystery intriguing. Oh, yeah, and there's the Ramases and Nefret thing. Acctualy, I believe that one of the promos for HE SHALL THUNDER IN THE SKY was \\"Nefret and Ramases; will they or won't they?\\" How appropriate! But I can't say anything more; you shall just have to purchase the book and line Ms. Peters's pockets with more well deserved green backs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"Up until now I have loved every one of the Amelia Peabody mysteries. They were clever, funny and upbeat, more comedic than dramatic. I found that the first half of this book was true to form but once Ramses and Nefret finally understood each other it took a definite turn for the worse. What I expected to be a light hearted book turned into a tragic, unbelievable drama. Nefret behaved completely out of the character that had previously been developed for her. I was very disappointed that a series I have always enjoyed reading for escapism should take such a harsh turn to reality. If I want to read about lovers separated by misunderstanding I will read biographies! I won't read another one in this series until and unless Elizabeth Peters returns this series to its roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed emotion","review":"How could this happen? I have been a loyal follower to this series for a long time and then this? I have always loved Ramses and reading this book broke my heart over and over again. He deserves love and happiness too. I was completly shocked at how Nefret behaved in this book like some spoiled selfish brat. At some points in this depressing story I felt like crying or throwing the book up against the wall. After I finished the book I couldn't sleep at all, the cliff hanger left me excited for the next book but also sad because what this series has become. Hopefully the next book will be what many have come to expect from the Peabody Emerson gang, action, suspense, crime, togetherness, and most of all a happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pace is a bit slow, end a bit disappointing.","review":"The Amelia Peabody mysteries are always a treat, and this is another satisfactory addition to the series. My sole criticisms are that the pace was unusually slow up to about the last quarter of the book, and I would have enjoyed a happier ending. Obviously, the ending of this book is meant to set the stage for the next book in the series, but a bit more positive closure in certain relationships would have been welcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"A change is needed in the format of the Amelia Peabody books","review":"I have loved Amelia and her parasol from the first book in the series, Crocodile on the Sandbank. However, the latest entry falls curiously flat. All the familiar characters are present -- Emerson, Selim, Nefret, Ramses, David, etc. And there's an Egyptian mystery to be solved. But it never works the way it should. Changing from Peabody's first person to Manuscript H to Nefret's letters becomes tiresome. If Ramses and Nefret are to carry the series, let them tell the whole story, and allow Peabody to sit back. Or just let Peabody and her parasol take charge the way they should. I'm looking forward to the next book because there were too many loose ends in this one. And I hope the next installment returns to the quality of the earlier books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad turn for E. Peters","review":"I eagerly picked up the book with the expectation of a good reading, and was sorely disappointed. I have read all the previous volumes, enjoying the light tone, the banter and the eccentricity of Amelia and Co. This last effort is stilted and artificial, with too much melodrama; it reads like a cheap soap opera. It seems like Ms. Peters has tried to increase the emotional content of her work, with the result of making the story unbelievable and unpalatable.E. Peters stories are enjoyable because they don't have the high pressure of a story \\"a la Stephen King\\", and certainly a more pleasant athmoshpere. I agree with some of the other reviewers in considering this book a terrible faux-pas. Conan-Doyle had Holmes disappear in the waterfall...maybe Amelia should have been crushed within a pyramid?I am very sorry that I did not wait for the book to be in the library, but instead bought the hard-cover. For the next one, I'll wait until it will be on the shelves of our local branch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd Waited for the Paperback!","review":"In her most recent Amelia Peabody books, including this one, the author has used an annoying literary device of breaking the momentum of the narrative to insert \\"Manuscript\\" and diary segments from other characters. Why she doesn't just spin the next generation of characters into another series, instead of diluting the otherwise still-alluring plot and setting, is a mystery. I bought this book, as all the others, in hardback. The next book will either be borrowed from a library or purchased at a paperback exchange, and my money will go for another more deserving new mystery writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much like all the others on the shelves","review":"The Amelia series used to be unique in that it was fresh, witty, and fun to read. I couldn't find any others like it. I eagerly awaited each new book and reread previously published ones over and over. Now it's just another book on the shelf just like all the others. The reason I loved the Amelia series was because it WAS so different. I hate the turn this series has taken...just like I hate all the other books on the shelf and the soap operas on TV. We don't need another series full of dull, flat melodrama and \\"sexual tension\\". There are PLENTY of those on the shelves already. PLEASE, Ms. Peters, go back to your original fresh and witty style. The new story plots are too nauseating. I don't buy and read other authors' books PRECISELY BECAUSE they write books like these last few Amelia books. I didn't like this book and I won't be buying any more if they continue in this manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best.","review":"Unlike some readers who have written in, I loved this book. I like watching the children grow up and coming into their own. And yes, the last 1/4 of the book was sad, but then that's life. I hate books where everyone is goody two shoes and everything is always rosy all the time. I think Elizabeth Peters has done a fine job with her characters.I also thought her mystery this time around was much better. A few of the last books left me kind of bored with what was going on. This time, she was back in good form.Can't wait for the next book in this series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amelia is back in fine form.","review":"I keep waiting in vain for Elizabeth Peters to disappoint me. This was a well written, carefully plotted adventure with an amazingly successful villain.The period and atmosphere are skilfully evoked by this past mistress of her craft. Amelia is as delightful as ever as she holds high the banner of female emancipation. I hope that trailing romantic ends will be neatly tied in the eagerly anticipated sequel to this book. Why doesn't the key romantic protagonist admit that he doesn't understand women and ask for someone's advice?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A BOOK YOU LOVE TO HATE!","review":"Hi Peabody fans! I found this book disturbing. After so many years of jolly adventures wrapped up neatly and happily at the end of each book, we get hit with major punch in the stomach.

I applaud the author's talent in making us care about the characters so much that their pain is our pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotions run wild...","review":"I know a lot of people had problems with this book...er, actually with Nefret's actions in this book. I however, loved it! The intense pain and hurt that came from those actions were so real...I felt Amelia's shock and pain. I think it changed the characters in a world that was rapidly changing around them. No one could stay behind as this Great War began to sweep a world along with it.On another note, I absolutely adored the story of Sinuhe. The parallels to Nefret were astounding...I think that she still is making her journey as Sinuhe at the end of this book. One can almost see the pain that she feels, still searching for her way \\"home.\\" Elizabeth Peters is the grand master of the extended metaphor, but this time she truly outdid herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reason for return","review":"We returned this item as the legs were so small.

Duvivier's dark film is one our most atmospheric mysteries, exuding an almost paranoic tension. Gabin (like younger countryman Gerard Depardieu), is not classically handsome, but possessed of a rugged allure that women find unable to resist. At the same time, Balin is pretty irresistible herself, definitely a woman worth taking chances for. See Gabin's charisma at its height in the incomparable \\"Pepe\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Believable","review":"I'm afraid that I was disappointed by this 1936 movie of French gangsters in the Casbah. I suppose this was a copy of American gangster movies, but Jean Gabin as a suddenly love sick hard guy willing to risk prison for a pretty face is not believable. In fact, none of the characters seemed realistic. They were almost cartoonish. Humphrey Bogart or James Cagney in their 1930's gangster movies were far more realistic and their films hold up better. Because Gabin's love for Juline Duvivier is not developed, we can not understand why Pepe would give up the sexy life he has in his exotic world. The best part of the movie is Pepe's walk to the harbor. The camera follows him from behind and from unusual angles and cuts. There is a Citizen Kane feeling in these shots. The gritty tear scene at the end is interesting also. Technically this movie is not up to American Gangster movies, but you can see the influence on Godard in the 50's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Le Pew, I Agree.","review":"One reviewer claimed this higly overrated film was the inspiration for Pepe Le Pew, the Looney Tunes cartoon character. I don't know if there is any truth to his claim, but I would say the Le Pew association works on another level: This film stinks! I hate everything about it, including its overdone art design, its terrible (and way too melodramatic) acting, its dreadful pacing and its derivative storyline. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute case and cute color too!","review":"The case is really cute and the red color is fantastic. Will definitely stand out and get a mention in all gatherings! It fits my SD450 like a glove. It will be too tight for the SD550. There is a pocket inside for an SD card (possibly) but I bought the 1GB card so I don't need it. The leather is hard and of great quality so if I was carrying the camera in the case in my hand I would not be afraid of holding too tight or damaging it with the slightest knock. To top it all it has the Canon logo and a belt loop of the same red leather at the back. The only reason the case gets 4 stars is because it have to thread the strap into the hole in the middle of the case each time or it would not close. So taking out the camera will take a couple of seconds more. Overall I love the case for it's protection factor and the 'perfect fit'. The case even fits nicely in my teeny purse so I can take my camera everywhere I go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Case","review":"Case is perfect for protecting my Canon ELPH. It has a belt loop for attaching to your belt and a hole in the top for pulling the cord through. It also is magnetic so you don't have to worry about it coming apart and losing your camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy such a product","review":"Small interior for the devices it is meant to protect.

The interior is also hard , not soft for such devices."},{"rating":"2","title":"great camera case","review":"Just what I expected, since this is the second one I have purchased. I have one, and bought a camera and this case for my daughter. The case protects the camera lcd screen, but is still small enough to fit in a pocket or easily in a purse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to stretch out the case","review":"This case is a tight fit on my sd600. I put a PDA screen protector over the LCD screen of the sd600, and the case was so tight that it eventually peeled off the edge of the screen protector after the third use. I eventually solved the problem by leaving the handle of a fat screwdriver in the case overnight. The next day the case was stretched out enough so that there was some leeway between the case and the camera. Now it works fine. The case NOT soft leather. It is somewhat sturdy and firm--good protection against soft knocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a red hot case for your camera","review":"I purchased this case for my Canon elph 600 digital camera and it fit like a glove. It is red ,sexy and fits in my purse. It looks very elegant and expensive looking, plus protects your camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful but too compact","review":"I love the color, but the lack of place to put anything else (like a spare battery or additional memory card) is very inconvinent. Other than that, this leather case looks sharp, very stylish and wonderful to carry it around and show it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Cute!","review":"\\"Too cute,\\" is what everyone always says when they see my SD 450 tucked into this red leather case. It is a perfect fit for the camera, though there is no room for an extra battery or card. But since this is a tiny camera that I use for on-the-go shooting, I really don't need to carry these extras.I also love the matching wrist strap that comes with it. Our camera looks very unique (I can always tell which is mine when sitting on a table with other's cameras at parties), and the wrist strap is a must for safety. I give the case and strap a 4 of 5 rating only because I'm not crazy about the way the strap feeds through the case. While I like that I get the use of a wrist strap when the camera is in the case, it is kind of annoying to feed and unfeed the strap when I'm trying to quickly access the camera. Overall, it's a small annoyance, but does keep this case from ultimate perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Case","review":"I fell in love with this case when I first saw it here on Amazon, and chose the red case, even though the black case with the battery was a better deal. As other reviewers said, the case perfectly fits my SD200, even with the rigid LCD protector on it from 'da Products (which is a must-have for the SD series).The leather is high quality, and beautifully finished. I love the matching strap, and though it is a little stiff, I'll find a way to break it in.There is definitely NO room for anything else in the case; I think even an extra card might be pushing it, but I wanted a small, portable camera. To me, it seems like carrying extra batteries and cards with you defeats the purpose of having a tiny portable point-and-shoot, anyway. Go pick up a large memory card and have an extra battery handy that's charged and ready and you're always good to go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slim and sexy","review":"This case is drop-dead gorgeous and is a perfect fit for the Canon Ixy 60 that I bought for my girlfriend (equivalent to the Ixus 55 and SD450 models outside of Japan). She absolutely loves the red colour and the genuine leather smell. It fits perfectly around the camera, and the included matching leather strap just perfects the package.The only improvement that my girlfriend thought of is if there could be a way that the strap can be made to \\"tether\\" the camera to the case so that when taking pictures it won't get left behind or lost.We came up with our own solution by attaching a (matching) chrome keyring to the end of the strap so that it doesn't fit through the hole when the strap usually \\"escapes\\", which means that camera and case will never be separated, and you can still carry the camera on your wrist both in and out of the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but not perfect","review":"I just bought the red case for my SD300. It's a very nice, solid case, but it's pretty thick and does make your camera a lot bulkier (although it fits inside perfectly). The top flap has a magnetic button closure, but the whole flap is very, very stiff. It doesn't easily open all the way, so I have to be careful not to let the snap on the underside of the flap scratch my camera as I take it in and out. And the red strap that the case comes with is too cumbersome if you actually use it on the camera. The strap gets stuck in the hole in the flap when you try to take it out. The regular strap that the camera comes with works much better with this case, as it will slide in and out of the hole pretty smoothly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does not fit the SD500 but its a nice case","review":"The SD500 does not fit in this case at all. Sure you can force it in but you can't get it out in under 5 seconds. On top of that, the flap won't shut when the camera is in there. The case looks cool, seems like it would be nice but unfortunately does not fit the SD500."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay a bit more and get something good","review":"This one is hard leather with sharp corners and does not feel comfortable in my pocket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera protector","review":"I have been very pleased with this camera holder and the amount of protection it offers for my camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect fit for my SD600","review":"This case is just right for my Canon SD600.

Soft inner casing protects the camera screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact","review":"One thing I worry about the most is the inside button, I always concern the steel part of inner side of the button could scratch the surface of the camera, although I don't see any yet, but, this part can be improved to ease people's minds. I still rate it 4"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing little case","review":"Just received this case and it is really nice. The top quality leather resembles a fine wallet and is very classy looking. The clasp is not only magnetic, but snaps shut as well which I really like. My Canon SD600 fits this case like a glove and adds hardly any bulk to the camera at all. My only concern (and the reason it gets 4 stars instead of a perfect 5) is that the inside isn't lined with as soft a material as I would have liked to have seen. Still, it provides nice protection and I don't think this will be an issue as far as scratching my camera or the LCD screen (but I'm getting an LCD screen protector just to be safe). I also looked at the Lowepro Slider 20 but once I saw that one in person at Circuit City it was way too bulky and downright unattractive. The PCS-90 is a great choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tight fit","review":"Looks good, but barely fits the described cameras with no room for xtra memory cards.

Flipping through, I found only one recipe I would consider trying.The chapters are short with very few true low carb recipes. Mostly fruits, desserts, a few vegetable dishes and maybe a dozen pages of beef, pork and poultry. And far too much use of splenda. Many recipes come straight from a newer version of Atkins, where cottage cheese and tofu are fillers, fat is avoided and even savory dishes have a packet of artificial sweetener.Definitely not worth the $12.50 at the used store and I hope I have swayed you from paying almost ten times that price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this, or from this vendor","review":"I received my AVR147 in late August.

I have to turn off the receiver and turn it back on.3) The surround-sound setup proceedure with the supplied microphone did not work when the microphone was where my head would be. I had to put the micrphone where my feet would be. Even then, the proceedure was very simplistic compared to the Yamaha tune-up proceedure.The unit sounds about the same as other receivers I have used. Others just work better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best 5.1 channel receiver","review":"I bought this receiver few months ago and understood the difference between cheap 5.1 channel receiver and top of the line 5.1 channel receiver.

This product is terrible. You would think that it would be a great product since it comes from the manufacturer of the hardware that fits in it. This is not so. The camera is not revealed. You have to unsnap the top strap and fold down the back falp to use the Camera. You have to unsnap it whenever you need to to beam or receive a beam. Unsnapping it will eventually lead to you forgetting to snap it back and you will drop the Treo 650 sooner or later. The top right corner is not covered. If you drop it while it is in the case the corner is not protected. Krusell makes a better case than PalmOne."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID if you want to wear this with the belt clip","review":"I've owned this case for about a year. I think it's an attractive case. However the snap that holds the Treo in the case is weak and has opened many times causing the Treo to fall out and land on the ground. In addition to dinging the Treo, this has led to styli falling out and occasionally getting lost.I do NOT recommend this case if you intend to wear your Treo using the belt clip because the snap is too weak. If you're keeping it in your purse or briefcase, it should be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enhanced with Music","review":"I was hoping for pure, simple bird songs.

Incidentally, passe what has been said elsewhere, the Nazis were not at all oppposed to the setting up of a jewish state in Palestine. On the contrary, it accorded with Nazi beliefs that Jews were \\"foreigners\\" in Germany and needed their \\"own\\" territory, being incompatible with any country they settled in.

Is it the lowly Palestinian people, run out of their homeland, persecuted and oppressed, denied basic human rights and dignity; or is it an American client state armed to the teeth, engaging in routine political assasinations adn massacres? Ok, a trick question, but dramatising B-G as some modern day Biblical hero is pure obfuscation, as is this book. Someone refers to B-G as a modern day JOshua reclaiming Canaan. Fine, but the \\"reconquest\\" of Canaan was, acording to the Old Testament, an act of genocide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Author's comments","review":"Instead of the confrontational process of traditional rules of order, I used a negotiation of consensus procedure. My years of service in cooperatives, churches, service clubs, and other membership organizations showed me how people of good will can make democratic decisions together. I set forth the exact procedures to use to avoid hostilities and to apply the most brain power to any problem a group may face. I also describe in detail the responsibilities of the officers of membership organizations. I tell how to organize a new co-op or other organization and include guidelines for writing -- or re-writing -- your articles of incorporation and bylaws. I show how you can consider every possible solution to a problem, instead of limiting your discussion to the one idea in a main motion. This is a practical guide, not a technical manual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar Cases","review":"Just what my son needed. These cases are great.

When I visited the state in the summer of 2004, I found the mountains and valleys breathtaking and the old mining facilities made me appreciate the ruggedness of the Europeans who first settled in the region. However, I was also surprised at how flat and fertile the eastern section was. The plains region reminded me of my home state of Iowa.In this book, Muench presents the disparity of environments that exist in Colorado in images. He also captures the different expressions seen in all four seasons, which is something I clearly could not experience in one short visit. The beauty of the photos makes me want to visit three more times, once for each of the seasons that I missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Mane","review":"I wanted to try a new shampoo that was different - this one lathers great & smells really nice too.

Eventually we did, and it's a fine transfer of the show. We haven't watched any of the bonus features yet, just making our way through the episodes again. What makes this show unique is the combination of live re-enactors, computer generated reenactments, and the two presenters going live to the actual battlefields and doing some simulations of the technology of the time. The father/son team do a great job presenting the show in a fun but informative manner, and it's kind of fun seeing the dad taking advantage of his son sometimes, making him do the dirty work. Apparently the son didn't want to work with his dad originally, and you can see some of that in their interactions sometimes.

Again, a romance posing as a mystery. Excerpt \\"She loved him so much. He surely must love her, too. She was much more than his eager protege; she felt his exhaustion, fully understood his commitment\\". However, she apparently did not feel the fact that he was in love and sleeping with Delores.

The author is a professor, and the book is written as such. People seeking \\"warm fuzzies\\" from reading a book about rediscovering classical Christianity are not going to find it here. They will instead find a powerful look at the way that classical Christianity can be drawn upon to reenergize the church, specifically the evangelical church, and make it a more dynamic force in the world as the body of Christ.

Instead he played it as a bumbling, stuttering, cuckolded fool. It isn't the character that I object to; it's the way Conti played it that is irritating. Francesca Annis held her own, to be sure, but it's because of Conti's ridiculous portrayal of Monsieur Bovary that I could only give this mini-series a 1 star rating. It's difficult to feel anything but contempt for Madame Bovary but it's because of the character and not Annis' acting. I'd avoid this one and find another dvd that tells the story. It can't be any worse than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"Did a great job of resealing the firebox in my fireplace.

Anyone attempting to use the recipes is likely to seriously harm themselves (i.e., blow themselves up with a faulty explosive, or poison themselves with badly made drugs). Further, the concept of violent action to bring social change is the worst possible assault to the anarchist ideal, as it forces the will of the anarchist on others, while anarchy is a philosophy based on individual liberty. Besides, the more subversive violence enacted, the tighter the fist of the politicians. As a serious guide for the anarchist, I'd recommend Rebels and Devils, ed. by Christopher Hyatt, the Illuminatus!

Sounds crazy I know but this is just something I do. I was extremely disappointed with the contents. It seemed as if 90% of the book was a \\"how to\\" manual on bombs and/or expolsives. There was a very brief segment on legal \\"drugs\\" or narcotics and how, where, quantity, etc. Other than that, there was very, very little substance to this popular book. I don't know what I was expecting but something a little more subversive and anti-establishment, whatever that may be. I imagine that since the advent of the world wide web, the contents of the book can be found much easier online and this book will soon, if not already, be outdated and blaise.

If the book's steps are followed, one will end up with nitrotriodite, which is extremely volatile and can explode at the touch of a finger.

The book written in protest of the Viet-Nam War was being used by a Green Beret veterain of that same war to train us who might be leading troops in, yes, that same war. The irony speaks for itself. I understand that William Powell no longer agrees with what he wrote as a young man, and symphathise with the plight of an artist who has lost control of his work. However, I am glad (and somewhat suprised) that this is still available. Not only is it an important sociological piece of the period, but it is filled with information that could be useful if (god forbid) things ever hit the fan. That same ROTC instructor told me time and again, \\"Better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it,\\" so this book gets a space on my shelf just in case.

Edward is a dissatisfied emu, always thinking that he's missing out on something better just over in the next zoo enclosure. Eventually, of course, he learns that being what he is is the best thing for him. The up-close style of the drawings brings every feather, every hair, every expression right into your lap.

Though more unique than some, Jesse's chops are reminiscent of almost every typical ex-boy band singer: bland and whiny. It's apparent his old and new female fans come in droves mainly because he's good-looking, but is there any substance behind his sound? Maybe, but it's harder to see behind that blonde, blue-eyed poster pin-up image. One thing that makes Jesse McCartney better than some of his peers, though, is that he co-wrote some tracks on his debut, including the title and No. 1 hit.

Any kind of music is better than this. Rap, hard rock, soft rock, R&B, reggae, even heavy metal. $10 said that as bad as the lyrics to this song are, he didn't write them, because he probably doesn't even know how to. He's probably just like Derek Zoolander from the hilarious Ben Stiller movie, 'cept he's like that in real life. Listen to some music with meaninful lyrics, and good instuments, and stuff made by people with TALENT!!

All the songs pretty much show through to his youth, and need of new style and maturity. He is definitely drawn towards N*Sync style. I think he just needs to slow down and leave behind his Disney/Sugar-pop effects.One song I will give credit to is \\"Beautiful Soul\\". That is a wonderful song, he gives his vocals an extra push, and he reveals the sweeter side. The rest is ultimately geared toward the \\"Dirty Pop\\" crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"noticed something","review":"did you all know that jesse mccartney's song \\"Come to Me\\" is the EXACT same song as Plus One's \\"Let Me be the One\\" which came out a couple years ago??? if you think i'm lying, go ckeck it out. the song is in the album \\"Obvious\\". i just think that's totally messed up."},{"rating":"1","title":"......................................","review":"Forget Jesse McCartney.

Some People say Jesse is a foney but I may be obsessed with Jesse but I say he is no foney. He is hot but that does not mader because his music is take your breth away kinda stuff. He is amazing and a great roll model. I have read so many aticles about him and know so much about him that he is like a to me brother. Man,I wish my brother was like Jesse. But I do not recond this cd for children under the age of 8 years old because They may not under stand some words. Jesse does not cuss but uses bigger words. So before buy this cd for a child under 8 years old think if the child is mature for it.Thats all I have to say ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Let Down","review":"I purchased this disc as a 'amazon also recommended'.

Unfortunately, that's it. Jesse's voice is whiny and croaky. You can tell it has been digitally remastered and he may be lip-sinking.\\"Beautiful Soul\\" was ok. \\"Come to me\\" was discusting.

He has basically no vocal talent at all, and he is ugly, his mouth is so small, and he is UGLY!!!!. And not to mention his video for beautiful soul!, he took his shirt off!!!! How can he do such a thing!!!!! He thinks that by showing his hairy armpits will increase his cd sales? He makes me sick, he is like a male britney spears, except he starts off bad. He makes me sick. Buy some other bubble gum pop, because this one is not nice consume, (that was a pun, because when you buy something, you are consuming, and you eat = consume bubble gum, and bubbe gum pop is the genre of this cd).

Well...The sound of the songs on the album is okay. A good blend of smooth, uplifting pop/r&b; that radio is missing these days. But a song is more than just itself: a lot of it comes from what the artist delivers. Jesse McCartney has probably THE most WHINY voice I have EVER heard from ANY artist who has gained as much popularity as him. Consequently, the CD is very unpleasant to listen to. Vocally the artist has barely anything. Also, judging from the lyrics to some songs, it sounds like a 13 year old should be singing instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!","review":"Worst cd I have ever heard. I heard it, and ti honestly made me wanna go puke. Whoever likes it must be gay, or mentally retarded! His voice is like somebody scratching nails on a chalkboard.

A PERSON WITH LARYNGITIS COULD SING WAY BETTER THAN THAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I am a 17 year old girl and I love this album. I read some of the reviews before actaully buying the album. I was suprised to see that many of them were negative. I still bought the album though. I thought for sure Jesse would be some Aaron Carter wannabe (aaron cant sing) who couldnt sing like him. But i was pleasntly suprised when I heard the songs on this album. Yes.. some of them are a bit tennie but most pop is teenie. Many are saying the kid cant sing but I disagree. I think his voice is actually quite good. Yeah he needs a little work but so does every artist out there. If your looking for something fresh then this album is a most."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe im the one with issues......","review":"but i dont find him that attractive.and i know that no one likes him for just his music, and that it is more for his looks that seems to appeal to his ten year old fanbase.but personally, i'd be less susprised if guys were attracted to him because of his extremely girly nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Think He's a Girl.","review":"This little boy is stupid.

I think some of these songs aren't too bad (my niece has this), but he's not worth all of the hype. The songs are repetitive and his voice isn't great in range. Quite frankly, in my opinion this album would never have gotten released if it weren't for his acting job and the teeny boppers opinion that he is even somewhat remotely good looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"EWWWWWWWWWWWW","review":"Jesse McCartney is soooooo ugly and he cannot sing! i am sry to offend anyone but its the total truth.

Either way, they've pulled the right strings and acquired Jesse a fanbase of screaming teenage girls. I admit I do like the song 'Beautiful Soul\\", as well as a few other ballads amongst the mix... although many of the tracks seem to propose that Jesse is read to be the next Justin Timberlake.

The truth is that he is never going to become famous. He is the epitomy of the end of male pop. Aaron carter was first, then this idiot. What is the world coming to? Is it the new craze for teenage boys to record cds? I cant see how anyone likes such music. He has a bad voice. I dont hate pop, but stuff like this makes me gag, and maybe vomit.

When I tell my friends when they're listening to \\"Beautiful Soul\\" that I hate the song, they say,\\"OMG! How can you not like this song?\\" But they're the kind of people that don't listen to the radio and just rely on burning other people's CD's.

And if you want romantic music with someone who has a great voice AND good music lyrics/music then buy an album by Andrea Bocelli or Josh Groban.Jesse McCartney has the voice, he just needs to grow out of childish Justin Timberlake/Usher phase.

And if you don't like my review, then I don't care about you either. I'm so glad that people are finally starting to come to their senses and write bad reviews on Jesse McCarntey, becasue he deserves it. He doesn't deserve any fame, he doesn't deserve any popularity, and he isn't orignal, because he's exactly like that other fruitcake Aaron Carter.

All the ingredients that usually go into garbage music. Surprisingly, the material here is appealing to all ages. My daughter is 15 and loves it. She also loves Justin Timberlake, Usher, Christina A., but wouldn't have touched Aaron Carter, or teenbopper-pop with a ten foot pole. I grew up with James Tayor, Earth Wind and Fire, and the pop of the 70s and 80s.My daughter wanted to buy this CD and I relented. Listening with her in the car, I was surprised at how much better this is than I thought it would be. In fact I really love it.What's even more surprising is that Jesse McCartney can actually sing. Many of these actor/singer's voices sound manufactured by computers but you can tell McCartney has got real chops. My favorites on this album are \\"The Stupid Things,\\" a soulful heartfelt love song, and \\"Get Your Shine On\\" an homage to off-the-wall vintage Michael Jackson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Terrible!!!","review":"Jesse Mccartney is really a good looking guy but he sings like a girl.

I was expecting his sound to be like Dreamstreet's sound, a sound which is getting old in my opinion. I think that Jesse really performed songs that any person of any age could enjoy, not just 9-13 year old girls (even though they still do enjoy this album. I should know, I'm one of them.) I think that in Beautiful Soul that he really is setting the good example for kids that looks don't really matter and what matters is that you have a Beautiful Soul. I also enjoyed Get Your Shine On.The reason that I gave this album a 4 is because the album has it's catchy songs, which we all know, such as Beautiful Soul.

I saw in a few reviews that this cd is evidentally the best CD ever made. Obviously I had to give it a listen. I would probably put it at about #475,934 of cds that I have heard. Jesse is what Jesse is, a poster boy with nothing to say. Other people write most of his music and the Lizzie McGuire crowd eats it up because he is pretty. If a 284 pound kid with zits and Joe Paterno glasses named Chuck Zubcrotch put out this disc, no one would even pay attention to it. No one would go to his concert, no one would feed him hot dogs and no one would be wanting to give it a hug. Jesse is the system and you people are eating it up. To call this the best cd ever is the funniest thing I've ever seen.

Also, you should go and listen to the live version of \\"beautiful soul\\" (...)He's actually very good live. It does him justice. And just to be childish and stupid, since you lot want to make fun of jesse McCartney, White Sripes really need to get more interesting, and get some decent base stuff in there!

Jesse has certainly grown up a lot in the past few years and I look forward to forthcoming music from him, and hope that he continues on his path to even more success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very superb pop debut!","review":"I just heard Jesse McCartney's Beautiful Soul album. It is very catchy, well made pop album. The dance numbers are funky and he sounds a little bit like Babyface or Usher. The ballads are nice too. However, on two of the last four songs of the album, he sometimes comes off as borrowing a little too much of Clay Aiken's power ballad sound that he's (Aiken) so very good at. The song \\"Stupid\\" almost sounds like Aiken's own No More Sad Songs from last year in its nice piano opening and the similar sections later in the song. McCartney sings with so much energy and vigor in his songs. For Jesse to last, he needs to come up better on the ballads and not imitate another male artist's vocal style.

Listen to one song and you will realize it...Once again, Jesse is just another good example of a preppy white boy who wishes he was black, whose jealous of Michael Jackson's singing and dancing talent, and wishes he could be Justin Timberlake and Aaron Carter, so do not fall for the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blondes have all the Fun ?","review":"I would give it a zero but theres only a 1 to end it!I think only girls gave it 5 stars because hes \\"HOT?\\"(NOT).I think only BOYS have good taste in music ,not the singer!!!except Actresses!(DUH!!!)The old saying is true \\"I dont really like the way he sings and hes lucky \\" Thats why i want to paint my hair yellow.A boy singing romance CDs(HOW TYPICAL).Its eitheir the boy or the girl saying i want you back. So just say IT!because romance CDs are messed up when you only have to say 4WORDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DISCO will NEVER die,Peace out!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All hype but no talent","review":"The title pretty much explains itself, all Jesse is, is a bunch of hype. Nothing unique about him at all. I know alot of one star reviews before me have already said this, but seriously, his voice is very VERY whiney and irritating, and he sounds like a girl way too many times. I'm really struggling to see why this guy is as famous as he is. How can you possibly give this album 5 stars or anything above 1 star is beyond me. Girls like him for his looks and that is it. Plain and simple. Spend your hard earned 15 dollars elsewhere, please, don't waste your time and money. And another thing, what's with that song \\"Get your shine on\\" How the heck does someone get there shine on, even that sounds alittle perverted. All hype and no talent, don't buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Brings Back Memories","review":"This album brings back memories when I was a little kid. Especially the song \\"Naughty Girls\\". This song was great forwhen you just wanna chill and listen to the old school dance jam. This cd would be great for anybody who loved tha club dances in the 80's (like me). Or just someone who just misses those old jams dat went away!!! So take tha chance and buy dis cd and try it for yourself. And I bet you'll be dancing in your kitchin dancing with the mop (dont nodd your head, you know you done it!!) So purchace and enjoy Samantha Fox!!!!!!!!<DJJMC Studios, LosLasCommunication>"},{"rating":"2","title":"Samantha Fox (cd)","review":"It's a blast to the past 80's style with this CD. It was a joy to hear it sound better than ever before on CD after growing up with it on tape. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"Samantha Fox's sophmore album may not be as great as her first album, but it's still a great album and worth owning. There isn't as much Rock n Roll influence in this one as in \\"Touch Me\\", but I still like it. Naughty Girls (Need Love Too) is great and her cover of I Can't Get No Satisfaction gives the Stones a run for their money. The Best Is Yet to Come is another great song and it's one of the best on here. Samantha Fox is sexy and has a sexy voice. If you liked her first album, this one's worth checking out.Grade: B"},{"rating":"1","title":"SOngs, songs and more songs...","review":"Even with the stellar cating providing voices for the characters (reaching almost perfection) this film fails, because probably Katzenberger wanted to beat Disney in their own terrain. So, what he did? Filled the movie with songs and forgot about the history. The result is a boring film (with high technical quality, of course)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prince of Egypt","review":"I recently watched this film with my daughter who is two. Ithought it was ok but there were too many songs. I thought the storywas not true to the real story in the bible and really, I don't think I would purchase this film. I collect Disney and I believe Disney would have done a better job at making this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"\\"~Found the movie very boring considering I was expecting it to be better than 'The Ten Commandments'. LionKing should get 100 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for children","review":"Am I the only one who thinks this movie is not appropriate for a child? I do not want my son to fear God and think it is ok to kill in his name. That some people are good because they believe in him and other are not and have to be eliminated because they do not? I have never cried more seeing a film than this one and find it to be exactly what I do not want my child to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Family Film","review":"Although this movie is not biblically accurate, it is a wonderful film for children to see with their parents. It provides a wonderful opportunity to share God's Word with your children and discuss obedience to God, the consequences of having a hardened heart, the majesty and power of our Lord, as well as His faithfulness, grace, mercy and love for those who, who despite not being perfect, love and obey Him. I highly recommend this film along with Joseph, King of Dreams. It's a shame that there aren't more films of this quality out there for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting, and very emotional...a real gem!!!!","review":"A rather complex bible story (there is nothing \\"linear\\" about the life and work of Moses) made simple, stunning and very emotional.

It's simply amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most awe inspiring interpretation ever!","review":"I was moved so many times during the course of this film as both a 3-D animator and a Christian. While the story may have been 1000's of years before the time of Christ, Christians and Jews both understand that Moses was in fact a \\"type\\" of Christ, and pointed to the savior yet to come through his ministry. Christians understand that God's Spirit transcends the boundaries of time and has salvation available for peoples throughout all history who believe in his provisions. This movie does a great job of displaying these truths which absolutely DOES make it Christian and the most accurate biblical account ever told via Hollywood animation. Please buy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it!","review":"This is a great, classic movie. Wonderful graphics, good story, amazingly powerful music. More people should see it. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie. Go buy it!!!","review":"DreamWorks did a really good job of presenting this movie from the Bible. When I saw the movie, I was near tears, and as I listen to my soundtrack everyday, I still cry, especially in \\"Deliver Us\\" and \\"When You Believe\\". This movie is really awesome, and I'm buying this movie the day in comes out on video. Only 9 more days until it comes out on video"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finest animated films ever made!","review":"I saw \\"Prince of Egypt\\" in the theater and plan to buy it on video, though I will wait for a letterbox version. I was awed by the power and emotional depth of the story, and its technical execution. It's so nice to see an animated film that's truly appropriate for the whole family, without resorting to cutesiness and broad humor as Disney so often does. The film pulls no punches in its treatment of slavery and death, yet is never explicit. The songs and score are quite good and often magnificent. I am not Christian or Jewish (I'm an agnostic animist!) yet the power of Moses' faith can inspire all of us who are unsure of our place in the world, or who have to do something which may not be pleasant or easy. (If only we all had something as obvious as a burning bush to show us the way!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW - By an Extreme Christian","review":"The Prince of Egypt restored my faith in movies. I am gladthat there are still (rich) people makeing a move for God. Althoughthere are a few alterations from the Bible (Ramesees really wanted Moses Dead - Bible doesn't explain how Moses became aware of his Jewish family - and moses stayed in Midian until Pharoh was dead so he could safely return) it is a very great movie. But I think those slight alterations were made to give theme to the Movie, otherwise it would have been just a boring documentary. That same biblical message is still there, that Our God, The King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, is an Awsome God ( I was really wishing that song would be in the movie, because that song was in my head the whole time - Awome God)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Christian kid's movie","review":"I find the movie a great teaching tool and the story very touching. It helped me, and the grandchildren, to look at Moses from a different perspective and appreciate where he came from and all that he went through. I'd forgotten that the animation was so plain, but the story and sound effects more than made up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty to look at, but...zzz","review":"The story is pretty dry and the songs arn't that catchy-they just sound like a bad mix of disney and andrew lloyd webber. Try Yellow Submarine for yours kids instead-you can at least enjoy watching that with them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Disappointed!","review":"I was anticipating the release of this movie for a long time. When it finally was released on video I went right out and bought it, thinking it would be an excellent way to teach my children about Moses. Was I ever disappointed!!!! It was not accurate at all. Where was Aaron? He was with Moses throught the miracles and wonders and they never even showed him much. There was so much that was inaccurate that I wanted to return the movie back to the store and get my money!!! The ending was even more disappointing. Bible it was and didn't rent it before purchasing it. I had thought if the reviews are good then it would be excellent for my children. Even Christian programs were raving about it. The animation is awesome, but that is all that is any good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie Great DVD Lousy","review":"We like to have language options on our films. There are no language options other than English on the DVD. Even the subtitles only come in English."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acuracy","review":"I watch this and thought that it was pretty good. If anyone wishes to buy this as a bible lesson to teach kids, don't buy it. It is absolutely not acurate. All it is entertaining. After I've watch it, it made me thought of \\"that stupid Egyptians! They have no compassion at all. After the jews saved their life and they put them into slavery.\\"I belive that any filming industry who wishes to do a bilble story should do it exactly as the scriptual says and not try to edit the stories for the benifit of actracting people to see it. It is wrong to do this."},{"rating":"1","title":"BRILLIANT TECHNICAL SIDE; BORING SONGS....","review":"The songs in this animated picture are the most exxagerated I've ever heard. IT is like if a character in a movie, for example, couldn't simple ask for a couple of coffee: he would have to do so singing \\"please, give me a cup of coffee, because I love you and life is beautiful and coffee is good for health..\\" Blergh. The technical aspect is brilliant, but the history is marginally told, the influence in children (if any) is questionable, because you have to have some age to get to understand this picture. Anyway, anything coming from Spielberg doesn't surprise me (although Katzenberge, obvioulsy, was the mastermind behind this project) because Steven only wants money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This is easily in my top five movies. It is a superb film, grippingly plotted and astonishingly well researched (I'm a professor of Classical and Near Eastern studies, and I'm quite familiar with ancient Egyptian art and civilization). It manages to be stirring and inspirational without preaching, and conveys the humanity of its characters in a way that few films manage. Perhaps not a good movie for children due to the content (the film doesn't flinch from the killing of the male infants, the plagues, or violence against slaves), but something that aims for and satisfies an adult audience with the richness of its storytelling and its impeccable animation. Breathtaking, chilling, and beautiful. Respectful to the several religious traditions who look to Moses as a founder. A must-watch film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another awesome movie","review":"The animation is stupendous....music score as well.the story of Moses is well told a must see for both children and adults. I was very happy with the propmness of delivery, the price, and the excellent condition(brand new). Thank u!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video","review":"This film was well done and is children friendly. My family and I now enjoy this film regularly. Excellent choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"New look at Exodus","review":"Moses as you've never seen him... in a cartoon! This take is a pretty good animated film, especially when one considers how touch some people are likely to be about one of the tenets of Judeo-Christian faith. The musical numbers were OK, but the rest of the film, especially the animation style was first-rate. Not one I would go out of my way to see but definitely one WORTH seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I still get chills!","review":"When I first saw this movie in the theaters, I thought it was absolutely wonderful. The songs, the characters, the special effects, the cast, and especially the story were breathtaking. I've owned the movie since it came out to the public and everytime I watch it I still am in awe. The music is so powerful and moving that I get goosebumps everytime I hear it (no kidding!). I am also Jewish and to actually SEE the story, especially for younger viewers, makes it easier to understand. I thought Dreamworks did a fabulous job portraying one of the most popular stories of the Old Testament"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent rendition of one of the greatest Bible stories!","review":"Wow!!! The movie was very moving. Everything seemed so real and I really felt it with my heart. I did cry, and as I watched the movie, I was able to feel the pain of the Israelites, the fear of the Egyptians and the strength of God. If I could go back in time to experience miracles of God, it would have been during that time. (Appropriate for the very young and the very young at heart)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Money well spent","review":"This is a great movie and is perfect to use at bible functions.

I highly recommend this movie not only for children, but adults too :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless classic!","review":"I was so pleased to see the kids at church just as engaged and captivated by DreamWorks depiction of the story of Moses as I was when I was growing up! There are a few minor inconsistencies with the Scriptures, but we discussed them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures the essence of Exodus 1-14","review":"I've probably watched this movie over 5 times, which is huge for me since I really dislike watching movies more than once.However, this movie constantly reminds me of the deep profundity of the Old Testament and how there was so much drama, action, and faithfulness. Normally when I read the Old Testament, it's not as \\"easy\\" of a task as say... reading my favorite news blogs. However, movies such as the Prince of Egypt really go to show the depth of the life of Moses, and how much strength and character was involved to really live a life commanded by God.Overall, I'll keep re-watching this over and over to remind myself just how much I'm missing as I read the Old Testament."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful movie, great songs","review":"I had already seen the movie but I wanted to add it to my DVD collection. The disc has a lot of bonus features to entertain yourself with. I would have liked to have the option of watching it in Spanish and French, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DreamWorks Movie","review":"The Prince of Egypt is the first traditionally animated DreamWorks film.

First they had ANTS, a film full ofoutrageous violence, full blown war, and over the top salacity. Second was this film, Prince of Egypt *loosely* based on biblical story of Moses. This is an extremely complex story for a children's film. My five year old was appalled as was I with the blatant portrayal of infanticide. While part of the biblical story, it was entirely too violent and inexplicable to young children. This is one parent that is done with dreamscape movies, period. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ten Commandments Please","review":"Boring, unbiblical, and too long. What in the world did people see in this movie? Children can enjoy THE TEN COMMANDMENTS -- they don't need this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like violence for your children, buy this video","review":"If your taste runs toward graphic display of infantacide, then this movie is for you. While part of the Moses story, this movie uses a rather heavy-handed treatment of the story. The themes were entirely too complex for my 5 year old. The story is only loosely based on the biblical version. The ten commandments did it much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"Time, money, and energy - all wasted on creating and watching 'Prince of E-was-gypt'. My church teaches that waste is a sin - how ironic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Prince of Egypt is an amazing and dramatic story","review":"The Prince of Egypt - by itself, without the DVD - is still incredible. The special effects and music are breathtaking, the characters have depth, and the story's integrity and feel really do match with the bible, even if some details are changed. Then, add the DVD to it - the best one I own right nest to \\"The Matrix\\" - and its rating goes off the charts. It has director commentary, The Making of, trailers, sketch \\"album,\\" how the special effects were done, and a heck of a lot more. My favorite is the \\"When You Believe\\" multi-language track. It's very obvious that the filmmakers did everything possible to make this movie good in EVERY country. Buy this DVD! It will blow you away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the whole family","review":"When I put this movie on for the little ones, the whole family gets sucked in! The music is awesome and the characters so lovable! I enjoy watching The Prince of Egypt every time. What a good way to get your kids interested in a scripture story!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great well paced movie","review":"The Prince of Egypt was a great movie. I liked the movie because it wasn't like all the other biblical movies that I have seen. It was well paced but dragged every now and then. It was dramatic and even brought tears to my eyes. I could have done without all the singing, but its Disney so what do you expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly Valiant Effort, but not Disney Par","review":"Also, let me point out if I had the choice, it would be more of a 2.5...not just a 2. Bravo to Dreamworks for trying TOO HARD. Animation was inconsistent, although at sometimes fluid. The CGI was GREAT as a 3-D work, but it was AWFUL as a piece of traditional animation. The red sea didn't blend in at all with the normal animation and stuck out just as badly as the CGI in Anastasia did. The film was overall mostly enjoyable, there were 2 good songs, the rest I cringed all the way through. Worth a rent, but not worth the buy I'd say."},{"rating":"1","title":"movie is scratch","review":"the movie was the one i wanted and it was working fine but the end of the dvd is scratch at the end so we were not able to watch the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE PRINCE OF DVDs","review":"This is a really good film on a great dvd. It's a nice simple telling of the Moses story which will be loved by older children and adults alike. I say older children as there are some slightly upsetting scenes of infanticide which haven't been as discreetly or tactfully delt with as you might expect from an animated movie. Other than that small issue the movie is virtually faultless the animation is superb and the sound great. The movie moves along at a fast pace and although it does cut the story short it does it with intelligence. The songs are among the best I have ever heard in an animated movie, you'll be left with them stuck in your mind for days. Once the film finishes there is no need to feel dismayed because you can spend another couple of hours watching the extras, it really is a fantastic disc. So don't be a Pauper get The Prince now."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% Excellent","review":"This amazing video is probably one of the best possible gifts available to buy without putting a hole in your pocket! Great story line and will entertain all family members... especially the kids!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful in every sense.","review":"My 3 children, my husband and I absolutely LOVE this movie. My 2 year old watches it at least once a day and knows most of the songs on the soundtrack. The animation is unique and lovely and the music is so magnificent that is leaves you breathless. Our favourite songs are \\"Through Heaven's Eyes\\", \\"Deliver Us\\" (Ofra Haza had the most beautiful, haunting voice), \\"The Plagues\\", and Michelle Pfeiffer and Sally Dworsky's version of \\"When You Believe/A'shira\\" will have you smiling and crying at the same time, it is so powerful. Everyone I have bought the video or DVD for, is thoroughly addicted to this movie.My family and I HIGHLY recommend this movie, we have not tired of it since it came out in the movie theatres!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film, great DVD","review":"I love this movie. It's the story of Moses from the Bible. It's a cartoon. It's a musical. It's just all-around goodness.And the DVD has some good features, as well. I found it particularly intersting to watch it with the commentary track and hear the production thoughts about creating the visuals and different animation techniques. It was also neat to see how they produced the film for world-wide distribution in so many different languages.It's the kind of movie that's hard to get tired of."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best animated wonders of the 90's.","review":"This is the story about the life of Moses, how he was rescued by a Egyptian queen and became a prince of Egypt to the day he lead his people \\" the Hebrews\\" out of Egypt. This movie has it all to make it a very entertaining and inspiring animated movie with beautifully drawn animation, breathttaking atsmophere with CGI effects that makes this movie a wonder to behold and a triumph in animated movies.The DVD itself is phenomenl and loaded with extras, the picture is excellent with it's sound too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best animated flick","review":"Simply the best animation ever seen (computer characters don't count), only outclassed by the music, and the story of course. Only one cheesy \\"Disney\\" moment, with the two \\"comic relief\\" characters. Story, with liberties taken, is essentially faithful to the story of exodus. Would recommend to children, even with the death and scary moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie meant a lot to me spiritually.","review":"Although the story was modified a little from the scriptual text, this film moved me spiritually in a way that few other productions have.

I highly recommend it to ANYONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tumbling Mat - a good buy","review":"Purchased this tumbling mat for my kids.

This mat is very thick and easily stored. It is not heavy so she can, with a little effort, move it around the playroom by herself. There is velcro on one end for storage purposes, I believe, but I wish there were velcro on both ends so I could be sure it would not move around on top of the floor. That is the only drawback. Easily cleaned and well-made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"We love this item. We bought this to go with an incline for our girls to practice gymnastics on. Seems to be very durable. Stiching seems very strong. We are going to be purchasing a second one so there is no fight over whos turn it is.

So glad that the Extended version is also represented on this collection, it's SOOOOOOO hot!!! The other songs are also very good, especially Space age lovesong and The more you live the more you love.

Made of a good material (not cheap plastic stuff), the elastic around bottom brings the cover to a good snug fit and there is the snap closure that pulls the fit snug around the mower handles. I for one am very happy with this product and I must say that the reviews saying about the fit being too tight?

This cable is just the right length for me to pull the mp3 player out of the center console where my aux port is located so that I can view its display. The quality is good with very little noise.

There are not many CD's that you can ride the whole CD but \\"life is too short\\" you can. Every single song on the CD is good. Obviously freaky tales, i aint trippen, and life is too short are the best songs. All the others are good too. If you can get this on CD the bass quality is great.

Percussion is supplied but what appears to be a reasonably good drum machine, and this gets rather monotonous. The non-piano keyboards sound cheesy.Tracks 1-6 and 11-15 are quickstep tempos. Tracks 8-10 are a bit slower, and so bronze or beginning foxtrot might be appropriate. I would dance samba to track 7. Tracks 4, 8 and 10 are more than four minutes long, and this gets tiresome in a quickstep or faster foxtrot.

The character chemistry between the two lead characters is fantastic, and it makes the entire movie enjoyable, even though some of the other characters are a little more flat. In traditional Dreamworks fashion, the humor is targeted such that adults will enjoy the movie as much as the younger viewers, without ever being inappropriate. The music by Elton John, while not his best, is certainly a welcome addition as well.The dvd features aren't anything special, the usual directors commentary and making of featurettes, but they're there if you're interested.Overall the movie is a lot of fun, easily on par with Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas (another favorite, check it out.) Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More enjoyable for adults than kids.","review":"This one probably won't become your kid's favorite video. El Dorado seems to have more action than comedy and the love story elements are uninteresting (and at times inapproprite) for children. As an adult, I liked the storyline and thought the handling of the Aztecs and Spaniards clash was very creative, though not realistic. (Expect more than the usual Disney-type liberties taken with historical accuracy.) The main characters are well defined and enjoyable, which sets El Dorado apart from many other animated films. The music and animation are well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Road to El Dorado commentary","review":"This story of the two masters of mischief is a great one and inspired me back to the days of the Great Stefanos and their travels in the Flipppity Five!

Kelvin Kline and KenNeth Branagh play Tulio and Miguel who are Spanish con-artists who come across the map to the treasure of El Dorado. Together, they go out on an adventure much like Bing Cosby and Bob Hope.There is a lot to see in this movie. The value of friendship is what stands out the most, but there are other thingsThe movie is funny, especially the constant bickering between Tulio and Miguel. Even funny is the horse, Altivo, who does not have a line but has some of the greatest reactions to the events unfolding before him.This movie has some great music by Elton John that both my son and I enjoy. This would be a good soundtrack to pick up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just awesome.","review":"Movie is simply the best and I don't know why there was not a sequel but there should have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Road to Eldorado","review":"This is an incredibly fun movie and has been a family favorite since its release.

A fun way to tell El Dorado story. Great music and art. You and your family will like this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the road to El Disaster, but I thought it was OK","review":"This movie was pretty good. The plot was okay, but it wasn't as funny as, say, Toy Story. It is basically the story of two men (Miguel and Tulio) who set off to find El Dorado, the city of gold. When they finally find El Dorado (through a series of amusing events) the people think they are gods. Tulio is wooed by the gold and the attractive Chel, and he wants to return to Spain. Miguel falls in love with the city and its people and wants to stay. How they resolve it has a nice ending. What I thought was nice was that the movie can totally have a sequel, according to the way it ended. I especially liked the scene where they play ball with a rolled-up armadillo. It's a cute movie, but not that funny, so don't expect a big laugh, although people have differing opinions. All in all it deserves the 4 stars I gave it."},{"rating":"1","title":"funny/stupid/weird/disturbing","review":"As funny as it may sound, the only actual funny parts are all showed in the previews. It also has a lot of stupid humor that little kids don't understand, butadults will find disturbing to see them on a childrens movie. (ex: \\"Holy ship!\\" , one of the less disturbing parts.) I was really suprised that Disney addad that scene with that girl and whats-his-name. Anyway, cut out the weid parts and skip the prieviews, and you have a pretty good movie. Another fault: The heros are criminals and cheaters, but they get away with breaking the rules. Not a good mesage to kids. I still can't see why it got almost 5 stars?!

The movie included some poor language, sexual references, cartoon nudity, criminals and violence.Second, the show was flat out boring. That was my biggest gripe, I just could hardly sit through it.Look for something better if you are going to buy a DVD for the kids.

I can tell you that Marc did nothing good to the image of Lavoe. Now, the non spanish viewers were presented with \\"another spanish junkie\\". Thanks, Marc. Hector was a human being with his demons and weaknesses. Thank you, Marc.I will say that the sound of the soundtrack is superb! The music itself deserves 5 stars. It does sound good and is refined per today's standards. But that is where it all ends. You want to experience Lavoe, then buy Hector's CD's and enjoy the legend.You liked the movie, then go ahead and buy this CD.

Hector did not have a very powerful voice or a big range like Marc does. So you can tell Marc is holding his voice back. Marc does not really sound like himself. So he did a good job on this cd of not sounding like himself but trying to sing in more of Hector's syle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I think Marc did a great job sounding like Hector.

Marc Anthony doesn't sing as well as Hector Lavoe and it sounds like he is imitating him and at least I can tell, he just is not believable and if Marc Anthony is going to sing Hectors songs he should just interpret the music it in his own way. No one sings like Hector so if you like his music buy his albums you can't go wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you sure you want to buy this?","review":"Instead of buying this, you could buy \\"El Cantante: The Originals\\", a compilation album that has many of the same songs as this, except that it's really Hector Lavoe that's singing them. Seriously, if you had the choice between listening to Hector Lavoe and listening to Marc Anthony doing a bad imitation of Hector Lavoe, why would you buy this one?Anyway, in this album, Marc Anthony does a very bad imitation of Hector Lavoe. If you like Marc Anthony and you have to have all his albums, then sure, you're going to want this one.

Marc Anthony has great energy, and is a fabulous singer. The music of Hector Lavoe is exceptional, and so is his band. I would recommend this album to anyone who likes good music to dance to, or just plain quality musicianship. I could have done without the last track by Jennifer Lopez.

However, once you put the Hoop Guard on the bass drum hoop it becomes too thick to attach your bass drum pedal. I have a Tama Starclassic Maple drum kit (about 10 years old), and an older DW 5000 bass drum pedal (about 15 years old).

A desire for a naval career is not a pre-requisite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr.Mishipman Hornblower is just the beginning","review":"I began the Hornblower series with this book. I recently completed 10 of the 11 novels in the Series. Having seen Gregory Peck as Hornblower and the BBC series, my imagination was fired with the images of Hornblower both as a young man and as and older, wiser gentleman. This book raised my interest in the rest of the series and completing the series has a certain regret about it. Like Cornwell's \\"Sharpe's Rifles\\" series it has some implausibilities and drag points but by in large it is an excellent read.I would comment on the a problem I have had with some kindle books. There seems to be a lack of good editorial control on many of them. Spelling errors and grammar problems pop up, inadvertently. I can accept the problem on books that are low cost and transcribed by volunteers. When you pay full price on books sometimes well above the $10 norm, you deserve professional editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adventure","review":"The \\"Horatio Hornblower\\" books cannot be beat for adventure, excitement, and historic depiction. These novels of the British navy during the Napoleonic wars depict a man of average, or even below average physical ability, who relies on his mind, struggles with moral issues, and wins through with courage and planning. Hornblower's success is often shown to stem from his productive activity -- his motto: \\"Do it now.\\" Interestingly, Hornblower thinks he is a coward, even while he illustrates the true nature of courage -- he is embarrassed for being afraid in the face of danger, even while he leads the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked this book....","review":"Horatio is great stuff, and if you liked this, you will also like Patrick O'Brien's 19 book series, which covers the same historical period. the first book is Master and Commander, the second is (I think), Post Captain. Beautifully written."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful romp through the days when sailing ships sailed the seas.","review":"The Hornblower series is a must read. They are well written and gives you a good taste of what navy life must have been like during that period of time.The characters and story are quite engaging. I had trouble putting these books down."},{"rating":"2","title":"sailors dream","review":"Plot, setting, character development. All there.The plot was as expected, midshipmen are what they are, beginning sailors. Setting is developed enough to bring you back to difficulties of wooden ships, and Mr Hornblower is as expected surrounded by life and personnel of the period.All in all, an enjoyable experience which I will follow up with his next promotion, and Hotspur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough to want to continue with the series","review":"This is a collection of short stories about Horatio Hornblower as a midshipman, and later an acting lieutenant. It is thus somewhat episodic, as several reviewers have already noted. I vaguely remember some of these stories from the A&E; series starring Ioan Gruffudd, which I watched on DVD about 5 or 6 years ago. I liked the stories enough to want to continue reading the series, and I look forward to installments with book-length plots and stories. Forester is a remarkably clear and lucid writer, but have a dictionary of nautical terms (or the Internet) handy as you read these stories, if you haven't recently brushed up on late 18th Century sailing terminology.I only wish that affordable hardbound volumes with the beautiful woodcut covers were available for other books in this series. Sadly, they aren't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arguably the weakest of the series","review":"New midshipman Hornblower endures bullying and self-accusations of cowardice at the start of his naval career, although his creativity earns praise from his captain and respect from the men.Probably the weakest of this justly-famous series. Forester does too much telling the reader how Hornblower is feeling, rather than showing. But the action storylines are wonderful, as are Hornblower's developing capabilities under Captain Sir Edward Pellew. And it's worth mentioning that the book is not nearly as depressing as the first of the Ioan Gruffudd Hornblower movies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Educational","review":"This is one amazing series of books by an author who really knew his topic matter. I've read almost all of the books of the Hornblower series, and reread them again and again. This fictional narrative follows the life of English Naval officer Horatio Hornblower from his first post as a seasick Midshipman aboard HMS Justinian under the ailing Captain Keene through bold action after bold action while serving as acting lieutenant aboard HMS Indefatigable under the command of the noble Sir William Pellew. Fantastic descriptions and more than enough naval technical information will leave you feeling you could sail your own beautifully masted frigate against anything Bonaparte could throw at you! So up anchors and away matey for a swashbuckling read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing naval fun!","review":"I can't believe that I've never read this series! After wrapping up Cornwell's Sharpe's series, I was desperate for another good series on the Napoleonic wars, and I came across Forseter's Hornblower books. Lots of action and a style that makes you feel like you're on deck, reefing the tops'ls right along with 'em!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor proofreading","review":"I LOVE Forester's Hornblower novels, and have worn out a couple of paperback sets. It's great to have these stories in ebook form, but whoever transcribed them did a terrible job. There are incorrect words used in many places, and in some places find-and-replace has created errors. For example in Hornblower and the Atropos, the word \\"triumph\\" always appears as \\"Triumph\\", capitalized and in italics, because at one place in the book there is a ship named the Triumph.Such sloppy work would be acceptable in a $.99 edition, but not in a $6.00 one.This comment applies to ALL the Hornblower ebooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to relax with and enjoy","review":"This is a nice collection of short stories and great bedtime reading. The moon is something of an older, wiser friend who likes to talk about the things he's seen over time. Each chapter is a story that stands alone, but they're all part of the moon's perspective as an observer. There's also a touch of fantasy in the narrative portions where the author is speaking directly to the moon, but the actual stories are written with realism. This makes for a nice transition from one genre to another that works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Vacation Reading","review":"This is one of those books that you could take with you on vacation for a quiet and reflective read. Thoroughly enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"Conversations with the Moon aspires to be more than it is. It consists of several, thin short stories linked by a heavy-handed attempt at poetic prose centered around the moon and its mannerisms (it's pompous and exhales glittering light, basically).The short stories are pedantic, thinly guised attempts to communicate values for living. Even the character's names are boring and unimaginative, as if they were extracted from a second-grade reader.It *is* a quick read, I'll agree there. But it's an unfulfilling and empty read as well. I bought this on an Amazon recommendation after choosing Big Fish. No doubt there are similarities in structure, but at least Big Fish entertains and makes you think.Some authors write prose that you savor in your mind like a confection. Gabriel Garcia Marquez, John Irving or Tom Robbins for example. Conversations with the Moon sets your expectation for a special read but doesn't deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hallmark Channel Reject","review":"I disliked this book so much after reading the first two of the stories that the moon tells that I won't read the rest. The stories were no more touching than a bad made for televison movie. I found myself thinking, \\"Where's the meat?\\" and it wasn't that I was particularly invested in reading an intellectual or heavy piece. This book cannot be the same one that other readers/reviewers found touching and poignant... or compared to The Little Prince. Conversations With The Moon is a definite dust collector on my shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Win-win combination","review":"Although the CD was purchased second hand, still a lot of quality and very happy to have made this purchase. Allayed much skepticicm with 2nd hand CDs. The music of the Seekers is very uplifting, epitomizes optimism, harmonic, and melodic where one can sing along to it while driving or at home. Thus, not a day goes by that I don't play the CD. Truly wish there were more groups like this, but I live in a world of nostalgia anyway.

This is true punk.P.s: I kinda like NOFX"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic!","review":"Of all the anarco punk bands from the UK Subhumans stood out and one of the main reasons was the quality of the music (unlike Crass for example who seemed to stand out for their lack of it!) This album is no exception.Its realy great to have a political message that you can actually listen to without it becoming nothing more than a rant. Dead Kennedys had that one worked out MDC did not. Subhumans were another band who had worked it out.Mid paced 80s punk with even the odd speedy hardcore track (I dont wanna die) to satisfy the hardcore listener. Lyrics are exellent covering not only political issues but social and personal issues, in another words, lyrics that effect the average person in the street.Definatly worth buying and listening to...agan...and again....and again...When the people of the country have forgotten how to disagree..........(By the way, if you like this you may want to check out ska-punk band Citizen Fish)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great CD","review":"When my sister bought this cd for me i wasn't expecting too much but i listened to it and really liked it. The more I listen to this cd the more I like it. The best part is that each song is different. It isnt like with some cd's where each song starts the same and you dont notice the difference util youve listened to it ten times. This CD brings something new with each song.

But, I made homemade tomato-beef soup and then made a batch of cornbread to go with it. This is the best cornbread we have ever had. We are westerners but lived in the central south for 7.5 years, so we have eaten good cornbread. Nothing we've had before touches the tender sweetness and fine grain of this product. I don't know where the women get their cornmeal from but I noticed the product comes from Colorado--definitely in the west!

Although he always writes clearly, some of his works (such as Speech Acts and Intentionality) are of an unavoidably technical nature. However, here he distills his work there (and in other places) down to its essence. This work then is an excellent introduction to his thought as well as an excellent introduction to philosophy. Searle is particularly good when he attacks scepticism. I don't, however, agree with his apparent agnosticism [pps. 36-37]."},{"rating":"2","title":"john searle(on and off mark)","review":"I have read some of the book and can say that i respect his views;but have to disagree with his summation of mind and conciousnes. how can the mind produce conciousness the mind is matter matter cannot produce.it has to be a thought first existing in conciousness first all that exist existed in mind first as thought or idea but all come from conciousness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Photography","review":"Let's not beat around the bush; this book is a must for any serious ZZ Top fan. That said, it's a little disappointing because there are no new anecdotes about Billy's life with ZZ that anybody who's read interviews or album liners doesn't already know. Much is made of the Rev's mucial life before ZZ, and Dusty and Frank are mentioned only briefly, almost as an afterthought. I guess I expected more stories about touring with the band, how they get along, how they write. The writing style is a little bit tedious also. Isn't that what ghost writers are for?The photographs, however, are another story. This is a coffee table book with large colorful pictures of Billy and the band, his cars and guitars. The section on guitars is especially good and many of the crazy guitars BFG is seen playing live are described. Check out the license plate on Cadzilla: 8JAPAN. Classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRAB THAT SLAB AND GRIND ME A POUND!","review":"DAt's what BFG say. The man is a GENIUS. This book is a fascinating read, and shines a whole new light on that little old band from Texas. I've always loved ZZ Top, but now I have a whole new respect for Billy Gibbons- the guy just oozes soul, is so understated yet so creative. This book shows how detail oriented, how creative, and how cool the man is. A great artist, a gearhead, and most importantly a genius on the gee-tar. Gotta love his life story. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"buy this book...","review":"This book is killer. Great stories, awesome photography, intelligent layout. Gibbons is the man....and he keeps getting stronger.

I mean just to protect Tohru, Kyo tells Akito he doesn't love her though he really does. How sweet!!I must say I cannot decide between the two if I were to choose.I do have a lot of respect for Momiji, though. I think he has actually grown up more in this volume, going against Akito the way he did. The way Momiji is not afraid to go to Tohru and transform I think he is more apt to sharing his feelings with Tohru then shy Kyo and Yuki. I think he Momiji does trully love Tohru but we won't find out until later, I guess.It's so sad what will happen to Kyo. He doesn't deserve that, nor do any of the Zodiac having to return to Akito. Kyo doesn't tell Tohru but Akito does, the cold-hearted, ------I must say this is a great series and it's just getting better and better.

A must have for all hip-hop enthusiast."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ageless masterpiece","review":"I first got hold of BDP on a cassette a friend brought back from San Fancisco in 1988. I was young and eager to find the freshest and stongest hip-hop available but this just blew me away. Hip-hop is highly suceptible to pop trends as is evident in music lifted by the momentum of the moment. Whether rasta, sex, violence, or humor mixed and engineered with the slickest beats of the hour are the drivers, only a true masterpiece can overcome any one of these trends to trancend time as a proven work of art. \\"My Philosophy\\" is a fitting opener and not enough can be said of the intelligence, emotion, and purpose expressed in this album. I will not mention anything else in the career or life of KRS1 in this review but I will say that without any doubt, this classic is one bright creation that will shine long after the other albums of its time fade to black."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T SLIP ON THIS","review":"Keep keepin on and ya don't stop. Neither did KRS-1. All I can say is this is at least as good as Criminal Minded. Some may disagree but the song \\"Ya Slippin\\" pretty much makes the point. I got a 15 year old memorizing this album. This is B-BOY supreme. Crank this up at a stop light and watch them all sweat. The song Ya Slippin is my personal favorite.

During the making of this album, Scott La Rock, DJ and Producer of BDP was shot and killed. During the making of \\"My Philosophy\\" in fact...which in my opinion is when Kris started showing his true colors. It was positive and negative, educational and entertaining..which had become the mantra of KRS ever since. On this album he tells you that Illegal Business controls America. He tells you to enjoy love, but make sure to wear a jimmy hat. He tells you how sometimes love is gonna get you. On this album you learn what the \\"word\\" \\"Unrational\\" means.

With the exception of, to an extend, Cosmic Girl and Alright, it's really the only track on the album that has that feel or sound.There's a lot of ground covered on the album, and some of it is more successful than others. Virtual Insanity and Cosmic Girl are instantly likable, cheery numbers. Use the Force is a bit on the silly side for me, but things pick up for the next few tracks. Drifting Along pretty much runs right off the rail for me, and Didjerama is just plain boring (though Digjital Vibrations is alright).Things start to pick up again after that. Travelling Without Moving and You Are My Love move back in to the up-beat territory.The final two tracks are much more chill, but are also possibly my two favorite on the album.I'd easily recommend this, but be warned that you'll probably find yourself hitting skip on a few of the tracks in the middle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groovy!!","review":"Jamiroquai brings up the flavor of '70s Disco back to the 90s. And though many call his music acid jazz, I agree that a more accurate term would be 'neo-disco.' Just check out the album from start to finish, with the exception of tracks 8 and 9, which have some aborigine australian instrumentals, and the rock steady of track 6. 'Cosmic girl,' 'Virtual Insanity,' 'Alright,' You are my love,' and the title track are pure funky disco groove molded in such a way the 90s audience can digest it. I haven't heard Jamiroquai's other albums, but as far as this one goes, it certainly is worth the time you'll take on burning it or the money to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third time is the good one?","review":"Comparing to other cd's from 1996/1997, this cd is great, wonderful... But, comparing to the other 2 Jamiroquai cd's (\\"Emergency On Planet Earth\\" and \\"The Return Of The Space Cowboy\\"), it is not as good. This cd doesn't have sense of unit. But any cd with so great songs, such as Virtual Insanity, Alright and Cosmic Girl, is something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"ACID JAZZ AND FUNK, WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FOR!","review":"Jamiroquai delivers a strong punch as a third cd.

When I first got it, I couldn't believe I hadn't had it already. Immediately, I had to get the other two previous albums. I was in love with Jamiroquai!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funktastic (pardon the pun)","review":"Generally this is an excellent album I would agree with a previous review on that some of the slower ballads dont quite fit the musically style (That from a personal view however). But on up-tempo songs such as Virtual Insanity and Cosmic Girl the rhythms and grooves are overwhelmingly infectious. The diverse use of sounds and instruments keeps you interested and some of the Bass lines are excellent. Some might say that the style is not earth-shatteringly original, which may be true, but the feel of the music is amazingly soulful and so I dont really give a F**k if its original or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Funk CD In My Collection!","review":"I love all these songs, they are the kinda songs that you can listen to and actually concentrate on the music or just have it as background music with a few friends over. I remember a few years ago I saw the music video for \\"Virtual Insanity\\" and for a while I was on this craze of wanting the CD really bad then it sorta faded into my life and forgotten. Recently I was going through my local electronics store and I noticed this CD, and it cried out for me. I decided I would buy it cause I like having lots of different kinds of CDs and this would be a nice change. Well, I have to say this wow I love all these songs. A for sure buy for anyone of all ages, and for the explorer that is daring enough to try a new genre. 5 Stars here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing dance musicians with lots of soul.","review":"Jamiroquai leashes out with it's 3rd album debut and I think Jay Kay does his vocals so flawlessly well. \\"Virtual Insanity\\" and \\"Cosmic Girl\\" are by far some of the best dance songs I ever heard. I rarely hear Jamiroquai on the radio where I live and I'm hoping that the do play their songs on radio stations in Calgary like Power107 and kiss FM 96.9 more often. I hope their next album will be as popular as this one.

Play that funky music England and I'll continue buyin' your albums!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS GROWS ON YOU","review":"I bought this album without having heard any song except for \\"Virtual Insanity\\". This is still one of my 5 favorite songs ever, but there are some other good songs on here that I didn't like at first. \\"Alright\\" and \\"Cosmic Girl\\" (the two singles released after \\"Virtual Insanity\\") are two songs that sort of sound like disco, but they also have a nice funk/r&b vibe going. \\"High Times\\" doesn't have that great of lyrics, but it has a really good chorus. The title track and \\"Use the Force\\" are also very good. In conclusion, this is one of the must-have albums of the past 10 years. I would like to say though that as good as this album is, you should really check out Jamiroquai's newest release A Funk Odyssey. In my opinion, it is Jamiroquai's best overall album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipped instantly","review":"Thank you, seller, for this product.

With more spaced and planned lyrics (as compared to Return of the Space Cowboy, where Kay bascially does his own thing) this CD generally brings out a brighter, better future...had Jamiroqui's CD's consistently moved like \\"Return of the...\\" they would be nowhere. Along with some better lyrics and beat, instrumentals such as Didjital Vibrations bring out the best in this group. If you are new to Jamiroqui's style, \\"Traveling Without Moving\\" is definately the one to buy, better songs and a pretty acurate overview of what Jamiroqui is like..or, if you are depressed with flops like (once again) \\"The Return of the..\\" and feel like giving them one more chance, this is the CD to brighten the mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"bicycle mouse hot friend nose","review":"their second best album.discoey, pop songy, dancey, acid jazzy, funky, bongo drummy, and a touch of breakbeat.similar music? can't think of any.not as quality as Return of the Space Cowboy, because it's venturing more into the commercial world and although catchy, some of the tracks become a little tiresome after a while. but it's worth getting. my favorite Jamiroquai track is on this album - track 13.dance dance dance funk funk funk. good cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet, Sweet Sounds","review":"Well overall Jamiroquai is a great band. This CD in particular seems to have an edge that all other albums lack. The speedy, catchy rhythms are pure bliss.

This is the best Jamiroquai album, even better than their latest 'Synkronized.' You probably already like \\"Virtual Insanity,\\" because you heard it on the radio. But if you buy this album you'll quickly get hooked on \\"Cosmic Girl\\" and \\"Alright,\\" which are both great dance tracks. Every track is not only funky, but also extremely groovy. You'll love the strings and Jay's awesome vocals as he effortlessly hits every note with pinpoint precision. \\"Travelling Without Moving\\" also has an fat bassline and kickin' bass drum, and pretty soon you'll figure out that every song on this album is great. I became so addicted that I immediately went out and bought their previous two albums. And by the way, disco never died.

While I have respect for Catholics and believe that many of them have true faith in Jesus, I do not agree with many of the Catholic beliefs and doctrines. I am a Christian but I am interested in what Catholics believe because I have many friends who are Catholics. Before reading this book I had, in my lifetime, read the entire Bible, the Vatican II documents, and studied the Catholic canons. That was enough to convince me that many of the Catholic teachings are not in the Bible, and even go against the teachings of the Bible. This book failed to convince me otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album and hardest to find","review":"Probably their best album but also the hardest to find. Why they have not brought this out again on CD God only knows because this is a classic.

Everyone who's heard them likes the music. Then, several years ago I heard he was coming to Atlanta to play at Eddies Attic, and I just had to go and meet him again.

I heard so much about it and was surprised when I also found it in the library, multiple copies, under classics.I really like historical counts of the sixties counter culture but this never kept my interest to keep picking it up again. If you finally got interested in something, to follow along like a story or a sensible account, it just dropped it. I never found myself really caring about the people involved. Everything was just there, but the people were acting like everything they did had some great meaning, and it just seemed tired.I got thru 150 pages. I had to quit. I skimmed the rest of it really really quickly to get the jist of it. I looked up a summary of the book on the net, and I didn't miss anything in the plot. I wanted to like this book.

This book made me feel like I was tripping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good...not great.","review":"Very interesting account of the birth of the Hippie Movement in America (if not the world). When Wolfe's words are flowing it's awesome. But his jumbling up of styles, though intended to reflect what he was experiencing, more often than not, is boring and a bit pretentious. Specifically, when he attempts Kerouacian spontaneous prose, it largely comes off, for me anyways, as gimmicky. I wish he would have stuck to a straight ahead style...I think the craziness and uniqueness of what he was witnessing would have still come through. Overall, though, worth the time spent reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The way it was","review":"If you want to understand today's drug culture, you must go back to the origins in the Sixties. Wolf's account of this era and its principal characters is a not to be missed read and a valuable reference for that period. In fact, if you want to understand society today, certain lifestyles and the associated values, read this book. From the painted buses to the flower children to Ken Kesey and more, it is all here in extraordinary detail. You won't put it down until you finish, once you start reading, so carve out a few hours one weekend and have food and beverage to hand. Pencil and paper, too, for you will want to get Wolf's other books for his social insights."},{"rating":"2","title":"'On the bus'","review":"The Electric Kool-Aid acid test is one of the most humorous, mind appealing things i have ever read.

The rest of the book is very disappointing. While one could argue that the 2 chapters on matrices/quaternions is useful, this information could be found in any game/math book/website.Examples of useless stuff: chapter on User Interface(heh), chapter on initializing D3D/Opengl, chapter on macros, and worst of all, the stuff talking about what a linked-list is(wtf)I wish the author simply released this as a PDF online, because the little useful information here isn't worth a whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all good things come in small packages","review":"This book is too sparsely written to recommend buying at its price.

She loved them, they are very pretty and dainty. However, after 3-4 uses, several of the stones popped out and we were unable to fix it. It was too late to return them, so we just threw them out. Due to the design, the earring bends a little each time you put them on or off.

However, as an owner of numerous garnets of varying shades, I cannot stress enough that these will not be able to be worn with ANYTHING red. They are a very pale orange color. Maybe I got duds, but the description is completely inaccurate. They're a clear orange color. No red undertones or anything. I'm keeping them because they were $20 and it's not worth the hassle of returning them. I'm doubting whether they're actually garnets, but at this point I guess I just don't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I got these as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. I thought they'd make a good stocking stuffer since peridot is her birthstone. However, when I recieved the pair I ordered, I immediately opened them up to make sure they were what I had ordered. One of the earrings had a missing peridot stone. I returned them as per Amazon.com's return policy (which I must say, is extremely easy to use, painless, and hassle-free). I recieved a replacement pair within a short period of time (still before Christmas) and checked them to see if they had all of the stones intact. Unfortunatly, the replacement pair also had a earring that was missing a peridot stone (in a different position than the last pair). After I sent the second pair back, Amazon.com refunded my money and apologized for the problem.

Three tracks are excellent, namely \\"Spooky,\\" \\"Burning Man,\\" and \\"Walk On The Moon.\\" The rest of the album is seriously lacking in melody and interest. Glimpses of brilliance shine through -- a bassline here, a guitar hook there -- but too much of the album is formless techno. I'm not opposed to Daniel's techno direction -- \\"Hot Trip to Heaven\\" and \\"Lift\\" are my two favorite Love and Rockets albums, in fact. But those albums had far more compelling SONGS, while too much of this album is simply beats without any distinguishing features. His previous solo albums and Tones on Tail releases are far superior.Buy it if you're a fan -- the three great tracks make it worthwhile -- but don't expect much. This easily surpasses \\"Sweet F.A.\\" in being the least rewarding album that D.A. has ever been involved with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dan being All Daniel","review":"Mr. Ashes latest release shows us everything he's made of.Here we get Tones on Tale to the Electronica of LnR LIFT.It's all about the hypnotist and Ash is a master. It's refreshing to hear an artist make an album for himself and not the fans who want the same songs written over and over.He's never been afraid to evolve as an artist and I've had to relearn at every release. Look at each departure the LnR releases took from their previous. Viva Le Daniel.If you don't like the latest, you clearly don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, Daniel, Why?","review":"Sad. Just sad. At this point, Daniel Ash appears to just be going through the motions. The cover of Spooky is nice, but seems like a throwaway embedded in a series of forced tunes.

I worshipped him for many years, but I think at this point I have to agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album","review":"This album is great and while it is a turn from his other works (Of course! Give him some credit, Mr. Fanbase) it can be compared a little to Love & Rockets' \\"Lift\\".

Where most of us are reluctant to get involved, she is completely at ease with the sick and down-trodden. The eager smiles that greet her show that she is well-known and highly revered in the worst circumstances. Even though there many who follow in her footsteps, there is clearly only one Mother Teresa who towers above all. If this film were more widely distributed among teen-age venues, there might be less emphasis on self and violence and more thought to others and their needs.

You follow her and her fellow nuns as they change unchangable minds, help the forgotten, love the unloved and move people and governments to be able to help and love more. If you don't know much about Mother Teresa it gives you such a powerful view of her life and her impact. If you already hold Mother Tereas in great regard, this video will only increase your respect and admiration.

Features great guitar work by Charlie Sexton, Jon Dee Graham, Kurt Neumann (The Bodeans). The production (by Austin's Michael Ramos)is fantastic. Overall, I would suggest this album to anybody. It's well worth your time and money. Although this band has broken up, some members play in Dallas' Deadman...who's music i would also recommend. Also, check out Nashville's Milton Mapes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This is poorly designed. My children received it as a gift and shortly after, things began breaking. The dog tag snapped. Then the leash bolts came off (choking hazard). Even if yours does not have breakage, there are thick rubber bands on each wheel which slide off every time the toy is used. This means they will end up either in a child's mouth, the vacuum cleaner or in your cleanup routine to put them back on the wheels all the time. On top of it all, because the height of the item is so tall, this item always falls over when pulled by a child.I even called the company to tell them they needed to use rubber wheels or to adhere the bands on the wheels permanently and their response was that the bands are not a choking hazard as they pass the \\"size\\" test requirement. So much for wanting to improve the product!! Too bad because the toy is really cute, but that is the only thing its got going for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"I purchased this toy for my grandson. While it quickly became a favorite for him and his playmates, it also became apparent that the construction would not hold up to children tugging on it, as it frequently fell apart. My son-in-law has glued back various sections, only to have the tail or ear torn off next. The leash also quickly came off and is now tied back on. My grandson was working the rubber off the wooden wheels, so it was necessary to remove it, to avoid a choking hazard. All in all, this was our most disastrous gift choice to date, and after reading some other reviews, I feel it may be unsafe and should be tossed out when our grandson isn't looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensual and Moving","review":"I had this recording on LP.

And for all the hooplah surrounding the \\"banned\\" episode:Part 2 is that this is not a great FG episode. It's not the raunchiest, it's not the best written and by far, it's not the funniest.I will say, at least, that it is probably one of the more thought-provoking: SPOILER ALERT ** SPOILER ALERT ** SPOILER ALERT **** SPOILER ALERT **There is much to converse about after, as the question lingers: what would you do if you were carrying a baby as surrogate for another couple, who then die?

To me, one episode is simply not worth the price they're asking for it, especially now that it is becoming more and more routine for \\"Family Guy\\" to release overpriced and/or incomplete DVD sets. But, if you're an avid collector or someone who's really interested in the extras, then why not go ahead and get it?For the average viewer, though, I think the right thing to do with this particular product is simply to rent it and then, if you still want to own a copy, wait until the price comes down a bit. Sure, you're only saving a few bucks, but it's better in your pockets than theirs, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"One episode for $10?","review":"I saw this episode online and yes, it is funny... but not worth $10.

Not even the Live Cast reading or the special Stage show warrant a pack-in feature for this single episode - and why was it banned? Simply because of the sensitive nature of implanting, so don't expect anything better that the un-rated collections you already have.

I have noticed lately though that they seem to be carrying gags too long (IMHO to use up time) and the overall quality of the writing has diminished. That said, the regular show still gets a chuckle out of me once in a while. The ONLY redeeming feature of this particular product was it's brevity. Definitely not worth the money. I suggest you only get this if you can get it for FREE. The only reason I didn't give it one star was due to my fondness of the series in general. I am hoping the upcoming star wars parody will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 show for 10 dollars, not worth it.","review":"My complaint is that it's only one show, the show itself I liked.

Its no secret that there has been a drop in quality in the later seasons and while I have wanted to drop the show at several points I lack the will power to give up on it completely. Family Guy is no stranger to making bold and offensive jokes before, but they were always quick jokes their were never suppose to be episodes pro or anti anything political or religiously. I have to say that this is probably the worst Family Guy episode that I have ever seen and that's not just because of its subject matter. Being a bored 16 year old, I don't pretend to know anything about politics. Aside from being boring, and unfunny it is incredibly preachy and cringe worthy. With a ending gag so predictably unfunny that it will make you want to never watch a Family Guy episode again."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIPPING OFF THE FANS","review":"I am a huge fan of \\"Family Guy\\", but feel the studio kicked us in the teeth one too many times. First they split the seasons, then release the Star Wars episodes seperately from their seasons, now they are selling an individual episode! If it sells well, they will do it over and over.

Overly Politically biased, and strong handed about it. The writers should stick to senseless jokes and not attempt to enter a moral/political debate. I've been a fan since Day 1 and never felt offended or robbed by the show or dvds, until this DVD. AVOID BUYING!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was not a very good episode of Family Guy and I am a fan.","review":"With Family Guy, there are good episodes and episodes that are not very good. This falls into the latter. I was greatly disappointed. It deals with abortion so I guess that is why it was banned from TV.

I am not sure why it did not just end up on the season dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handled Perfectly","review":"Especially for Family Guy; this episode, and this subject matter were handled perfectly and objectively in my point of view.

But this stand alone episode release left me wondering if this title warranted a lone release, over simply being included in their usual 1/2 season release. I had very few laughs and mostly felt either bored or wanting. It seemed like a message piece, rather than the usual over top satire of a very serious topic:Abortion. I usually enjoy FG dvd's repeatedly, but this one will not be viewed more than perhaps twice. It simply is NOT worth the 10.00 to own. Wait for it to be on the clearance table or used, it simply is that bad. I wanted to laugh, but couldn't even force myself. Usually FG has me cracking up throughout, but this one took itself too seriously and it failed to launch comedically. The only saving grace is the almost live special, table read, etc. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"a rip off","review":"I found the episode after 30-60 seconds of perusing the internet (as of 1-Oct-2010). It is hilarious but the notion of paying [...] for one 20 minute episode is pure and total greed on the producers' part. I understand the reasons behind not airing the episode on network television, but if they at all cared about their fans, the episode would be included on a total season boxed-set. While mainstream commercial sites like youtube may not carry the episode, a million and one other sites do.Sure, one or two might be asked to cease but digital media is impossible to contain in our modern era. Enjoy the episode, commercial free on the internet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its good but...","review":"Its a good episode but it aired in the UK and that is it.

However, laying down the full list price for this DVD is practically highway robbery, more so considering that this will no doubt be included in an eventual box set release. That being said though, while watching the episode one can see just why Fox decided not to air it, although it is nowhere near as controversial, apalling, or offensive as you may have heard it to be. The special features are decent though, with a great commentary from Seth MacFarlane and crew, and the live table read with the voice cast is worth checking this DVD out for alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"family guy partial terms of endearment","review":"i love this episode. it did not offend me at all. it just made me laugh and laugh and laugh"},{"rating":"1","title":"Corporate Greed Meets Family Guy","review":"It was a kick in the butt when Family Guy was no longer released in seasons, but volumes thus creating more volumes to buy. But one episode for a DVD? Absolutely ridiculous no matter how much filler material you add to it.Granted this is a very funny episode.

You would be better off just using a tape measure. It's way too sensitive, the area of a stud being located is about 6 inches wide, so you divide that in half and it's still no where close. I still had to drill several holes to locate the stud which was 2 inches from the left beep and 4 inches from the right side beep.

This thing found studs only going from right to left. Then it wouldn't quit beeping after the stud had passed. Going from left to right on a wall doesn't make it go off at all.

It's like a paradox. This stud only exists if you move right to left?? This happens over and over and over with this tool. I'm completely a layman when it comes to home repairs and handymanly work. Using this tool, I found a stud, mounted a monitor, put a little weight on it, and it pulled right out. Turns out, I was almost an entire inch away from the stud, while the whole time I assumed I was dead center inside it. Probably my mistake, but this tool did not help at all.It's not all bad, as it has accurately helped me on more than one occasion. I just have to take it's readings with a grain of salt, and usually have to do drill tests with my smallest bit, just to be certain."},{"rating":"1","title":"God Awful","review":"It just doesn't work... plain and simple.

This tool should actually be called a nailfinder because after reading the directions, it indicates that the stud is found by magnetically locating the nails which attach the drywall to the stud. So that means there may not be a nail right where you want a hole, but with a little patience, you can find a nail either above or below and use a level to indicate where you should pound to hit the stud.

Mr. Harper and Mrs. Givens were abducted in 1965, their bodies found several months later and 3 persons were charged with their murders.

It kind of does for Matthew Perry what \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" did for Jim Carrey. As much as I liked the Carrey movie, at times it was very confusing.

His compositions are moving, funky, tasteful and have some real bite. Nowadays much of the jazz played on the radio is so mellow that its fine for background music but its not the least bit challenging or engaging. Chris Ho's music is melodic yet has some punch ala the Yellowjackets. His band burns led by an incredible sax player, Wayne Wayne. No your not seeing double that's his moniker. Wayne plays with an intense soulfulness and is able to blend bop with with fusion. Throw into this mix the tight guitar work of Mike O'Neil and Chris' satisfying soloing and you have an outstanding effort.

My initial reaction was how can we as humans resort to such savagery. The reality is that war seems to be a necessary evil where freedom is threatened. One asks if there couldn't be a better way - I don't know if there is an answer to this question.The last few lines of the film were deep - it calls us to ask of ourselves the same question - are/have our lives been worthy of the sacrifice made on our behalf - by men and woman who have gone before and fought for freedom and then by the sacrifice of Jesus trading His sinless life for our sinful one.We will need to give an account for our lives one day.

It is up there among great war films, but ones such as Das Boot, Apocalypse Now, Catch-22, and Full Metal Jacket still stand out as the tops. I urge you to check those out first before or in addition to Saving Private Ryan.I would say that Saving Private Ryan had impeccable and more realism in the D-Day and battle scenes. Yet in a way it detracted from the real suspense and horror of war by just handing the viewer graphical depictions -- limbs on a silver platter, if you will. The other movies I mentioned show the real face of war -- it's atrocities and absurdities. While the plot of Saving Private Ryan dances around those things also, I believe it gets buried in the audio and video technological wizardry.

War is hell and the men who fought and died for you and me are true heros."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest war movie ever?","review":"Well, maybe, maybe not...I'm certainly not a war movie officionado, but SPR was excellent. If you haven't seen it, you've certainly at least heard about the opening half hour. While it is great (especially on DVD with surround), the movie as a whole was fantastic with some good insight into each of the characters. Tom Hanks was, as usual, believable and inspiring in his role. This movie, while full of generous doses of action, really shows the horrors of war.

The opening sequence will never be forgotten. You felt like you were really there. This movie represents only one slice of what war was like. It was about heroes making unusual sacrifices against insurmountable odds. I don't think Spielberg glorified war. To the contrary, he made war feel so real to the viewers that they shouldn't forget the patriots that lost their life for our freedom. I hope to one day visit the D-Day museum Spielberg talks about at the end of the movie. If you enjoy great acting, sound, cinematography, a great story, and the realism of war, this movie is highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with DTS version","review":"I have Panasonic A310 and I have problem playing the DTS version.

This is a very moving tribute to those who died for our country during WWII (especially to those who sacrficed their lives on June 7, 1944 when Normandy was invaded.)

Thank you Mr. Spielberg for telling the story the way it happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best war movie ever, if not the best movie ever!","review":"Saving Private Ryan was a gruesome portrayal of war. It is avery true to life story about D-Day. It is was hard to believe that there was actually a soldier who was brought off the front because three of his brothers where dead. This movie is gory, but it is also what it would have been like on those beaches, its Speilberg and Hanks at there best."},{"rating":"2","title":"War is never pretty","review":"This film shows us a slight picture of how it was.

A must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding, moving, unreal.....one of the best ever!!!","review":"If you don't love this movie you don't love movies.

I own very few movies but this will be part of my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not about the futility of war","review":"Despite what one reviewer wrote, Saving Private Ryan shows us that some evils have to be fought.

If you sometimes like movies just for their technical achievements then this won't let you down, that is if you can stomach the dizzying first-person camera work. Someone needs to tell Mr. $pielberg that a person's head tends to compensate for movement quite a bit better than his \\"realistic\\" camera work is supposed to portray. Finally, the characters are more \\"wooden\\" than Al Gore, which is a serious disservice to our underappreciated vets."},{"rating":"2","title":"War hits home in this Spielberg epic","review":"I have just recently viewed 'Saving Private Ryan' and would like to praise all involved. This film is a must see for people of any age. It shows the complete sacrifice and dedication of the soldiers during the D-Day invasion and also deals with other, deeper social issues. Being someone in his twenties, I had not realized the true nature of this war until it was presented to me in this stunning visual format. These men died so that we would know freedom. They deserve our respect and our thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best movie in the world of movies.","review":"I thought that this was one of the best movies ever made.

The best part of the film is the D-Day scene, then I fell asleep for the remainder of the film. He should have used a cast that was unrecognizable. I just cant believe Hanks was cast in this movie.

It really portrays war as it really looks.However, that's all that's good about it.The actors are horrible, and the script is even worse. It's a very corny movie- for instance, when the P-51's destroy the Tiger tank right on time near the end of the movie. The SS men in the end of the movie were far more skilled in combat than the movie portrays them to be (some say the best soldiers in the world at the time). All the Allied killings of prisoners are lauded as heroic and justified, while the German atrocities are given a far more evil tone. It's no coincidence that the show was very anti-German because the director is Jewish. I'm not saying that what the Germans did was right, but Mr. Spielberg, please don't let personal vendettas get in the way of directing a historical movie.Apart from the special effects, the movie is pure garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO CHARACTERS AT ALL...","review":"People keep wondering how it came that Spielberg took the OSCAR for best director and not best Film also, what is a pretty good rare occasion. The answer is very clear when you watch this movie: there is no plot, no character development, nothing, only war battles (the best ever made, for sure). It would be impossible to win the Best FIlm award."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Typical Hollywood War Film","review":"Even if one overlooks the glaring historical inaccuracies in this film, Saving Private Ryan is your basic Spielberg war epic, nothing more, nothing less: John Williams' crescendos every fifteen minutes, a few ridiculous utterly unbelievable circumstances (the roomful of Germans exposed by the collapsed wall), predictable bloodshed (the troops getting butchered immediately upon landfall), on and on and on. I don't doubt Spielberg's good intentions here. And to his credit, some of the shots are outstanding. The erratic frame-rate during the beachhead was particularly well executed. But the incredible, overwhelming patriotic slant of the film itself is ultimately bogus and unrewarding. This film plods along beside the antiquated Hollywood propaganda films of yesteryear (albeit with modern gore), it achieves nothing more than its predecessors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seen It Before! By Far Not the Best War Movie","review":"I have seen many great war movies from Full Metal Jacket to Glory and both have given the tremendous aspects of war. For Full Metal Jacket, it was the grittiness of the General(not 100% sure of his rank), for Glory it was strong about racism. But in Saving Private Ryan, I've seen it all and the open scene really set the tone for a dull movie with no special theme. Were soldiers really that stupid back then? Okay, fine, they're looking for Private Ryan just for American pride. I think you can get that American pride from many Hollywood movies. I'm not saying it's a totally horrible film but if you're going to make me sit for 3 hours, I better see something new. I think Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise are great actors; they just need a new script with a promising plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Spielberg Anti-German Overdone FX Movie","review":"This movie is nothing without the special effects. It's yet another movie which attempts to make people believe that the odds in Normandy were against the Allied Air, Sea and Land Machine. The Germans didn't have more than one plane over the Normandy beaches during the entire invasion. Even if the Germans had quicker panzer support it is hard to believe that the invasion would have had a different outcome. At least the movie does show that the allies were just as brutal as the axis when it came to war...But here too, Spielberg trys to make it acceptable for the allies to murder prisoners, but a war crime for the Germans to do the same. The Nazi Ministry of Propaganda under Goebbels was never as capable as Hollywood under Spielberg. See Stalingrad or the Winter War instead. I'm really tired of Spielberg getting rich off of German bashing."},{"rating":"1","title":"SPIELBERG'S WORST FILM","review":"Overrated World War II drama, that somehow became a big hit, and won Spielberg his second Academy Award. The film starts and ends with two very realistic battle scenes, but what they put in the middle is meaningless and pointless; pure corn. I admire Spielberg the serious, older director, but somehow I miss the young director who made movies like E.T., Jaws, Duel and Raiders of the Lost Ark. His latter-day-work has lost that wonderful sense of wonder that made him so dear to movie buffs. Some of the action is very realistic, but if I will only want realism, I would watch a documentary. I prefer the poetic and more powerful Platoon, a film that reminds me of the young Spielberg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut versons","review":"LET THE BUYER BEWARE! I recently purchased a copy of Saving Private Ryan from an online store. I received a cut version and am very disappointed. There are no times listed in the descriptions so the buyer is unaware of whether this is a full or cut version of the movie. The current online store (Amazon) does not list the length of the movie. Therefore, how do I know which version I am getting? Do I buy another one and pay the shipping to return it? If I buy enough of them on line, the return shipping costs will more than equal my time to go to a video store and purchase the correct version."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie that requires special credentials to review","review":"Unless you were in firefights in WW2, Korea, or Vietnam, you really are unable to review this movie and have no business doing so. Everyone of us who saw this in real life were left crying messes by this movie. No one would think of offending the victims of rape, molestation, child torture or other hideous violence by making a \\"technically perfect rendition\\" of it so others could \\"enjoy the gore without the fear\\" or offer insipid reviews about character development as if no one died for their freedom to do so.

Once I saw it, I realized why. It is directed so well, that the movie looks like it's through the eyes of a soldier, yet, in hollywood quality.

It is long, and somewhat tedious at times, but nevertheless, SEE THIS MOVIE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Moving - not one of Tom Hank's better movies","review":"Personally of you're looking for a good war movie I'd suggest Midway over this.

The plot is entirely dirivitive. The action scenes seem real, but way, way over the top, especially the first shots on Omaha beach.

As General Sherman said, \\"War is hell\\" and so is watching this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and pretentious","review":"Yes, the opening scene at Omaha Beach is riveting. The problem is, they put it at the beginning of the movie, and it's all downhill from there. The rest of the movie is mostly a mishmash of contrived dialogue, forced acting, and cornball speeches. I find its depiction of war quite inaccurate, with its apparent message that war ennobles its participants and brings out the best in soldiers (and includes lots of moving oratory by guys like Tom Hanks). Quite simply, that isn't true. I found \\"Platoon\\" and \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" to be much more accurate portrayals of the psychological impact of war.

I personally do not so my opinion is very subjective.

The idea of the movie was really good but there was too much blood for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Remarkable Film!","review":"Never before has a film caught my attention as this one did. Before viewing it, I was assuming I'd see another machine-gun cracking, bomb-exploding depiction of World War II.

He did mention that over 1,000 men dead first hour of the landing. I could tell it still bothered him and after seeing the movie I can definetly see why. Nothing someone tells you can prepare you for that. I apprecite even more what my dad and others like him did and how I hope we never forget the bravery and sacrifice they made. I also think it illustrates what my dad told told me, \\"There is nothing glorious about war,just pain,sorrow and waste\\".

What was the worst was the scene with the German guy getting arrested and forced to dig a ditch singing \\"I say can you see\\" (a mockery of our anthem); then it's very ironic that Ryan - a private - ignored the ordered from Chief of Staff General Marshall to return home, and nobody did anything to punish Ryan for disobeying a direct order, this among other mistakes makes this movie, in my opinion, the worst WW2 movie ever.

For a real movie about a battle you should all watch Left Behind, based on the books written by Tim and Jerry. They are great and they tell the story of the rapture which is sure to be coming soon with filth like this being shown in todays homes.
