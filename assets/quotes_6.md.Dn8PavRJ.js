There were one or two images I enjoyed in the book but apart from that there was very little that held my interest. Watson is perhaps the most well known West Indian painter yet it seems he has no interest in identifying himself with that wonderful region, at least according to the pieces selected for this book.

He is an outstanding composer with a voice that cannot mixed up with anybody else's. I would classify him as italian romantic pop. It's his niche and he knows it. That's where his success comes from.This album is within that line. All songs are great, overall better than his prior effort in 2003 but never to the level and intensity of his memorable \\"Un Vincitore non c'e'\\" (2000). Yet I recommend this CD to all those who enjoy contemporary music from Italy. In this album, his best example of creativity is the second track, \\"Soltanto un attimo\\" (Only a moment).

I had trouble getting the batteries in- the spot is very tight, but I was finally able to jam the batteries in. The switch was very hard to slide to the on position, although this would probably get better with more use. The big problem I have with this is the LED light that is used to illuminate. The one I had as a child used a regular bulb, and you were able to see the items clearly. The LED light casts a purple haze on the items and washes out what you are looking at. I used to love looking at my skin with this toy. Try that with this one and you lose most of the detail and it appears you are looking at an alien's skin....funny I didn't know I had purple alien skin.

You can still use it I believe b/c I've played both with this version and with the 4th Edition, but it's less confusing if your hex tiles, trading ports, and resource cards look the same.Also, note that the expansion takes longer to play than the 3-4 player basic game.

When she is first introduced as the legendary Carmen, it is almost comical. She looks old, plain with but two outstanding features--horse teeth and a big nose. Later, her attempts at being a temptress are undeniably ludicrous. How she landed this part will remain a mystery to me. Wallace Reid, on the other hand, is brilliant as always. It's just hard to imagine a young, strapping Reid heartbroken for a woman who looks like she could be his mother. It was like Pierce Brosnan going after Streisand in The Mirror Has Two Faces.

However after my first watch of 3 years died (a walmart special) I put this one into use. After 11 days I noticed it was broken. Apparently while I was washing my hands the button to set the analog watch fell off and water made it into the watch.

I thought about making a warranty claim, but the apparent impact was just hard enough to scratch the plastic barrier designed to protect it. I couldn't believe it. My last one didn't have the barrier, likely because it didn't need it. Timex has seriously sacrificed quality in pursuit of keeping prices low.

Just as Safe As Milk is my favorite pop album by the Captain from 1967."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear Spot not Trout Mask Replica","review":"I'm a Beefheart fan from way back although I don't listen to him so often these days. Trout Mask Replica is forever showing up on lists of rock connoisseurs. It may be one of those cool records to have but how many folks who have it actually listen to it? Let's face it, despite some great moments, Trout Mask is virtually unlistenable in many parts and even some of the better parts seem little more than novelty today.Spotlight Kid/Clear Spot is a great value for the money. Spotlight Kid isn't so hot but has a few good songs. Clear Spot, on the other hand, is the Captain's best album for my money. Clear Spot is his most consistent and accessible collection of songs (even had an AM radio mini hit in Too Much Time) but it still retains a fair share of fun and crazyness. Go for this one as the best introduction to the Captain. Then go for one of the later releases - Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller) or Doc at the Radar Station."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear Spot - best recording of all time","review":"Cap'n and the boys put together the most brilliant album of all time in Clear Spot.

One more thing: Amazon says this watch's bracelet has a safety clasp, and the site includes a link to a drawing showing the clasp. This, too, is inaccurate, for the bracelet has no safety clasp.

I laugh and I cry when I listen to it, not because it's ridiculous (although there's some of that), but because it's not afraid of emotion, of expression, of drama.

The eliminator is meant to bracket to a light stand but we usually set them on the stage shining up at us. This one works better because it has a stand built into it. This also has a clear plastic cover that protects the LEDs. The Eliminator I had to add an extra brackett so it would stand on the floor without falling over.

I had planned on using the eraser of a pencil with the touchpad instead of my finger to cut down on my wrist movement but found the touchpad does not work with anything but your finger. So using the index finger or any finger, I'm still using the same tendon and nerves in my wrist and arm.It requires very soft touches which takes a little practice. I was tapping too hard in the beginning. Highlighting, dragging and moving lines takes some practice as well. I have not used the programmable features yet. Since the touchpad hasn't eliminated my pain, I'm trying to stay off my computer as much as possible.If you have no pain, I feel you would prefer this over a mouse. Being able to hold it in close to your body or on your lap is a more natural position than extending your arm out gripping a mouse.I wish I had started using this before the mouse, I probably wouldn't have developed my wrist problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adesso EasyCat 2-Button PS/2 Glidepoint Touchpad","review":"Great but hard to find product.

There is a hi-nrg version of Vienna Calling, a hip-housy version of Der Kommissar and a down-beat version of Rock Me Amadeus, among other \\"hits\\".

It's timing release was bad, the story is more cheesy than a triple-cheese pizza, the inclusive add-ins of acting make no sense, and the circus stuff is even more ridiculous. I think the entire cast and crew were so high on cocaine and LSD that they completely justified it, include the hippie movement at the end of the film. Totally ludicrous.This film also severely hurt the film career of Catherine Mry Stewart. She nearly bounced back after \\"Night of the Comet\\", but then \\"The Last Starfighter\\" shot her back down, mostly ending her film career. In all honesty, this is a movie to get high on, or to bang to. This film was exactly like Xanadu, musical and creative, but way too cheesy and timed all wrong. Yes, throw this into the Worst Films Ever bin with Blues Brothers 2000 and Poltergeist 2 & 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad but not fun","review":"This movie fails in every department. A musical with bad songs (it was the first effort from the composer who later went on to score Mortal Kombat II and American Ninja III). Frequent dance scenes with dull choreography. A message movie with nothing to say. An earnest movie warning the audience about evil record producers, created by Golan/Globus, men who made a career of producing movies that cheated audiences.It WAS fun to see such a flagrant gay sensibility in a 1980 movie. One dance number cut between firemen, construction workers, policemen in tights, and a biker gang in black leather. But the flip side of that is that the women's costumes weren't sexy: they were just weird.The comparison between The Apple and Rocky Horror Picture Show is unfair. Rocky Horror had great songs, fine singers, a sense of humor, and a clever visual style. The Apple has none of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not golden or delicious","review":"I brought this film because it's projected as a silent backdrop at a club I go to and it looks completely surreal. However, after getting it home I realised why I had never heard of it before. It is absolutely dire. Terrible plot, acting and songs. Not even campily funny in manner of Showgirls or Rocky Horror. Just awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird, but kind of fun","review":"There is no real way to describe this film except to say that it is goofy and enjoyable. While not a classic (I doubt I could watch it many times) it is worth seeing once or twice. The \\"future\\" of 1994 is just funny. It's worth it to see all the weird clothes and makeup. The acting is, at times, a little over the top, but that's intentional.The musical numbers are varied and many. While clearly a lot of effort was put into them, they are not particularly memorable. The same could be said for the songs, which left barely an impression at all once the movie was over. But while they're going on, you can enjoy them.Worth a watch if you're interested in some eighties strangeness, but otherwise, I'll stick with Xanadu."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst piece of work I ever loved.","review":"I thought I would continue going through life singing \\"Alfie where are you now, Will I ever see your face again?\\" Thank you for the release of this lack luster film.

You got what I need! You need this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Synth-city","review":"Not that great, really. One track is pretty decent, #7, which is a suite of various themes from the original series TV show and movies. But it's performed by an actual orchestra. The rest of the CD is all-synth manufactured music. On some of the tracks, like the Klingon Battle and Theme from Star Trek The Motion Picture, the synthy sound isn't that bad, it's actually almost good (and a little different). On others, like the Theme for The Voyage Home, it's just awful, you can barely hear the main theme music over the accompanying synthed instruments. Kind of a mixed bag, but all right if you get it cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly accessible and recommended reading.","review":"The Courtship Dance Of The Borderline is a informative, humanistic look at \\"borderline personality disorder\\", a mental illness characterized by the afflicted person's tendency to resolutely divide the world into heroes and villains. Author and psychiatrist Anthony Walker, M.D. recounts the his marriage to a woman with borderline personality disorder and how their relationship became pathologically harmful to both of them. A straightforward, understanding view, The Courtship Dance Of The Borderline was deliberately and successfully written to be as accessible to the lay reader as to a mental health professional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable and Validating","review":"Dr. Walker is a good and articulate writer who accomplishes an amazing amount -- from South Africa to Boston -- in just 139 pages of very short chapters on a mercifully brief but pivotal marriage to a borderline personality (and her privileged psychogenic family) while in medical school and on his close Catholic family life as one of eight children. A necessarily cathartic memoir, Dr. Walker is a compassionate but awake psychiatrist whose \\"instinct for self-preservation\\" motivated a savvy specialization in BPD. Highly recommended for non-bps in need of validation, not recommended for borderline personalities who are not well into recovery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invitation to relationship problems","review":"It seems that Dr. Walker forgot the first commandment for therapists: do not socialize with patients. In the case of former patients, two years must elapse before there is any contact outside of the therapeutic relationship. Dr. Walker failed to maintain clear boundaries and invited disaster. He portrays himself as a victim who was simply trying to \\"rescue\\" a patient who was diagnosed with BPD. He conveniently views his book as a case study of a borderline. He describes what it is like to live with someone suffering from an irrational fear of abandonment, but he doesn't acknowledge his contribution to the failed relationship. How about the havoc and problems his \\"unprofessional\\" behavior caused for his mentally ill wife. Shame on you, Dr.Walker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Word of Warning","review":"Thanks to \\"Anthony Walker's\\" fear of being identified, we do not know if he is a real person or really if anything he is writing is true. He works at \\"A Prestigious American Hospital.\\" At best this is letter to Playboy and at it's scariest this man is one of the 10% of men in the mental health profession who admit to sexually assaulting their patients. Because the provider/patient relationship creates such a power imbalance, it is not legal or possible for a patient in the psychiatric care of someone to \\"consent\\" to a relationship. \\"Anthony\\" is a coward who has not given his \\"wife\\" the chance to defend herself. I think in all likelihood, she would tell us a very different story about a controlling and abusive man."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is Help out there","review":"I read the book very quickly. It as really an easy read. I am a BPD but didn't understand why the girl in the book didn't receive better help. I know for a fact that help is out there. I was discouraged that she didn't get the help she desperatly needed. I am proud of myself to know that I can do better than the character in the book.

The author described and illustrated the behaviour of the sufferer, and in a compassionate way showed the despair behind the behaviour. He also showed the debilitaing effect the behaviour of a sufferer of borderline personality disorder has on those close to her. I recommend it to anyone who is troubled by manipulative and disruptive behaviour of someone they know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hodgepodge of The Worst of Rod Stewart & Faces","review":"* Many tracks consist only of cut-off pieces of the whole songs.* The audio and video quality are abysmal.* In several cases, the audio is taken from the studio record, combined with grainy live shots.- Sometimes, when the gap between audio and video becomes too obvious, the audio breaks from studio into live performance (e.g., on \\"Stay With Me\\").* Info lines, graphical elements are laid over the live pictures. Instead of adding value, they reduce whatever value may be there.\\"You Wear It Well\\" is presented with Rod's own post-Faces band, accompanied by pictures and photos of newspaper clippings on the Faces.* On \\"True Blue\\", Ron Wood prematurely enters the final fast part of the song, while the rest of the band have to play catch-up.

It is double-sided tape, clear - once you remove the blue paper backing. I can use this and the wig will stay on for a week. I remove it using Lace Release. This works great. All you have to do is spray the Lace Release on the taped areas, wait about a minute and then slowly lift up on the hair. Spray a little more, wait and repeat until the wig has been removed. Once the wig is removed, you may just need to spray a little more lace release on any remaining tape that is still attached to the wig or hair. Wait a minute and slide the glued section of the wig against a mirror. This will release the taped residue without damaging the wig or the hair.

The composition veers toward Danny Elfman territory at times, acheiving a huge, lumbering behemoth sort of sound which hovers between the comic and the menacing. Very successful overall, and a significant addition to the cello concerto cannon.The Kodaly sonata is one of the best compositions for solo cello in this century, and here the performance is outstanding, far superior to Yo-Yo Ma's dry rendition on \\"Solo.\\" I recommend this CD with no hesitations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give it a zero rating","review":"Who are you and what have you done with Burt Bacharach?

The pic wasnt great before that either. So now a month after the warranty it flips out. The black \\"Polaroid\\" startup screen is now all red. The pictures is totally screwed, its kind of hard to explain what has happened to it, the resolution is screwed, pixelized garbage and the colors are way off. Called Polaroid and after talking to a guy there he said he has come to the end of his troubleshooting abilities and said I could send it back to Polaroid and they would SELL me another. Kinda funny, I entertained the notion to see how much they wanted to charge, they said they would call back with a price. A week later a guy calls at 2:00 PM wanting numbers on the back of the plasma. I am at work so cant do it. He said he would call back at 5:00 PM when I am off work, no call. Been a week and nothing. Long story short........Dont buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"We bought this TV a little over 2 years ago and guess what it just broke. We unfortunately did not buy the extended warranty so we are out of luck. My husband called Polaroid and they told him that they would fix it for 650 dollars plus us paying shipping and handling each way. That's a joke considering you can buy a brand new one for a little more than that these days. The picture went black in one area and the rest is a mix of red and blue. I am really disappointed and would give this zero stars if I could, when you spend 2000 on a tv you would expect it to last quite a bit longer than 2 years. this is a shame because it had a nice picture until this happened. if you do a google search on the internet you will see that many, many people have had problems with this tv and you should not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Don't waste the money.

And if I use the 4oz bottle with this liner and try to put in two scoops of formula and you can BARELY fit one scoop in! I received some preformed when I bought both sets of bottles and didn't try them at first since I had the other liners, but now that I've had so many difficulties with these liners- I'm using the preformed and I love them.

They could not help me. You'd think it wouldn't be that difficult for two college educated parents to assemble a toy. The toy is a cute idea with poor craftmanship. It could NOT have been tested for actual use or it never would have hit the toy stores. You cannot keep the slides both on at the same time nor can you really keep the entire slide together.

Well, neither my husband nor I can get the slides to stay in one piece or to stay attached to the towers. The swings keep pulling off as well. My poor little girl tries to play gently, but any movement at all and the thing falls apart. As I type, my hubby is attempting to super glue the whole thing together. Hopefully that will keep it ine one piece so Polly and her friends can slide in peace. As a side note, the \\"color change hair\\" of the doll included with our set barely changes color at all.

I don't know whybut she plays with Polly's a lot more than the little Bratz.She has the whole mall and all the little Bratz with a greatshinny lip case and it just sits under the end table. Onemajor drawback is the pink plastic slides on the sides.They are miserable to put on and after twelve attempts Iwas ready to put this toy in the garbage.

Disassembled, it just sits there because it's not worth the trouble to snap it all back together again. This toy is an invitation for a mess of water on your floor and it's a pain to store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"This appears to be a really cute toy, but it doesn't stay together.

Our track season is at the hottest time of the year. (August-October) when my girls come back from summer break, they are out of shape. It is so hard to get them into shape without serious strains, shin splints,etc. when the heat index is 100plus. The workout in the book is wonderful because it's easy to teach the skills on land before getting into the pool. I don't have the time to teach an \\"aerobic workout'. i like knowing that I'm using the same basic skills that are used on the track and transferring to the pool. It makes the best out of every practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jon Norsworthy is a wonderful teacher for beginners","review":"One of the most entertaining golf instructors that I've ever watched. The video begins with two new beginners to golf and Jon teaches them golf from the ground up. In between lessons, they visit scenic places all over France.Not only was the DVD entertaining, but my game actually did improve after incorporating some of its tips....especially on putting. The natural instinct method seemed to really work for me better than most private lessons--and at a much better price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost In Time","review":"These lessons are dated, out of touch and older than God.

Jon is so laidback in his instruction, you are just kind of absorbing the knowledge. The footage in Valbonne is beautiful--after a day at the public course, I can only dream of going to some of those courses in France that sit on cliffs at the ocean's edge.If you like golf, or know someone who does, I would recommend this DVD. The information is solid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better instruction is out there....","review":"Sure, a few shots of France are nice, but this video was not helpfull. The students in this video have never played, watching them swing was of little use to me. If you are looking for ways to correct a slice or improve your short game, I am guessing you won't find your answer here. I regret purchasing this 20 year old video."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm going golfing in France!","review":"What a nice dvd! As a beginner, there were a couple things I now see I was doing wrong, and this dvd made it so easy to see. Now I can hardly wait to get home from work to practice my swing. But even better, after my wife saw the dvd and the beautiful settings we started planning a golf vacation in the south of France next spring! My wife is going on a GOLFING vacation? How lucky am I? Well worth the price, I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Video in DVD format ---- Overpriced","review":"The video was filmed in 1983.

The picture quality and content are both very low quality. The movie's age shows (made in the 80s) and the there are far better instructional golf videos on the market.

It doesn't go through the mechanics of the grip, stance, back swing, etc., but at the end of the course, you have learned it all.I highly recommend it to anyone picking up a golf club for the first time and for those who have played for a while and can't break 100."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book - As Usual, Better Than the Movie","review":"I loved this novel. The characters were very real to me and the story was engaging. The movie was OK, but as always I preferred the book.

Great characters and some really funny dialogue in the midst of silent tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much blather and very little story","review":"After reading 100 pages I realized I was completely uninterested in the characters or the story, if there was one. Since I had expected to enjoy the book I decided to keep reading and hoped I'd be glad I did. So at 279 pages (over half way through) when nothing else had happened at all I decided to call it quits. Yeah, I understand lots of scene setting and intro to all the characters, etc. But for 279 (or more maybe)pages? The first half of this book seriously needed an editor to cut, cut cut. With about half of the verbiage cut out maybe I could have reached the part where the plot started. Because half-way through there was no evidence at all of any storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pith and Vinegar","review":"With Empire Falls, Richard Russo traces post-industrial decline in small town America and its resultant elements of disenfranchisement, power abuse, classism and violence. Each character in this small town has a personal struggle against this gradual descent. In effect then, Russo writes the perfect story of both universal and personal entropy. That he can do all that in a way that is compassionate, philosophical and funny makes Empire Falls a great read and a worthy recipient of the Pulitzer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Bookclub Unanimously Loved Empire Falls!","review":"I wish I could give an erudite explanation of why our bookclub, two men and three women, unanimously enjoyed this book so much, as that would make this recommendation more meanful, but it is not easy. The characters and their development are absorbing. We read primarily fiction for our bookclub, and I can safely say this book would be in our top ten for the 12 years we have been together, including books like INDEPENDENCE DAY, ANGLE OF REPOSE, THE SHIPPING NEWS, ANGELA'S ASHES, KAVALIER & CLAY, THE LITTLE FRIEND, and DUPLICATE KEYS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulitzer Prize Committee...\\"You're Fired!\\"","review":"So saddened and disappointed by the fact this was chosen as a Pulitzer.

His characters are cardboard, and that plot is worthy of a Springer show. Good God."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first and last Russo book","review":"Russo's character development is good, but the characters were dull, and not that funny (although I think that was the intention.) The ending felt rushed, and it was a real let down. After 400+ pages, I expected more, especially since I wasn't 'hooked' into the book until page 200. There were no surprises, it was very predictable - it felt as though Russo was letting us in on secrets that most readers would have figured out 100 pages earlier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not deserving of the Pulitzer","review":"This was a lousy book. Poor prose, unremarkable characters, a tedious plot. I barely finished it. Go out and read Yann Martel's marvelous Life of Pi instead.

RICHARD RUSSO'S CHARACTERS CUT RIGHT TO THE HEART...WELL WORTH READING...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulitzer Shmulitzer","review":"Without the underhanded assistance of the venal French Ice Skating judge I cannot imagine how this book won a Pulitzer Prize. The writing is incredibly sloppy and the forward motion is glacial. Yes, there are some interesting and likeable, if somewhat exaggerated, characters, but I got so tied up in the author's misuse of words (\\"inference\\" and \\"vagaries\\" are only two glaring examples) and apparent misunderstanding of the proper use of tenses in the English language, so weary of his sentences going on long after they'd purged themselves of useful information, that I simply did not care. Where the heck was his editor???"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could recommend this book","review":"I tried three times to get into this book. I found the book a bore. It reminded my of a book I often had to read for a sociology or psychology course and then discuss the motives, thoughts, and desires of the people involved. It definately is not a story -- it is a study of mal-adjusted, unhappy people. There is no real action or anything to grab the reader into the story in the first 100 pages. At that point I felt I was wasting my time and reading something I did not like. NOT A SUMMER READING BOOK FOR THE BEACH. Not a page turner. I realize it won an award, but often the critic delights are not the readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish","review":"I didn't pick up this book because it won a Pulitzer, ratherit came highly recommended by a friend who usually has good taste in books. I was unimpressed with the story in general, but mostly with Russo's writing style. The part that I read seemd very forced; every line an obvious attempt by Russo to come across as \\"witty\\" and \\"humorous\\". Perhaps my dislike has something to do with the fact that I had just finished reading \\"East of Eden\\"....a superior book by a far superior writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite Russo","review":"I've loved Richard Russo novels since 'Mohawk', but perhaps I've finally OD'd. This one was an awful slog and I almost gave up, reading several other books in between attempts.Time for a new formula; Russo has worn out the poor schlemiel just barely making it through life in some northeast backwater theme. Perhaps if you haven't already read 'Nobody's Fool' and 'The Risk Pool' and 'Straight Man'...?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"I don't know if it is possible to create a more vivid sense of place and characters than Russo has achieved here. Every character comes across as distinct and incredibly real--indeed, I felt as if I had known people like each and every one. Each lives his or her life amid a dying town that somehow elicits a faint sense of hope. If you enjoy literary fiction you will love this book. It's been months since I finished this book and many of the scenes and characters are still with me. A tremendous work of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nobody's Fool","review":"I'm Nobody's Fool and, unfortunately, neither is this book - not even close. Unfortunately also, he tries, quite carelessly, to reprise Fool in many ways. A bad go from conception to completion. Maybe just a shot at making a buck - who knows.Always a bad sign when the publisher can find no reviews from substantial sources from which to quote.A big dissapointment but, from the stars already assigned by readers, clearly one can fool most of the people some of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"This is a hopelessly conventional novel written in featureless prose worthy of a government document. I'm tempted to invite the members of the Pulitzer committee over to paint my house since they're clearly not suited for the job they're doing.How about something subtle and artful for next year's award -- a piece of fiction in between the bombastic lyricism of Kavalier and Clay and the thuddingly workmanlike prose of Empire Falls? This reader would celebrate the change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely Disappointing","review":"I have read all Russo's novels. \\"The Risk Pool\\" is minor realist classic literature. \\"Nobody's Fool\\" and \\"Mowhawk\\" were very good, traditional mid-list reads, like the books of John Hassler. I ran out to buy his books in hardback. I thought \\"Straight Man,\\" another mediocre academic novel, was an aberration-it wasn't. I wonder if he wrote the movie (or made-for-TV) script in tandem for \\"Empire Falls\\"? It is the weakest link. The main character's model was probably Charlie Brown. This novel is so dull it could have been concocted by a marketing team, except that even a marketing team would have insisted on better editing to hasten the lumbering prose in the first two-thirds of the book. I feel personally betrayed by Russo; so few write convincingly about working class people. But he's another brand name now and can continue to write dull fare and make money. For what it's worth, he's off this reader's list."},{"rating":"1","title":"This won a Pulitzer!?","review":"This trite piece of fluff won a Pulitzer? While reading Empire Falls you might have the sensation that you've met all the players and their problems before, in my opinion that's because you have. There is nothing remotely new or engaging about this book. But that's not all- this book comes complete with sterotypical characters, syrupy dialogue, and an spectacularly bad 'movie of the week' ending. If you have more than two brain cells left I suggest you find another book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish the empire had fallen in less words!","review":"I love reading, in fact I often write it down as my favorite hobby. The truth is though, no matter how much I love reading I seem to love procrastinating even more! I wasn't surprised (neither was anybody else who knows me) to find that the last week before school I was still not done with this book (sorry Larry). I don't however believe that reading this novel quickly was the reason that I did not find it \\"enjoyable\\" to say the least! I felt that becuase of its INCREDIBLE length the actual story ended up drowned under pages of unecessary words. I don't regret it but I don't recommend it either. If nothing else however at least I can say it didn't fail to show me once again that procrastination should really stop being my #1 hobby!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stink, Stank, STUNK","review":"I have tried three times to read this book............I found this book very boring. Ok, the Moosehead got a little chuckle, but that is as far as it goes. I can not figure out what all the hype is about. I know there are better books out there to read with my time. Don't waste yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"glad it's over","review":"I am at a loss to find one character, or one plot-line in this book, that wasn't an overused, overwritten cliche. From the evil stepmother/witch-figure Mrs Whiting (complete with evil feline sidekick), to the beautiful Grace Roby from the wrong side of the tracks, to the ex-wife Janine who finds that losing weight and her ex-husband can't buy her happiness, I was really relieved when this book ended saving me from any more tedious dialogue from Mr. Russo."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the few I never finished","review":"I was looking for a good fiction novel since I mostly read non-fiction. I figured I couldn't go wrong with a Pulitzer Prize winner. I was wrong. Not only that, it eventually became a chore to read. Too many stories within a story and too many characters to develop. There was one 'storylet' about Miles as a child on vacation with his mother which I could've kept reading but it was only a few pages. The writing is good, I enjoyed his style, but the story itself didn't grab me and I couldn't make a connection with any of the characters. As much as I hate to do it, I finally (after many nights of being able to read 2 or 3 pages because it was so sleep-inducing, just called it quits halfway through the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible... dont bother","review":"the thinly veiled misogyny that runs through this book was enough to make me put it down in disgust. if mrs russo really does read her husband's manuscripts, as he claims in his acknowledgements, she ought to be doing a better job at pointing out how much he obviously doesn't like women. i couldn't get past page 50 but i had to because it was a book club selection. it appalls me that educated women would read this book at all... let alone enjoy it and recommend it to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"How on earth did this book win a Pullitzer?","review":"True to most formerly intelligent things in this country, it appears we've dumbed down our standards once again. In my opinion this book is one step above Steven King. True the characters are well defined, but the dialogue is terribly written, and the plot is utterly predictable. If you're looking for award winning fiction that will challenge you intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually, this is NOT the book for you. The Pullitzer people should take some lessons from the Booker people, and pick out some real literature for the prize, not brain candy like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading the movie","review":"I must admit that the diner on the cover and the wild success of Russo's book put me off. I enjoyed Russo's sense of humor and admired Miles Roby, the main character, but reading this light novel was like watching a respectable American movie. It was perfectly well done, but it didn't linger for much longer than the ride home. The teenage subplot was the most disappointing part - in the early chapters Russo struck a balance between his memory of high school and his observation of the current scene, but in the climax he sacrificed both without taking us any deeper into the nightmare with which he replaces them. He's at his best when he's exploring the bittersweet life of a mill town without a mill, but in the end fiction takes over. As result, I quickly forgot what I liked about the book in the first place. I'm sure the movie will be fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"All glowing adjectives apply","review":"To read Empire Falls is to join a small community and become intimately aquainted with it . We see what makes people tick, understand their hopes, desires and fears. Therein lies the strength of the book: to be taken so deeply into the lives of numerous characters being entertained all the way. Small mysteries unfold slowly, but the book never bogs down. The central character, Miles Roby, is as well drawn a fictional character as you'll ever come across. But Russo slights none of his Empire Falls' residents. We slowly get to know them all well. While Russo takes his time unfolding the story, we are always entertained and amused -- not to mention enlightened.This is a story about \\"normal\\" people, about small towns and about how we are connected to our past. Good call, Pulitzer Committee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Detailed, humane and flawed","review":"In his attempt to be the Chekov of blue-collar America, Mr Russo gets several things right -- Empire Falls displays a keen eye for detail, an unhurried pace, a humane investigation of characters in action and an ability to mimic the rhythms of life itself.The book, however, is flawed on at least two counts. First, the prose is little more than workmanlike. One expected more polish, more craftsmanship, at this level. And second, the narrative drive necessary to sustain a novel of such length is sorely missing. The characters have desires and drives, yes, but the action is strangely muted and bloodless -- making the book somewhat tedious to plough through.These two drawbacks make Empire Falls less than a triumph. Not deserving of the Pulitzer, in my humble opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm, not so sure about this one","review":"Richard Russo is considered a great author, heck, he is a Pulitzer Prize winner. Yet, somehow this book didn't measure up to my expectations. I found Empire Falls to be a very uninteresting read, in which you always knew where the author was headed about 20 pages before he arrived at his destination."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.9 stars and I still feel that I needed to round down","review":"Let me start by saying that I really enjoyed this book. I really enjoyed the character developement and that is the kind of reader I am. I felt many times that I could sense how the characters might have handled each situation and later in the book, I was surprised by the events, but not the characters' reactions to the situation. I love when a book ends the way that Empire Falls did(Still a few things that you want to know about the characters, so that you are allowed to ponder what they might do next).This book is funny, charming and surprising. I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"everything falls apart","review":"That sums up the message of the novel and its presentation.Empire Falls starts out as a mildly interesting character piece. The author plays out the interactions of a diverse set of characters and avoids easy judgemental pitfalls. I was intrigued by the very low level of sexuality displayed by all of the characters. Even the ex-wife in her single-minded pursuit of the perfect orgasm is only narcisistic, not sensual.Having introduced us to a community that is collectively, individually, and unanimously rotting away, Russo finally must confront the fact that there can be no satisfactory conclusion. To close out the novel, he drops the characterization (leaving lots of dangling issues) and substitutes a series of contrived, pulp-fiction plot devices (too many and too stupid to list here). The last page left me with fitting image of a town and a novel flushed down the sewer together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth Reading","review":"I have never read a book by this author, so I was coming into it blind without expectations (other than from the \\"Winner of the Pulitzer Prize\\" sticker on the cover and I've never put much stock into those prizes anyhow). I was immediately charmed by Russo's writing style, sporadically humorous and at turns elegant and creaky, just like most people, I suppose -- able to pretty up on occasion but never able to hide their shortcomings for long. It made the book feel authentic in a way, and I just liked it. I agree with those who complain about the ending. It was simply too lurid for such quietly heroic and loudly flawed characters. All through the second half of the book I felt the plot gearing up for something dramatic, and then lo-and-behold, something very dramatic happens -- and I did resent that. The rise to conclusion should have felt more natural, and with a better ending it might have. Still, this book is well worth a read, and I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read, but a Pulitzer?","review":"Most of the members of my bookclub enjoyed Empire Falls. Russo's characterization is flawless -- he manages to bring out minor characters as well as major ones. The book moves along well, and tells a believable story for the most part. The most realistic part of the book may be the end, which leaves us, much as real life, knowing how some things resolve, but not others. Real life doesn't tie everything up in a neat little package and neither does Russo -- will there be a sequel? I would read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"I was almost turned off by the fact that this novel won the Pulitzer. After several times passing up the book, I finally sat down and read it. It is a simple story about a town in Maine. That is the easiest description possible. Mr. Russo has managed to convey feelings that I recall when I was 16, 21 and 27. He has such a firm grasp on the characters that you feel as though you have known these people all your life. It did wrap up quiclky but as in real life, sometimes that does happen. Do yourself a favor and walk in the Miles Roby's life and town. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot, what plot?","review":"If you are looking for a book with an ending, don't bother with this one.After seemingly endless development of characters and environment Mr Russo decided that he had better things to do rather than develope a plot.When action finally does occur his characters all act out of character and the book ends without satifaction from the point of view of characters, history or feasible plot.One of the most dissapointing reads I have had for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Irving Lite","review":"Russo gets credit for being a brillaint writer. 'Straight Man' and 'Nobody's Fool' were excellent novels, creating characters and worlds i still recall fondly.But let's face it, this is a beach read.An Oprah book.The problem is, Oprah's book club is out of business.russo aspires to the dizzying heights of a John Irving novel. A small town, quirky characters. Ah, yes, but Irving novels (when good) have deeper meaning. (Is Owen Meany God? Does feminism destroy women? Is abortion ethical?)This novel's meaning is sadly trite: small town life is disintigrating--but it can be SAVED BY A CREDIT CARD COMPANY?I'm not sure Russo even sees the irony in his own Hollywood ending. These are the same comapnies who lay off his characters by the tens of thousands in real life.Its sad. The characters are well rounded but we've met them all before.If this were a first novel, it would have been edited to ribbons."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it","review":"I would rather stare blankly into space on than try to read this book during my morning commute. I painfully labored with the first few pages before allowing myself to skip to Chapter 1. I tried to get involved. I tried to get interested. I tried to figure out where the plot would pick up. After an entire week of trying to muster interest in \\"Empire Falls,\\" I decided that that I'd rather leave it in my pocket book than be bothered with trying to determine where the story was going. It's a shame because Russo's \\"Straight Man\\" is also sitting on my \\"to read\\" pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to read","review":"I read all the time and there are lots of books that I have enjoyed, but this is not one of them. I thought it might be interesting because I grew up in Maine, but I found the book extremely hard to read. It was much too wordy and kept jumping around from the present to the past. The ending eventually pulled together the mystery of the book, but it could have been written with less words and in a way that was more captivating. The book had me mildly interested, but this writer will never be an author that I will go back to reading in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over the top","review":"I started out liking the book but by the time I finished I kind of lost interest. The revelation of why C.B. Whiting took his own life,etc. - it didn't ring true to me. Plus the author has everything in the book but the kitchen sink!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Maybe people like me are meant to read only certain kinds of books. I have always gone with thrillers and enjoyed most of them. Sometimes, though, I want to see what else I might be missing in terms of literary pleasure.This one was a completely boring! Enough of the whining already! Nobody in this fictitious town does anything but think and stew and complain! Now if someone really did get fed up and killed Mrs. Whiting then maybe you'll have yourself something interesting to read. Then again it probably wouldn't have won a Pulitzer."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"This is the first Russo book I have read and might be the last. Actually I have not finished it yet and have been trying to do so for the last 2 1/2 months. The book is very well written and the story does indeed give a look at everyday life. I however found it rather boring. The book is not engrossing in the least...I have to really work hard to convince myself to pick it. Once I do start reading it again it is mildly entertaining, but as a mother of three small children I really need a book to draw me in or else it is not worth my time. This book did not draw me; I found the character development rather lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment of the Year","review":"The disappointment of the year. Characters and plot were not compelling, convincing or just plain interesting, especially the female characters. For example, the young pre-teen daughter who did not want to eat, or the ex-wife who just lost 50 pounds, the handicapped half-wit in love with the main character, the rich eccentric old woman...I could not for one minute believe any of them existed. Sidebar on the old woman: if I had to read one more sentence of that old bat calling the main character (he was so unremarkable I even forgot his name) \\"my dear boy\\" I think I would have gotten sick. I am surprised so many people gave it such high marks...not to mention the Pulitzer prize...? Compared to the past few years of Pulitzer prize winners this was very poor. I even think the whiney-spirited \\"Hours\\" was better than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightweight and banal","review":"When I heard that Richard Russo's \\"Empire Falls\\" won the Pulitzer Prize and was about blue-collar life, I was expecting something a lot more serious and with a harder edge. I was disappointed to discover that it's lightweight fluff. Some of the characters and situations are not to be believed. Miles Roby, the angst-ridden main character, is defined by his relationship to the various women in his life. I just didn't care about the characters or situations. This book reminded me a lot of Richard Ford's \\"Independence Day,\\" another book I didn't care for. Is this really the best fiction of the year?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I have never read a book in which each character deserves the fate that the universe has handed them.I tried...really tried to enjoy this book, but it just become insufferable after a while. The only way to improve this book is to give it to Philip Roth, and have him rewrite the story, and redact the story by about 125 pages. I'm pglad that I read it so that I can serve as a warning to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bore...","review":"Adequately written at best, no action, predictable. If I wasn't the kind of person who always finishes a book I start, this one would of found it's way to the wastebasket early on, but I kept reading in the hope that it would get better. It didn't!This was good only as a time filler on the subway."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't want it to end","review":"I enjoyed STRAIGHT MAN, Russo's previous novel, but EMPIRE FALLS just absorbed me completely. This author knows how to tell a story, and how to make you care about characters. Don't miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empire Falls","review":"drags a bit and is less relevant due to its time period. I actually had read it several years ago but the plot is not memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it...","review":"Anyone who has ever lived in a small town will appreciate this book. It's a wonderful story, really worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read Overall....3.5 to 4 stars","review":"I had a hard time getting through some parts of this book. It just felt like it was dragging at some points. After reading 300-and-something pages I took a break from it. I finally picked up again after 2 weeks and finished the book. And I have to be honest I breezed through to the end! So if you choose to read this book...you may find a lul -just set it down for a while, read something else (I did!), and come back to it. In the end it's worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his Best, but Better than most any other...","review":"Not as good, or as personal, as his novel \\"The Risk Pool\\", yet, even Russos' mid-quality work is better than almost everyone elses BEST writing. The interpersonal detail between the characters in his novels has never been equaled, in my opinion. Anyone who just recently discovered Russo, should defintely read ALL his novels. If they liked \\"Empire Falls\\" they will LOVE \\"Risk Pool\\", \\"Mohawk\\", \\"Nobodys' Fool\\". If you read Anne Tyler immediately after reading a Russo novel, you should be able to see that he writes better than the more popular and better known authors of the genre. I don't know, I could be wrong, but I doubt it.. :-) ;-) JT in NC"},{"rating":"2","title":"Russo is a brilliant writer","review":"Empire Falls gets better with each page. What a great study of human nature. The book may not be exciting for some because it is about small town life, but the writing is so clever it's well worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book in a long time","review":"This was the best book I've read in a long time. I loved the story, the characters, the humor. Actually, I really loved everything about it and I was sorry when I finished it. Athough it was a little slow, it was well worth it. I look forward to reading Russo's other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Classic","review":"A winner! This is another hit from Richard Russo. Intelligently written with humor and wit. This book may put off those who like to only like \\"beach reading\\" books and are looking for a substitute for the TV. This is a sentimental heart warming story of small town life in New England. The characters are real and there is a sense of a longing for a life that has passed by...something we all think about from time to time. Russo writes with a feeling and style that we all wish we could do."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved This Book!","review":"I actually was sad when I finished it! The characters, plot, and tone were elegeantly constructed and lively. I felt as though I were there! I can see why this book won the Pulitzer. I am now a huge fan of Richard Russo."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book","review":"On the surface the storyline is simple and compelling. It is the quality of Richard Russo's writing as it weaves subtle connections and ironies throughout the story that makes this one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read. Russo seems to have great respect for his reader, assuming intelligence and wit. In an age of high-impact cinema with special effects that spell out every turn of events in a plot; Empire Falls offers sophistication, elegance and meaning to an audience that prefers to think when they read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolutely Wonderful Novel","review":"After reading this book for the first time, it became one of my favorites. The tales for each of Russo's characters are wonderfully played out and work together to make one of the best books I've read in a while. This is an excellent book, and although it is a little lengthy, it definitely worth the read. I would absolutely recommend this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"It bored me to sleep","review":"How many times can a writer use the phrases \\"After all\\" and \\"of course\\" in a 500 page book and still win a Pulitzer? Apparently, about 500. The writing in this book is lethally dull, the characters are uninteresting and the plot limps along until the very end when it commits suicide. Puh-leeze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Burn","review":"I almost went to the last chapter in this novel. Slow all the way, mediocre characters, not much interest in any of them with the exception of the father and his jaunt with the old priest."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!!","review":"Was so relishing reading this book as I'd heard such great things about it....and it won the Pulitzer of course. What a disappointment! It's literature light, really. I found the characters annoying and utterly unlikable. I was hoping bad things would happen to them, especially Miles who was not at all sympathetic but rather annoying and shallow. Russell Banks gets small town blue collar life much better than this. It was like a made-for-tv-movie in book form. How did this win the Pulitzer??"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"having read other books by richard russo, i thought this would be great (it did win the pulitzer). big disappointment. unlike his other work, this is much more self-indulgent and wordy. i loved STRAIGHT MAN which i would recommend to anyone as one of the best books i've read by russo or any other writer. by comparison, EMPIRE FALLS was a huge letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Read","review":"EMPIRE FALLS, the latest by the author of NOBODY'S FOOL (made into the movie with Paul Newman) and STRAIGHT MAN, is a good book about the fortunes of Miles Roby, the manager of the local diner (more or less, the greasy spoon of the place) and his family, friends, and acquaintances.The book is similar in color and texture to Richard Russo's over novels with characters of blue collar origin and local pseudo-aristocracy. The plot is straightforward, the prose flows nicely and the characters are fairly believable, especially important at a time when so many authors choose to have protagonists with forced-uniqueness.This is a good novel for the beach or the back porch on a cool summer evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Characters, Characters","review":"Beautifully written, beautifully drawn characters, as easy as a glass of lemonade is to drink on a hot day, this book is to read.Delcious"},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Flat","review":"Sorry, I have to be the dissenting voice here. It is an extremely rare occurence that I give up on a book and I am dangerously close to putting Empire Falls back on my roommate's book shelf. There may be a good story somewhere in the next 300 pages, but it'd really have to be something spectacular to justify plodding through the vapid writing.Russo likes to hit the reader over the head, tell you instead of show you, and repeat the obvious three and four times. Perhaps a real character will develop by the second half of the book, but thus far I am looking at a cast of caricatures painted with broad strokes, engaged in conversations that sound nothing like natural human dialogue.I have a feeling that Empire Falls' popular acclaim is largely attributable to its willingness to tackle a difficult issue of concern to many in this country -- school violence. It will not survive as a classic, and, less importantly, it will not survive as the book I read on the subway for the rest of the week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did not want it to end","review":"This is a wonderful book for anyone who wants to simply be entertained. This is not second rate fiction. Empire Falls is quality. His style of writing is wonderfuly accessible to the casual reader and satisfying for those who enjoy a book with more complex prose. I have never experienced character development like this. I was terribly concerned for the characters and what would happen to all of them. I cannot imagine anyone who would truely dislike this book, although I am sure there are a few people, it has something for everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful!","review":"What a great novel this is. A good friend gave this to me, and I finally got around to reading it and loved all of it. All the praise is justified."},{"rating":"2","title":"New England all the way","review":"Stick with it, it begins a bit slow. Like Russo's other novels, though, Empire Falls is quite entertaining. Not as good as Straight Man, though consistently good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book was so good. I had no idea what it was about when I bought it, and once I started, I could not put it down. If you are looking for a really good book to read, then I suggest this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life in a mill town in Maine","review":"This town with its polluted river, its decaying main street and declining businesses is all too familiar to this reader. I grew up in just such a town although the high school scenes are obviously drawn from the present--even down to the horrific climax that has become too familiar in our own times. Russo does know that generation very well, as far as I can tell.Miles Roby is too much of the anti-hero, the loser, but the reader never loses sympathy for Miles even when he seems to be his own worst enemy (not counting Mrs. Whiting). At first he makes the ex-wife despicable, but Russo manages to show even her complexities.I would give it five stars, except that the author seems to muddy the religious theme, especially when John Voss is suggested as a Christ figure, who seemed to be at the center of the trouble and then mysteriously disappeared. Jesus did not decide to take violent revenge on his enemies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stock Characters = Pulitzer???","review":"You know how with some books you have to read some sentences over and over because they are so amazingly written? Or because they make you marvel at their wittiness? Or they make a philosophical or spiritual point that takes you by surprise and makes you think? Or you just delight in the originality and spare or lush beauty of the prose?This is not one of those books. If you tend to mentally edit redundancy or banality out of less-than-wonderful writing, you will find this annoying.The stock characters are one dimensional, some to the point of caricature. You can put almost every one in the Good or Bad column and leave them there. There are subcolumns for Heart of Gold, Cantankerous, Cantakerous Heart of Gold, Cartoonishly Boorish, etc. None of them evolve, although Miles, the main character, [SPOILER] discovers he has been duped, and his ex-wife's weight fluctuates. The two stars is generous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulitzer Prize?","review":"I can't figure out why this one the Pulitzer, unless it was a dry year for novels. I felt a steady, low-level of enjoyment throughout this book. I didn't find the characters compelling or the story particularly engaging. I liked the book enough to finish it but wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many words!","review":"I can't believe that I managed to finish this book. There were way too many words - I kept getting lost in the prose and waiting for something - anything - to happen. I am not sure why I persisted - I guess I kept thinking (hoping)that it would get better. The story could have been quite good - if he hadn't taken pages to say what could have been said in a couple of paragraphs. This was truly a disappointing novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...Couldn't Finish","review":"I received this book as a gift with a great recommendation. After 125 pages, I had to finally let it go. Reading it was like watching grass grow. I like plots with some action or interesting things happening, so this is not the book for me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book with no ending","review":"Empire Falls is a good book: interesting characters, plot set-up, location--until it gets to the end where nothing is resolved. Deus ex machina everything clears up in a sentence or two thanks to a completely throwaway subplot that seems to exist just to give Miles an excuse to leave town."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would make a better movie than a book","review":"I bought this book thinking I would like it because I enjoyed the movie NOBODY'S FOOL, but I was mistaken. This book would make an interesting movie but as a book it is just too slow. Nothing happens and the author only writes about the little things. Not even in the present most of the time. It gives the reader the false illusion that we are getting to know the protagonist and his past so that something extraordinary will happen--I gave up waiting for taht event half way through the book and have never been tempted to pick it up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"the empire's new clothes?","review":"Pulitzer Prize? Hogspit! This is four hundred eighty pages of sentimental drivel which no one bothered either to edit or proofread. A dozen loathsome cardboard characters. A story utterly contrived. Russo apparently has everybody fooled. Some publisher chose him to introduce the stories of Richard Yates. He should read them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empire Falls the worst book I ever read","review":"Empire Falls is the worst book I have ever read. As an avid reader I find that there are books that I don't like, however, I finish reading them. I couldn't even finish this book I was so bored. Not everyone who lives in a small town in Maine is as pathetic as the characters Russo depicts in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult read","review":"Our book club agrees... we don't see what all the raves are about. It took me so long to finally get past the first couple chapters without falling asleep. Once I did, I found it depressing and dull. I had to force myself to finish this book because of book club. There were some colorful characters that added a little excitement to the otherwise dull life of the main character, but other than that, I didn't find it remarkable.Check out The Lovely Bones if you want a great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing as hell","review":"I bought the book and forced myself to finish it because of the review. Really, if it were by my choice, I would not have read the book. It is (as you will find out, by this author) all about an abandoned American town which (if you were like me, a Hopper's fan, you would understand it) is a classic example of decline of a suburb. It is an economical as well as a cultural decline (if there was any economics or culture). I am not here to compare... We all have a choice as to what to read. For me, it is like an expired strip mall. When you drive by, you get a nostalgia feeling... inevitable, helpless and depressing. The novel is well written but the scene is like my impression, so hopeless that youth people are escaping from it. This kind of art is necessary but not entirely uplifting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Didn't Get the Point","review":"Without delving into the plotline, I just have to say that I was severly dissappointed in this novel after reading so many rave reviews. The hero is weak; the climax reveals no victory, and the ending...just ends - not making you want more, but making you wonder, \\"Why did I waste my money on this book?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Empire Fell Flat","review":"I was optimistic upon starting out, but as the book progressed (or rather dragged on) I just couldn't get into it. Although some parts were funny, I felt a lot was overdone - and certain parts were just stuck here and there for shock value. I could easily skip over a page or two of objectionable content without missing much. I finished the book out of obligation and then threw it out. I didn't feel I could recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Empire Falls","review":"I loved it! A real page turner about life in a mill town.

It was such a let down that subtle insights about the characters' lives and about life in general were lost completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The book was well written, but the storyline never picked up.

(I don't know why people do that!?) As for it being, according to some readers, slack-paced, and, according to other readers, too fast-paced, it is both slack-paced and fast-paced at exactly the right times. Tension builds slowly into a wildly active climax. This is a very classical way to build a plot. Shakespeare used it, not to mention every great storyteller. It is the shape of myth. It's what I want out of a long novel. As the story gets longer, the effects of earlier actions and decisions accrue at an increasing speed, and people do get their poetic justice. . .which might not always happen in life but I love it when it happens in stories. I couldn't put it down. It's beautifully funny, and serious, and poignant.The main characters is very sympathetic, but every single minor character is complex and memorable as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"the \\"book \\"is not very good, it is jealous and vindictive","review":"the author is clearly beyond envious of a scene that she can only enter as a server/worker. if she lusts after men who ignore her and hates women she envies, then why slave in these fancy restaurants and suffer, so embarrassing ? she thinks its witty, but she actually writes with such low self esteem, self-loathing in fact, attacking celebs but trying to link herseslf with them, attacking socials and fellow asians, yet wanting to BECOME one of them. there is so much the author can't admit here. its not honest. the book also betrays the very employers who paid her by exposing \\"rude\\" behavior of co-workers and clientele -- yet jealous abbe diaz, the \\"author\\", insists upon name-dropping these employers on her website as bait for her \\"book.\\" plus there is no structure or plot. so sad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"Every song on this album is fabulous.

However, the plotting holds up, the characterization is exceptionally good, and the writing is spot on. In this first book of the series, one can tell that it took McClure little time to master his craft and illuminate his country for a wide audience.Like all good detective stories, what makes this a great read in the inter-play between Kramer and Zondi.

But the basic plot is rather weak, and were it not for the blatant intercession of a very active author-deity, the good guys would have lost this one.I'm told that back in the days of the movie western serials, Hopalong Cassidy was once trapped in a box canyon, no way out, and hopelessly outnumbered by the approaching bad guys. Then the writers realized that they had written themselves into a corner, so when we \\"tuned in next week\\", the story began with \\"After Hoppy got out of the box canyon...\\" This story reminded me of that anecdote, notably in the segue from chapter six to chapter seven.Sloppy."},{"rating":"2","title":"CSTR = Masterpiece","review":"I have listened to Can't Stand the Rezillos for years now.

The March 14 review titled \\"not for the weak or shaky\\" found under the same juicer but in the color white is correct. I would add that among other bad features, the paint is being slowly ground off the hinge and this paint dust may get in your juice. This is the second juicer I have owned and I still own an electric made by Krups. The Ojex juicer leaves unsqueezed pulp behind that does not happen with the electric. Also, the peel is squeezed along with the pulp so your juice gets the bitter orange oil in it. This is not an issue with the electric. This juicer opens up just barely far enough to accept half an orange. I tried to get a half a grapefruit in there but it wasn't easy. All these bad features aside, I still use it and find it slightly more convenient than the electric.

After having read \\"When Genius Failed\\" by Roger Lowenstein, I looked forward to reading Dunbar's book, which I thought would be another informative take on the fiasco. Even in the beginning pages, Dunbar jumped around soooo much, from country to country, from financial discovery to mathematical equasions, from era to era AND from subject to subject that is was just TOO DISTRACTING to be enjoyable. Maybe Wall Street traders or mathematicians would be drawn in by this drivel but I don't think the average reader would be. The biggest disappointment was that Dunbar failed to make even these complex, intense traders interesting! \\"When Genius Failed\\" is a far better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, duller, dullest...","review":"...and slow, slower, slowest. This book tries -- but fails. Other reviewers have given it credit for explaining some of the complex math involved in hedging and trading but it fumbles this task. The explanations are too complex (and written in turgid prose) for the novice and grossly oversimplified (still written in turgid prose) for anyone with even a smattering of knowledge in this area. Insight into the principals of LTCM is non-existent; the author has no access to them. The prose style is consistently whatever the opposite of scintillating is. And the pace is leaden...far too much back story. This is a 224-page book (not counting the Afterword, notes and index). LTCM isn't even formed until more than halfway through (p. 125) and doesn't go bust (the most interesting part of the story; who would read a book about LTCM if it hadn't done so?) until p. 175. A waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"cannot finish reading this book","review":"This is one of the rare book in my recent reading history that I just can't seem to finish reading.

Perhaps if the author focus on fewer characters, it would help. (By the way, I really like The Smartest Guys in the Room--the Enron book)The book appears to be a hotchpotch of trade ideas. I suspect that the author is not very well versed in finance. I find the presentatinon of some standard finance theory awkward.

This work has a deserved reputation for being careful and thorough. However, it was written before the rise of literary critical approaches, and it can come off now as a bit dry and unsatisfying.

Anyone with a modicum of baseball knowledge knows the Sox had a 2-0 lead at that point and Dent's homer put the Yanks ahead.

Of those latter songs, I was particularly glad to get \\"This Masquerade.\\" If you've never heard Reddy, she is a singer from Australia who has a wonderful voice and style, which to me is reminiscent of Tin Pan Alley singers from earlier decades. She was at her most popular in the 1970s, and every song on this CD is from the 70s. Sound quality is very good. At 14 songs this is only fairly generous, and the earlier version of \\"I Am Woman\\" is interesting but largely pointless having on here since it's markedly inferior to the later version that was the hit, and which is also on here. A more generous collection that also includes the big hit singles, but has 8 more songs than this one, although both are supposed to be remastered, is the more recent compilationThe Woman I Am: The Definitive Collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"So, how can Judaism make me a better person?\\"","review":"If you've asked that question, peruse this book and discover for yourself whether the morals and ethics of Judaism appeal to you.

It reveals the parts of his life leading the reader to understand the why's and wherefore's of his poems. I was first seriously introduced to Frost in college when doing a paper centering on three of his most popular works: \\"Mending Wall\\", \\"Two Tramps in Mudtime\\", and \\"After Apple Picking\\". The only \\"criticism\\" that I might have of Mr. Parini's book is that it goes into more detail of the poems which intrudes upon the smooth flow of the actual telling of Frost's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A balanced view of a teacher, poet, friend, and family man.","review":"Jay Parini's well-written and well-organized life of Robert Frost weaves together beautifully the many contradictory Frosts: the spiteful yet respectful colleague, the insensitive yet devoted husband, the domineering yet supportive father, the bullying yet challenging teacher. What we have as a result is a definitive picture of one of our country's greatest poets as a three-dimensional human being, a man of great passions and great talent. As if that weren't good enough, Parini does a magnificent job of showing how many of Frost's best poems fit into periods of his life, how they often reflect his successes and failures, his dreams and his fears. In brief, this is a superlative biography, a must read for anyone curious about the life of this powerful and important poet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A poet's perspective.","review":"Jay Parini bring's a poet's perspective to this excellent biography. By combining a compelling look at Frost's life with an informed commentary on his poetry, Parini has avoided the common pitfall of many biographers; forgetting the work while describing the life.

Recognizing that it is so little known and already, bizarrely, out of print, it is also one of the strangest musical curiosities I'm aware of. Every aspect of this CD, from the songwriting, to musicianship, on through to production quality, are at the highest level of artistic craftsmanship, so I feel very fortunate to have happened upon such a well-kept secret as Bonneville. Without doubt, somewhere along the line this CD will be 'rediscovered' by getting the (mass) media attention it needs (and deserves) for it to be properly marketed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of cheese, but there are a few highlights","review":"Most of the songs here use a sort of easy-listening production style you might hear on an Andy Williams album from the 60s. However, there are a few tracks that have a more stipped-down, bonafide folk feel to them: Black Velvet Band, Whisky in the Jar, Goodbye Mick, and Rosin the Bow. Star of County Down, Dear Old Donegal, and Rose of Trallee are also fairly inoffensive.

Play doh aliens come to town on a Simon Says alien space ship and try to create a perfect human/vacuum cleaner species. The plan inevitably fails with a homeless guy falling in love with the vacuum, the vacuum murdering and raping men and women until it discovers its gay, people getting charged with murder, and ultimately a very unhappy ending, I won't ruin it for you.

This album has a very rich mystical feel to it which carries you along into a slightly dark yet also somehow comforting dimension of melded tribal rythms, mysterious vocal samples, and otherworldly sounds that weave, float and loop through your mind. This album is a must with headphones.A track of note for me is Spanish Fly (Flemenco Dub Pt.1) ((where is part 2? hehe a future album perhaps?)) , which nicely blends some latin strings and vocals into an otherwise rich ambient tribal dub.Every track on the album is good and they all fit nicely together in this collection.

This narrator uses tired cliches, follows a sexist and racist ideology, fails to look at the larger historical, societal, and economic factors that lead to contemporary issues of prostitution in Russia, and tries to take credit for \\"thinking up\\" the reclaiming of language that ethnic and women's studies scholars have been asserting for decades.

It suggests drugs such as Oxygen Elements Plus and OxCgen will increase the your blood oxygen and then cure you.If one does research they'll see raising the O2 levels in one's blood does have an effect on certain types of cells (it ages them), but there's no clinical proof it does anything to cancer.

Although this book isn't nearly as exercise heavy as \\"Tarot for your self\\", I still feel it merits five stars.

Their assemblage here, with the addition of two extra tracks, represents a quantum leap for Bright Eyes as a band, and perhaps the most coherent song cycle they've released yet. To be sure, the lyrics and voice of Nebraskan wunderkind Connor Oberst dominate the scene, but the tasteful inclusion of flute, horns, back-up vocals, and electronics lend this record the feel of a true \\"band\\" recording. The formula hasn't changed a great deal from last year's FEVERS AND MIRRORS, but Oberst and company meld better than ever, and the lyrics and vocals seem to be growing in leaps and bounds with each new song they record.

Sure, they had the look down, but like most of the pathetic offspring of the first wave of punk, the Dead Boys had little to back up their phlegm and bondage pants. \\"Sonic Reducer\\" is the pinnacle of this band's career, so if that doesn't do it for you, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Ruined Punk Forever!","review":"Way before those half assed posers in England got wind of what was going on, the North East of the USA cranked out some amazing real punk music. Mostly from NYC, Boston, & Cleveland (yes Cleveland!) Music that was innovative, challenging, thought provoking, way ahead of it's time. Bands like The Modern Lovers, Pere Ubu, Television, Richard Hell & the Voidoids, Talking Heads, Patti Smith, & Devo. Then the Dead Boys came on the scene only to dumb everything down. Suddenly punk meant being obnoxious mean and spiteful. Punk shows before them were all about dancing and pogoing, really expressing your self. Then the Dead Boys got everybody to slam dance and stage dive. Sure I know you probably think thats cool but a lot of people get hurt that way. And their lyrics are so misogynistic, I can't believe anybody can actually listen to them.

My kids did the running back and forth warming them up and they complained they smelled bad. I suppose every microwave is different so that could be why the 60 seocnds recommended for heating up wasn't really adequate. We did them together standing up on their sides curled around so that there was air movement all around. And it was usually acummulated time of 2.5 to 3 minutes to get them good and hot.I have not used them as a cold pack. Cold is not helpful for my nerve injuries in my arms.

He was probably the best songwriter the '70s era. This is one of the best, if not the best, punk albums of its time."},{"rating":"2","title":"essential 70s punk rock","review":"Richard Hell and the Voidoids produced a sound which was uniquely punk and yet unlike anything else around at the time. In a sense, they sounded like they looked; the album cover photos show them as having been pioneers of a punk visual style - a kind of torn apart look. Hell's vocals consisted of a nasely sneer; his singing range is limited, yet it is somehow appropriate to his skronky yet poppish, detachedly nihilistic tunes. The sound of the Voidoid was the sound of simple Ramones-like rhythms (though slower), Hell's yelping vocals, and dual lead guitars producing a wide variety of sometimes tuneful, sometimes atonal, noises. The overall result is somehow catchier than it ought to be. Blank Generation's title song, something of a punk anthem, is one of the standout tracks. Love Comes in Spurts, Who Says (it's Good to be Alive), Down at the Club, and New Pleasure are also among the great tunes on an important and still cool sounding record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind Of Wimpy","review":"I will admit, I bought this mainly to hear the guitar work of the great,late Robert Quine.Other than Quines usual fine guitar work, this struck me as pretty mediocre stuff.

I bought \\"Blank Generation\\" at the same time as Ted Nugent's \\"Cat Scratch Fever\\" and wore them both out. It was the age of the anti-hero & I always thought Richard Hell was the first to put the moniker on our generation by calling it 'blank'. (It's my contention that the symbol 'x' was used to represent 'blank', but sometime in the 80s someone interpreted 'x\\" literally and thus Generation X was coined instead. ) Well, it only counts that we had Richard Hell, as for the rest, we can take it or leave it each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressing sometimes","review":"I can't believe there are this many reviews of this album! It has really become an underground classic. The lyrics are observations on the hopelessness of life, for the most part. The music is a little loose and jangley. The singing is mildly unpleasant. It's not the powerful thud of the Sex Pistols. Or Ramones. Also not the bone crunching sound of the MC5. It's more subdued than any of that, although Hell's singing reminds you of Johnny Rotten a little, and the Stooges are certainly an influence. You hear a little jazz influence, maybe even a little country (on \\"Betrayal takes Two\\"), and there's a remake of an obscure CCR tune, \\"Walking on the Water\\". This keeps you coming back (at least occasionally), for some reason-not unlike \\"Teenage jesus and the Jerks\\", and the first Vanilla Fudge album (none of these sound much alike, but they all have that same vibe). Nothing occult here, just a very dim outlook on life."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love you, Richard!","review":"I know so many people who hate Richard Hell, and what can I say? I admit it: I must be behind the times, or I must not take myself seriously enough, 'cause I fell in love with the guy's music when I heard \\"Love Comes in Spurts\\" for the first time, waaaaaaay back in 1994! Yeah, he sounds pathetic, crazy, and wierd; but that's part of R.H's charm for me. I even love \\"Another World.\\" It's so wonderfully kooky! Give me Richard, and his off-key wailing, any day over some gloomy, mumbling long-haired guy in flannel... or some portentous dude in black who's too afraid to make himself look \\"uncool.\\" All I can say is, I love you, Richard!

This album has the wild and eclectic mixture of styles and tempos that quickly got lost post the early history of punk.

Easily one of the greatest albums I've ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Richard Hell & The Voidoids - 'Blank Generation' (Sire) 2 1/2","review":"Originally released in 1977, as this was Richard Hell's first lp. Reason I'm giving this CD reissue a 2 1/2 star rating is because I personally know old school fans of New York punk that may get more out of it that I did. Tunes here that kept this disc in my player ALL the way through were \\"Love Comes In Spurts\\", \\"Betrayal Takes Two\\", their John Fogerty cover \\"Walking On The Water\\" and the title cut \\"Blank Generation\\", Obviously, this disc didn't do much for me. Line-up: Richard Hell - bass & vocals, Robert Quine (R.I.P.) & Ian Julian - guitar & backing vocals and Mark Bell (aka Marky Ramone) - drums.

No such limitation listed in the product specs, and nothing useful on the Creative site.I'm swapping this out for a Siig DP 4 Soundwave. The site formally states there is support for 2003 and 2008.

In fact if you spend enough time on Creatives website and on other forums you'll find that many of their products don't work well with VISTA. The biggest issue I had was that it lacked a very basic feature: Microphone Boost. Without such a feature you cannot use your mic for online gaming. Simply maxing the mic outbound volume isn't enough...the 10 or 20 db boost is required for talking volumes to be registered.

Not sure exactly how it happened. I do plug and unplug connectors into the jacks a lot so I guess the plastic insulation wasn't strong enough for that. On closer inspection, the plastic does seem to be the hard, brittle kind. I think a softer plastic is needed here. Anyway, the card is now unusable. I can make a connection, but I get a lot of noise and feedback without insulation around the plug. All of this happened after only 4.5 months of use. No idea if the manufacturer will replace it. Aside from this one problem, it was a perfectly acceptable sound card."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic sound card","review":"Popped the card and the disc into the system, let the OS do the install, and boom, I had audio. I'm only using the basic stereo output with the supplied drivers & basic applications like Media Player, so I can't comment on the capabilities of the card or the Creative applications beyond that. On a side note, I needed this for a system that I know to be electrically noisy, and this card does not seem to be particularly susceptible to it, with little of the noise leaking into the audio. If what you want is a bssic card with a no-hassle install, you should be happy with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME !!!

I use my front jacks heavily so it was a turn down.I Couldn't get it to work fully in Debian Linux, after a month of researching (and reinstalling) I got bored and stop trying. ALSA will give you 2 channel output no matter what you do, some hacks can route the sound to all your speakers, but will only work with *some* applications, other applications like totem and flash player would hang. And don't even think of watching a movie in 5.1, because it will NOT work.Pulseaudio would hang randomly with this card.

Too bad no one has released a truly complete cd set featuring all the great r & b songs he did for Scepter. This cd features a good number of his best, but omits plenty of good tunes....like his version of Spinning Wheel, which cuts out the excess that Blood, Sweat and Tears implemented in their version....others like \\"Ain't No Soul Left in These Old Shoes\\", \\"Old Man at the Fair\\", \\"Win My Love and Break My Heart\\", \\"I Saw Pity in the Face of a Friend\\", \\"I Can't Stop Crying\\" (one of his very best!), and \\"Another Branch From the Old Tree\\" could all be included if they would reissue all the songs in a 2-cd collection.

Despite having one less song, this CD actually runs a bit longer than the other one, because on It's Alive some of the breaks between songs were cut down, most notably the breaks between the three encores. Joey's stage patter is, of course, different at the two shows. Other than that, there are no real differences between the concerts.

Our vet stopped carrying them (because of issues with the distributor, not the product), so I was pleased to find them here. Not only are they a low-cal, low-fat treat for the dogs, but if you have a dog that needs to take pill-form medication with any frequency, Lean Treats are soft enough for a pill to be pushed into. Works great. There's a product called Pill Pockets that work well too, but they are ridiculously priced and likely not as healthy as Lean Treats...."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Dogs go CRAZY for this little purple bag","review":"As soon as my dogs see this little bag of goodness - they go crazy!!!!

BTW that steel catch is now bent on all tapes. I don't know what material it is but it is WEAK!!

Few movies I have seen are as visually impresive and verbally moving as \\"The Devil and Daniel Webster.\\" Walter Huston's representation of the Devil is definitive. He's charming and sly to the naked eye, but pure evil at heart. I think the real Devil would have applauded. Edward Arnold is equally impresive as Daniel Webster. The Faust legend always makes for a good story, and this is the best use i've ever sen the legend put to. This movie is a pleasure.P.S. Warning: The end will give you goosebumps."},{"rating":"1","title":"YET ANOTHER DISAPPOINTING TRANSFER FROM CRITERION","review":"With the DEVIL & DANIEL WEBSTER, we have yet another example of a shoddy Criterion transfer. The problem here is not the picture, but the sound. Admittedly the picture could be improved - especially the bothersome vertical white line coursing through much of the film. The sound, though, is appalling: a constant and annoying hiss makes it almost impossible to appreciate the astonishing acting and lighting and, obviously, the score.How long can Criterion coast on its heretofore deserved reputation as a distributor of classic films on DVD? With this and other recent fiascos, one can only assume not long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daniel Webster runs Devil out on a rail!","review":"If you are ever tempted to sell your soul to the devil, best watch this movie first. Devil, he don't play fair--never has, never will. If you still insist on selling though, better locate a Daniel Webster first, just in case. Pay careful attention to the selection of the jury when your case comes up. Very enjoyable movie but it leaves you thinking, what if?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see movie","review":"I just happened to catch this movie on a classics channel, and never having seen it before, was delighted to have stumbled upon it. I came to Amazon to buy a copy to own (I was going to get several to give away, but for the price!) The acting and cinematography were top notch, the story engrossing. I found the movie to be a wonderful trip to the past--an escape from today's modern and too-fast world. We watched with our pre-teen and early teen girls, and they enjoyed it too. A great movie to watch over and over, much like A Wonderful Life and The Wizard of Oz. This is a review of the movie only, not the DVD version; regardless of the quality, it is one to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old New England Wisdom stirs the spirits.","review":"Ah!

But this isn't the same Oakenfold sound as on his Cream Resident cd, or his Global Underground NY cd, and certainly not like his essential mixes. The first three tracks are terrible, though after that it's not as bad, though compared to some of Oakie's stuff, this is trash. The few songs that aren't completely horrible are what stopped me from giving this a 1.

It starts off with \\"Bad Days,\\" a carnival romp reminiscent of Wild Honey era Brian Wilson, and from there, gradually disintegrates into the kind of fun-filled, chaotic madness we've come to expect from Coyne Country (or Category). This includes the blissful guitar and fuzzed bass on \\"Ice Drummer;\\" plus \\"Waterbug,\\" a \\"true story\\" about Wayne's brother and a grocery store arrest; and a rambling cover of a Bill Callahan/Smog song, \\"Chosen One.\\" There's a fair amount of Wayne talking on this EP, introducing the songs live or in the studio, which is mildly entertaining. In all, this EP marked a fairly low-key but still enjoyable point on the Flaming Lips' journey through this strange world."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd got it, now it's gone, I wanna it back","review":"what I have had is a box set of movie hits which is different from the set introduced here ( \\"Today's movie hits\\"/performed by the countdown singers, Rel.1995), 2/3 of my set are in this set, some of them are familiar for people all of the world, some are ordinary.

Music is in your blood. I saw her in concert for DirectTV, and she likes variety. I loved the comment to the audience \\"well we've done country, bluegrass, jazz... I guess it's time to ROCK!\\". Her band is excellent. She covers Heart and Zeppelin with style. I enjoy both of her CD's too. I guarantee I'm gonna pay to see this artist live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here for the party again","review":"Here for the Party was great but this album seems like it was rushed to capitalize on Gretchen's success. However, it still has some good tunes like \\"Politically Uncorrect\\", the title track, and the surprisingly good remake of the jazz standard, \\"Good Morning Heartache\\". I read many reviews criticizing Gretch on not being a good role model. Well, if you're looking for a role model, you shouldn't be listening to country music!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gretchen does it again!","review":"Gretchen's second album is as good as the first. I was skeptical that she could pull off another great all around album. I enjoyed all the songs and if you are a true country fan you will enjoy it. She pays homage to the traditional country which is very absent in today's country singers. The bonus track is also a nice treat. I was a little surprised that it was not a country song but it shows that she has great range as a singer. It's nice to know that we still have a couple of really talented country singers left."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of this Disc","review":"Just a note the \\"Dual Disc\\" is something to beware of.

Something for everyone's taste in music and a return to good old 'grass roots' country to boot. Great work, Gretchen! Keep 'em coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER IN MY LIFE!","review":"Never in my life have I heard or seen such degradation. I thought the bubblegum country was bad but this is much, much worse! The poison inflicted by this type of \\"noise\\" robs the heart of its integrity. I can understand Wilson having a hard life but is it really worth having success if you have to demoralize yourself and the rest of the country too by abasing yourself to such levels?? The first record was bad enough but this one is thoroughly horrific! I would have much more respect for Wilson if she had had the integrity to say to these producers \\"I won't be a part of such vermin\\". But, I guess when a carrot is being dangled in front of you and they offer you the world, its hard to resist. This CD hits rock bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"How long can we be the poor girl??","review":"this cd is so white trash and gross that it makes me sick that gretchen Wilson is so popular .. in the beginning she looked like she could last and be a staple and bring back classic country but now she has just gotten even more white trash and she is the farthest thing now from a poor girl as they come i wonder if she has a trailer she writes in on her land with her 2 million dollar home yeah that sounds ruff.. from the moment i listened to this cd i threw it away buy song 4 she failed with this cd big time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who cares about the music????","review":"I really don't care about the music here!!!!

Hell.....I just like looking at her!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"God this is AWFUL!","review":"Her last album had \\"Redneck Woman.\\" This one has....well NOTHING! She is going to go down in history with all the other one hit wonders. She clearly needs to go to school and get an education. The song about being one Bud Wiser, a play on the name of the beer, is one of the lamest and desperate plays on words ever to appear in a song. It's also an insult to anyone who's lost someone to drinking and driving. It's like she's glorifying drinking. It's very irresponsible. But then again, she includes a song about Skoal...a substance which causes mouth cancer. I know her fans are mostly uneducated rednecks, but they still deserve better than this!AND...The song \\"He Ain't Even Cold Yet:\\" is one of the poorest excuses of a song in history. It's apparently about a woman who goes out partying before they even bury her husband's dead body. What trailer park did Gretchen Wilson crawl out of?This cd is also on Sony....so beware. They install spyware on computers. DON'T TRUST THEM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHATEVER POSSESSED ME TO BUY THIS I DON'T KNOW","review":"Curiousity maybe. But one listen was enough for me.

I DON'T THINK SO!!!!!!!!!Comparing her to Hank is an insult to Hank. At least Hank has some singing talent. Gretchen will be gone in about 2 years.

Where's Hank,George & Merle when you need them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy","review":"Trashy woman, trashy music. Nothing original here folks...Ranting about materialistic women seems to be her theme. Igot to admit, I don't like materialistic women, but thatdoesn't mean I'm going to be attracted to her proud whitetrash self.The worst part is that on her second album she's alreadyre-writing the same song (Redneck Woman/California Girls)so that doesn't bode well for the future for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WANT CLASS IN COUNTRY MUSIC, NOT TRASH","review":"A friend had this CD and I borrowed it out of curiousity. I couldn't believe people would buy this. I want a good role model to look up to. Gretchen Wilson is not a good role model for anyone aspiring to a good, moral life. Heaven help the future if we have role models like Gretchen Wilson around. This CD and its music (lyrics and music) is thisclose to being X rated!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Copy Protection","review":"It's great to see that Amazon is warning us of copy protected CD's.

Better luck on her next one - I hope!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected More, Will Wait for Number III","review":"I eagerly awaited this sophmore release from Gretchen, but in the end, I'm afraid it turned into \\"Here for the Party: Part II\\" While it was Redneck Woman and Here for the Party that broke Gretchen out into the open - she's taken something that was fresh and fun and not delved any deeper. With each release there should be some degree of growth in an artist, and this one just doesn't show it. I had difficulty in sitting through the entire album, and now it lies mostly forgotten in my iTunes library. This is coming from someone who has completely worn out her disc with Gretchen Wilson's debut...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprise ending.","review":"I was in a bad mood today, the kind you get when you see the lonely silver rain pouring down outside your window, until.....I decided to listen to this cd.Unlike many fans I was not that thrilled with \\"All Jacked Up\\".So why the five stars you ask? The bonus song at the end blew me away, totally unexpected! I know, I know, we have heard her perform it on her CMTV special but until I put my headphones on and listened to her voice it is just not the same.It brightened my day. Thank you Gretchen"},{"rating":"1","title":"The ugly truth about copy-protected CDs","review":"I was devastated when I found out that this CD has copy-protection software. I love Wilson and eagerly anticipated this CD, but now that the ass-clowns at the record label have made this CD copy-protected, it's worthless to me. Memo to the music industry: make your CDs compatible with iTunes! Otherwise, expect CD sales to continue to suffer. Avoid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adds a soul to Country","review":"Gretchen Wilson has an old soul and you hear it in her music. She has a powerful voice that's full of emotion. She draws you in and makes you want to pay attention! Gretchen is fun and light, as well as, deep and reflective. This is a great combination. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great follow up!","review":"Ignore the nay-sayers who just dislike her (and probably country as well)... why would they give her a good review anyways?This is a great follow up album with plenty of solid tracks. Her voice sounds even more powerful than on Here for the Party. Politically Uncorrect is a great tribute to what built this country and makes it so great, Skoal Ring and California Girls continue the Gretchen music home cookin that is down to earth and real. The title track really jams and is a great follow up to Redneck Woman. There are also some excellent ballads. A very well varied album with something to appeal to almost every country fan. Highly recommended if you liked her last album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love her! Hate the CD!","review":"After the hits Redneck Woman, Here For The Party and the new single All Jacked Up. I was All Jacked Up for this new cd. I put it in and I was Jacked, and then I loved the lyrics and the song to California Girls. But after that, its all garbage. All slow twangy crap. The only song worth a damn after that is the bonus track from Target. Overall. A VERY BIG disappointment and I can see why it won't do well as the first. Sorry Gretch. Better Luck next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophmore Jinx Strikes Again.......","review":"I loved Gretchen's first CD \\"Here For The Party\\".

I appreciate a quality product plus a job well done. Dr. Frank Condie Baxter is the perfect showman for these movies, and Eddie Albert and Richard Carlson added to the production as well. Did I mention the voice of Lionel Barrymore? It doesn't get any better than that. My favorite of the two was the Strange Case of the Cosmic Rays.

The ensuing reaction between the human and animated characters deserves an Academy Award. What's even more amazing is the truth behind this revelation.

To me, they sound like any random hard rock band. I have heard dozens of bands like this play the LA strip, most thankfully have faded from memory.

Still, these perform as advertised and will clean between your teeth and give your gums a dose of anti-microbial tea tree oil.

That and gum can't pick stuff out of your teeth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very high quality. Cavity protection? Cold protection? Mouth sore protection?","review":"I'm not a person who smokes however these are very high quality chew sticks. Made of birch they don't shred as easy for the avid chewer. Regular toothpicks are no longer the same to me because these def. raise the standard. I want to note that the taste of these picks is pretty strong especially for the non-smoker (like me) but I like these all the same.Note that I'm cavity prone! However after chewing and picking my teeth with these 3 times a day, 2 weeks before i went to the dentist...my dentist informed me that I had the cleanest mouth he had ever seen. And no cavities.Note that I have been Cold free for about 2 and a half years.Note that I gave one of these to my friends at work who had a mouthsore and he claims it numbed the pain away.I can't recommend these to younger people as toothpicks are somewhat dangerous, but everyone else should give these a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once were my favorite","review":"I have been chewing these for years. I was highly disappointed to discover that they are now making them noticeably thinner as of this year (2012), apparently to save money without raising the cost.

I realize this is a trend in our econmy, to give less for the same price, but I would certainly rather pay more for the quality I am accustomed to."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are toothpicks...","review":"So these are regular old toothpicks that have been soaked in tea tree oil and a bit of Cinnamon Oil (those are the only two I can taste); also according to the package- canola oil, peppermint oil, spearmint oil, and fennel oil. I guess I expected them to be larger or otherwise different because the are called \\"chewing sticks\\". I expected wrongly.In my experience, these do not appear to splinter any less than \\"normal\\" toothpicks. I picked up a normal toothpick at a restaurant today (shaped just like these with one pointed end and one flat w/ embellishments) and it was of the same durability, just without the various oils taste.I am not going to throw these away, but now I wished I would have bought plastic toothpicks for durability's sake or bought just normal toothpicks for the cost savings. I do like the little plastic pack they come in; that is handy.Purpose of purchase was to give me something else to gnaw on besides my own fingers/fingernails."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like these things!","review":"For me, smoking isn't about the addiction to nicotine or other addictive concotions in cigarettes. It's about the physical. These help me with having something physical for my mouth and hands in place of a cigarette. When I'm on the computer, I'm notorious for smoking, moreso than any other place. Also, it's great to have in the car. I no longer smoke in the car!I also enjoy the taste of these. It helps keep my mouth tasting nice and fresh. I've also tried the cinnamon, which is a real blast of taste. I nibble at those very cautiously.The cost is great, too. The price of these 100 sticks equals one pack of cigarettes, and I don't use ten sticks/day. I will definitely be ordering more.Also, it states clearly in the product description that these are toothpicks."},{"rating":"1","title":"High quality tooth picks, but overpowering flavor","review":"These tooth picks are definitely high quality and can take some major punishment. I've been chewing one for over an hour now and it's still sturdy, but the flavor is terrible in my opinion. It's very strong and it feels like the equivalent of pouring tea tree oil into my mouth. I regret not getting the cinnamon flavor. I got these because I figured the tea tree oil might be better for my teeth and gums, which might not even be true. So unless you really like the taste of tea tree oil already there's a good chance you won't like the taste. I'm hoping maybe after a while I'll just get used to it and maybe even enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"They are toothpicks flavored (heavily) with minty fresh tea tree oil, they last for hours unless actively \\"chewed\\". Everyone at work asks me for them. My only complaints are they are a little pricey to buy online, possibly cheaper at the store, and the lid does not snap securely shut. Oh yeah, don't rub your eyes after handling these.

The rest of the movie is a bust.I like slow contemplative movies, but only when there is substance in the film to contemplate. The whole premise for this movie fails the suspension of disbelief test.I would have enjoyed watching Ghost in the Shell for the umpteenth time more than I got out of seeing Sky Watchers once. I suppose it is worth a Netflix rental just to see the dogfights. You can safely skip everything else.Also, there's a discontinuity that I found odd, some may find jarring. There is a tremendous amount of realistic texture and detail in the backgrounds, the furniture, the airplanes, the clouds, etc., which I assume is a triumph of computer aided animation technique. The human characters appear as if they are traditional cheap hand-drawn animation cells -- with minimal detail and texture in the skin, clothing, etc. This is a flaw -- if you're going to go for hyper-realism in animation, then go all the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid!","review":"This movie was absolutely terrible.

That film, along with Cowboy Bebop, was what got me into anime.So imagine my disappointment with Oshii's Sky Crawlers. I wasn't expecting a movie all about air combat, as implied by the title and the excellent opening shootout, but I was expecting something that would hold my attention like a pair of meathooks. What followed was an interesting, but slow-paced and ultimately boring film with a fairly predictable conclusion. If it could be called that.Oshii's Ghost in the Shell was an intelligent balance of style and substance, action and thought-provoking dialogue. It was one of those movies that stayed with you, gave you something to think about.The Sky Crawlers attempts to create this same feeling, but I don't feel like it quite made the cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly one of the worse anime I've ever seen!","review":"This is no Miyazaki, this is not nausicaa, this is not even close to a \\"D\\" rated movie. The animation is good, but the story is, well, just not there. The story is not well developed and it drags and drags and drags to complete boredom. By the time the movie ends all you'll want is a refund of your time. Not worth watching, much less buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This movie should/could have been great if it had more action. There is maybe a total of 10 minutes of real action. The rest of the time is used for a convoluted story full of characters I never found any reason to care about. This particular style of hand-drawn animation does not blend well with the CG animation. Overall, a very disappointing offering from acclaimed director Mamoru Oshii."},{"rating":"2","title":"ACTION JUNKIES BEWARE!!!","review":"I thought this film was excellent. Highly intrinsic and slightly atypical of the usual Oshii films in a manner that I still can't put my finger on.If you're just looking for a lot of slam and bang and rock \`em sock \`em \\"activity\\", then you'll need to give this film a very VERY wide berth. If, however, your interests lie in cinematic storytelling with true story value and meaningful concept and story elements which unfold with deliberate and life-like tempo, then here is a film that you will likely enjoy.Oshii is not a nuts and bolts, every man kind of director like, let's say, James Cameron. His films require an evolved sensibility in order to be fully appreciated. He is not perfect and neither are his films but, technically speaking, he does reside in the pantheon of great anime directors, even if he's not necessarily a fixture there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"had a few good scenes but in general was disappointing, i had expected more based on the trailers i had seen before about this movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot Crawlers","review":"Sky Crawlers has some interesting Dog Fights and imagery, but little else interesting.Chris"},{"rating":"1","title":"More like Cancer Crawlers","review":"There is really not much to say except that this a drawn out cartoon with extremely lackluster animation. The look, story, and pacing are slow and sloppy. There is 5 to 8 minutes of passable entertainment while the rest is sadly filler. This is time I cannot get back in my life. There is a huge emphasis on smoking cigarettes which comes off as \\"Why\\"? Why is that all of the technical features such as aircraft, vehicles, and military installations all look sophisticated and top notch and then all of the characters look really crappy? It looks like lazy drawing. I think it is safe to say that these anime films are for populations that are starved for any type of entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Boring..","review":"Oshii, he specialized in slow movies and obsessive on his passion for the dogs. The movie is a circle without an ending and does not develop. The character is very traumatic and the only way to survivor is fight against peace, a peace that will never come. A rival plane who's impossible to destroy and at the end he will destroy any one who come across his way. The movie did not really impress me; this is \\"Oshii styled\\", slow and boring. This movie is nothing like Ghost in the Shell's. The plot does not save the movie at all! I also don't like the design of the characters. I prefer the characters design from the Ghost in the Shell and Jin Roh, Hiroyuki Okiura."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sky Crawlers","review":"I was so dissapointed in this dull, veeeeery slow moving movie.

The song is great and I think the music is part of the movie, so it is a big deal for me :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent and Emotionally Involving","review":"An astonishing film, visually beautiful and deeply moving. However, it won't be for everyone, especially those who want to sit back and be entertained in an effortless way. Oshii isn't a filmmaker who caters to that kind of audience. I have admired his other films, especially Jin Roh, which for my money is one of the greatest animated films ever, and a great film in its own right (animation aside). If you've seen Jin Roh and liked it, you will probably find The Sky Crawlers worth your time. I was surprised at how much I came to care about certain characters and how emotionally involving the film became. It was also thought-provoking, posing questions about the role of warfare in human society; and had its exciting moments during aerial combat sequences.Be sure to watch through to the end of the credits, as there is a tiny epilogue of sorts at the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gorgeous anime","review":"The Sky Crawlers moves a little slow at first, but as the story develops it becomes quite engaging. The aerial combat scenes are breathtaking and just beautifully done. Somehow the makers achieved the perfect balance between CG and Hand drawn styles.The story follows the adventures of a group of young pilots on an airbase in the near future as they take part in a war fought by ageless bio-engineered clones. It shows their struggles and small victories, as well as their instinctive feeling that something about the world around them just isn't right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange and Sad but very very good.","review":"Sky Crawlers is wonderfully drawn, and engaging in it's action sequences; but it is something more. The Main Characters are Kildren; Genetically engineered \\"Children\\" who cannot grow up; and who are inherently expendable cogs in a unending war; such a theme could easily fall into Pabulum; but the writers pretty well pull it off.Sky Crawlers is Speculative fiction of a High Order, worthy of comparison with the work of Roger Zelazni, or Larry Niven; if it does not always reach quite as high as it aims; it at least comes close to that mark. The Teacher Subplot in many ways crucial to the story; is just a bit much; 'The Teacher' in the end likely share the fate of Baron von Richthofen, or Colonel Tomb; hanging so much of the drama, unnecessarily on this supposedly unbeatable adversary is a bit much; and a bit juvenal; which is why I only give the film 4 stars; the writing could; and generally did take a more mature, more genuinely adult point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"im lovin this cd and movie!","review":"The movie its self was ace and now the cd is to!especially kate rose lemon i loved that song before the movie even started!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great soundtrack and an amazing movie/story.","review":"All of these songs completely fit the story of thirteen.

It is nice to have such great variety and some quality songs of all genres. However I do agree with the reviewer below me.

I have used Castro's books in the past and have never experienced the problems I have with this one. I recommend against purchasing this book and I hope Peachpit will not repeat the problems encountered within."},{"rating":"1","title":"But why???","review":"I've been interested in learning XML for some time now and checked out various websites and bought this book. But the sites and this book fail to give any reason why I should use XML... I've been working with VB, VBA, VBScript, C, C++, JAVA, JavaScript, and more for years and they all serve a clear purpose. I just cant figure out how XML makes my life easier - it just makes me type much more.As for the book, I found the figures much easier to follow than the text that refers to them. The text is very repetitive and bland (type this, type that). Also, there are constant references to other pages that kept me hopping around the book until I was cross-eyed.I recommend visiting IBM or Micro$oft and checking out their free online tutorials before reading this book, especially for newbies to XML like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth your time","review":"Money is OK.... :)This is a book written by and for HTML coders. It doesn't teach the gist of XML or guide you to do anything that really needs XML. On the other hand, if you just want to understand some basics of XML (instead of DOING real things), I think it is better to find a review paper on XML instead, which will save you time and get the point easier. This author wrote a wonderful HTML book, but this XML one looks like a piggyback on the reputation earned there - may ruin it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Beginners! Jumbled Mess!","review":"While I can't say this is the worst XML book I've ever read, it's definitely not the best either. I've worked with and learned some xml in college, and I can definitely tell you that this book is full of vague descriptions. I learned alot more from tizag.coms XML tutorials than I did reading this crap. The author goes as far as to explain how to create the structure of a xml document for several pages before explaining how to even write the xml declaration. Pitiful. A beginner would never understand this book at all. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a stand-alone book","review":"I've read through 2/3 of the book for an XML class. This book did not provide a good picture of what could be accomplished with XML. Nor did it explain steps well. I found myself getting very confused in many places and wondering why the author did what they did.While the steps are succinct, you do need other resources to learn XML. I was very frustrated with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's better out there","review":"Others have commented on their failings with this book. I'll add mine: layout and fonts. In theory, you'd expect a two-column layout with text on one side, and code on the other, to better visually present information than traditional textbooks. The reality, however, is snippet-heavy examples, because of insufficient space in the book to see the code. The abundance of different font sizes and colors used in code and the text less result in clarity than the Los Angeles freeway. When later using the book for reference, I had a more difficult time than I should have skimming the busy pages for information. I've since found another XML to review information from, which obviously means I don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic XML","review":"The best way to teach a beginner (myself) how to write code is to consistently illustrate the code with examples that can be modified and used in various circumstances. As she has stated in the introduction of the book, this is not an advanced book on XLM for developers but a project manager's book to understand the language of the developers when they are talking and even understand the code being developed.This book follows the same type of verbiage and examples from her previous book, HTML 4, so the transition from very easy. This book delves into the basics of XLM, DTD, Schema, XLST, Cascading Style Sheets and some more topics for the reader to discover.The price of the book is affordable for anyone trying to step into the new World of XML.Have fun coding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as Castro's HTML Book","review":"I had high hopes for this book, But I have come away disappointed. I used Castro's HTML book to learn that language, and I was favorably impressed. I found the examples in that book easy to walk through, and I felt they did a good job explaining basic concepts and procedures. I also liked the fact that Castro brought a designer's perspective to the subject.Unfortunately, I can't say the same for this book. I have spent the better part of a day on its chapter on XSLT, and I don't feel like I have gotten a handle on the subject. I feel about the same way about XML schemas. I think XML may simply be a subject that requires a programmer's, rather than a designer's perspective.The book could use a complete rewrite, particularly its walkthroughs, which I have had trouble following and making sense of. If you need to write style sheets, schemas, or anything else beyond the simplest XML, you are probably better served by another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah! Elizabeth's writing about XML!","review":"Elizabeth Castro has to be THE best technical writer at breaking processes into discrete chunks. I use her other books in my community college teaching -- and I used this one with a three-day class in XML that I taught for a corporate client in December.

The Turtle Tatoo uses story telling to demonstrate how to accomplish goals. Stories have proven to be the best teachers through out the centuries. I was so impressed that I ordered extra copies of it from the mail order company I had gotten the copy I have from for a special education class I had been providing books and other reading material to over the last five to six years. What is even more impressive is that the author got the idea for this book while trying to figure out how to set about her goal of writing a book about stories and used the principles she discusses in the book to do it. The result of her efforts is The Turtle Tatoo and I would highly reccomend it. It is a great little book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what promised","review":"I'm a big slash fan, so I had high expectations of this book-the slash field is so overrun with Lord of the Rings/Harry Potter slash these days that the relatively new genre of environmental slash was tempting enough for me to buy it sight unseen.

It's strengths are many but I particularly like it's Flash Points sections which offer a discussion point for helping understand when a person can be liable for certain actions. It then relates these to the Professional Code of Conduct for different disciplines. It's concrete and practical.The book is easily readable, but well researched. Anyone who has heard either Bart Bernstein or Thomas Hartsell, Jr. Speak, knows these guys have \\"been there and know this stuff.\\" It's one of my favorite books for anyone who counsels or helps others. If read and followed, it should keep us out of the courthouse and in the counseling field helping those in need.

The book began OK, but soon became unbelievable. True, Jackson was a selfish [guy]... but Ginger wasn't much better -- incredibly stubborn, and never, ever satisfied with anything. She definitely provoked some of the stuff that happened to her. She was easily one of the most annoying characters I've ever encountered in a novel. By the book's end, after she STILL wasn't satisfied, you just wanted someone to throw her off a skyscraper, followed by Jackson, so the two of them can never show up in a book again.

KNOWING was a book filled with repetative paragraphs that went nowhere. As usual, nothing picked up until the end, and by then, I didn't care anymore.

One of your reviews stated something about the son not liking school and planning to get a masters degree while in the Air Force.

I really can't complain about the sex--I mean Jackie Collins does it too--yet still it was excessive and seemed only for the purpose of gratification. We didn't need 300 sex scenes to prove that was all Jackson cared about. 4. Things were unrealistic. Like Jackson decides to become a Christian in a paragraph. ...but I don't want to hate on Rosalyn.

It seems that if I take out the batteries and reinsert it solves the problem and the remote control works again, but it is quite frustrating. So between the robot falling apart (the wheels, head, and arms do not stay on correctly), and the control not working, it is a terrible toy. Every few minutes I am \\"fixing\\" the toy. I do not recommend you purchase this product. We've been very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea, BAD Execution","review":"My son received this toy when he was 5 years old. I'm proud to say that I have a boy who loves to build things on his own so at first glance he LOVED the idea of being able to build his own robot. With minimal help he was able to build a few of the creations on his own. He really enjoyed this toy. That being said this robot only moves forward and backwards with no control over the head or arms. It has many pieces that fit together rather tightly and it was difficult for my son to take the pieces apart when he wanted to make something new. Truthfully, I had to use so much force to separate the blocks that some of them have little stress cracks in them. Also when the Robot is built and on the move, the wheels tended to fall off. It was a good gift but unfortunately it will only provide minimal entertainment value and it isn't durable enough to last more than a few months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Fun!","review":"My 5 year old son loves this toy.

If I would have read them I could have saved myself the trouble of buying this toy for a 6 year old. I can only reiterate the other reviews - adult help is needed to make the pieces fit together, the remote control only goes backwards and forwards - not that it matters much because the wheels don't actually turn for the robot to move in any direction, and the arms fall off when the robot moves at all. Thank goodness for the Amazon return policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design very disappointing","review":"Very poor design. Do NOT buy.

It is very well balanced with uptempo swing and beautiful ballads, old favorites and originals. The vocalist Shelley Burns handles all of them with her matured voice, technique and impeccable style. Burns is a versatile entertainer with somewhat commical touch on stage, but this album seems to focus more on her philosophical and romantic side. And the pianist, Bob Fylling's original compositions are all exquisite and his arrangements on standards are extraordinary. Other sidemen including the young talent Ryan Coughran on clarinet are worth checking out, too. Overall, it is an enjoyable album for all kinds of Jazz fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Believe No One Has Reviewed This!","review":"This CD is sooooo good.

They feel duped and ultimately angry. They should be thankful that they purchased a great CD for about $3 - $4 when they could have thrown away about $13 on a lousy Manheim Steamroller CD. Personally I think Manheim Steamroller is completely overrated and dated. This fresh and beautiful CD by The Westwind Ensemble (that's WESTWIND ENSEMBLE!!!) is a well-crafted blend of synthesizers, bells, horns and percussion. While it's true that a couple of the songs take some getting used to (Good King Wenceslas for its techno sound and Jingle Bells for its downbeat gothic tone), this is a gem of a Christmas CD.

After the first one banged in my CD player with the windows down in winter for over a year, this one makes me keep the windows up and the stereo on mute for the majority of the cuts!! Besides for \\"it's on\\" and a few of PEEDI's cuts, the album is lacking the Roc-a-fella touch. Where's the step stool that brings Roc to anothr level? This album was a step backwards and I am really dissappointed in Sparks. Young Froggy is a killa with his raspy voice and unusual delivery, but left me aching for more of that raw coming off a 3rd verse high on \\"Sing my Song\\" off the first album.

Only notable tracks are the first 3, and \\"G.A.M.E\\" ( only because it featured the streets very own...Lil'Cease). Words can't describe the disapointment that Roc-A-Fella fans recieved witt this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album works","review":"This album is real Street. I definately felt it a lot more than the first album. Young Chris shows off his telent on numerous tracks and Oshino and Sparks seem to have upped their bar. Siegal is his usual raw self, bringing the heat on every track he is featured on. My favorite songs are Can't Stop Won't Stop, BB Gun, Blow, Just Another Nigga and 94 Bars. Probably my only problem with the album is some of Peedi Crakk's work which doesnt always seem up to par. If you enjoyed the first one or are a fan of rap(not hip hop) I definately recommend checking this album out."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is how you do it","review":"After being disappointed with the first SP cd, SP had to come with a harder cd to win back some of their fans they lost.

I remember the growls and beautiful voice of Liv. I never even bothered with the albums where they decided to go techno-industrial or what ever that crap was. I am always looking for the operatic sounds when I am looking for new music. It's getting harder to find bands like that anymore. Seems like everytime you find one they only put out one album or one ep and then it's over. Case in point..Eyes Without Face..great!! But they only put out an ep and thats it. This album is okay, but, after hearing the whole thing I was bored. The new female singer is way too poppy, her voice never changes on any of the songs. I felt at times I was listening to Collide. I guess she can't sing operatic style. The rest of the vocals are just boring and not uplifting at all. Almost seems that they are trying to get into that Nu-Metal market and appeal to the younger crowd. So..okay, but, nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"A freshman work.","review":"Suffice it to say, Mr. Chabon became a more disciplined, focused, and skilled writer with practice and age. Much like hearing a demo of a great song, one can hear evidence of the greatness in the demo, but the demo itself doesn't stand alone. The same can be said with this book. In the Chabon canon, people will look at this years from now and see the techniques and styles being practiced in The Mysteries of Pittsburgh that made Chabon what he is. Then they will go on to read his works of polish and quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literary fiction CAN be gripping and humorous!","review":"This is my first time reading Chabon, and I am thoroughly impressed. I found his novel poignant and intriguing; I kept turning the pages as you might when reading a best-selling thriller. The language is exquisite and I even caught myself reading it outloud sometimes.

I liked his metaphors [e.g., describing a suburban house's garden-hose as a \\"French horn\\" hung on the house]. But the main character was sniveling, weak and unlikeable. I felt as much antipathty toward him as his father did--and I suspect that that wasn't the author's intent.Maybe I'm too \\"old-fashioned\\" in my literary tastes--but a girl named \\"Phlox,\\" the many celebrations of \\"alternative sexual drives,\\" the adolescent urges to \\"shock\\" all left me cold.Too bad.I really wanted to like him more--or, if not like him, than admire his talent to such an extent that it would overcome my personal repugnance to him as a man.

I've probably bought 5 copies or so over the years because I keep giving it away to friends saying \\"you HAVE to read this book!\\" And, I confess that it is one of the landmarks I judge my friends by - (don't you do that, wait and see if a friend loves your favorite book as much as you do - if so, then you truly might be soul-mates, if not, well I guess there's a gap in understanding)...

The language is fluid and witty. The characters are some of the most complicated and intelligent and fun to watch of any i've seen recently. Set in the strange summer right after college graduation, this novel takes place in the time of life when old illusions and newfound freedom converge, and relationships are suddenly epic and intense. Chabon really allowed himself to adore everyone in the small circle of friends that constitutes this book's characters. He has a gift for drawing not just characters but relationships between characters so finely that you can feel them changing every time a word passes between them. I put this book down wanting to go out and find my own romantic adventures. A wonderful, energetic novel about the rush and longing that immediately precedes sexual and emotional self-discovery. Which can't last, alas..."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Wonder Boys","review":"I found this book to be very well written. Chabon is a brilliant writer but I didnt care for the lead character. I agree with one review that stated his venture in homosexuality was cliched and predictable.

Having attended college in Pittsburgh (and fallen in love there) not long before this novel was published in 1988, I was hoping for a trip down memory lane by an accomplished novelist.

I mean, a whole chapter dedicated to two characters playing \\"Twister\\"???? (that did not further the story at all?)

(A porno mag drops out of a book at the protagonist's book store job, \\"like a severed arm.\\" (!!) Uh..okay). The book reeked of something written by a (post)adolescent. (Not a compliment). Maybe if you're gay, or live in Pittsburgh (or both) this will be enjoyable. Otherwise, I can't recommend it. I actually bought my copy of PITTSBURGH at a book signing, and met Mr. Chabon when he signed my copy. He was very articulate, well-mannered, and seemed a sensitive and nice fellow.

Michael Chabon is a much better writer than the other two, but he also shroud his characters in the same inaccurate light. The Mysteries of Pittsburgh is a very fragmentary and immature piece of work about a college student named Art having bisexual trysts. The characters are very stereotypical, and seemed to be put together by super glue. This Side of Paradise and The Catcher in the Rye it is definitely not. If you really have to be immersed in cultural cliches and unrealistic narrative, read The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay. At least you can learn some new words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prententious tripe","review":"This was such a precious, pretentious, contrived piece of self-absorbed twaddle, I can't comprehend the high ratings for this book.

I also examined the cover of the book and focused on the words \\"the acclaimed New York Times bestseller.\\" I thought, if this book could have the New York Times not only stamp their approval but also put the fancy word \\"acclaimed\\" in the sentence, then by golly I was sold. Judging a book by its cover was my new motto.The level of ease of reading the book was child's play ...Soon after breezing through a few chapters, however, the child's play also became a child's book. Suddenly, and occurring too often in my maturing stage of life now that I think about it, I felt like I was in sixth grade. The easy read was just that, an easy read. Instead of some type of depth, Michael Chabon took the readers along a 297-page book that could probably be explained and done with in two minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but needs another reading","review":"I will admit that I view Michael Chabon with some respect. I have read Kavalier & Clay twice and have read both his short story collections. I also just finished his upcoming novel, \\"Summerland.\\" Therefore, I was slightly disappointed when I finished TMOP. Not that it wasn't good. It is just that I have read his later works, which I can say have put him near the top of the current author crop, and TMOP shows Chabon's youth and inexperience.While the characters are interesting and developed, they still carry many stereotypes. I also found myself uninterested in the outcome of the book. I didn't really care what happened to anyone. This is not something that happens in his later books.Anyway, it is a good book and I hope it will work itself into my personal favorites someday. If not, at least one of his novels (Kavalier & Clay) will always be on my bookshelf.Recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"A literary darling's first novel","review":"Chabon hit the big time with this one, and has had some leeway with the critics since then.

It brings back memories of the golden age of shoegazer in the very early 90's. Back then I was listening to Medicine, My Bloody Valentine, The Drop Nineteens, Slowdive, et al and remember feeling priviledged to bear witness to such a beautiful and creative movement. This is an unknown album which is criminal because it is so good. There are a number of outstanding songs on the CD and no bad ones. Although it is not quite as good as My Bloody Valentine or Medicine, it is a notch below and well worth investing in if you have even the slightest interest in that ramarkable period. I'd compare the style to an upbeat Chapterhouse, or a quiter Medicine. Its very different from bands like Slowdive or Ride in that it is almost dancey but not quite. Listen to it and enjoy it.

That's right, all 4 of the films take place in the woods almost 95% of the time. As if it weren't boring enough with crappy action sequences and lame story. Don't waste your money. I agree that Aoi and Kageru were good in the film, but I wish I had seen them first in something else. And the film did look like it was filmed by a soccer mom with a camcorder.

However it is far from informative. Compared to the books from the same publisher but of different breeds, this book does not contain sufficient information. Some pictures are cute, but some others merely does not reflect the beauty and the elegance of the Maltese breed. A few pictures were so yellowish that it seemed like the Maltese has a yellow coat, which is misleading to owners who are not familiar with the Maltese breed. This book does not contain sufficient information on the topic of breeding and preparation. The author spent over 3 pages just to talk about the history of the Maltese breed. The author gives unrelated info, such as the AKC standard of the Poodle.

I love this show. I love Bernadette Peters. I'm sure she's a great performer in this show. However, this recording is painful to listen to.Bernadette is not at all in top vocal form on this recording. While on stage her take on these songs may be powerfully well-acted, on CD it sounds as though the material overpowers her. She sounds like a second-rate singer squeaking and croaking through material that is way out of her league.This is a recording that is unworthy of a fabulous performer and a fantastic show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Bernedette Peters puts on a showstoping performance as the terrible Momma Rose. Her performance of \\"Rose's Turn\\" is the best yet. Some great songs from the show include \\"Some People\\" \\"Everything's Coming Up Roses\\" and \\"Let Me Entertain You.\\" A truely superb \\"Gypsy.\\" It is the ultimate recording of a truely awesome show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I saw the show the night before they recorded the CD. Bernadette had been sick a couple of weeks before and was never able to fully recuperate. You'll Never Get Away From Me seemed to be a little too low for Bernadette to sing (since her voice wasn't in top shape)- I noticed that on the recording as well. Little Lamb isn't that great-the song has never been a favorite of mine anyway. The rest of the CD is just great! Both Baby June & Louise are very talented. I especially recommend Small World (Bernadette & John Dossett do an amazing job), If Momma Was Married (The harmony is fabulous) and Rose's Turn (Great Song performed by the greatest talent on Broadway)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster recording","review":"I was eager to hear another version of this classic show, but I was terribly disappointed. There is just something lacking in the great Bernadette Peter's performance on this disc. Someone has offered the live show was much better. Perhaps, but I even find the arrangements uninspired, so it's hard to blame a particular day or rest the blame solely on Peters. I'm afraid this whole affair is just rather boring to listen to, and this is coming from a huge musical fan. . But as a record of one if Broadway's finest works, I must say you can easily skip this recoding. Now if you want to hear Peters shine and an INCREDIBLE sounding CD, get her revival of Annie Get Your Gun. Now that is Broadway! Powerful, bouncy, perfectly cast. That's a great recording! This Gypsy, is sad to say, a big yawn."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish she wasn't holding back","review":"I got this CD on the day it came out. I was so excited because I saw her in , which was probably one of the most amazing experience ever! I cried when she came walking down the aisle. Well, anyway! Bernadette is really one of the last true Broadway Divas. They're a rare breed that command everyone and everything around them and have the talent which gives them the right to do so and have the pesonality that makes them a diva.Bernadette, in my opinion has told herself that she is now old and she can't be pushing herself. On this album, she doesn't hold notes. She still sounds like the same, amazing Bernadette, but a few technical things let her down. She doesn't hold notes, and she sometimes mixes different parts of her voice in different spots that don't work anymore. I gave this a 5 star rating because Gypsy is a flawless show that can't be bad. Bernadette was amazing, but she's holding back! I wish she would just let it all out. Well, that's my 2 cents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bernadette makes a wonderful \\"Rose\\"","review":"This is my very first Broadway album that I ever bought and I have to say I was not disappointed. Bernadette is not playing a part, she convinces you that she IS Rose (especially in the numbers \\"Everything's Comin' Up Roses\\" and \\"Rose's Turn\\"). Instead of making the part campy (like Bette Midler) or yelling the songs (like Ethel Merman) or imitating another person (like the miscast Rosalind Russell copying her Auntie Mame role), she adds a sense of vulnerability and humanity to the role. I would have to say that Bernadette Peters and Angela Lansbury are the two best \\"Roses\\" and are the two cast albums to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Casting","review":"I first saw Bernadette Peteres perform her role as Mama Rose on the Tony Awards 2003 and was very, very disappointed.

She has no idea what she's doing in this role ... she cant even hold a candle to the people who have done the role before her, like the divine ms M!

THe sound is crisp and forward. Angel is fast becoming one of the better labels for this genre. (BMG's entire catalog from the 80s needs to be remastered)I wish they would have waited a month or two to record the CD. Ms. Peters just came off a bout with bronchitis and it really shows on the CD. She's hoarse in places and you can hear her strain to get to notes in others. But the acting is phenomenal. I saw the show in September and was amazed at how much better it sounded. Ms. Peters had relaxed vocally and deppened emotionally.The find on the CD is Tammy Blanchard, with Little Lamb, one can actually close your eyes and see the classic scene of Louise and her lamb.And I totally agree with those who have said this is one of the best recordings of Rose's Turn.Recap: Buy the CD, listen for the nuances in line readings and enjoy the orchestra and overall sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"Okay - I adore B.Peters and I love Gypsy. I always thought she would be perfect to belt out those songs. The truth of the matter is she is simply the wrong type. I saw it in performance and was heart broken. The key changes for Bernadette's voice completely re-color the character of Rose. Bernadette shoud have played Tessie! Her use of Rose's sex appeal completely stole the coming out story reserved for Louise. And the casting of Louise and June was way off. These girls looked to be about 35!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Recording with Maureen Moore?","review":"I had the pleasure of seeing this on Broadway without Bernadette Peters. She was out for the night and her cover, Maureen Moore, was magnificent! Ever since I saw a ghastly community college production of Gypsy in 1974, I've dreaded productions of this brilliant musical. The performance I saw on Broadway changed all that! Maureen Moore was an amazing Rose. She had me crying at the First Act finale, and I was sobbing as all that emotion poured out of her on \\"Rose's Turn.\\" She brought Gypsy to life for me. Tammy Blanchard was a terrific Gypsy, and John Dossett was a fantastic Herbie. I'd even consider seeing a seriously miscast Peters in this, but hope that Maureen Moore becomes a star after playing those performances that Peters misses!Where is her CD of that outstanding performance? Get the Merman or the Lansbury recordings instead. They're far better in this role!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother - This CD is the worst!","review":"Bernadette Peters as Madame Rose in \\"Gypsy\\" is one of the worst casting ideas of all time!Peters is a great performer, but this role is simply wrong for her. This latest \\"Gypsy - Broadway Cast\\" CD makes this painfully clear. In addition, the entire CD is a sub-standard version of this great classic score.Buy the original 1959 cast album with Ethel Merman. The Bette Midler TV version is a close second. The later Broadway revival cast albums with Angela Lansbury and Tyne Daly are so-so, but this latest version is definitely at the bottom of the barrel.Besides the sadly miscast Peters, the whole production sounds like a bad high school play. Skip it! Go for ANY other version than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I AM SPEACHLESS!!","review":"Wow!! This recording is amazing. It has totally blown me away. Everything is so crisp and precise. Bernadette Peters has done it again! Her voice continues to glow throughout the CD. Her emotions that she puts into each and every song are incredible.

The problem with the windows driver is that it regularly malfunctions. If you plug it into your computer one day, it may not recognize the computer.

The DS would no longer detect the cartridge at all.And good luck trying to get customer support from Datel. The codejunkies help forums have been \\"temporarily down\\" for several years, and the customer support's e-mail bounces.

Once you connect your USB to the free port on your pc and add the cord to the cheater, you will be brought to a screen where you may attempt to download new updates. The software with the USB cable, is installable on your pc; the big shocker?!?! When you do quick update, it deletes all your games then freezes. If you restart the product you will find all your other games have been deleted and you can't retrieve them.If you have an avid DS lite or DS player do not update your game Cheater, you will be sorely disappointed and can offer nothing but an empty Cheater.

My kids absolutely love the new options for their DS Lite games.I'm downgrading this item a bit for three two issues we've encountered:1. It took a bit of work to get the correct driver installed on our Windows 7 machine, a manual install of the driver was required.2. I'm seeing occasional game lockups while using the Action Replay. It may be because the kids are trying to use multiple codes or using codes too quickly / too close together, but it is a minor annoyance.3. Due to the shape of the DS Lite Action Replay, you cannot use it while the DS is protected by a cover like theDSL Nerf Armor Dark Blue/White. The Action Replay design should account for the large number of DS Lites in a protective case.Overall all, though, a great purchase for the DS Lite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too great...","review":"My son was enjoying this Action Replay until recently when suddenly all of the games listed were wiped out - it is now useless.

He turns it on and it goes to a white screen.

The only problem is every month or so it freezes or doesn't respond. However, as long as you save your game every 20 minutes, its definitly worth beating that almost impossible boss or getting perfect scores and unlocking every character. I got mine almost a year ago and it's only froze about 3-5 times. even if you don't like to cheat you can always create a file where you don't cheat (if the game lets you).

Nor does it say anywhere on the packaging of the product or in the advertisement just what computer specifications are necessary to perform this update. It turned out my computer wasn't able to be used for this.And there is no way to enter codes in manually, to my knowledge. I say to my knowledge, because I was unable to get any replies from the company to my emails asking about this.

It's one of the few that when the original release of Naruto comes out (heard some time in July), I will get that, and just leave it on subbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The import is the only real way to watch NARUTO","review":"this edited version is just crap. i've seen a few episodes of the import version but i don't know how to get any of it.

However this DVD from Shonen Jump only has the English dub audio track on it and the anime is pretty subpar with the American voice actors. Not as bad as One Piece but still not good either. I was really excited that they finally put Naruto out ond DVD. I was angry however when I learned there is no Japanese track. I don't think I can trust any DVD with the words Shonen Jump on them again if this is how they release a product. However it's still a decent series if you still want to check it out on Cartoon Network but the Japanese voices have alot more emotion than their American counterparts."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is...Naruto?!","review":"Stick to the manga, it's superior in every way (this goes for One Piece too)- The manga is uncut which means it contains violence + profanity + all the crap that was cut out because it was deemed inappropriate.

But if i were you i would wait for the uncut version or better yet buy the japanese version w/english subs. Its not that the show is actually horrible on the CW but the CW's version is watered down...if your like me then you hate it when things get cut out, thats what they do.Its been turned into a kids anime which really isn't what it is if you watch the origional version. The voice acting is good i will have to say that but the japanese voices are great to and the soundtrack in the japanese version is amazing...although some of the music is the same in the english version some of my favorite songs are the ones at the begining and end of the episodes and those are not in the english version.Like I said before wait for the uncut version (I hope they put it out in a box set when the whole series is done) or get the origional Japanese version if you don't mind reading subtitles it really is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's Nothing Wrong With the CN Verision","review":"Hey, guys!

Anime is growing up and out, like any entertainment or art form that's reaching a larger audience. It is changing for different environments. A purist won't like THIS verion of Naruto, but that's OK, this version isn't made for them, it's made for people like my family with younger kids. I do wish that the CN version was available in a boxed set; buying individual episodes gets pricey. When my kids are older, they may want the uncut version. But the CN version is good for now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was hoping that Naruto would NOT be dubbed for a while by any company for about two more years. This will sound biased or downright stupid to some, but seriously, Viz should've at least considered hiring new and young actors to play the voices of Naruto, Sakura, & Sasuke. Or at least have Stephanie Nadolny (the voice of Kid Goku from the original Dragon Ball) play the part of Naruto. After seeing the first episode dubbed, I was just flat out disappointed beyond belief. The voices just sounded so disgusting! That's all I'm gonna say!And seeing as this DVD is the edited version of the show, I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone, of course except for the kids who are just getting into the hype of Naruto.

The characters change more in this show than virtually any anime I have ever seen. Anybody who has seen up to ep 135 or so knows what I'm talking about.The show doesn't really get good until episode 20 or so, but from there it doesn't have more than one ep until about episode 140.This show makes me laugh pretty often, and while the voices in japanese are a bit irritating, they are nothing compared to the constant recital of \\"BELIEVE IT!!!!!!\\" I hear in every ep of the dub.

Im surprised Americans even have comedy, frankly, I don't find their humour funny at all, its usually a forced laugh from something obscene or profanitive or they laughing cause others are - mainly standup comedy.

It had a few missing elements that annoyed me, but which is not really the sellers fault though.First of, the space where you put your coins don't have a zipper. So if you open your wallet the wrong way, all the coins will fall out.I also only has 4 slots for credit cards or whatever, which are very tight. Personally that makes it hard for me, as I normally seperate my receipts, bills, credits cards and other cards.The good thing is that it's thin and easy to carry around.

He tells us in the book's very first chapter that calling him a liberal is meaningless, because labels in themselves are meaningless. Sure, throwing around labels like \\"Liberal\\" or \\"Conservative\\" is not only weak, but cliche. However, when you're writing a book that is essentially a guide to living in and improving society, you definitely lose some credibility for being clearly biased politically.I don't identify myself at all as a conservative, as I'm pretty liberal myself (possibly even more liberal than Schwalbe that condemns anyone producing or supporting pornography as being responsible ultimately for only misery, and lumps that specific industry in with big tobacco and gun manufacturers), but that doesn't mean I support someone shoveling a political agenda and calling it social science."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Good Advice","review":"This book throws out a ton of advice on how to have a successful marriage.

This translation, however, reveals the Iliad as an exciting and historical story. I usually don't get into these types of epics, but this translation made it easy for me to understand and become involved with the story.

When the spotlight arrived, I was a bit concerned, it was much smaller than any spotlight I've seen before. It was also very lightweight, which was good as I was going to be hiking with it strapped to my camera backpack.I used the light for about an hour on max intensity (there are two settings, one to use one bulb and the other to use both bulbs. The light did an excellent job and still was very bright after an hour of use. Keep in mind that this was in 15 degree weather where most batteries underperform.Overall I give this a 5/5. It's light weight, very bright and holds an excellent charge...what more could you ask for?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold a charge very long","review":"Doesn't hold a charge very long.

It gives a good foundation of the theory, even if sometime I would have preferred to have more proofs of theorems.Compact, readable and fairly complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for those who think Robert Jarrow is a lightweight!","review":"Robert Jarrow praises this book! I think that tells you the level of this text. It's Ivy League Ph.D.-school material with inadequate background provided. I guess if you are already a director of research in an investment bank, this book provides a lucid and compact survey of the current state-of-the-art techniques of credit risk modeling. In short, this is a book written for people who already are comfortable with the subject at a very high level.If you are a regular Schmoe like myself (someone comfortable at the Hull or Cuthbertson and Nitzche level) much of this book may zoom over your head. But if you regulary snicker at folks like me as derivatives dilatants and poseurs, I'd say check it out.The book may be great. But for me it was a waste of money.Did I mention that Robert Jarrow likes it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This is one of the worst books I have read in applied probability. Key results are glossed over, sometimes stated incorrectly, and almost always incomplete. I will give two examples: (1) In page 33, line 2 the author quotes a formula and places a footnote saying that it does not agree with the result of the original paper. The result in Lando misses a term exp(-\\\\gamma T) and is therefore incorrect, but Lando can't be bothered about who is right, he or the original authors. (2) In page 114, a formula (5.3) and the one preceding it are quoted as \\"essential ingredient\\"s in obtaining many pricing formulae but not proved. I wasted considerable amount purchasing the book and cannot recommend it based on its quality or level of content. To call it a book for a course is a cruel joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"The classic text for this kind of circuitry.","review":"Assuming you know something about CMOS and VLSIdesign, this is the classic text to cover thebroad base to get started in understanding howone goes about designing actual hardware forvarious neural network architectures.

There are a lot of newbooks (Mead has a new one out) but they owe alarge debt to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This series is SPECTACULAR!","review":"I've watched the entire series in fansubs and I'm VERY impressed with this series!It may sound boring and uninteresting to watch people play an ancient game, but the character development and the side plots are very much worth it. I have never seen an animated series that has surpassed Hikaru no Go for character development or interest, honestly.This series isn't as popular as Neon Genesis Evangelion or Rurouni Kenshin or Inuyasha, but I can assure you that it is just as interesting and engaging with better character development than those other series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to its recommendation","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I like Carl's juvenile literature much better than his adult books."},{"rating":"2","title":"a encounter too much brief","review":"This film is very good but has a central fail even considering it's made in the decade of 1940's. Interpretations, drama and black & white photography are superb. A man and a married woman, both in middle age, knows each other by hazard in a railroad station near London and falls in love. One must accept the moral and uses are these of the decade of 1940's, but even so, the situation becomes a little absurd as they don't consummate any sexual act nor even appears a slight suggestion. I think sex is exaggerated in today's cinema but in this movie it seems so hot passion rest incomplete and unreal, being substituted by cinema sessions, restaurant lunches and many walking by countryside, and that seems to me a little absurd. Also, curiously I have the feeling this film is conceived under a feminine point of view, being the director a man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very \\"Bridgette Jones' Diary\\"","review":"If you likes Bridgette Jones stories, where the bumbling female lead comes off as endearing to the most eligible bachelor in town, then you will love this book.Every woman wants to be courted like this and every woman wants her story to turn out this way.You won't broaden your vocabulary. You won't be better for having read it. You won't be changed forever. It's a cheesy escape and you'll have fun reading it.

(three and a half stars)","review":"A big fan of Shopaholic, I got this book the minute it was available in my library (I rarely buy books I'm not 100% sure I'll read again). Frankly, I expected a bit more. Emma just seemed identical to Becky without the shopping need, yet I didn't \\"feel her pain\\" her as I did with Becky. The writing were great as usual, the plot a bit predictable. As a whole, certainly not about to produce a series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read!","review":"This is a great book!!! I read it in about 1 1/2days and was up until 2:30 in the morning finishing it. It was so exciting I didn't want to put it down.This book is about a 20 something on her way back from a presentation who spills her guts to the guys sitting next to her on the plane when she thinks they are going to crash. Though she is embarassed when she realizes what she's done, she figures she won't see him again so it doesn't matter. Days later Emma finds out that the guy she told her innermost secrets to is the CEO of her company.This book is as exciting, funny and cativating as the \\"Shopaholic\\" series. However, what makes this book even funnier is waiting to find out what secret about Emma that the boss remembers next.This is a must read and a must own for any book collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it ...","review":"After suffering through the first nine pages of CYKS, I gave up. I'd by now started to hate Emma with a passion, and couldn't care less about what might or might not happen to her.I just don't get this new genre of \\"chicklit\\" in which Bridget Jones and the Sex in the City women reign. I love to read novels with women as the protagonists, but just don't understand the popularity of the characters created by Helen Fielding, Marian Keyes, Jane Green, Sophie Kinsella, and whoever wrote Sex in the City. I just cannot respect these women - I find them ditzy, scatterbrained, insecure, and pathetic.Clearly, I'm missing something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe all those five stars","review":"The protagonist: is petty, immature, and mentally deficient; lacks self-confidence, self-respect, self-control, and common sense; needs a boyfriend to legitimize her existence.The object of interest: has no standards in his women (aren't the airheads chosen by high-powered executives at least attractive?); incredibly, got to be a marketing genius and CEO without being able to see an individual's worth -- or lack thereof.The supporting cast: feel like polyester (even cardboard has too much texture and variance).The plot: predictable in the storyline, unpredictable in the stupidity of its details.I love chick flicks because they celebrate our femininity, but I cannot imagine how women are giving away their hard-earned money to an author who asks them to sympathize with an idiot like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt finish this book","review":"I didnt finsih this book. didnt flow for me. I might try it again when I dont have anything else to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book was so boring and predictable. It is written in the same manner as \\"Bridget Jones Diary\\". Same type of main character, same story problem, same solution. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chick lit at its most mindless and badly written","review":"I truly do not understand all the adulation this book has received. I'm a big fan of chick lit, but this book has to be one of the sillier, more badly written chick books around. The whole premise of someone being so frightened by airplane turbulence that she would blurt out her entire life history (including the details of how/when she lost her virginity?!) to the person sitting next to them on the plane--how silly is that?! How long did that turbulence on the flight last anyway--12 hours or so? That's how long it'd have taken for the moronic Emma to relate all her life's stultefying details to the unfortunate what's-his-name (and I can't remember his name 'cos he's utterly forgettable). The other plot elements in this novel get even more contrived, inane and annoying as the tedious book wears on--it felt like a 1000 pages. Not a book for those who enjoy their chick lit humor spiced with wit and intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as addictive as the shopaholic series...But cute.","review":"I got this book the day it came out, because i was really looking forward to Sophie Kinsella's next realease. The book was still very well written and funny at times, but i felt as though the plot was a little predictable. The book is very easy to read but i preferred the shopaholic series. All in all, it was a good book but i suggest that you borrow it, not buy it. Before i purchase a book i read a lot of reviews to make sure its worth my time. I hope this review is helpful to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as the Shopaholic series","review":"I'm a big fan of Becky Bloomwood and her Shopaholic adventures, but I thought Sophie Kinsella was coasting on her reputation in Can You Keep a Secret (and it appears to be working, given the number of rave reviews I'm seeing). I found Emma to be not-too-bright and not-too-interesting. Ditto for her love interest, who seems much too clueless to be a successful tycoon. Also, I had enjoyed the first-person perspective in Shopaholic, where we could get into Becky's wonderfully zany and creative mind. In this one, Emma never comes alive in a believable or sympathetic way. I agree with a previous reviewer that this book will disappoint those who expect both wit and intelligence in their chick lit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ray","review":"The book is stereotype and cliche. Very boring to read. It's like watching a mediocre Hollywood comedy when you can basically predict how the story goes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"This book had me laughing out loud!!! I have it as an audio book and even my husband listened to it and loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, simple chick lit","review":"This book is an interesting, and very quick read. It's completely predictable, and some of the situations that Emma gets herself into are a bit over the top, but all and all it's a good read, and it will make you laugh. Not as good as Shopoholic though I must say!"},{"rating":"1","title":"would not recommend, even if it was free","review":"I am sorry to report that this was a horrible waste of my money and time. I really wanted to like it and needed some good laughs. It may very well have been my fault since I also did not get past the sample for the Shopaholic, I should have known not to try this.The dialogue is horrible, I have more interesting and entertaining dialogue with my 12 year hold nephews. I was hoping it would be along the line of a Stephanie Plum story - not even close. Maybe if I was 13 I might have enjoyed the book more.I did read the sample and found it to be mildly entertaining, so I purchased the book. What you read in the sample is basically the best part. Why does everyone start their sentences with 'ER....'.I would not recommend this book even if it was free, sorry, just never takes off."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG, What a Waste","review":"I felt absolutely horrible after purchasing this book. Normally, I'd try the free sample offered for a book, but this time I just purchased the book before really trying it out and o'boy did I pay for it (literally). The first chapter was so annoying. I tried and tried to focus, but found my mind wondering off to la la land. I couldn't concentrate on the book at all. I tried to read the 2nd chapter and just gave up. I couldn't even finish the book. The protagonist just rambled on and on about nothing. I didn't see where the story was going. Geez!!! If you have money and time to waste, buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Kinsella so far","review":"I adored this book. I really liked the first three Shopoholic books (the fourth wasn't my favorite) so I thought I'd give Ms. Kinsella another try. I was not disappointed.The protagonist, Emma Corrigan, is very likable. The plot goes full-circle.There is just nothing wrong with this book except it's hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Start but Cute Ending","review":"I enjoyed Can You Keep a Secret. It has a slow start, but it is worth the read. Once you get started, it is a quick read and you want to know more about what happens in their lives. I was not ready for it to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brina's Review","review":"This was an amazing book. I love Sophie Kinsella's books. This book is about a woman living in England. She spills all of her secrets to a man who she thinks she will never meet again...until he shows up at her offices. What will happen? What will narrator Emma do? Read this great book to find out! I recommend this book to female teens and adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can You Keep A Secret - is great!!!!","review":"This book was hilarious and another excellent book by Sophie Kinsella. I can hardly wait to read what she writes next! The book grabs you from the beginning and then you don't want to put it down! Very fun and light reading and quite entertaining!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hillarious Secrets!!","review":"Sophie Kinsella has done it again. If you're a huge fan of the Shopaholic series like myself, then you are bound to enjoy this one. You might be able to guess the ending at the halfway point, but it's still a hillarious, laugh-out-loud story and the secret-keeper, Emma, is a lot more plausible than most chick lit female leads.The best parts are the embarrassing office scenes with Jack Harper, because they make you cringe for poor Emma. The boring market-research obsessed boyfriend is also very plausible. This is one of the best chick lit books of the year. It definitely lives up to the previous books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun book to read","review":"This is book was very entertaining. A Cute story about a woman making her way in the business world, and at the same time dealing with romance.There are lots of parts that will make you laugh out loud.

I was reading this book everywhere I could and couldn't help but laugh out loud. A really fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audiobook Version was entertaining","review":"I was looking for something light, funny, witty and romantic. This book met the requirements. It wasn't especially thought-provoking, nor was it unique, nonetheless, it was the entertainment I was seeking. I should also mention that the narrator's voice was appropriate for the story. Sometimes, the narrator of an audio-book has a voice which clashes with the intended feel of the storyline; this book was a fine combination. If you are looking for something deep and singular, this is probably not the book for you. Fun and sweet? Give this one a go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secret is out - this is a super fun book!","review":"If I were to guess Sophie Kinsella's character through the female protagonists in her novel, I'd say she is a very funny woman. As in her other books, I had a great laugh in a lot of scenes in this novel. The story is about Emma Corrigan who, like a lot of us have tiny, little secrets that by some circumstances were spilled out on national tv! That is actually the reason why my rating is one star short of the highest - couldn't imagine that kind of spilling happening in real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this book SO much!!!!!!!!!","review":"okay, it's been quite some time since I got so engrossed in a book that at some points I was mentally SCREAMING in frustration at characters! This book did the trick. The character build-ups were simply immaculate and the story line was just fabulous. I literally loaded this book to my kindle last night at 6 o'clock...and i've already finished it by 1:30 this afternoon!!! and i'm SO sad it's over. It was such a great read. Needless to say I cannot WAIT to read more of Sophie Kinsella's work!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay...","review":"Sometimes I wonder if people are just afraid to go against the tide while giving a review. Why all the rave reviews for this story? Am I missing something? This is Confessions of a Shopahilic with a new title and different names. Let's review...-Wealthy male boss who is initially mistaken for stranger never to be seen again (check)- bumbling young female with big life lesson to learn (check)- quirky jusgemental friends with misguided loyalty (check)- a betrayal of trust passed off as a misunderstanding or a silly lack of communication (check)- a fully fleshed out herione falling for a guy that we never really get to know (check)Yep... It's all there! So, if you loved Confessions and you want to read the same story again then you are in luck! For $7.99 you can download it on your kindle and have it today (AGAIN)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chick Literature is not for me","review":"This is one of the few books from the chick lit genre that I have read. I am quite disappointed as the characters were two dimensional and the plot was predictable. Not to mention the ridiculous and obvious ending, that I will not go into to avoid a spoiler review.I bought the book for an easy read on a flight (another mistake due to the fact that the main character has a panic attack on a plane), though I do have a minimum standard for expectations in any novel that I read. If you are any type of feminist, avoid this book. The heroine does not have a strong character and smacks of desperation...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!","review":"I have been a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella and the Shopaholic series.

This was the best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't HATE it, but skimmed to the finish","review":"Well, my first Chick Lit book was \\"The Undomestic Goddess,\\" (also by Kinsella) which I really enjoyed. So I was really looking forward to reading more of her work. As much as I had to suspend my disbelief for TUG, THIS one was almost impossible. I'd give it 2-1/2 stars if I could. I found myself skimming skimming skimming, and had a difficult time with all the, \\"And there was Jack\\" moments toward the end. Brother. I didn't hate it, but I kindof wish I could get those hours back so I could invest them in something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fun book!","review":"The chick lit genre is often so hit or miss, that even though I picked this one up at the used bookstore, I was still a little nervous that I wouldn't enjoy it. But my worries were completely unfounded! I had a great time reading this cute and funny read. It was fast-paced and just super entertaining. No, it's not terribly thought-provoking, or terribly unique, but it's entertaining and the characters are lively and sympathetic. I'm looking forward to enjoying another one of her books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well executed chick lit","review":"Completely predictable but thoroughly entertaining just the same. The main character is lovable and you feel for her during her predicament. There are some laugh-out-loud funny moments and Kinsella writes with admirable British wit. A light, entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is No Secret. . . it's GREAT!","review":"The moment Emma Corrigan unfolds her deepest darkest secrets to her reader, you're HOOKED. Not only can every woman relate to each one of Emma's secrets, but she instantly becomes your best friend.This book is so well written that you can't help but FEEL exactly what Emma is feeling at the moment, whether it be despair or euphoria, you are right by her side. Believe me, it's hard for me to find a good book that I can sit down and TRULY enjoy, and I couldn't put this book down, I LOVED IT! Whether or not you're a shopaholic fan, this book is enjoyable to all readers.To anyone who hasn't read this book: You're definetly missing out! It's well-written, and if you have any sense of humor, you will definetly be laughing out loud!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this...","review":"I read Undomestic Goddess and loved it so much that I decided to purchase Can You Keep a Secret afterwards. I was highly disappointed in this book for so many reasons. The characters are not fully developed and it doesn't feel like the reader gets to know them they way you do in other Kinsella novels (like Becky in Shopaholic or Samantha in U.Goddess). The story unfolds rather quickly in the beginning of the book, and the rest of it is just boring to get through. I'm still a huge Sophie Kinsella fan and will continue to read her books though."},{"rating":"2","title":"WITTY SUMMER BEACH READ","review":"This is a fantasic read. Emma is a character everyone of us can relate to. She is a little off the walls but a true princess. She is constantly being caught in the act if not with her boring boyfriend Connor then its nipping off for coffee with her collegue.Jack her boss who she deeply fancys but will not acknowledge is every girls dreams, full of surprises.

She is petrified of flying and on the rough flight home she freaks out and tells a total stranger, sitting next to her, all of her deepest secrets. This stranger turns out to be the CEO of the company she works at.

Thanks to Sophie Kinsella's witty charm and funny characters and actions, I read all of her other books, including her Madeleine Wickham novels and a bunch of other chick-lit authors! This book is a wonderful beach read/pool read/ plane read/rainy day read/ ANY DAY READ!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"loved 'secret'","review":"This is by far the best Sophie Kinsella book ever, ive read them all but twienties girl, that arrived this week. I fell for Jack, for the down to earth that this book is. So much more fun, without the intense intrigue of the shoppaholics (in my case a plus). A story is something that could actually happen, wich makes it more interesting. i wanted to read more. the language was easy, for us non-brits. loved loved loved it!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Laughed Out Loud--NO SPOILERS","review":"I am not going to recap the story. Amazon does that fine. But I just finished this book today and thought I would give you my thoughts. Although a tad predictable occasionally, as are most chick lit, it is entirely yummy, exactly what I hoped for. And at moments I was stunned and rather shocked. Her secrets aren't just secrets. Some are more like revelations to herself. It isn't that Emma is uncomfortable with herself, she just hasn't managed to be the girl she really is inside. Fortunately, she never comes across as annoying. Rather it is endearing and you cheer for her, and then cringe in her most embarrassing moments. (There were moments when I felt myself speeding up my reading to get through Emma's painful moments.)I had a hard time putting this one down. I ended up reading it in 2 days. It played like a movie in my head. My friend makes me create her summer reading lists and this one is going on it! Simply too much fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Read!","review":"As usual, Sophie Kinsella writes an entertaining book.

It is as if she is thinking things that I would think about a situation. I have already read a couple more books by her. It is really entertaining and she gets in alot of scraps. I think this is really more of a girl, lady book and doubt that the guys would like it. It's light and funny.

Emma, the main character is a responsible, thrifty person, who confronts difficult situations straight on and is not afraid to speak her mind. (Very opposite of Becky Bloomwood from the Shopaholic series that I also loved so much.) Emma is smart, witty and equally, if not more lovable.The audio version is narrated by Emily Gray, one of my favorite narrators. She makes this book even more enjoyable, if that's possible. I found myself laughing out loud.I know this is a \\"one off\\" book, with no plans for a series, but I really would love to see more on Emma and Jack. I would love to see a sequal. One of my top fun reads and will definetly read this one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hated all the shopaholic books, but loved this one!!","review":"I loved this book. Funny, sweet and endearing.

I started reading and I could not put this book down. I read it in less than a day and when I finished I couldn't stop thinking about the book and its great ending.It's about a woman named Emma that goes on a business trip to Glasgow and on her way back she meets a man on the airplane to whom she tells all her secrets to when there's a lot of turbulence on the plane and she believes he'll be the last person she'll ever see. She thinks that she'll never see this man again, luckily, but to her surprise it turns out to be her boss.I laughed out loud and I felt her anxiety when she was nervous.

This story is hilarious, it's romantic, fun, entertaining and by the end you're definitely in love. What I really love about this story, besides the fun romantic part of it, is the family dynamic that is really well written and played out. What I also love about her stories is that they could all be movies. In fact, I'd love if all her stories were made into movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a Fun Read!","review":"Can you Keep a Secret was a quick, fun read. With a similar formula of the Shopacholic series, Sophie Kinsella comes up with a new character who steals our hearts from page 1!Emma Corrigan is an average girl, 20-something who's trying to find her path in life. I think she's someone most of us can relate to with job woes, boyfriend woes, family issues etc. The best part of Emma is that she's honest, and funny. The things she says, the things she does and the way she thinks has you almost laughing outloud! The whole story you're hoping, waiting for something to go right for her, and for her to get her happy ending.I really enjoyed the story of Emma. Nearly as much as our beloved Shopaholic Queen. I think Kinsella managed to create another winning character and I wouldn't mind a sequel to this at all! For a quick read over the weekend, a pick-me-up or something to read in between those more heavy novels- Sophie Kinsella's books do the trick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Riot!","review":"You will love Emma, her friends, and Jack. This is truly escapist fiction- the book opens and you fall in, and become filled with rage, pity or giggles while experiencing Emma's various and sundry traumas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!!!!","review":"I'm not a reader type of person; however, this book was absolutley fantastic. All of Kinsella's books are funny and entertaining. I could not put this book down! I read it in 3 days! If you want an entertaining book read this one! I guarantee you will enjoy it. I was laughing every minute of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"help","review":"i am trying to make a soundtrack to this book and i need 10 songs. so far i only have 1 and that is Dirty Little Secret - By The All-AMerican Rejects. if you could give me any more ideas for this soundtrack that would be awsome please email me or something at hannahmarie@nwgroup.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can You Keep A Secret?","review":"Everyone at the Panther Corperation is overexcited about the visit from Jack Harper. When Emma realizesthat is the man she had told all her secrets to on the plane. It's unexpected when Connor asked Emma to move in with him, but for her to say no was shocking. Could anything worse happen? Emma makes a big mistake. Will this change her life. Can You Keep A Secret is an extrodinary book with marvelous details."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOOOOOOO BORING!","review":"I read the entire Shopaholic series and loved it..this book didn't get off the ground until the final 10 pages. If you want a better read that's more for a mature adult, buy GREEN EGGS & HAM by Dr. Seuss..don't waste your money on this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor man's Bridget Jones","review":"This a rip off of the Bridget Jones series. I can just imagine the publisher nodding off to sleep while reading the rough draft. \\"Hmmm,the character is shallow,unattractive,below average in intelligence but Bridget Jones sold millions of copies so there has to be an audience for this book.\\" My daughter's book, HOP ON POP had more substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can You Keep a Secret?","review":"This was my \\"beach book\\" I read it in a week! I love to read but I need to get lost in a book to be interested. I found myself wanting to know what happens to Emma next. Her realtionship w/ Jack is awesome and cute. What every woman day dreams about. The best thing about this book is its funny like a sitcom and I don't have to wait a week to know more. Its fun, and enjoyable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing read...","review":"I picked up this book thinking it would be a fun read but I did not anticipate that it would be this predictable and uninteresting. I was personnally very disappointed and would not recommend it to anybody unless they have never read anything else their whole life. Then maybe they would find this book somewhat amusing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun!","review":"Like many others have said this is a fun book. It doesn't requite deep thought or a list of notes to follow along, (which is exactly what I want in a book that I am taking to the beach) I laughed out loud and I cheered for our heroine when she landed her man.The book follows the standard chick-lit plot. Boy and Girl meet, fall for one another, someone does something wrong, then they find their way back to one another. I must say this book offered a new transgression, one that I found myself hurting alongside our heroine as she suffered the indignities of her partner.This was my first book by Kinsella, but it certainly won't be my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"90210","review":"If you like the drama then you'll like this book. She goes on a trip for work and has one too many cocktails and spills her guts to non other than the guy that she's suppose to work for.oops, I did it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"So...er, shallow","review":"Cannot believe the rave reviews from critics and readers! Were we reading the same book? Er, um, what were they thinking? I, er, got into counting the \\"ers,\\" \\"ums,\\" and even the \\"erms\\" prefacing every Emma-thought and statement. Overall, a boring and um, shallow read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Okay, this is all my fault. The \\"Shopaholic\\" book (only read the first) was appallingly bad, so what on earth made me think this would be any better?First of all, the main character is an idiot. Please. Gets on a plane, gets nervous and tells some total stranger her ENTIRE life story? And he just sits there and listens? AND remembers every single detail?Secondly, how old is this guy?Third. They have two aborted \\"dates\\" and she jumps right into bed with him? And he expects her to? I mean, they had, up to that point ONLY KISSED ONCE!And HIS secret? Laughable. Completely laughable.The only use I can find for this book is as a coaster.I honestly don't understand how these awful books keep getting published!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinsella Has the Gift of Humor","review":"Emma has no idea why her actions backfire so frequently. Think of Clueless, cross that with Bridget Jones and you have a hint of what a fun movie this would make. I'm picturing Hugh Grant playing Jack, the tycoon.It's fun, as the reader can't wait to see what comes out of Emma's mouth next. The girl has a knack for bumbling through life, yet you can't help cheering for her to overcome it all.Update: I just found on the internet that this will become a movie, with Erin Cressida Wilson to adapt the book into a screenplay for Kate Hudson to star in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves A Million Stars","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. I've read all of the Sophie Kinsella books and so far this is by fat the best. Humor and romance... What could be better?"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it love it love it !!","review":"I am completely in love with this book!!! Everytime I opened it up to read another chapter I couldn't help but laugh out loud. The sense of humor is cute and sophisticated. Every scene in the book you could picture in your head which made it all the more amusing. It's fun and whitty, Once you have the book in your hands and you start reading it, you will not be able to put it down! Every moment in this book is so real ...or at least Sophie Kinsella(author) makes it seem like it could be real. Emma Corrigan is an unforgettable hilarious character which I feel you become attatched to, like a good friend. Can You Keep A Secret is a comforting make you feel good about your own life kind of book...Poor Emma goes thorugh some life changes that she struggles throguh brilliantly!I am so happy I got the chance to read this book, and I am looking forward to start reading Confessions Of A Shopoholic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun times!","review":"I spend time reading text books and self-help books and Sophie Kinsella provides an entertaining break from reality for me. Her books are just plain fun and I intend to read them all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"chicklit at its best","review":"i looved this book! i just had to keep reading. i felt so bad for her, how humiliating that would be!! ahh but definitely addicting! i've reread it a few times so it's definitely worth trying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely funny book","review":"This book is a good read!Very very funny novel and you ask yourself over and over \\"what more can go wrong?\\"A book to lose yourself in. Quick and easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighthearted fun read","review":"I found this book to be funny, sad a very relateable. Altough I am not from London or have a \\"ken\\" like boyfriend I found that I was very much able to relate to the main character in the book. I would recommend this book to anyone, and especially the twenty something girl that is questioning her career and place in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overwhelmingly good!! What a fun read!","review":"I am not typically one to laugh out loud when reading but this book made it. I could not hold back my giggles and laughter so many times!This is a very sweet, traditional romance book but with so much more. I don't normally keep my books after I finished them(I sell them on Amazon) but this is something I definitely want to keep on a shelf and share with friends. Actually, I have made my \\"never read a book\\"coworker read it and she loved it! That's how good this book is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you need a laugh...","review":"This was the first book that I have read by Sophie Kinsella and it won't be the last. I was literally laughing out loud at the beginning of the book. If you want a quick read that lifts your spirits...I recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud!","review":"This was my first Sophie Kinsella book and I was not disappointed. It's so funny my tummy hurt from laughing. The characters were likable enough. Just a thoroughly entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVERAGE CHICK LIT","review":"I have liked previous books by this author and heard good things about this book, so I thought I would enjoy it. I love chick lit and am always looking for a fun breezy book. I really did not care for \\"Can You Keep a Secret\\"-overall I thought it was average. The characters never seemed real, the romance was never developed and felt fake at times, and it almost seemed like a long drawn out plot for a soap opera. A few parts made me laugh, but all in all I thought the plot to be very weak and unrealistic. I found myself sympathizing more for the dumped boyfriend than cheering on the new love interest. If you're looking for a light fluff book you can finish quickly without thinking, then I would pick this book. But I most likely will never read it again and I would recommed any of the Shopaholic novels over this one anyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This story was ridiculously predictable and annoying.The main character is often in situations that she supposedly finds unbearable, but does nothing to change them when she easily could(being \\"forced\\" into a hideous costume at the company picnic, being put down by family members constantly, being stuck with her family while Jack is waiting for her). I could go on and on.She's just a complete idiot and I could not relate to her. It makes me wonder how I'm supposed to believe that any man is interested in her, much less a brilliant, successful marketing genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"I just finished the book, and am so bored by its predictability! Wow, I just didn't think books like this were being written anymore. From the Shopaholic series which were great (the first 2 anyway) to this. A big slide downhill. This book would be fine if this was your first look into chick lit/romance fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Great Sophie Kinsella!","review":"I liked this book a lot, though not quite as much as the Shopaholic books, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I liked the premise for the book; it was interesting and fun reading. I recently read that Kate Hudson is going to star in the movie version of this book... congratulations to Ms. Kinsella! The only other thing I'll mention here is that there seems to be a pattern in all of her books that the heroine ends up with an extremely wealthy man, out of pure luck. A nice thought, but how often does that translate into reality? That aside, I still love all her books and am anxiously awaiting Shopaholic and Sister - hurry September!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book","review":"This book was my first Sophie Kinsella attempt, and I loved it! Emma Corrigan was the kind of \\"heroine\\" that's fun to read about, but also is what you really want in a heroine. Her loose tongue to the man who turns out to be her boss was hilarious. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wanted a quick, funny read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Read","review":"I loved this book. It was light, funny, and sooo could actually happen. I felt the embarassment as Emma stepped into one awkard situation after another. It all started with a simple plane ride...except it wasn't simple to Emma. She ends up thinking the plane is going to crash and rambles on and on to a strange man sitting next to her. The plane didn't crash, and she never thinks she will see the man again....wrong! He ends up being the founder of the company she works for! Now he knows all her \\"secrets\\"...all the little things she does and doesn't do at work, etc. Read to find out what happens to her job, and her relationship with this \\"stranger\\". You will enjoy it, I'm sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and sweet","review":"When Emma reveals her most intimate secrets to some guy on a plane the last thing she expects is for him to end up running the company she works for! (Although lets face it, it had to happen!)I've never read any of the Shopaholic series (gasp!) and I'm not really a fan of girly-sugary books - possibly because I don't really give them a chance, but I must admit - I really enjoyed this book!The book is well paced with some brilliant characters (Kelly and Jemima have got to be my favorites) and although the humor didn't make me laugh out loud I did smile pretty much the whole way through.The four stars instead of five are because I felt it could have been a bit funnier and it was a little predictable in parts (but this was also part of its charm!)If you're looking for a quick, sugary sweet read where you don't have to think this'll be it.I look forward to trying the Shopaholic series because, whether I like it or not, this book had me hooked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Sophie Kinsella!!!","review":"I cannot say that there is a Sophie Kinsella book that I don't love! I relate to the characters, laugh out loud and find them impossible to put down! This book was no different! I loved everything about it! My only gripe is I wish she would write faster! I cannot wait for her next books to be published so that I can love them too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"It was a very good book. It was very funny and kept my interest through until the end.

It is fun and the caracters are likeable. I only wish Sophie Kinsella had made this a series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, humorous book!","review":"This was a funny book. I love Kinsella's humor and the way she has her characters (Becky from Shopaholic, Emma from this one) look at things. I love that I can identify with them; their flaws and shortcomings, and the funny things that happen to them.In this book, I particularly enjoyed the relationship changes that took place with Emma's parents and cousin as the book progressed. Great secondary characters as well: Emma's marriage-hungry roommate was hysterical, and her best friend loyal and helpful.From a romantic-comedy angle this book was excellent. Though problems are constant with two men involved, Emma perseveres and works it out best for her in a way that keeps the reader laughing.The concept of secrets was a fun idea. We know right from the start Emma's secrets but have to wait to find out those of the man she adores.I recommend this book! It is funny, sweet, and happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The wit of shopaholic without the cringing","review":"I loved all of Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic books, so much, in fact, that I ordered some on Amazon UK to get them before they came out in the US. But I always found them extremely cringeworthy and almost hard to read, since Becky was constantly getting herself into such trouble. This book made me laugh out loud several times and charmed me as much as her previous books but I almost never winced or cringed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Fun Read By Kinsella","review":"I started with Kinsella's shopaholic series. This author is wonderful! You find yourself laughing out loud throughout.This book has that same light, silly style as the others.I hate summarizing a book & giving away the whole plot, so I won't even try. My only gripe was that Jack Harper, the American, did not sound really American. I realize the author is British, but I wished she's done her homework w/ American dialogue, as Jack sounds just like another Brit.Reading Kinsella's novels is wonderful & great way to get your mind off your own hectic life & laugh out loud at the mishaps of another. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Chick Lit Books I have Read in Years","review":"After reading the Undomestic Goddess, I had to read some more books by Sophie Kinsella. Therefore, I picked up Can You Keep a Secret. This book has to be the best chick lit I have read since Bridget Jones Diary (and, btw, I have read a lot of chick lit). Emma is an absolutely charming character that has secrets that many of us twenty and thirtysomething women share. Her main love interest, Jack, is also a total hottie!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun one to read!","review":"When I first started this book it reminded me too much of the Shopoholic series. However, after getting into it more, I realized I couldn't put it down. I loved this book and can't wait to see it on the big screen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Busted out laughing on the subway","review":"This was a good book with many funny parts. Probably because I can relate to her bad luck and poor timing. <3"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, easy read","review":"I thought this was an easy read and entertaining. I enjoyed it, liked the characters, and loved Emma! This is a fun book, great for the airplane"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Summer Read","review":"My summer reading came to a halt mid July, I was not motivated to read any book...until I came across this. The plot is very simple: Emma is an average grad trying her best to move up through the ranks of the corporate world. Her troubles are like those of many college grads; and they include family, work, love, and a crazy roommate. She stands apart from the average Jane when her secrets are blurted out to a stranger on a flight in the midst of heavy turbulence. The stranger soon turns up in her corporate world, and this places her in a horrible situation!Overally, I found this novel very light-hearted, humorous, and shallow (in a good way). No deep thinking required, which is perfect for the summer or in-between more thought provoking novels. I was reminded a lot of \\"Bridget Jones Diary\\" throughout. If you liked that, then you'll love this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beach Read","review":"I'm as much a sucker as the next gal for a good chick lit book -- and Sophie Kinsella still is tops on the list, in my humble opinion! In her latest novel, she has all the winning elements of a Bridget Jones-ish hit... a bumbling yet lovable heroine, a dashing leading man, and a comedy of errors. It's laugh-out-loud funny, with enough romance to keep you swooning. Great beach read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing read!","review":"I couldn't put this book down! Absolutely loved the characters in this book and was intrigued by the two main characters. Well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining after 54 pages","review":"I nearly chucked this book because it looked like nothing of interest was going to happen in the first 50 pages (the Nancy Pearl rule of thumb). Thankfully, it finally picked up around page 54 when Jack enters the picture. I find his character endearing, and the rest of the book offers some mindless entertainment as you follow Emma's story through her relationships, career mishaps, and peculiarities. Read this for - as I've said already - mindless entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out Loud","review":"I had to read this book two times, it was so funny! I enjoy Sophie Kinsella's work so that wasn't surprising but the way this story came together was just HILARIOUS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and Funny","review":"It's an adorably sweet light read. Obviously it isn't war and peace, but it's quite entertaining and gives you a nice feeling. Kind of Bridget Jones-y."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally overrated","review":"i would have given it two stars if i had not expected so much from this book. there is not much romance in this book,too many secondary characters,not much chemistry,no sexual tention,i skimmed through most of the book,was not able to finish it. it is a PG13 lightweight situation comedy with a little romance. i should stick to historical romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"Overall I enjoyed the book. It was funny at for most of the time and I thought the love story was original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!","review":"This was the first book I read by this author. I absolutely adored this book. And I'm looking forward to when The Undomestic Goddess comes out in paperback!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my ususal genre","review":"I usually read mystery/suspense type novels, but for some reason I decided to give this a shot. I actually really enjoyed this book. The fun, lighthearted nature of it left me feeling happy and optimistic. I was slightly frustrated at how careless Emma was at times in the book, but was also finding myself envying her for her simple, happy life. I will be incorporating more books like this into my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good read.","review":"I love Sophie's series Shopoholic and have falled for her individual novel. Can You Keep A Secret was really entertaining and almost made me go crazy at the main character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grat read","review":"Loved it. Good story. Easy read. What's not to love. I love the female characters of Sophie kinsella. I love all her books I've read so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and Fun","review":"Light and fun and not a Shopaholic clone. I enjoyed the Shopaholic books but was ready for something fresh! And Emma was fun, funny, and like some of us feel sometimes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone has secrets!","review":"I thought this book was a delightful, light, funny, quick read. I enjoyed the concept - it was different and unique. The book also had several laugh-out-loud moments. I liked the character of Emma - an ordinary girl with relatable problems with her boyfriend, family and friends - and I enjoyed watching her grow more confident in herself as the book went on. The book wasn't perfect... it does stick to the formula of chick lit books which makes the plot predictable (but enjoyable in a no-thinking-required way). I felt that the ending wasn't as strong as the rest of the book - there is a secondary plot twist at the end that is unnecessary and just makes the book last longer without adding much to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will not be disappointed","review":"Cute book. Up to par with most good chic lit. Pretty much what you expect, some very funny parts, a decent plott, and a happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny.","review":"I loved this book. I could not put it down. We were on vacation and my husband kept looking over at me when I would laugh out loud while reading.If you are looking for light summer fun reading this is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something light for a summer day","review":"Can you keep a secret? I love to read these books from time to time.Emma is the perfect character for this book. She proves truly \\"gripping\\" as she attempts to negotiate her career, friendships, family and love life. She knows what she likes and dislikes, even if she is unsure (identifiably) what she might like in the future. For the most part she's happy, until...She has a rocky flight and tells all of her secrets to a stranger, who, like the back of the book will tell you, ends up being the president of the multinational company she works for.He flips her life around and thankfully so. Up until about the fifth chapter, I felt like I was reading another version of Shopaholic (which I loved as well).Great book to read on the beach, over your lunch hour(s) or under a shade tree in your back yard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It's nothing groundbreaking, but a nice guilty pleasure. Funny that the book is titled CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET? since none of the characters in the book can! The book revolves around Emma, a woman in her mid 20s who is unlucky in life. She's finally given a chance to prove herself and get a possible promotion while on a trip overseas, but she mucks it up and goes back home. On the flight she encounters a man and she tells him every little secret that she has. Unbeknowst to her, he is her boss! Feeling so embarrassed by revealing so much, she tries to avoid him. He starts to romance her and she ends up falling for him, only to find that he's exposed all of her secrets to everyone! Mortified she shuts him out of her life, but this proves to be too hard. Overall it was a great, fun book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's nice","review":"Actually this book is pretty good. But unfurtunatelly not so good like the shopahoolics. I think the big problem was the end but nevertheless it's nice and worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute...","review":"I was so excited to read the newest book by Sophie Kinsella as I LOVE the Shopaholic series. This was not as good, but still quite enjoyable.It's fun to see how this book runs through the course of time. Why certain things happen, when they do happen and how its resolved. It's fairly predictable, but still enjoyable.Overall, I recommend if you enjoy the Shopaholic books, I don't think you'll be dissapointed as long as you're not expecting a clone of the former character."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I LIKE THE AUTHOR BUT THIS BOOK WAS BORING . . . I NEVER FINISHED IT, COULDN'T EVEN TELL YOU WHAT IT WAS ABOUT!DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chicklit?","review":"I searched amazon.com for \\"women's fiction\\" and came across the hugely popular Sophie Kinsella. I'd read a few of her books in her Madeleine Wickham-avatar, and found them delightful. I figured I couldn't possibly go wrong with such rave reviews. Oh, what a disappointment I was in for. Can You Keep a Secret falls into every stereotype women have had to contend with for the last century or more. To me, chick-lit translates into stories about real women -- women who are strong and smart. What's interesting about a caricature of incompetent women who are incomplete without a husband/boyfriend/significant-other, and can think of nothing else? I know we're better than that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Again!","review":"I loved the Shopaholic books by Sophie and I am enjoying \\"Can You Keep a Secret\\" to some degree but, since I work as an Administrative Assistant, I find the book very condescending to those in my profession. No doubt she has a good sense of humor but if you work in my field you may find the book to be insulting. I'm really tired of authors (and everyone else in the world) thinking that degrading Secretaries and Admin Assistants is a good subject for their writing. I deal with enough condescension in my everyday life, I don't need to pick up a book which I'm expecting to enjoy and then have another person hit me in the face with insults. I'm most likely done with this author because of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can You Keep a Secret?","review":"I bought paper back as i had a hard copy in Engalnd and wanted to continue reading while away... Big mistake the paper felt so horrible i didnt get to read the book until i came home..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Fun & Interesting Secert!","review":"The book is full of humor, romance, and life lessons, which is the perfect recepie for a chick lit. The book was filled with great characters that you end up falling and routhing for. \\"Can You Keep a Secert?\\", is full of fun, juicy, and delicious secerts that keeps you wanting more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Put me in a great mood!","review":"I'm not a big reader but I totally enjoyed this book start to finish! I don't think I've ever laughed out loud reading a book...until now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I thought this was a great book. It had me cracking up at so many things. The story unfolded so well and I really liked how the relationship with Jack was developed. Once Emma spilled her life secrets on the plane, I was hooked and couldn't put the book down. She was such a lovable character and Jack was intriguing as well. It was perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Fabulous Despite Rave Review","review":"I guess I had super high hopes about this book because of the plethora of rave reviews...however, the book did not live up to its reviews. Honestly, the book had a cute plot, yet it could have been told in 200 pages not nearing 400. I felt some parts of the book just dragged! Needless to say I was happy when it was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light, campy humor, and a quick read","review":"This was a cute story - predictable as it was...Very light and breezy type of feel to it. Exceptionally quick read complete with likable characters. If you are looking for some mindless enjoyment in the chick lit genre then you should give this book a try. The only problem I had with this book (aside from the predictability factor) was that the main character Emma comes off as a real idiot/airhead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty Pleasure","review":"I am a big reader, and read lots of different genres. Lately, I have found that whenever I need to veg out on my lunch break or after work, I love the silly British girl genre. This book falls nicely into this category, as do Bridget Jones and Shopaholic. I found Can you Keep a Secret to be a guilty pleasure-fun, fanciful reading. Nothing to make me think too hard! The characters are great, and I just love the premise of the man knowing all the secrets. I highly recommend this as airplane, beach or Christmas vacation reading. Enjoy yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maintained her High Standards!","review":"This book was absolutely fabulous. The character, Emma, is in some ways quite similar to Shopaholic Becky, in that they like to lie a lot. Other than that, Emma is such a funny person with the most unique personality. Well, not *that* unique - what I love most about Sophie Kinsella is that she seems to be writing about me! I did not personally relate to Emma in this book, but it was nonetheless an easy, breezy, HUMOROUS read! I hadn't finished a book in a day in a long time (not since \\"Shopaholic Takes Manhattan\\") so this one definitely brought me back to bookwormhood.I'm so glad Sophie Kinsella can write so well beyond the Shopaholic series (of which there is a new book!). I absolutely love her. She is officially my favorite author.BUY THIS BOOK. It's been weeks, and still scenes from the story are replaying themselves in my mind. I think I might want to read it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not just another bridget jones","review":"As I started this book, I thought it was another one of those \\"Bridget Jones type girl whose life is lame but gets the man anyway\\" books. In some ways, it was because she was annoyingly lame at first, but after 10 pages, she was endearing and I was really rooting for her. I even cried when she had a row with Jack! HA-I never cry at books! It was a great light and funny read. Very LOL (Laugh Out Loud). I can't wait to read the Shopaholic books now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely FABULOUS","review":"I had the pleasure of meeting the every so lovely and charming author before reading this book or any of the Shopoholic ones!

I was totally LAUGHING OUT LOUD in the subway... it was hilarious!A must read for ALL women who have had secrets and still do! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, Funny","review":"Not as good as the shopaholic series but still a fun read. I laughed out loud a times, very witty. I think the romance and how it came about was a bit farfetched. But still, a fun, enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fun vacation read","review":"I read Can You Keep a Secret in about one day, and I really enjoyed it. I found Emma to be a good character- one that I actually enjoyed more than Becky from the Shopaholic series. Becky always made me cringe because of her actions (I can't watch movies like that either), but Emma had a good, solid head on her. I laughed out loud at Emma's actions, and really empathized with her, whereas I always wanted to sit Becky down and give her a good talking to.The plot was a tad predictable, but so were all the Shopoholic books, and that didn't stop me either! I really enjoy British chic-lit (it's my guilty pleasure), and I hope that Sophie Kinsella keeps writing fun books with engaging characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinsella's Best Work!","review":"Sophie Kinsella's latest novel \\"Can You Keep A Secret?\\" relates the hysterical tale of Emma Corrigan and one plane ride that changes her entire life. After a disastious meeting in Scotland, Emma has a few to drink in the airport and on the plane. When the plane hits some turbulence and Emma thinks she is about to die, she blurts out ALL of her secrets to the man sitting next to her. She tells him absolutely everything. Come Monday morning, Emma thinks everything is A-OK until the owner of the corporation she works for shows up and is none other than the man from her flight, the one who knows all of her secrets.I adore Kinsella's work and this is definitely her best! Her writing style is witty, fun and fresh. Kinsella is a major player in the chick lit genre and I recommend that everyone give her a try (if you like chick lit). You will absolutely adore Emma and the jams she gets into!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shopaholic fan, but disappointed in this book.","review":"I have read all three of the shopaholic books, in fact I've re-read them! I'm a HUGE fan of that series! I was so looking forward to seeing what the author would do in this book. But in all honesty, I thought \\"Can You Keep A Secret?\\" was a total re-tread of the shopaholic books, except the main character is not addicted to shopping. The whole set-up, the main character's personality, the supporting characters (co-workers, sexy leading man who happens to be a corporate big-wig, room-mate), were so similar to the shopaholic books. I was really disappointed, and felt this new book was just a watered-down \\"shopaholic\\" story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confessions of a social fibber","review":"A great premise. Woman on lurching plane nervously blabs all she feels guilty about to her seatmate, a perfect stranger, only to find out later that he owns the company she works for. This book was fun and thought-provoking (honesty is the best policy, and while it would be difficult to tell a friend you don't like the gifts they give you, but Emma's fibs were out of control. I had just a minimum of trouble understanding British terminology (I'm not going to say I can't understand English!) The ending was especially cute. I was, however, let down by Jack's Big Secret, which to me wasn't any big deal.I notice that many readers who've read the Shopaholic series expressed disappointment in this book. I haven't read the series yet, but I intend to. I'm looking forward to it. From the reviews I've read I might like these even better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep a secret","review":"This is the second Sophie Kinsella book I have borrowed, and I'm hooked.

It was 23 years before I was diagnosed, and it seems women in the US have had it worse than me because doctors found out about them and started to make their lives an even worse misery. I live with dyspareunia and I have lots of sex but not intercourse. Stop being a victim, it is doctors doing this to you. Guys love BJs. You can have a great sex life.

So unimpressed in fact that I stopped using it after a couple of weeks.The device's power is so low that it constantly suffered from interference from other signals. At its best the sound quality was poor and at worst it was swamped by the local radio stations. On top of all that the battery only lasted about 3 or 4 hours. If you have to have one of these make sure you place it as close to the radio's antenna as possible. For me that meant putting it on the back seat - not very convenient!I had almost given up on these things until I saw the one from iRiver which is truly great and well worth the money.

I have a PSP Lite and I wasn't sure it would fit and but it works fine and my PSP Lite fits in as snug as a bug in a rug.It is a hard case with a leather finish which makes it perfect to toss into a bag and not have to worry about your PSP or your screen. It also folds back and works as a holder to watch movies or videos with. The case also works fine to play games with while in the case. I recommend it because of the looks, the safety, and the practicality of it. Quite a bit better and cheaper than some of the other name brand cases."},{"rating":"2","title":"great service","review":"the dvd arrived quickly and was in the exact condition stated. my mom really enjoyed her gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"The music is shallow and goes nowhere..","review":"This whole Electro-clash thing is a major fad for 2003/2004 and Keoki is jumping on the bandwagon. I fully expect his style will be radically different a few years from now unlike his past where he matured and grew with the music, now he just leaps onboard to do what others are doing in an \\"Americanized\\" way.For what it's worth, the songs are just ok. I don't feel any emotion or drive behind the mix like I have with past Keoki mixes, including his own remix work. You have to be in one of those non-emotional moods to get into this.Still, I feel it's a dead end mix.

A true testament to The Clubkids andto latter-period New Wave and Old Punk clubgoers.A must buy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clash","review":"This sounds unlike anything that I've ever heard Keoki do, and I love it! A friend of mine who has also liked Keoki for years didn't care for it too much.

It's over.","review":"When I first played this album, I thought it was kindof overdone, the sounds not blending well and the vocals too frequent and random... however, humorous at times. After listening to it I got the feeling that Keoki made this mix as sortof a tribute to some old friends... drag queens trippin' balls, tweak'd out club kids, or heroin addicted fashion models... the drug vibe is very strong. If you fit the above, and you're into electro, then goshdarnit buy this album! Don't be fooled by the poor intro, the album really pick up and reaches it's 'climax' in the middle.

Imagine my surprise when I saw this CD listed 14 years after his death. I had never heard about him doing an Elvis tribute so where had this album been? Well to my great disapointment Only the first 3 tracks are by Carl. I believe these come from the 1984 recordings he did for Rice musice that seem to have been reissued by many lables since. They are not even good quality dubs. The remaining 9 tracks are by an unknown Elvis imitator and are just plain awful! There is absolutly NO information listed in the packaging.

Frances Johnson is a very well made book. It fits in your pocket and takes serious abuse.However, Frances Johnson is a pretty quick read. The language and figures of speech didn't make me think too much, since most of it was pretty obvious. Levine does create an otherwordly atmosphere in the first two-three pages, and on page 10 you're sure she's got you sucked into a vacant pot-boiler. The pacing is masterful. Frances Johnson is a fun read, but the hype led me to believe that it was a masterpiece.It's not. Just a great read, but not demanding, like Beckett, Kafka and Duras (to respond to another reviewer).I'd highly recommend this book, however. It should appeal to a wide range of readers.Thank you,Frank Sauce"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"It's amazing how the Penthouse organization has so rapidly squandered the value of its big brand name.

Remember, this was the Edwardian era, when women were given more to fits of the vapors that to fits of passion. It's a pleasure to read along as Agnes struggles not to succumb to the mores of her time.As author Freed grew up in South Africa, her book is all the more compelling for its presumed accuracy.

I recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cleaner, great spray bottle","review":"I've tried a couple different cleaners for my black granite countertops and so far Granite Gold is by far the best. It quickly and completely removes grease and water stains and leaves my granite looking spotless. While the manufacturer does not provide an ingredients list, they claim the product is non-toxic and biodegradable, which is always welcome, and MSDS data is easily available on their site. It also seems to work passably as a cleaner for cooktops.Also, this is maybe kind of weird, but the spray bottle that Granite Gold comes in is so good I feel like I have to call it out specifically. Really nice spray bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleaner is good - Price is too high","review":"I bought this a few weeks ago and it works great.

I don't usually write reviews unless the product really makes me happy. Oddly enough, cleaning products and devices that are really affective make me happy! and this happens to be one of them. After cleaning my granite kitchen countertop with dish detergent (and then learning I should NOT do that), I went ahead and got this cleaner. It's very easy to us: Just clean the surface well with a damp sponge, then spray the cleaner on the granite, then wash off again with the damp sponge. I didn't have any left over residue; I think it because I used an actual dish sponge (very soft one) rather than paper towel that might leave marks. I came back in 5 minutes and noticed a shine that was not there before! very happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Product When Used Correctly","review":"I have used Granite Gold cleaner and polish for many years, and it gives me the best results by far on our marble and Corian countertops. Our local supermarkets carry both this cleaner and the companion products (polish, etc.) at a much lower price than here on Amazon.Please remember that after you spray and wipe, it is important to use a dry cloth or paper towel to lightly buff the countertops. This eliminates streaking and gives a nice sheen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Granite Gold Granite Gold Daily Cleaner GG0029","review":"Ok cleaner. Not totally thrilled.

However, my commute is around 90 minutes each way and the battery has died on occasion. Once every time I switched to the mp3 player it would shut down, I had to restore it and load and set options again. Now, it works in the car, through my stereo but not head phones. I get noise like an AM radio. Hopefully it will get resolved in a timely matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inno","review":"Great product. Really like having XM radio with my own playlists.

Reception is poor overall. I even tried the antenna headphones. I gave up, cancelled my subscription. If anyone interested send an email, will sell for half the going price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great System in a Small Package","review":"I really like this little Radio!! The only draw-backs are 1) there are a lot of trees at our home and I've had to learn where to place the external antena to get the best signal. We were able to hook the radio into our home stereo, so it's nice to listen to XM through out the house when wanted. Takes a little time to learn all the ins and outs of operating the programs...but great little radio in a conveniently small package!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"The Inno is great gadget that is not that expensive to buy (297.00 at Comp-u-plus.com). It has good reception(even with lots of trees in the way), the battery life is long enough (mine 6 hours of XM) The cons: really nothing, but when i first got it, it did not let me access \\"my music\\" because i had not activated it. Other than that it is money well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-hyped","review":"Works great in the car, with great reception.Also installed it at home (and connected to home stereo); good reception.However, very disappointed with \\"portability\\", as reception is marginal. Bought antenna headphones, which improve reception, but seem too bulky for the size of the unit.Overall, and if portability is a big factor for you, I think the Inno is over-hyped and is not a good value for its price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless! Poor reception ruins a could be great product","review":"I have like others been an avid XM listener since the beginning. I saw the Inno at CES in Las Vegas in January and though it was the iPod killer. Delay after delay meant my order took five months to arrive. Received it last week and have to report it is not a dispointment, but worst - useless. I could barely get reception. I live in Palo Alto, tree lined streets. This never bothered my XM Roady I use in the car, but it only brought static to the Inno. Also, after a full 8 hour charge it was flat the 2nd time I tried to use it.I reccomend avoiding until the next generation, or buy from someone you can easily make a return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly disappointed","review":"I have read many reviews of the Inno prior to my decision to purchase it. I was aware of some reception problems, but since I am in the NY Tri State area I thought it would be ok. The Inno itself is very cool - small sleek great screen and easy to use. For this I give it 2 stars. Unfortunately the reception at my home in Central NJ is awful. On my commute (bus) to NYC I could not listen to one single song with out the signal dropping out at least once and often more. Reception at home - even with the home kit was spotty and as I moved outside the signal was fine until I turned around and lost the signal completely! How is this a portable unit if that happens - especially in the Tri-State area?? The signal in NYC was excellent due to the repeaters even inside my office (my window faces south) - so if you live in NYC and will only be in NYC - I say go for it. Otherwie take a pass. I have already cancelled XM and I will return the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad, I finally have to write a review","review":"I've had XM radio in my car for about 2 years now and decided to buy this 4 months ago for in-home and outside - I've used it twice recreationally. The Inno gets TERRIBLE reception and battery life was miserable. First time I charged it up out of the box according to instructions I got 1 hour of use. Afterward during tests I was able to average about 3 hours, which isn't bad except when I compare to my 60G iPod. But battery life isn't my main gripe. If you have trees or buildings around your house/apartment you will unlikely get a signal, with or without the external antenna. I've been 99% happy with all my tech purchases (and there are lots of them) - but this one is just a bad product, so bad that I'm finally writing a review on something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mike","review":"I received this item and was enthused to get it. However that is where the fun stopped. If you want a unit that will work outside in a clear area, this is for you. It will also work inside with the base and large antanna, provided, if you can get it positioned correctly.It did not work anywere else for me. The transmitter will not work unless you get a car kit (not stated in add I saw). It did not work for me in wooded areas, or inside buildings or sheds.A word of caution. It cost me $20 (or so) to get it hooked up even though I canceled the next day.And be very carefull if you take advantage of the 3mth free offer. In that case you may have to pay much more to return the radio.THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I FELT THE NEED TO WRITE A REVIEW ON A PRODUCT."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor signal quality","review":"I had high hopes for this unit for use in both walking and to transfer use in my car. Consistent signal quality is very poor. I was surprised and disappointed to find out that unless I use it in wide open spaces, this signal cuts out frequently making it very annoying to use. Trees, building, even small ones, and any type of hills and valleys interfere with signal, causing it to cut out.Thankfully, I only signed up for one year of service. After it expires I will use the unit for only MP3 files."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think about it.","review":"This appears to be a great product, however, I haven't had mine long enough to find out. This will be the second time I have had to send it back because of a faulty FM modulator. At ~$30.00 a trip (Electronica wants it back in 7 days and the bill to send it there is on you.) any savings you might get from ordering online, is eaten up fairly quickly.If you require an FM modulator for your vehicle, I would recommend purchasing local so that you can return it without the hassle, and price."},{"rating":"1","title":"MP3 problem with INNO.","review":"I purchased the Inno last week and I have returned it for the third and final time. I downloaded songs to the unit and it showed that they were on there. I then pushed the MODE button to listen live, then pushed MODE again and the unit froze up. I took out the battery and restared it without success. I returned the unit and got a new one with the same results. I returned the second unit and thought 3 was a charm.WRONG. This time when I powered the unit up it froze on the XM symbol and would not go any further. I retured that one also. I am hoping for something better in the next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work!!","review":"We have been XM radio subscribers for over 2 years, via my car, and it's great. I thought this would be the perfect gift for my husband. I purchased it at an electronics retailer (glad I did). The first night, we got great reception in the cradle, but no signal on a stand-alone basis, after all that is why I wanted it. We returned it, since XM told me it was probably a faulty unit. I received another unit the next day, and guess what, no reception out of the cradle. I returned it, and got my full cash refund. I would not recommend this unit for anyone who expects a signal on a stand alone basis. There are a lot of cheaper alternatives than this. I would think XM borders on \\"false advertising\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dylan makes it worth the price..","review":"....but the ability to hear a very wide selection of great music, one button recording complete the package.Nice looking unit, easy to use controls and a nice set of accessories, the stock ticker function is useful for neurotic investors, I mean in case you know anyone like that.The value is subjective but in an environment that receives the signal it is hard to argue if you want the things that it offers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor support, battery problem","review":"First I should say I love the Inno unit, and the concept of a satellite radio that I can use in the home, in my car, or carry around. But I've had problems with this one. The primary problem is that, after a couple of months of mild use, the battery will no longer hold a charge. I cannot use it out of the dock. I've gotten the runaround from Pioneer about service; I cannot recommend any Pioneer products if this service experience is representative of the company. Also, although reception is better with the Inno than the dismal MyFi that preceeded it, it still needs some work. Any Inno buyer should also plan to buy the headphones to improve reception outdoors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Great item and purchase. Would be nice with a little more memory - we have ours split in 1/2, half for mp3s and half for recording off xm. We use this in our baby's room for the kid tunes and classical music - she absolutely loves this! We hook it up to external speakers and it sounds great. We have also used on the beach, when biking, etc. and never had any issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"GET YOUR MONEY BACK","review":"I bought the INNO a month ago in spite of all of the negative reviews. IT'S TERRIBLE. The battery life lasts only a few hours of playing time. When the unit is powered down it still drains the battery. I cannot use the INNO on consecutive nights without charging the battery. The reception is garbage if you live in the city/suburb. Mounting it is the only solution(Which make the \\"portable xm\\" a joke). I was also suckered into buying this because of the record feature. Although it works great, it lacks memory space. And on top of that you cant transfer the files to another device such as your computer. Computers cant read xm files. BAD ITEM, STAY AWAY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great portable XM radio and MP3 player","review":"What I really like about the INNO is that it's like a DVR for audio!! You can set up a schedule to record programming via computer or device. It's so easy to use. I also like how you can manage the the downloaded songs via computer. You can record a block of music then open up Napster and delete what songs you don't want. You can even create folders or play lists. Also the display changes from horizontal (docking station) to vertical (to go) This is an amazing player. I love it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"fatal flaw","review":"Although this unit works perfectly when turned on ... providing easy to use recording, mp3 playback, and excellent XM reception, it fails miserably when turned off. Turn it off, and it looks like it's off ... but it keeps doing something that eventually drains the battery. Pioneer technical folks told me that when the unit was not in use it was to be stored in the home docking station. How lame is that? They assured me that the unit was working perfectly. I tried to return the unit to Amazon, but it turned out to be a \\"3rd Party Sale,\\" so had to send it to the real vendor who promised to credit my card. We'll see. This unit is not ready for prime time."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's just great!","review":"I love it. Most versitile xm radio yet. I use it in my room, my car, the living room on my stereo system, at the beach on my boombox. Great for taking your worry free xm music wherever you need it.** you do need the car kit to use the FM transmitter unfortunately... However, you can just plug it into the car kit cradle and carry it like that, and the FM transmitter will still function."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be taken advantage of!","review":"This product was intentionally downgraded, so that the FM transmitter will only work if you buy the car kit. Now you can't take it to your office and use with your boombox, etc. Perhaps they think they will sell more hardware this way.However, in the days of advancing electronics we should expect better. Don't buy this product until they change it back! Don't worry, a competitor will soon improve on this situation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I purchased this product and have tried it for one week the reception when I am walking is vert erratic constantly cutting in and out. I then tried to download music from Napster to find out it does not come with Napster To Go software. This will cause to spend $.99 a song to download. Not happy with the product and have returned for a refund"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or your money","review":"I was so looking forward to many happy hours of commercial free music on the go that I couldn't wait to buy this product. I returned it the next day. WHAT AN OVER-HYPED PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!! Forget the MP3 capabilities and the set-up of the actual unit itself- yes, its tiny, brightly lit and easily navigable, but so what!!! Why are you going to buy the Inno? Because you want a portable radio, and that friends, Pioneer simply can't deliver. If you live anywhere outside of NYC or other major metro area, FORGET ABOUT GOOD RECEPTION!!! All the previous reviews were right about that. Hopefully, XM works out the kinks in the near future, whether that means a better antenna or more satellites or repeater towers going up in every town in the USA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't deliver","review":"The idea is great, but the whole deal is based on the premise you are actually going to be able to receive the signal. Unless you pay the extra $40 for the antenna headphones you can forget about listening to the Inno on headphones. When the Inno is docked, attached to the antenna and not moving it works great. I got the car kit for another $70. I get a signal about half the time in the car. Still get numerous drop outs making it impossible to actually record a song. So it's $399 for the actual Inno, $70 for the car kit, $40 for the antenna headphones, 12 month subscription to XM at $12.99 a month for another $156 plus tax (7.85 percent where I live) for a grand total of $717.20 This stinks of price gouging and XM greed."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst value for the money you spend","review":"I was really excited to buy the inno and figured that the installation would be a piece of cake. Well the sure connect has ruined it all. I cant use it in my convertable because of too many wires on the outside. Also they claim that the unit is fully portable which is not at all true. There is absolutely no live reception indoors. I just returned my unit and all I want is an XM without sure connect otherwise I am switching over to sirius"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice...","review":"I love the Inno. My first xmradio came with my car, and I liked the programming so much I wanted something for the home and office. The Inno, with it's time-warping recording capability is wonderful.Two negatives. First, I have the same problem with other headphone plugs not seating properly in the headphone jack. If it wasn't for tihs problem I'd give the Inno 5 stars. Pioneer, fix this!Second, I wonder if the reception problems people are having with the separate antenna are related to compass direction. At home I get perfect reception from my home office wheer the window faces south. At work I have an east-facing window, and have to put the antenna on the ledge outside the window. Fortunately, I have a ledge and a window that opens. Also, I had great reception in Portland, Oregon on a business trip. With the unit standalone. I wonder if Portland is one of the cities with terrestrial-based xm repeaters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Read this Review","review":"I purchased this product because I want to listen to music while I hike. While walking around, the reception is poor, as it cuts in and out constantly. Now some of you have read other reviews stating this product is worth the money, but I honestly believe those people are paid to give a good rating to this product. It does work well in the house with the antenna, and the ability to record songs and make a play-list is fun, but in regard to that function there is also a downside. You see, XM is not commercial free radio. So, your play-lists are always intertwined with commercials, or at least the tail-end of a commercial. This product is like the fountain-of-youth -a nice dream- but nothing more. Save several hundred dollars until XM and Pioneer work out the kinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I purchased the Inno after reading great reviews of it here and in several publications. But, unless I've got a particular bad unit, the build quality is awful. The headphone jack will not hold onto my Etymotic Research earphone plug, which pulls out constantly. No other electronic device that I have has this problem. I found posts on the Web from other people who have also had the headphone jack problem. Also, the on/off slide switch seems to be defective. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Finally, I was surprised at how spotty the reception is. I'm in the SF Bay Area, and this is my first XM experience. I expected that I would have great reception at my location. But the signal drops out constantly. I actually looked forward to getting this product, but I'm returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Great for 3 Months","review":"Received this Inno as a gift last year. Was thrilled with it for the first 3 months and then started to have problems with turning it on once out of the docking cradle. Followed all the recommendations that came in the booklet but nothing helped. I believe that this inno came with a defective battery so called Pioneer's customer service which gave me no suggestions and offered no help. I then sent 3 snail mails to their corporate headquarters which in return received no acknowledgement. I then emailed on their web site and received no acknowledgment. I would not recommend this unit to anyone. I believe products are only as good as their customer service and Pioneer proved to me to be the worst there is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inno + NEW FIRMWARE = Awesome product","review":"First and most important... the latest firmware update fixes the problem of the battery draining while the Inno is \\"off\\", so that issue is no longer a problem. The Inno now goes into a deeper sleep mode while turned off. One minor inconvenience is that it takes a little longer to start up after the unit has been turned off for a while. No big deal as the battery doesn't drain while the unit is off now!The Inno has all of the features I want in a music player. XM provides a lot of variety, and the record feature of the Inno ensures that I can access songs that I like whenever I want. One button song recording is a great feature. The screen presents all of the XM information clearly and concisely. Lots of variety from the XM content (recorded and live) combined with MP3 playback - what more can you ask for?In short, the Inno is a great product, and I couldn't be happier with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Item","review":"This is an incredibly cool item and I bought it for my 15 yr old son for Christmas. Works great but the battery life is short and reception indoors is limited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect!!","review":"XM radio is taking over the world.... soon everyone will be listening to their Inno while working, playing, and exercising!

It's awsome!You won't regret getting an Inno!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inno Reception Very Disappointing","review":"I bought this thinking I could listen to live Xmradio on the go. The reception would go out when I would walk around, expecially if there were trees around. I did get the FM transmitter to work in my car but the reception was very poor when driving down the road. Songs would fade in and out even when there was a clear view of the sky. Driving 70 MPH under bridges nearly always caused the signal to go out. I took the unit back to the store for a full refund.I also miss not having preset buttons. I tried to use the Favorites to move around to the channels I liked the most but it was kind of distracting.I was a former Sirius customer and switched over to XM and was extremely disappointed when I started hearing commercials after listening to music for only 10 minutes. What's the point of paying for radio if you are going to have to listen to commercials. I cancelled everything and I'm headed back to Sirius.Bottom Line: Don't buy the INNO."},{"rating":"2","title":"How long would it take to reach the end of Ben's hog?","review":"I don't know, but with an Inno / Helix at least you'll have something to listen to.

There are patches of the brilliance long-time fans of SY expect, but this album does not shape the fragments, ideas, and melodies into finished songs, or at least not bite-size ones. That was probably not their intent, and fair enough, but the result is an album only their most dedicated fans will enjoy.The best SY albums aim both low and high, at true believers and at newcomers, whereas this album is all on the 'high' side.

A friend and I listened to it all the way through, and our immediate response was disappointment. There didn't seem to be any one song that stood out in particular: Most of the songs seem to just meander, then drift away. Later, I sat down and gave my full attention to it, and I realized I was listening to one of their best albums in years. It's an album of difficult, demanding and sometimes frustrating music, with heavy (and sometimes less than successful) Beat flourishes.

Gone are the days of Thurston and Lee's amazing guitar playing, replaced with 10 minutes of jangling strings the anyone could do with a cheap, fake fender guitar...Avoid this album at all costs. I am just going to listen to classics like \\"Sister\\" and \\"Daydream Nation,\\" and remember what used to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad cd about a bad city.","review":"new york city used to be cool, yeah. if i'd gotten this album when it came out i might be saying the same thing about sonic youth!! then i might not have looked into murray st. and sonic nurse. i, um, showed up a little late so instead of toyning me off to the band it just sort of collects dust on the shelf. oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album sucks!!!","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love Sonic Youth. I used to have dreams about meeting them and telling them how awesome they are. Now I have nightmares of having to sit with them and listen to this album. What happened? Call me a little too traditional but 10 minutes of guitar feedback is not really a song. And to fill the whole album with this \\"experimental\\" style is so unfair. Sonic Youth used to write great songs that were cutting edge but still listenable. Who in their right mind can sit back and listen to this whole album straight through. This album is like that whole turntablist/dj phenomenon-- it's cool when you see it live, but on a full length album at home, its just boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic Youth and electronic, good mix, but could've had more.","review":"sonic youth is, to put it bluntly, one ov the most influential bands in my life. Their unique style ov post-punk is outstanding and will never get old. On NyC Ghost & Flowers, the experimental forsom dont' hold back. BEing forty must be tough on the ego's, but not on their muzik. Good job guys, just wish their was more on it.Ps- William S. Burroughs rocks the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappointing","review":"It seems that with this release, Sonic Youth have run out of ideas, resulting in a dull and bland collection of \\"songs\\" that seem to go nowhere. The lyrics are disappointing, too, and many of the chorus tunes are kind of cheezy. Although Lee Ranaldo's contribution is among the album's best tracks, it still fails to reach the quality of his works on Washing Machine and earlier albums like Sister. But don't get me wrong--the album isn't too bad, it's just a disappointment after waiting a few years for a new Geffen release. For die-hard fans only, this record should be avoided by those just curious about what SY sound like and looking for an introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish i could be nicer..","review":"This album does have one REALLY good song, which is the opening track, \\"FREE CITY RHYMES\\".. it's really excellent. and this album does have good lyrics. the song \\"Side2Side\\" is kind of interesting, and the title track is okay to listen to once. But mostly it's just a disc full of half-spoken poetry over uninspired music, which is disappointing. Like everyone said, thankfully MURRAY STREET and NURSE were a LOT better. but definitely check out FREE CITY RHYMES, it's actually good, i promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"You fools!!!","review":"This is a great album. Not SY sounding, but still reallly good. For those who don't kwnow it yet, this is inspired by the post-rock movement (sounds A LOT like early June of '44, an excellent band except for their last record). Who cares this is not typical Sonic Youth?!! I find it funny when people say their best album is Dirty... Dirty is good, but the production is terribly grungy, thanx to Butch Vig."},{"rating":"2","title":"mournful and misunderstood","review":"After Sonic Youth accomplished everything they could accomplish, they made A Thousand Leaves and souned miles off their game - or, four musicians phoning in their parts from different planets. The game on this one is more daring and more upsetting - I think it's a concept album of regret, one that says after it's all over, you could possibly spend the rest of yoru life wondering what if. Possibilities of defiance and desire are long gone. That's a profound take for a profound band that shot for a mood and stayed there. I think a lot of people felt frustrated by the record, but it's all part of its brilliant design - it's a dark catharsis of a record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop looking for songs","review":"Catchy songs are just that--they catch you, pull you in, then then when they are finished with you, they leave. True artistry may be found in catchy songs (see \\"Schizophrenia\\"), but look deeper and longer on NYC Ghosts & Flowers. Give this disc time, thought, and energy, and you will not be disappointed. The negative reviews are predictable--usually written soon after the disc's release, after only a handful of listens. Give this time, particularly on Lee's brilliant title track, which ranks up there with the best SY has ever recorded. Granted, Thurston's overly dramatic vocals on the coda of \\"Small Flowers Crack Concrete\\" borders on embarassing, but the remainder of the work makes up for this momentary lapse. Stop looking for rock songs and just let the noise swirl in your head. Goodbye 20th Century? Perhaps, but NCY G&F seems more like goodbye SY-RockBand--and that's a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's sonic youth","review":"It is nice to see the experimentation from the SYR sessions spilling over into fully realized albums. The first track is reminiscient of SYR1 which is a definate must-have in understanding what SY means in the denouement of the 20th century. Sister on vinyl is still the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Sound","review":"A lot have been said about Sonic Youth going back to their roots, but that's only because the band pay a tribute to New-York with \\"NYC ghosts and flower\\".People that actually listen seriously to the record will tell you that Sonic Youth explore a new sound on this record. The tunes are not so much that matter, it's the sound, the atmosphere of the whole thing. It's have such a great impact on the listener and the band have not been so creative since Daydream Nation (and it's not because they use the old 1988 guitars). Gone the post-punk days and it's much better this way since the style is well dead now. Instead, the band became more production oriented with new electronic landscapes.Sonic Youth might be more a band for experimental music lovers that also love rock than the opposite now, but the true fans will find this album amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A pitiful release by an extraordinary artist.","review":"This bait-and-switch CD contains dreadful, bizarre versions (possibly demos) of some of Juice Newton's biggest hits.

I did not enjoy the book, the way it jumped from time periods back and forth telling the various stories was confusing. You needed a list just to keep up with who all the players were. The blatant sexuality that is brought into the characters is in my opinion embarrassing, voyeuristic and not needed.

I do not feel any heat on my right hand, maybe it is because I have the 30gig drive not the 40gig. Also I don't hear the hard drive clicking like I read in previous reviews. It is fast enough to do most heavy work and multitasking and with 3 usb ports it is very expandable.The only thing that kept me from giving it a 5 was the video card.

There's alot of drama in this book but the story and plot didn't really grab me. I only finished the book to see what would become of Terri. This is Tony Lindsay's first urban street novel. I don't understand why Tony Lindsay felt the need to jump on the street \\"hood\\" books bandwagon. The writing he did in his first book was better than this.

It is a dark story about a black man turning tricks as a woman, being strung out on drugs, living in terrible conditions and stealing money from a street gang. I don't find a \\"moral in the story\\" or any other redeeming qualities to recommend it to others. It is a depressing read.None of this came out in the synopsis written on the back cover. This bit of writing gave you the impression you would be reading about a female. Not true. It talks of \\"right of passage\\" which by the way the book ends could be true.To give the author his do, the writing itself was well done but the story line was little more than what you can read in the newspapers today.

The awning gets full afternoon sun. The material itself has held up remarkably well, with less fading than I expected. The problem is the stitching that holds the whole thing together. After two years, the cotton stitching on most of the seams has rotted away. One result is that the outer metal frame has separated from the material. Needless to say, the awning is shot. Sure, you can get replacement material, but that costs nearly as much as what I paid for the awning. Seems they would spend a little more on stitching that lasts as long as the awning material. Definitely disappointed in this product, especially considering the manufacturer's claim that the product lasts up to 15 years.

The 2nd is much better, cause it brings us the real Purple. As for the concerto - the years haven't done good with it. What was an achievement for the young Jon Lord in 1970, is far from satisfy our expectations from the older Lord in 2000. Even in the late 70s he made better works.

Following every verse is a two-page explanation on how it can apply to everyday life. For instance, walking unashamed of Christ may require going against peer pressure. The commentaries are well-written, but they are very short due to the large font used. This may be good for readers with short attention spans, but I would have preferred just a bit more depth, even from a quick read.Also, I think the content is relatively simple. For teens who grew up in a religious household, there will be little new content here. I would recommend this book more for tweens or young teens, people aged from ten to fourteen. Any older and I think this book is a bit too simple.

If the Pixies reunion means the end of the Catholics, I'll show you my tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eff'n brilliant of course","review":"Those who believe they see the Mind of God in FB's endlessly creative chord and time changes, as well as his genius with rhyming patterns, will listen to this album the first few times and be disappointed. I confess I was a little. DO NOT GIVE UP! He trades in some musical inventiveness for more traditional blues, country, and folk progressions, but Frank devours them, inhabits them, becomes them, and the result is some of his most soul-satisfying songs ever. No joke. His lyrical and rhymic mastery has never been better. Wouldv'e been 5 stars except for one dog on the album (The Snake)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree, he's done better.","review":"I don't understand the mediocre (and just plain bad) Frank Black albums getting 4 1/2 stars on average either. If you're new to Frank Black, I would recommend you get all the Pixies albums first of course. Then you should get the first two Frank Black albums (self-titled, Teenager of the Year), which are really really good. Other albums of his that have several to mostly quality tracks: Pistolero, Dog in the Sand, Honeycomb, Cult of Ray (yes!), the self-titled Catholics album, and Black Letter Days. The rest don't do anything for me, including this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put your tears away","review":"I really believe that Frank Black is one of the most gifted songwriters of his generation. As well as a seemingly inexhaustible ability to produce singable melodies, he has a unique lyric style and a mastery of oddball metaphor that make his writing utterly individual. And he owns THAT voice.I loved the Pixies, but I'd be the last one to hold him back from maturing in style. The Pixies are in the past, where they belong. Let him go all country if that's what he wants. After all, he's proved he can do it: \`Chip Away Boy' for example, from last year's Black Letter Days, is a terrific song.No, what bothers me is that Show Me Your Tears is simply not good enough. The songs just aren't there, and musically he sounds like he's badly pastiching the genre.He's divorced, he's upset and I really hope he gets over it soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teenager was brilliant","review":"Just because you start doing Neil Young inspired music doesn't make it mature or creative.

During my recent trip to Singapore, someone suggested that I should read it.Well, I have done it, and to be sure i do not regret it at all.The book provides an easy to understand introduction into the various fields of biobusiness. As someone with a non-scientific background, I really appreciate the clarity of the information given.Subsequently, Gurinder Shahi gives an excellent overview about the development of the different countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Particularly interesting are his thoughts about different cultural perceptions that have to be overcome.In conclusion, I highly recommend this book to everyone interested in BioBusiness in general as well as in Asia-Pacific developments more specifically."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good fun read","review":"I first came across Dr. Shahi's interesting ideas on biobusiness when I heard him speak at a conference a few months ago. His presentation created a bit of a buzz. In subsequent discussions, several attendees strongly recommended this book.I found \\"BioBusiness in Asia\\" to be very readable and well-structured to engage the general reader even though it is clearly organized for educational use (each chapter starts with a Summary and ends with Key Points).At the same time, the book is quite original with sometimes quirky anecdotes, memorable analyses, and intriguing insights. These include, among many others, the so-called \\"BioBusiness Landscape\\" and Dr. Shahi's perspective on the \\"Innovation Development Pipeline\\".A good read for both the novice and the industry savvy, as well as those who want to understand how we might go about translating the potential of biobusiness into practical reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good and built to last","review":"This lantern costs a little more than others you may find, but it is built to last and look good for a long time.

I loved using it as a facial moisturizer, however they recently reformulated their cream and it is no longer the same. The \\"new\\" cream has added canola oil to it and the calendula extract is no longer the second ingredient, It's way down on the list now along with other added chemical ingredients that were never on the first version.

I heard this after already knowing Sinister, Tigermilk, Arab Strap, and Waitress like the back of my hand. I expected that a release of early stuff would be subpar. I couldn't have been more wrong. These early cuts stand out as much as their best work on later albums. If you like B&S, you will love this.

If you like the slightly more upbeat B&S, I also highly recommend the \\"Legal Man\\" single."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny","review":"I've had this for a while now but wanted to wait till it actually got used to review it. The basement floods during a heavy summer downpour and the downspouts get clogged. Recently all the factors converged to cause water to enter the basement. I had forgotten about the Water Alert and heard the faint beeping of the unit. After a short search, I found the source of the sound and checking the basement, found water in the floor. Quick use of the shop vac avoided any damage. My only complaint is the volume of the alarm and the fact that it will alarm for some time after the clean up, sensing the overly damp condition of the floor. You have to unplug it until the floor dries. Just remember to plug it up again. Overall, works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple enough. Seems to work.","review":"This wireless water alert system seems to do as advertised. I have not needed it in a real water overflow condition, but it seems to signal properly when dipped in water. The sump is in the basement and I keep the receiver on the main floor. The signal is fine. The alarm is not very loud, but it seems loud enough. I also purchased a local (not wireless) alarm for the basement. The 4 out of 5 rating is to indicate that someone could make a better unit, but this one seems good for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Water detector","review":"Having had a flood in our basement last fall that ruined some finishes, we wanted to have early warning if it happened again. This is a pretty simple product to set up, and I tested it with a little water in a dish. Suction cup to attach the transmitter didn't work very well, but I had a place to set it adjacent to the detection site. A flange that could take a nail or picture hook would be a good idea. Detection seems to work fine, and the receiver is in the kitchen and audible if anything happens.

While this book will have use to future historians because it illustrates Bush's current desperation to go down in history as some sort of statesman, it does nothing to show the underhanded type of businessman and politician he was. George Bush the family man should not be confused with George Bush the career politician. That type of confusion is what he tries to pull off here, and readers should be aware of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived","review":"I'm sorry, but many of the letters in this book have the appearance of being manufactured for our benefit. What kind of man writes letters to his pre-teen sons telling them about the political ramifications of Watergate? What kind of man writes post-election reflection letters to a days-old grandchild? The answer is, nobody. This book is nothing more than camouflaged memoirs disguised as a series of family letters.This screed is yet another attempt by former President Bush to refurbish his less-than-stellar political reputation. Don't take the bait! Read it for the self-serving political memoir that it is, but don't be fooled into thinking that these letters make Bush into some sort of caring statesmen. His public career has proven otherwise and speaks for itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Letters from George H Bush, a different type of book.","review":"This was interesting as it is made up of letters that will jolt your memory from various time periods through out Bush#1's life.The first Desert Storm War, when Reagan was shot etc...Then this book also has insight from behind the scenes as well.

I have a story in letters from and to my own father from the time he entered the Army in 1943 through his being wounded in France and meeting my mother in a hospital in Kansas just before the war ended in 1945. George H. W. Bush's book made me laugh and cry. It gave me a new admiration for the \\"man\\". If you love the WWII generation, read this book.

One evening I stumbled across Maya Azucena among a huge pool of other talented artists. I knew straight away that she was a standout talent: a good strong voice with plenty of soul & moxie, terrific old school sound, and just a lot of bumpin' grooves. What more could you want? So I ordered her one and only CD (apparently from 2003) and when it came I listened to little else for the next week. Naturally I was hungry for more music from this fine artist. But I can't really find any more about her online. I'm hopeful that she's been courted by a label that is growing her talent even greater. I know it's heresy to hope that an indie artist gets picked up by a major label...but the only thing missing from this CD is that little bit of magic that happens when a great talent meets a great producer. But don't get me wrong -- this is a terrific album. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Your kids will ove this book!","review":"My 10 month old son loves this book.

A vanity publishing house is where an author pays to have his own book published because no respectible publisher will touch it. It is pure amature dribble. The rosy reviews, I suspect, were written by the author or friends of the author. You can not begin to compare an author who pays to have his own book published with an excellent thriller written by the likes of DeMille or Dan Brown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swindle is right...","review":"This author and book are not comparable to DeMille and any of his books.

So much so, I've bought several copies for friends.If you have a serious illness with treatment uncertainty in your future, buy the book. It could help you prepare for more intelligent discussions with your doctor(s) and decisions better suited to your needs.If you have a middle or high school student who thinks math, statistics and probabilities are a waste of time, this book could change attitudes.Really a great book... If I could give it more than 5 stars I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Work of Great importance","review":"This is an important work. It shows how to effectively reason about probabilities and risks and how to communicate them in a way that people can understand them. Many authors document the extent of statistical innumeracy among doctors and the general public. This book shows that this innumeracy is largely the result of ineffective forms of communicating probabilities and risks. The book has important implications about the teaching of statistics and should be read by all who want to improve their teaching of the subject. This book is also important for anybody who wants to improve their reasoning."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst Oz books","review":"The plot addresses a very important Oz-historical question: what became of Ozma's father, the King of Oz whom Mombi disposed of for the Wizard when he took over Oz? His name, Pastoria, was mentioned in THE MARVELLOUS LAND OF OZ, but Baum did not say how the Wizard and Mombi got rid of him. Unfortunately, this book's answer is completely unsatisfying and makes no sense at all.Also, the side adventures are stupid (at one point Mombi makes her captors float away through the air by giving them baking powder), and the protagonists are too goofy to identify with.The narrative reads like a first draft.Ruth Plumly Thompson wrote some good Oz books but this is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"When I first opened the box, I was disappointed to see that the metal corners have 'lips' on them. One lip faces into the corner, one faces out of it. This makes it impossible to use the metal corners in the middle of a large item. They can only be used at the end, so that the lip can overlap the edge of the piece.Then tried to use it for actually clamping something. The web strap is held onto the axle that gets tightened only by a thin metal clip. That clip is easy to pull off and provides very little resistance to spinning. As such, it is very difficult to get any kind of tension on the band. Sometimes if I wrap the webbing a number of times around the axle, it holds, but usually it just slips. This makes is essentially useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not order unless your a collector.","review":"I ordered this for my son for xmas and before the day was over the propelers were broke off and the wheels.

However, her chapters on \\"soldier women\\" are greatly disappointing. She can provide positive proof of only three women who successfully disguised themselves as men and fought during the war. All other cases she presents are based entirely upon anecdotal information. Her claim that 500-1,000 women served is entirely unsubstantiated.

After reading Will Durant's '' The Story of Philosophy '' I was anxious to learn more about Voltaire. According to Gray he was not politically correct or multicultural enough to get our modern stamp of approval. So far I have read several of the ''Great Philosophers Series'' and all have been poorly written or boring. I will not purchase any more. The story of philosophy is actually very exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Have Got To Be Kidding!","review":"Having read several of the other reviews posted here on John Gray's book, \\"Voltaire\\", it is hard to find words that would enhance the chorus of denigration. This is quiet literally a \\"dumb\\" book, meaning any who read this will be struck dumb by it's intellectual vacuousness. My only additional comment would be that the editor(s) of this series failed miserably. By allowing this book to be published under the guise of representing a critical appraisal of a philospher, something the Great Philosophers series purports to be, ( I am referring, of course, to \\"critical\\" as in objective, not negative), they have called the whole series into question and cheapened the discussion of philosophy in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable, False Hatchet Job.","review":"This book has nothing to do with Voltaire, it is about the author's belief that the enlightenmant is a failed project. He also unforunately seems not to understand the definition of faith, as he routinely makes the error that one finds everywhere in the politically correct west, that science is just a form of faith itself. The author should read Sam Harris' The End of Faith and should refrain from writing books in the meantime! cheers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating historical document","review":"Thorborg gives a deeply heartfelt reading of Der Abschied, and is sensitvely accompanied - despite the acoustic limitations of the time - by a secure Concertgebouw, marred only by a brief and strange audience interjection. This performance (mine was drawn from a 4 CD set of fascinating vocal Mahler) is vital for all committed Mahlerians, not as a first recommendation, but for a fascinating insight into early performance practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEEPLY DISAPPOINTING","review":"Unusually for me, I don't have a lot to say about this. Young is a genius, and the edgy but warm support of Crazy Horse has been pushing him to some of his best live work for nearly a quarter of a century. Sadly, then, I have to say that this album is dismal.In fact it's not all bad, but it's very samey, very long drawn out, the sound is muddy even by their normal earthy standards, and most of the best songs on here have been given better live treatment elsewhere.The most telling moment is when a lone heckler shouts from the audience, \\"They all sound the same\\". Young's response is instantaneous: \\"It's all one song\\". He must have proud of this quip, which comes right near the beginning, otherwise it could easily have been edited out. But it's a strange reflection on the attitude of an extraordinary genius who was once renowned for the breadth of his creative muse.Only completists and idol-worshippers need apply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This live album, a late 90's follow-upo to Arc/Weld, doesn't have much to offer. The choice of songs, with a few exceptions, are weak, and Young and Crazy Horse often jam endlessly, but the music goes nowhere.

But, Grandpap came to the rescue and bought her a replacement doll. As a matter of fact, I bought two Grover dolls as a second granddaughter has come along.

Anyone who buys this album should have their head examined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but ridiculous!","review":"If this is the price of indiscretion, then I'd rather go without. Not only did the main characters (Alex and Miranda) exhibit equal parts of selfishness and stupidity, but the heroine's sisters, particularly Charlotte, appeared to be nothing more than Regency-period gold diggers. Aren't they supposed to be better than that? Given this need to ensure a secure life for her sisters, however, Miranda has some good reason to hunt for a titled lord to marry, but she just comes across as indecisive, dishonorable, and yes, Too Stupid To Live. Sorry, Miranda, but while giving up the man you \\"love\\" is truly difficult, doing it more than once just smacks of false martyrdom. This one will definitely be returned to the book store."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Price of Idiocy","review":"I don't usually right reviews, but I need to vent about this book. The story itself wasn't half bad, but I could not stand either Miranda or Alex. Miranda was self-centered, indecisive, and moronic. Alex was equally self-centered, indecisive and moronic. One moment he's wearing his native-american collar to show he doesn't care what others think, and the next minute he's wishing he was full white to appease Miranda.As far as I'm concerned these two suck and they probably deserve each other. I hope Charlotte and the Duke are not as thoroughly unlikeable in their story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called \\"The Price Of Selfishness!\\"","review":"One of the absolute worst books I've ever read! The main characters were both spoiled, and incredibly self centered. The minor characters were poorly developed, but equally self centered.The book starts slow and continues at that pace. I kept reading hoping that once they got to London things would get better, but they didn't.Reading this book is like having a friend in a toxic relationship. You keep wanting them to come to their senses... end it, and move on. Unfortunately the heroine decides she must have the hero... and ruins everyone in order to have what she wants. You end the book feeling sorry for everyone, and glad to reach the end. (I actually skimmed the last 20 pages or so because I no longer liked either of the main characters enough to be at all happy for them).Now I see this is going to be a trilogy with book two featuring her ruined sister...

As a longtime reader of Mark Jenkins' articles in Outside magazine i was always going to buy any book he produced. After reading this book I will continue to buy everything he writes. No other writer out there has the techinque Jenkins does. He not only makes you want to get out and go on an adventure of your own, but he lets you in on his own thoughts while he was out there. He brings the meaning of adventure, the soul of it, right to you. While he is clearly a highly talented climber he never once boasts of his accomplishments, but rather shows that adventure is there for all of us to grab. The best thing about this book; you feel as if you could phone up Jenkins, tell him an adventure you had on your mind to do and ask if he wanted to come. I bet you he would say yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good stories, but terrible reproduction and difficult format","review":"[This review applies specifically to the paperback edition.] I had not anticipated this paperback to measure 8.5\\" x 11\\". The cover art looks normal, but the inside pages have about a 2-3\\" margin all the way around the text. It is an odd, wasteful format that is cumbersome. The inside text is difficult to read. It appears light and fuzzy and not at all crisp. The letters have a halftone appearance (i.e. they are made of dots, not solid black ink.) My guess is that a previous edition was once published in a smaller format (6 x 9 perhaps) and the pages were then scanned to create this edition for print-on-demand fulfillment? Apologies to the author for this one-star rating - the two stories I read before giving up in frustration were entertaining and the writing is excellent. Sadly, your publisher has done you no favors by releasing your book in this poor quality format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Porter Cable router plunge base","review":"Great product.

After 20 seconds into the first song, Attention Mesdames Et Messieurs, you'll be hooked. I'm a huge fan of Gainsbourg, Hardy, Polnareff, Dutronc, and 60s/70s French Pop.

For all the reviews that complain about the \\"stickers falling off\\" my stickers are just fine and I have a 4 year old, a 3 year old and a 2 year old. PLUS the numbers of the bells are engraved on the bell (hard to find but it is near the base of the handle on the actual bell). If you put the numbers in order it runs \\"c to c\\" PLUS the notes are in the order of the rainbow...so the stickers are really just to get you started. Well designed toy that teaches music. We play a fun game where we close our eyes while the other guesses the note we are ringing. Enjoy the bells!"},{"rating":"2","title":"colorful","review":"Found it to be fine for a beginner.

This book fulfilled those requirements, and exceeded my expectations. The story is fascinating and compelling, and it is told in a very enjoyable and readable way.The author is an American who has lived and taught in Japan for many years. He has developed a deep understanding of Japanese culture which allows him to present this material well to an English-speaking reader.As to charges that this book promotes mythology about Morihei Ueshiba: I'm really not in a position to say for myself, not having had a chance to compare this book with other authors' work on the topic. Until I do, I will reserve judgment. In any case, I found Stevens' book to be a very worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"This book should be put in the fantasy section of any bookstore.I get terribly tired of the tales of Ueyeshiba's supernatural exploits. And sadly this book is replete with such nonsense. Seriously they should put this next to exploits of Drizzt Do'Urden or The Hulk.A more interesting book would have chronicled the development of O'Sensei's early ideas on martial arts with his later crazy views. They are quite different, and moreover it is a progression you can see in the old photographs of him at work. Specifically, you see the journey he took from more or less practical aiki-jutsu to the flowery, ineffectual sillyness he wasted the latter years of his life on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in quality of book-not the recipes","review":"I have no problem with the cookbook, the recipes are some of the best. I actually made this purchase to replace an old original copy that is falling apart. So why was I disappointed? The book I purchased was a photocopy of the original recipe book. The pages were crooked, and some of the vital information such as recipe quantities and instructions were cut-off by bad copying. My Mother also purchased a copy and it was in the same condition.

Ever since their debut, Metal Magic, Pantera have paved the way of making themselves the tuff guys of metal. With classics such as, I am the night, they show how trully heavy they are. With their latest sencless drivel. Pantera expresses how musically talented they are. Diamond Darrell uses his pantented power chords to show how good he is at the guitar. He shows how much he deserves being in the spotlight in magazines where far more superior guitarists belong. His melodic solos, that can be mastered by a five year old, outshine S.R.V. anyday. Phil, shows how tuff he is after he cut his long blond hair, when he first joined the band, and bulked up.

When my wife presented me with a copy of the 1986 novel I was immediately suspicious that this would be western pulp with no basis in history. Boy was I wrong! This novel could be sub-titled \\"The Charlie Utter Story\\". Charlie's colorful career is the vessel that carries you through this wonderful period of history; a history that's filled with comedy, tragedy, and always fascinating characters. Al Swearingen turns out to be somewhat more liberal in his sexual tastes than his HBO namesake. Handsome Dick, Bill's wife Agnes, Captain Jack, Pink Buford, the Bottle Fiend, the China Doll, the vile Boone May, and Sol Star's involvement in the great Deadwood fire could provide the basis for many new seasons of the HBO show.Pete Dexter is a genius who has taken American histoy and turned it into one of the most entertaining books that I've read in the past year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Written","review":"I have read a few of Pete Dexter's books and after having watched HBO's version of \\"Deadwood,\\" wanted to give this book a try. Let me make this perfectly clear: I do not like westerns as a genre, in film or in prose.This book strays from HBO's interpretation (or vice versa) so please go into reading this with an open mind. There will be differences if you are familiar with the HBO series. The book is a standout for several reasons, but for brevity's sake I'll keep it...brief. The story telling and language are vivid. The humor is somewhat different and did have me laughing inappropriately-loud in public places.

The timer is a great feature that will allow you to wake up with a hot cup of coffee, or have it waiting for you when dessert time rolls around. The look is sleek and nice. The coffee is...well, coffeeish. But the very best part is that you can start pouring your first cup before it is done brewing...it's got a little valve that stops the coffee from pouring onto the hotplate and making a mess. Now that's worth the price of admission, my friend! I gave it four stars because the construction is a little flimsy, but rest assured because Krups really stands behind their products.

I gave it two stars because it didn't break after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"no coffee on saturday morning!!","review":"We purchased this coffee maker with the confidence that the Krups name was worth the extra money. Our coffee maker lasted about a year and a half and then it died. No symptoms, it just would not turn on. There was nothing we could do except to be dissapointed.

This story is an expose of the corrupt and unscrupulous aspects of the newspaper publishing world and the immoral seductions of Parisian high society.Duroy begins in the poverty and squalor of a worker's tenement building where he's struggling to make a living. Through sheer determination to change his situation and make something of his life, he moves to Paris and soon finds himself in the artistic salon of a wealthy and intelligent political hostess and the home of a rich Jewish banker and newspaper owner.

Keeps the attention of my 4 and 6 year olds. They request it often and it is definitely helpful in reinforcing the things I've tried to teach them thousands of times! My one complaint is that the menu screen is excessively loud compared to the volume of the episodes. So much so that my kids complain and cover their ears.There are two episodes on the disc; car safety and pedestrian safety. This is a wonderful tool and I recommend it to any parent looking for a way to reinforce the rules to kids about keeping their seatbelts on in the car etc. and not running into traffic. My kids are very visual learners (one's autistic) so they picked up the rules pretty quick. I can remind them while we're out about what Seemore says about certain things. It takes the pressure off of me as it's Seemore reminding them and not me. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heirloom Uncommon Love","review":"Track Listings:1. In My Heart2. Talk To Me3.

I found the pictures of the women in this book somewhat silly too - this book makes it look as if pregnant women have nine months to sit around looking pretty in a bathrobe or leotard. (It even tells about how you can \\"skillfully\\" apply your makeup during pregnancy - not high on my priorities!)

There is a learning curve with using the tool because of the inverted image and the difficulty in focusing while maintaining the view of the object. Once that is overcome the optical quality falls short. A 30x eye loupe from Widget Supply was a far better investment for my purposes. You pays your money and you takes your chances.

This is not the case. It is not useful unless you can lay the microscope on a flat object, such as paper, stamps, coins, calligraphy, etc. For three-dimensional things, it is impossible to get a focus, due to the extremely thin plane of focus, and the shaking of your hands, however steady they may be. For flat objects, I would give it 5 stars, due to the extreme close-up view that it is possible to achieve. I took stars off for misleading advertising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I had hoped","review":"This wasn't as big as the one I was hoping for. It's difficult to focus on a hike.

There is a vast collection of superbly written books on the subjects of atheism and science. This is not one of them. More like a barely passable first foray into the field.If this were only one of a select few books on the subject, I'd highly recommend it. However, that is not the case. The only reason to buy this book would be if you have already been through the great ones, in which case, there's nothing new here but sub-par writing and some personal anecdotes, so why bother?Pick up a Hitchens, Dawkins, or Sagan book if you're in the market for some rational thought.

Called my Mom to ask her how the containers she had were holding up and hers also have crazed and cracked and she has also thrown some away (& she does dishes by hand yet!).

Farnsworth's discussion is more in-depth, wide-ranging, and denser than Calamari's, so I used Calamari to get principles clear and then turned to Farnsworth for elaboration.Get both if you can; otherwise get this one first.

I would read the UCC (especially 2-207) material and feel like I wasn't any better off than when I left class. I would buy instead the Emmanuel's and/or the Emmanuel Flash Cards if you want a stronger study aid. Unlike those additions, this book lacks the useful charts and acronyms that help when you're trying to remember the series of questions to ask yourself on the exam.

Another MUST-SEE book this season is Flea Market Decorating, which also focuses on decorating with such treasures. Flea Market Decorating is a bit more sophisticated than the shabby chic book, and it's fun for me to look at and read because I like to do thing my own way, and Flea Market Decorating shows me a variety of styles, whbile the shabby chic books are kind of limiting, style-wise."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am extremely disappointed in this","review":"I thought, \\"Oh good! A book showing Shabby Chic style used in homes and rooms.\\" Instead, there are lots of close-up shots of objects and very few over-all shots of rooms that let me see how this style is applied to real homes and rooms. The book just doesn't have much content once you get into it. Tight little shots of doorknobs, flowers, and other stuff do not add up to a BOOK that's worth the money.

But the Grimm truth is that this is just a fairy story about a shabby chic princess who can afford a home on the beach. My little Craftsmen bungalow is about a mile from the river...does that count? I found no inspiration here but rather an excessive use of white paint on walls, ceilings, beams, etc. Does she own stock in Sherwin Williams?

The only track that's a bit jarring is \\"I'm Insane\\", mostly because it has horns on it, which some may like. I'd say if you're a fan of 90's \\"Dinosaur Jr.\\", you'll want to dig this up.

It's not a step by step style walkthrough.

I was hoping to replace my solid, old copper dustpan that served me just fine for nearly 20 years. Though the photo on Amazon looked just like my old one, the dust pan I received does not resemble it in any way. (1) It is as thin and flimsy as aluminum foil.

Right after the battle where Raistlin fights the dark queen and Dalamar and Tanis are holding the Tower...The part where Lord Soth shows up and demands Kitara's soul...Unfortunatly, Lord Soth's actions land him in Ravneloft, and right into the lap of Count Strahd. Strahd of course, is devious enough to keep out of the direct path of the Death Knight's fury... but a lot of others aren't so lucky.Soth is dark, cold and fairly cool as he destroys anyone who stands in his way in his search to find a way out. The ending was not a surprise, but it was cool enough to not take away from the book. Worth reading, but you probably won't get a full appreciation of it if you haven't read all six of the previous Dragonlance novels..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I am a strong fan of Forgotten Realms novels and bought this Ravenloft book by mistake. I am very happy that I made that mistake because this book was great. It got me into Ravenloft and is still the best along with I, Strahd."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Declare Myself a Reborn Fantasy Fan","review":"It has been a long long time since I've read a book that captured me as this one has. And it's sequel is more of an extension of this book, rather than a new story. Lowder's writing is simply incredible, comparible to Weis and Hickman themselves! While he is a bit boorish in the depth department, he is first class in action and excitement. I could literally FEEL the awe inspiring power and hatred that must have eminated from Lord Soth. As one earlier review overlooked, Lord Soth is a damnable being, seething with hatred and pride. Of course he would throw away a chance at redemption! Did you honestly think he'd let himself be redeemed after all he had done and went through? His pride was to much, just as it was when he could have prevented the Cataclysm. I give this novel 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"information only","review":"I am a huge fan of ravenloft fantasy and soth,this is why im having trouble writing this but its the truth(mine anyway):The book though it gives a great insight into soths charecter is very poorly writen,my 3 year old sister can write a more sofistaceted plot and with much less holes(the dark keeper of the gate? please)it is completly void of all meaning and purpose... But to sum it up,if you are a soth fan you should try to read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avertable and extraneous","review":"I kind of plodded along though this one, finding it tedious as I dislike the Dragonlance setting. It gets a bit more interesting when the lead character gets to Barovia but once Strahd leaves the scene you get the feeling as in a movie when the more talented actor finnishes his cameo part and leaves the set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never judge a book by it's cover","review":"The cover art is very eye-catching, but as the title of the review says, you should never judge a book by it's cover. As usual, Mr. Lowder's use of the English language is extremely sub-standard, as is the writing in general. He also proves himself unable to expand upon someone else's work, as the main characters go completely against all previously established personalities. I love this type of novel, and have understood the characters since their first appearance in both gaming and literature, and this novel made me truly nauseous. It's flat, dry, and poorly written. There is little in the way of character development and virtually no resolution. Even the \\"gothic\\" feel Mr. Lowder tries to evoke comes off as fake, as though written by someone describing it after a single exposure. My general opinion is that this is one of the worst novels of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell was that?","review":"This book was bad. REAL bad, even for a Ravenloft novel. The \\"I, Strahd\\" novels were interesting, unique and full of intrigue: what a Ravenloft novel should be at it's best. Lowder's grip of English is tenuous in that he offers no grace or emotion in his writing. The book is desert dry and, with a few modifications, would make a perfect book for pre-teens. How the hell did Lowder get this freakin' job? Characters are underdeveloped and flat, no suspense is ever developed, it isn't \\"Gothic\\" in the least, and no interest can ever be created in the lifeless pit dug where imagintion should be. Every time I finished reading a chapter I'd think: \\"You got to be friggin' joking.\\" LOWDER CAN'T WRITE NOVELS. Period. Sorry James. Don't make this your day job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soth vs Strahd?","review":"Some parts of this book were very well done. Others left something to be desired. The encounters between Soth and Strahd were definitely the high points of the story. I anxiously awaited each one. I'm not really used to dwarves with names like \\"Azrael\\". His mannerisms and speech were a bit too human for my taste. His battle prowess on the other hand, was decidely dwarven. All in all, I'm glad I read Knight of the Black Rose."},{"rating":"2","title":"great music","review":"this album provides the best in smoothe drum&base music.

(I knew they had because of tracking numbers, but they wouldn't confirm that). They promised replacement units on 8 different occasions, sometimes even telling me it was in the mail when it wasn't. It took 3 monthes to get our replacement unit. Koss emplyees were very unhelpful, unproffesioal, and overall frustrating to work with. I will NEVER buy another product from them.

The minor errors are disturbing, the big ones are appalling. His description of the Japanese fleet deployment and order of attack at the battle of Leyte Gulf is shockingly inaccurate. The battle of Leyte Gulf is one of the most significant engagements in the history of naval warfare. The facts surrounding it were well known by the time this book was written. How could this author have gotten it so wrong? And how could his editor have let it slide? And what does that say about the credibility of all the statements and conclusions presented in this poorly written book, other than that the photographs are very nice?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial re-hash of the Pacific War","review":"This title promises much but hardly delivers. The majority (95%)of the book could be written on a computer by an amateur historian in a few days. And that's without much research! With regard to wartime China there is little beyond Tuchman's book about Stilwell. There seems to be sparse insight about American Imperialism. World War II books are popular now but they should present scholarly research or new syntheses. There are also annoying editing errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"A radical and unsuspecting take on what church is","review":"The Relevant Church is compilation of readable essays and first-hand stories of young pastors, many of whom grew weary with the churchy, compartmentalized version of church in which they were leaders. The writing is funny, even irreverent at times, and will open your eyes to how the church is changing and forming at the forefront of culture. It will definitely challenge you to rethink the confines of church like no other book has."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than a box of chocolates.","review":"Music for the ska punk fanatics and their fellow convicts and/or inmates. This candy box (AKA CD) has some delectable morsels to be sampled. My favorite is a tasty bit called Trailer Park by 3 Miniute Hero itwill stir it up better than a tornado. When you listen to the Breaker by Supermarket Allstars, Disaster by the Readymen, I am the victim (But then again Iyam what Iyam) by the Independants, 13 by Son of Sam and Skoi Days by Third Strike You will swear that the tornado dropped a Winnebago in your back yard killing that big lizard you had living back there. There are several other whistle wetting spinach eatin songs on this cd to listen to and maybe one or two gummy bear songs, you know they stick to your teeth and bother you till you can get to your toothbrush.

Boggles my mind that one reviewer complained about not being able to get all the sardine goodness out of the tin -- get a rubber spatula for goodness' sake ;) But what do I know, there's probably ergonomics to sardine tins just like everything else.This was a good match for that je ne sais quoi I've been tasting for in my sardines...

These are a single layer and I generally don't buy singles, only double layers, but thought I would give them a try. Actually, for a single layer, they are pretty good. I eat mine with a little katchup, saltine crackers and a cold beer. I can recommend them, they have a light smokey flavor and seem to be higher quality than some others.

Although these are all fruits, the effect is NOT one that leaves you smelling like \\"food.\\"This is a very artfully balanced fragrance, highly unified, in which the other elements just add a depth to the sharp/sweet fruit smell as the harmony adds to a musical composition.

It is far superior than many textbooks on the topic that have been published later. This is one of the five textbooks on special relativity cited by Steven Weinberg in his classic \\"Gravitation and Cosmology\\". The author achieves a balance between clarity and completness that is missing in many other textbooks. For instance equations for the Lorentz transformations, velocity and force transformations are given in tridimensional notation and proved in simple terms. I recommend this textbook as one of the best introductions to Special Relativity. On the other hand, the part of the book discussing general relativity is a little outdated even tough correct."},{"rating":"2","title":"General Jo writer/producer for Phunn Phactor","review":"This is a crucial book for anyone involved in the music industry today. It is insightful and progressive thinking with interviews, anecdotes, and facts to support its viewpoints. The way music business is done is changing and this book is a lighthouse of information.This Handbook for Hell is aimed at artist who are serious about advancing their status and careers in the music industry. If you are interested in doing things the old fashion way, waiting to be discovered by a record label which will take advantage of you, do not read this book.This book is for artist, songwriters, managers, label operators, and other music industry personnel who seize opportunities to maximize their chances for successful navigation through industry traps and pitfalls.The CD-ROM which comes with the book really elevates the value of the purchase and helps ease the way into a technological industry. This goes on my list of 5 best books on the music industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe me, you NEED this book!","review":"This is an amazingly truthful and humorous exploration of the psychology of the music industry! The numerous interviews of industry executives and Goldberg's own anecdotes as an ex-A&R; rep -- are strong reminders that the music business is a business after all, and that a musician has become more a commodity than an artist in the industry's eyes. This is a serious Reality Check, and will be a major kick (...)to not wait for the label-in-shining-armor to save you. And the good news is, you don't need to be saved by a label--you can DO IT YOURSELF.It gets better! The all access CD (the book comes with a CD-Rom of resources) which contains useful information, becomes a fantastic deal when you upgrade into their membership plan (very ingenious product-bundling), as the doors are open to information on industry contacts, radio station databases, etc., etc. What a goldmine!Believe me, you NEED this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book saved our band!!!","review":"Finally an honest book about today's music industry! After buying and reading too many other books promising the \\"secrets\\" to success in the music industry, I decided to take a chance and read this one mainly due to the frankness of the title \\"handbook for hell\\" which many bands playing original music can testify is the appropriate title for finding success in music. The greatest strengths of this book are the directness and honesty with which Justin points out the unfortunate truths about the industry - while providing an outline for success - even if you aren't an \\"American Idol\\". It's also easy to read and entertaining while quite instructive. This book brought new life to my band and should be required reading for any original band.A great side benefit is the accompanying disc for PC that is packed full of crucial contact info.If you wanna be a sucessful musician playing original music - get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT INSIDER INTERVIEWS","review":"Finished absorbing the book just last week and I've got to say it's some of the *best* money I've ever spent in this industry!

This book is head and shoulders above the competition. What makes this book so great is that is broken down into chapters of important aspects of the industry and most importantly each chapter contains numerous interviews from industry executives about their thoughts and experiences on the subject. Only aperson as well connected as Goldberg could have gathered and harnessed this much knowledge in one book. Just when you think this book can't get any better it has a CD Rom included with it. The CD ROM is a database of music contacts that is unparalleled. Any contact you need in the music industry is on that CD Rom. The CD ROM itself is worth $15.00. To me it was like buying the database and getting the book for free. If you can just afford to buy one book on this subject, this should be the one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zero Resistance Selling","review":"A great instructional read with practical exercises and interesting supporting stories make this an easy and worthwhile read.

I give them two stars just because they are not soooo bad, just not at quality level you would expect from a brand like Sennheiser...Check out AKG K14P (but not its sibling K12P) instead.

In my continuous search for romantic, well-written alternative fiction, Act Well Your Part was yet another let-down. The mediocre writing left me thinking I had read much smoother and detailed works online. The relationship between the boys was perhaps realistic, but highly under-developed.

The cut off cover does not reach the back... and so the honey drips out."},{"rating":"1","title":"syrup dispenser","review":"this was crap and broke within 2 weeks...i gave it as a gift and heard about it later so couldnt return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"High maintenance and leaks constantly with real maple syrup","review":"After spending this much for a syrup dispenser, you'd think it would perform well over time. I've had it now for almost a year and am looking for a new one. We used the dispenser for real Vermont maple syrup, so I can't attest to its performance with honey or artificial maple syrup. The first month or so was fine, then the leaking starts, which will then prompt you to have to dump out the syrup, clean the interior, make sure the gasket is in properly etc. and then after a week, you will have to start the process all over again. I wound up having to put the dispenser in its own saucer because of the incessant leaking. Had this cost $10 I probably wouldn't have bothered to write a review, but it is ridiculous that at this price something that is supposed to be utilitarian requires such maintenance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Honestly, I was disappointed with this dispenser. I was willing to pay the extra money to get a great dispenser. I'm a big honey lover and go through a lot of it. I had researched honey dispensers on the web, and this one came back as the top rated. Supposedly, it was guaranteed not to drip - so I decided to spend the extra money. Well, the good news is that it doesn't drip . . . from the spout. But, the bad news is that it leaks from the top of the dispenser - where the weld is. So there is always a bead of honey on the top of dispenser. And of course, since I assumed it would work well - and since it didn't start leaking until a couple weeks after I got it, I had already thrown away the packaging so I couldn't return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does it spill?","review":"This dispenser looks great and worked for about 6 months without spilling. Now it leaks despite my best efforts to clean the dispenser and keep the washer in good shape. Not worth the hassles I am afraid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"Bought this dispenser after running through a bunch of regular dispensers. All of them would leak and the springs would eventually get stuck. This one has worked flawlessly in terms of dispensing maple syrup, hot or cold. Only little annoyance is that the sealing ring inside the cap sometimes slips inside the bottle while twisting the lid on. Not a major issue though. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Syrup dispenser","review":"We had been looking for a good syrup dispenser for years and finally found this one. The seal works, it doesn't leak and the spout works great without dribbling. It is easy to take the top on and off so you can heat up the syrup in the microwave. We have been very happy with it so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant, functional, well-made product","review":"The only sweetener I use much is honey, so it is left out a lot. This is perfect for that use as it is so attractive -- but it is also functional as it makes honey easy to pour without ugly, messy drips all over the container and countertop. I also have the WMF stock pot and find they make top quality products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks","review":"This worked great a first, but after a couple washes and refills it started leaking, bad. Now there is a constant stream of honey down the front and a honey ring everywhere I set it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"This dispenser worked great initially. But most of the time, it would eventually get a little bit of honey stuck to the top, after which the honey being poured would stick to the honey on the top. No matter how much I cleaned it, the top would eventually get gunky and start dripping down the side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Hot","review":"Save your money -- this one is well below the usual Kalmbach standards. While the opening essay on the birth, life and end of Model Builder magazine and its editor is fine, the rest of book is a slew of poorly reproduced articles from old issues of the magazine itself. Too many of these reprinted pages have photos that are very dark or muddy (especially in the second half of the book), other pages are reproduced so small they're unreadable. Several reprinted articles are truncated, so you can't even read the full text of the original. There's no index, bibliography, or even a list of contents of Model Builder issues. To cap it off, there's an incredibly self-serving reprint about another magazine entirely -- Model Railroader -- that has nothing to do with Lionel: it's a complete waste of space in what is already a thin and expensive little publication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"Boring, boring, boring, snore, snore, boring, boring, snore, snore.I didn't even finish the book. I tried and tried, I promise that I did. It wasn't that the writing didn't show real talent. The book is well written, it is just boring, boring, boring. Did I mention that the book was boring? I really wanted to like the book. There were times when I thought, this isn't so bad. Finally more than a month passed and I realized that I hadn't touched the book. Usually I can't wait to get home from work to read \\"just one more chapter\\" of the book that I am reading. This didn't happen with Mail. I couldn't care less about what ended up happening with the characters. I just ended up forgetting to read it. I have had more fun waiting for my own mail to arrive."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a twit...","review":"For a first novel, it's probably semi- autobiographic. I was hoping that this book will be different. Katinka is a dim-witted and neurotic twit, deserving both Seamus and Jake. This is a sad statement of our society when we cheer for a character like that as if we feel guilty of a better life than hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Despite the review in the NY Times which prompted me to rush forward and pay hardcover bucks for a first novel by someone I'd never heard of, I'm disappointed to say that MAIL is absolutely ordinary. The characters are barely two-dimensional...the only authentic ones are an 8-year old boy and a bag of flour named Daniella.The highest compliment I can ever give a book is to wish I had written it. The sad fact is that if I had written this one, I would have wished it were better."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you haven't read Mameve Medwed...try this","review":"I loved this book a lot. So very funny and I fell in love with everyone in it! It's one of those rare books you carry around in your head and heart long after the final page, missing your friends and wondering what they're doing. I smile just thinking about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Return to Sender","review":"I have to say, after recently reading a few other titles in the genre of \\"thirtysomethings-trying-to-hold-a-career-while-searching-for-a-lifetime-partner\\" (*Bridget Jones*, *Animal Husbandry*), that *Mail* stood as the least enjoyable. Exluding the fact that the characters are flat, the book is just not written with any lyricism. I mean, I didn't expect this to ressemble Joycean prose, but even in contemporary women's novels, I guess I still expect the writing to flow. The metaphors seem contrived, as did the humor. However, I didn't regret reading this for 2 reasons: it was fun to catch the Harvard locale references and I thought the author accurately captured the true feelings of a single, smart, childing-coveting woman who babysits a precocious, fun \\"Max-type\\" kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, solid novel","review":"Mail is a solid read, a good novel, with a couple of flaws, that are easily outweighed by the novel's strengths. The story of Katinka, the frustrated writer who falls in love with her mailman, struggling with whether or not he is truly \\"right\\" for her is amusing, entertaining and engaging. Katinka and the other characters are very believable, and Mail is the kind of book that will keep you thinking about it during your day, wondering what will happen next. The plot is well-paced and unpredictable, without being completely outlandish. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, but it is amusing. My one complaint is that at times the writing seemed to be almost too careful, too buttoned up. Sometimes I wished Medwed would have just broken loose, and the book could have been funnier. Taken in its entiretly, however, this is a pleasant read, a comforing read, the literary equivalent of Mom's macaroni and cheese."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS BOOK!","review":"If you've somehow managed to miss this one, don't wait another second. MAIL is a delight, witty and wonderful from start to finish. Medwed's Katinka O'Toole is the absolute embodiment of obsessive tendencies. Everyone I've recommended this book to has LOVED it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vague and difficult to stick with.","review":"I had high hopes for this book because of the popularity of the author but I found it to be hard to follow and scattered.

I have some that are 5 or more years old and they play as good as the day I burned them. At 20 cents a disk how can you go wrong. I also always recommend to all my friends to burn at a slower speed.

Some believe it's my burner, while some think it's my software, and others say it's even the images that are defective. Please!!!My burner & software are working perfectly...never having a problem with Sony discs (or even the Meijer brand Imation).I will NEVER buy another Memorex product again.They're CD-R's are unreliable, and not worth the frustration and aggravation of losing any more of my valuable work, and memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better quality CD-Rs are out there","review":"This is my experience: I was making a few CDs and noticing that many of the songs I recorded on them, particularly those at the end of the disc, skipped and popped a lot, basically rendering the whole CD worthless.

Later I was able to score a few DVDs so I didn't have to use so many CDs, THANKFULLY. Because after I wiped my computer and went to get my music back from the Memorex CD-Rs I couldn't! Over half the discs were defective. The defective ones would only show the first folder on the disk and the other ones come up as \\"file not found\\" when I search for them in the Command line.

It took me about 10 CDs and several emails & calls to their customer service dept. to figure out their media was to blame. My firmware was up-to-date and I've never had compatibility problems before. After discussing this issue w/ friends, Memorex appears to have compatibility problems w/ some audio & recording components.

Catton and Foote wrote literature. Eicher is not in their league. Half-way through, I had read nothing new to me. Moreover, Eicher hadn't created any narrative framework for the story: nothing that indicated where we were or where we were going. Many of his sentences were awkward, labored, and overlong.

I can't imagine what she was thinking. It is difficult to connect to any of the characters, and Cooper's usually flowing and descriptive prose is jarring and disconnected. The plot is contrived and clich��d, and I finished the book with a relieved sigh because I got through it, not because I had a desire to read it again.

If the only way to secure a very expensive computer to a bicycle is with a cheap piece of (overpriced) plastic, then the computer should at least come with a short tether, so it doesn't get lost when the plastic attachment unit inevitably breaks.

As with other reviewers stories the mount was either poorly designed or cheaply made (when you outsource your manufacturing overseas you are selling the USA short and eliminating jobs). The locking tab is plastic and will eventually break, there is no disputing that fact, and it seems that Garmin ignores the problem and keeps taking our money. And unless you can DIY design/make something in your workshop you are stuck sending Garmin money for new mounts time and again. I love the Garmin GPS units but hate the bike mount. Get on the ball Garmin and design something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Edge Handle Bar Mount","review":"All in all, the handle bar mount is a solid performer.

It can only be explained by a purposeful \\"built-in-obselescence\\"-type design. Thanks GARMIN for cheating us consumers and proving your no better than any other manufacturer out there.

The bracket is basically unsatisfactory. One solution is to stick \\"Dual-Lock\\" on the back of your unit and also on the top of your stem and hold the unit on that way.

If we don't go all the way and just use better material. How much would a piece of fiberglass reinforcement costIt seems to me that the stuff ages.

The quality of the latch that holds the unit in place will break quickly. For me it was literally less then a few minutes after mounting it on my stem. It broke after taking my edge 705 on and off the mount. Absolutely a piece of junk. I will put some sticky tack on my unit to hold it place. Not going to waste anymore money on this POS by GARMIN. The quality of this item should be an embarrassment to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what it claims to be","review":"I'm pleased with the mount. It is set up to allow the user to mount the Garmin cycle computer on the handle bar or on a tube perpendicular to the handle bar, such as the handle bar stem. There is a slight angle built in to the rubber mount that allows you to choose to tip the unit slightly toward you or away from you when mounting it on a tube perpendicular to the handlebar.

I do love the book and like how it is set up where you do have to read through the book to get the whole concept. The only reason I did not give it five stars even though I loved it, the book although says toddlers (which to me is 18mnths-2yrs) it seems like it was more geared to an older child possible 4 yrs and older.

It was endless, and the conclusion to the story was so lame that I'm mad at myself for wasting the last three days reading this book. In some ways, it seems like Wesson just gave up on page 295. From 296 on it's almost if she's just going through the motions of tying up all of the loose ends. I don't recommend this book at all now that I really think about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOOKMARK THIS AUTHOR","review":"I was so impressed by Render up The Body that I went in search of this novel; hungry for more! I was not disappointed. Ms. Wesson has a unique way of writing that immediately drew me into the story and kept me there until I turned the last page of the book.I especially enjoy the fact that her characters are so diverse. There is an air of honesty about each one and their individual belief structure, ie. homosexuality, bi-racial relationships, etc. yet none of it offends the reader. You find yourself \\"cheering for the underdog\\".When I closed the book I realized that I had questioned my own beliefs concerning the death penalty and other issues faced by the characters - its about time an author made us think.Keep up the great work, I am anxiously awaiting the third novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing.","review":"Hassler's depiction of the first day at Gettysburg is a no nonsense work that pleases from the get-go. An excellent history, this book details and asserts that the engagements fought here, northeast of and through the town of Gettysburg, were the keys to the Union's victory. Most current analysts agree.This is an easily digested read. The writing style is fluid and to the point. The tactical decisions on both sides are detailed right down to the unit commanders. You sense the fear and guts of this first day of battle. An altogether worthwhile effort, this is Civil War literature you can read with gusto."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"I would not buy this product again.

In the opening straight rocker \\"Oh My\\", Phil Mogg is singing \\"Oh my, oh how the times have changed\\", and the times sure did change for UFO as guitar wizard Michael Schenker joined the band. \\"Phenomenon\\" was released back in 1974, and the album features the well known and excellent \\"Doctor, Doctor\\" (maybe UFO's biggest hit ever) and the fan favourite \\"Rock Bottom\\", the album's hardest song which I personally don't fancy that much \`cos of the quite boring chorus. Among the better tunes on this album are the beautiful semi ballad \\"Crystal Light\\" - a real highlight in UFO's long career - and the melodic and attractive \\"Too Young To Know\\". This is a classic rock album indeed, and if you want to be more familiar with hard rock from the 1970's in general this is a very good album to invest in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"I like this One!

Obviously if you were a fan back in the day then you know that this is top shelf stuff so you probably don't need anyone to remind you of how influential this was at the time. People were talking about how killer Michael Schencker was which was true but I was equally as knocked out at how well they sounded as a band as opposed to some showy guitarist fronting a band. The songs worked and they rocked. Obviously the highlight of the record is \\"Rock Bottom\\" and for my money this is the only version I want to hear as I've never been thrilled with the endless noodling I've heard in various live versions. I realize other UFO fans might disagree but in any case you cannot go wrong with buying this record. I would suggest this above all other UFO studio albums (not that they are bad) because this is so good and captures the classic lineup so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be one of the better albums of all times","review":"I am only 17 years old and I can't explain how good this album actually is.

Florida","review":"Padgett Powell weaves an imaginative South that's as rich as Lady Baltimore cake. Losers and drunkards compete for the attentions of women with big hair and bigger secrets. Powell seems to know them all, and he hints at something darker and more mysterious in the American character, but with a quirky, hysterical style that can take a reader's breath away, and leave him jealous of a writer with so much natural talent. Even his weakest stories are better than almost anyone's else strongest ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern-fried Beckett Take 2","review":"I enjoyed reading Powell's first collection of short stories entitled \\"Typical\\" and looked forward to reading this one, once I got the chance.Powell has a really great ear for the way people speak, but more to the point, he can really get inside the minds of the down-and-out, somewhat crazy men and women he portrays. The 3 linked stories grouped under the title \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" are reminiscent of many of Samuel Beckett's works. (I thought most of \\"Molloy\\" and \\"Malone Dies.\\") He also has shadings of Flann O'Brien, who is quoted as the Frontispiece to this volume.For me a hallmark of really great writing is that I find myself reading it aloud, and I was vocalizing muchos veces during this read. The writing can go from downright hilarious to heart-rendingly poignant to deeply troubling with ease. A very great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbound","review":"From the first sentence, this author's words grab you like you were sitting next to him listening to him tell a story. I've read his Close Pursuit and Deadly Force but hadn't read any of his other books until this one. Now I know I'll get anything he writes. The different characters are developed clearly and the story never loses continuity, which a lot of authors have a problem with when dealing with several plot lines. Only problem is the loss of sleep, being unable to stop reading and put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I read this book many years ago and wanted to add it to my kindle collection.

Mr. Stroud has always excelled at writing books heavy with atmosphere and he does a beautiful job here as well. At forst the reader is following what seems to be two different story lines but both are very well done and one never becomes bored with either one. Eventually they come together in a way I found to be very satisfying. This is a book about honor, faithfulness, blood ties, and redemption. It's also a very intruiging mystery which keep one guessing almost to the end. The police procedure is believable and the action sequences are beautiful. Mr. Stroud also excells at giving the reader detailed descriptions on even the most minor characters so the reader feels like he has known them for years. Unlike so many of the police procedure thrillers this one takes a slighty different trail and does a great job. Read it. I really think you won't be disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pricing and Revenue Optimization","review":"This is an excellent book and should be in every pricing professionals library.

I skimmed the first sections after reading a few pages of that, and then got to the 2 week meal plan and the portion sizes for each day and have since made my own Excel Spreadsheet to keep track of what I am eating during the different meals.

The book is in every sense unappealing, with bad typography, irritating language and a feeling of having been thrown together with no thought or effort.

I thought it would be good for STAINED GLASS. The pictures are so small, 3-3/8 X 4-7/8, that they will all have to be enlarged to be able to be used for stained glass, even for sun catchers.I would think a ruler or a coin in the photo or some other size reference would have yielded 5 stars.

It's unbelievably disappointing that christian politicians of this great country are considered as extreme right wing and they also don't mind speaking in racist-like tone.

This is the wrong kind of book to be written at point in our common humanity when there is so much misunderstanding between cultures in the world. The erosion of \\"the moral\\" by what the author describes as a conspiratorial humanist movement is not only a concern of the West. This theme is echoed in all cultures where it's customs and traditions are being undermined by outside influences. However the finger pointing, half truths simply enhances the misunderstanding and can be a source of inflamatory behaviour by one race against another. And what's even more scary; he believes that he is right!!! selecting quotes and ideas suitable for his racist and bigotted bent! Glad that American continues to sideline these extremists. They don't have a place in the \\"new world\\" decent minded people have been trying to built for decades."},{"rating":"1","title":"loosely put together though seemingly well thought out","review":"Buchanan points out issues, nationally and internationally, that impact the rest of America. But the perspective that he's coming from is politically short-sighted not because he's racist but because his refusal to understand complex issues. To understand American issues on a multi-faceted front requires a sensible response, or at least a well-thought out response. Buchanan refuses to think. Rather, he jumps to a defensive that weakly defines what America is supposed to be. Buchanan's attack on pluralism and American ideals, while at the same time, advocates a stance that is neither Republican nor Democrat. He undermines the need that American politics must foster in this great country of ours. Buchanan's radicalism does nothing to challenge the real deep-seated issues in this country. It just supports the xenophobia that Americans have inherited and been crippled from. I encourage everyone to see \\"The Fog of War\\", by Errol Morris."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pat Buchanan's Death of the West.","review":"Election 2000 Presidential Canidate Pat Buchanan's bestseller _The Death of the West_ is a great introduction to the cultural problems that Western Civilization faces, and where it is headed if things continue as they are--to extinction. I can't really comment on this book too much without repeating the basic statements of the multitude of other reviewers who are more well-read and intelligent than myself. I disliked the constant references to the Confederacy and the Papacy as being off task. However, it is an informative read about the destruction of Christianity and the collective-suicide of those of European descent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chicken Little!","review":"There have always been people who decry current trends, which they see as bringing on disaster. This would include attitudes towards the Irish coming to America in the 19th century, eastern Europeans in the early 20th century, the end of effective medical care in the US when Medicare was developed 40 years ago, the end of movies in the 1950s, and so on. In spite of all the protestations, America is still the guiding light of the world, offering its people a better life and more opportunity than anywhere else on earth, and life only gets better in spite of the efforts of some to move it in another direction. Read Gregg Easterbrooks THE PROGRESS PARADOX for a more realistic look at America and the direction in which we are going."},{"rating":"1","title":"He came to Hampden Sydney","review":"Pat Buchanan did a lecture at my school promoting this book, and I attended with great interest. This is an odd book because it doesnt lead you to any great conclusion. So in 10 years there will be twice as many Muslims as Christians, and 3 times as many hispanics as whites (not accurate to the book). Basically Buchanan uses numbers to generate fear in the reader. White christians are better than everyone else so instead of integrating with other cultures we should do everything possible to stop these other cultures from having numerical dominance. The book leaves the reader wondering, where has buchanan been for the past 3o years? The book also leaves the reader wondering what action we should take. Should we nuke the muslims? castrate the catalonians? The only good point Buchanan makes is that immigrants are not \\"americanized\\" like they used to be. Instead of polarizing different cultures, we should find ways to better integrate and get along."},{"rating":"1","title":"why we study history","review":"The book is remarkably well written. I read the book with the expectation of disagreeing with what the author was saying, but found him surprisingly convincing. However, I did notice several flaws in the authors logic. First he is of the impression that we study history to develope a sense of nationalism and instill pride in Americans. I however have always been of the impression that we study history so we don't repeat the same mistakes our anscestors did. Maybe both who know, but he seems to think we should whitewash American history. A point I disagree with him on. Secondly he portrays immigrants, Mexicans in particular, as hateful to Americans and full of their own national pride without pointing out that this part is only a small proportion of the ones that immigrate to America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking backwards","review":"Patrick Buchanan is so far out of touch.

Pat is just tryig to turn everyone racist by pointing out minor problems in American society. What Pat Buchanan and his cohorts don't understand is that WE AS IN ALL OF US, ARE ALL AMERICANS. This is America as we know it today. It's time to put behind racial and secular divide. That's what has made America the greatest country in the world especially in the last 20 years.

I have to think he intentionally chose 50 years as the time span for the fall of western civilization because he knows he won't be around any longer and therefore won't have to face the fact that he's dead wrong... again. The conclusions in this book are so far-fetched, so alarmist, and so downright ridiculous that they are far to numerous to address here. The book can be summed up like this: If you are an extremely conservative (socially, religiously, and politically) white Christian who thinks the world is falling apart and that the End of Days is near, you'll undoubtedly agree with everything Buchanan has to say. Everyone else will recognize this book for the utter nonsense that it is and therefore need not bother themselves with reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 Stars","review":"Pat Buchanan and his misguided followers are America's arch-rivals.

Basically, Pat has used code words to implicate this. It doesn't fool me. Nor will it fool anyone else. This country will stand behind immigration forever...for the forgotten history of this land that only immigrants made it themselves. For we forget the American Indians who are the REAL AMERICANS.Those of my white race have forgotten such history and choose to skip it. For it is the ignorance of mankind to act in an unfair and unjust manner toward those who look different than he.There is NO religious war here. No cultural battle. And no race quarrel.

It's not a prediction of the future...it's happening right now!We don't have to wait fifty years, to see if he's right...the writing's on the wall, if we'll only see.Mr. Buchanan has been called a hate monger, a rascist, and a bigot. But, of course that's not true. Name calling is always from those who have no real argument, and don't want to face the truth.

Declining birth rates and immigration trends certainly will carry social impacts, however, no one can convincingly predict what those specific implications will be. Even less convincing are his solutions. If indeed western civilization is on the brink, then increasing tax deductions for children, passing laws against legal immigration and conducing a national history bee are highly simplistic reactions to complex realities.

There is no culture or religious wars. And neither are their going to be. So all you people out there aching for violence and race wars start punching the ground...maybe you'll dig a hole deep enough where we can't see you any more.

Our culture and politics would be more hispanic-oriented, and rightly so.

Look at the condition of your average Native American or Native Australian Aborigine family. And Pat has the nerve to talk about the \\"dying\\" WASP American or how European culture is supposedly in danger of extinction.Not only are his claims exaggerated, Buchanan misses the main point at hand: this immigration explosion in western nations is a backlash and a result of European colonialist expansion.

What he advocates is \\"white supremacy\\", preferably with the Bible raised high up over your head. Instead of making an effort to ease integration into the nation and upgrade the status of being an American, he engages in the usual trivia about Communists, illegals (hey, let's throw out the native Americans as well while we are at it).

Mr. Buchanan's grasp on history, art and the humanities is beyond impressive; it is astounding.I am sure the knee-jerk liberal crowd will be the first to criticize this book; they will also be the last to take an honest look at what it says. For this book, unlike any I have read in a decade, clearly documents the roots of modern day liberalism and the dreadful effects on the entire world.Not only is this a solid and well-documented book, it reads very well.

For example how many of us would agree that birth control, the sixties, integration, lack of certain history courses, immigration, etc. has lead to the downfall(death) of the west?

Buchanan paints a false picture of a America that has never existed. He seems to forget the genocide of the Native American populations and the forced servitude of Africans.This book left me feeling so dirty, that I truly had to take a shower after I'd finished it.

Rage because these people threaten the security of all Americans, no matter their color."},{"rating":"1","title":"a conservative perspective on contemporary issues","review":"Although Buchanan confronts topics such as immigration, he does not fully explain the why's and how's of such conditions. Buchanan has not explored the background of topics such as immigration, etc. Buchanan refuses to write about countless minorities and ethnic groups that have made the United States a better place. Because Buchanan chooses to focus on a negative perspective about issues like immigration, his motive for writing this book comes into question. In a time where America needs to unite in times of crisis, Buchanan does not remedy nor answer questions regarding social problems within America itself. Buchanan misses the point that diversity is what makes our country so versatile. What Buchanan does is create an anxiety for the average American when writing this book. What Buchanan needs to write about is the resilience in a diverse America."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Death of the West: Global Corporations happy to help","review":"This publication doesn't actually deserve any stars.

It saddens me that people actually like this sorry excuse for an intellectual. He is a threat to everything that is sacred to free people. This book ... uses facts to backup ludicrous conclusions. To those who think this guy is a savior-USE YOUR HEAD. He wants to see a country united under one culture, and those who don't aspire to that culture will be punished.

Pat Buchanan claims to be some kind of Christian...yet he himself knows...he's the biggest anti-Christ ever. He doesn't follow Christianity. He doesn't follow any religion at all. All it appears that he follows is (forgive me but it's true) Hitler. I thought we defeated Nazism and those kind of Socialistic ideas long ago.

The fact that such a nation is possibel is something every human being should be proud of.The problem of death of the west stems soley,in my opinion, from cultural problems of modern times.At any rate, Buchanan has broght this problem to the attention of millions and thus given them a good start at solving it."},{"rating":"2","title":"America is being invaded!","review":"People can call Buchanan a bigot all they want but he speaks the truth and is 100% correct!

Also unfortunately (considering Pat's preference for white babies), he seems unable to do what the Irish are so famous for: that is, breed indiscriminately. (I have the sinking feeling that he and his wife have never consummated their marriage.) So, let's load Pat and his fellow members of the Irish Catholic beltway mafia (Bill O'Reilly, Chris Matthews, Maureen Dowd, Michael Kelly, Peggy Noonan, Tim Russert) onto a sailing ship with plenty of potatoes and whiskey, and send them and their un-American papist traditions back to the \\"Emerald Isle\\" ASAP. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird book","review":"This is a strange book.

It sure is, but it isn't a new phenomenon: this started many centuries back. He calls the indigeneous population uncivilized and writes as though white people had sprouted out of this very land. No one can call America their home unless they are indigeneous to it and his logic is flawed. History has seen populations grow and shrink and grow over time.

Buchanan believes that anything that is not white and Christian is uncivilized. Well, he hates Mexicans, and they are Christian.Furthermore, Buchanan is not willing to admit the fact that Asians have a higher education level and income that whites in the US.

His explanations for how \\"we\\" got here from a God-faring country to a God-fearing country is also quite intriguing. If you're anti-religious, this book might be irritating. If you're religious, it may be depressing. He also takes on political correctness, racism, the family, and the denigration of American heros and values by \\"intellectuals who've built careers on the shakedown of America\\". This is one book I'll read again...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The answer to the behavior of the Left today","review":"Death of the west provides some very surprizing - and alarming - answers to explain most of the modern American Left's sometimes surprizing behaviour hidden behind aparently \\"noble\\" liberal values.

It is amazing how America has been brainwashed by the media and the socialist elite.

His premises are valid and his conclusions are sound and it's full of some Pat's best, from both heartfelt speeches and comentary--it is vintage Pat Buchanan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and Thought Provoking","review":"This is a fantastic book, well written, with wonderful characters and a slowly unfolding story that challenges you to determine the truth. Maggie, the main character, is a flawed, big hearted, loyal woman whom I loved from the beginning. She is pushed to confront doubts about Father Jack, her employer and friend of 18 years, and the man she credits with saving her life, as he is charged with child sexual abuse and murder. The gathering speed of the runnaway train of public opinion that turns the reputation of a priest against his own interests is facinating. This book is never pat or easy, but very engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing - Too Many Holes in the Story","review":"As far as I am concerned, the author dropped the ball on this story. It catches your attention in the beginning, even though I question the accuracy of some of the legal and prison settings and situations. However, this agonizing battle that Maggie goes through becomes boring and overdone. Her friendship, though the author would like us to believe that it ran deep, did not cover the concept that she actually trusted the person she supposedly loved, even though she kept reassuring us that she did trust. There are wonderful moments in the book, but frankly it ended rather flat. It could have been much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Looking","review":"This book is extremely long on what, but strangely short on how.

She was bored with the long drawn out reading, I had to make up my own short version for her.

She loved Pat the Bunny, so I felt this would also be a fun read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"This book unfortunately became useless pretty quickly. There is a scene where Daddy takes money from the ATM and puts it in his wallet- the slots in the book are prone to rip quickly (as in, as soon as we used it) and the money is a loose piece of cardstock that will not hold up and will wander away from the book. Your child will also pretend to write a shopping list with a card stock pencil on a string. The design is frustrating and prone to the string getting tangled between pages and ripping the book. Over all, the design is impractical and not durable. My kids love Pat the Bunny and cats and are truly not very destructive as far as books go. Secondly, the story line of Ned, Martha and Columbus the cat does not roll off one's tongue quite as well as the original did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for young readers","review":"My wife and I hate this book and just threw it away. First, if you're familiar with Pat the Bunny, this is the continuation if that \\"franchise\\" from the originator's daughter. It's very cheesy and \\"modern,\\" with activities like \\"help daddy go the ATM machine and take out money.\\" The big problem is that, unlike the original, there are removable parts of the book, and these will get gnawed to oblivion by the average child in the age range intended. Not sure why they didn't see that was going to be a problem. That said my 1-year-old daughter really liked this book, but Pat the Bunny is far superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooray for Hollywood","review":"This recording adapts the original 1939 original well. the Viking Opera Guide calls this cast recording the typical edition of all stage versions.

I think I spent the first half of this book with a grin on my face just because I was so excited about how good it was! The characters are well developed, likable people and the story is well crafted and flows smoothly. There were times that I was shouting \\"Kiss her already!\\" or \\"Take her to bed!\\". Clearly I do not have the patience that Jay does. After waiting so long for them to get together I honestly wouldn't have minded a little more detail in that area, and Dez's truck changes color somewhere in the middle of the book; these are the only two, very minor criticisms that I have concerning this novel.

After reading this book I realized I was not alone with my symptoms. The book is very comforting and has loads of resources and information on the virus as well as support groups.

A real \\"Conversations With George\\" book might have some Harry Trumanesque wit and bite to it, I'd love to sit down with him over a beer and hear him trash Yale, but this mental enema, written by Bush's Edgar Bergen, Karen Hughes (who quotes her own speeches endlessly), takes everything human out of what minuscule life story Bush has had. Imagine an entire book written in the style of a memo from the head of your company's HR department, and you have this waste of trees. The thing is, Bush isn't just announcing a new way for the HMO to screw you; he's dealt with real issues, like executing people, and on the evidence of this book he did it with all the human concern and feeling of an upperclassmen torturing a pledge.

He explains his journey and most of his philosophies for his positions enunciated during his campaign for the presidency in 1999 and 2000. His religious beliefs are manifest in this book, an obvious byproduct of his reassessment after trouble wit the law.

Hughs has managed only to conclusively prove that George W. Bush is nothing more than an empty suit living off his daddy's name. To the already converted, though, this does not matter, and they still line up to support Bush's quixotic quest for the presidency.This is a book for the gullible.

As a student, this book made me reflect on my own life, looking within myself regarding spirituality, family and the kind of impact I want to have in the future. Governor Bush's stance on various political issues, such as education, are elaborated upon.

Our hero is a wuss, his life is pathetic, and everyone around him is despicable. However, at the end of the book, he is still a wuss, his life still pathetic, those around him are still wretched, and two completely unimportant characters shack up and throw a housewarming party.In fact, the suicide-on-page-400 would have been the highlight of this book. I did not get that pleasure.This is Seinfeld in print. Which I find equally un-funny and pointless.My apologies, Mr. Wilcox.

I was curious as to what they would have him do too. All they have you do is put a blanket over your head and pull it off to creat a static charge. Does not work all that well.

I looked at solar powered fans, but their cost was too high. I was happy to find the exact make and model of my previous attic fan offered through Amazon.com, so I ordered it and couldn't be happier. This fan is well built, reasonably quiet and comes with a factory-set adjustable thermostat (switches on at 100 degrees and off at 85 degrees). The thermostat box includes a push-to-test switch. The fan comes with clear instructions and a five-year warranty against any defects due to workmanship, parts or mechanical failure. Best of all, it's made in the USA.

Unfortunately, it hums and has a minor vibration., even with replacement motor and blade. I had to isolate the steel mounting tabs between two pieces of medium firmness packing foam, and then mount it with plywood over the foam, screwing it to the studs through the plywood making sure that the screws didn't touch the fan's mounting tabs. It is barely quiet enough so we are able to be in the master bathroom and bedroom that is below the fan.It is sad that, with all of the technology we have, we cannot make a motor that doesn't hum and a a blade that is balanced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither Reliable, nor quiet nor easy to service.","review":"The thermostat control on mine failed after a few months. I replaced it with another brand of thermostat rather than make two trips to its difficult location and wait for Lomanco to rule on my warranty claim.I had to use strips of tire sidewall to mount this fan to get rid of the vibration it imparted to the house.It is also meant to be serviced only from the inside. If your fan is in a difficult location, it might be easier to remove the louver vent from the outside to get at the fan, but the motor fan assembly is removable only from the inside. This, of course, depends on your attic design, but s0ome attics are so full of trusses that access is a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cover to cover, it is the best.","review":"I personally have not read the book, but living with Valerie and Laurie for about 6 years has shown me so much.

So grab a copy and start learning.(John Machulski - Cover Designer)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wishful Thinking","review":"I was really hoping to find some great information and insight into unschooling with this book. What I found was one woman's narrow-minded opinions about parenting. The foundation for her strong opinions appears to be a traumatic childhood, a few 1970's books on unschooling, and the experience of raising her only child.She is extreme and harsh in her judgments. Nothing stated in this book is backed by any sort of data. If you actually look up her daughter online, you will find a woman who is unsure about her radical upbringing. The daughter does not view the experience with the same nostalgia and romance as her mother.Needless to say, I think this book was a disaster. If you are looking for a very extreme viewpoint on unschooling presented as one woman's memoir, than this is the book for you. If you are looking for some genuine insight and information on unschooling, I would look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smug parenting","review":"I read this book expecting to love it -- I am beginning to unschool my daughter, and I'm eager to hear about other people's experiences. I also agree with most of the author's parenting philosophy, and believe that her daughter turned out to be a wonderful, happy person. Yet the tone of this book is annoyingly self-righteous and strangely narrow-minded. There is no room in the author's view for the validity of other parents' choices for their children; in her opinion, if they persue more traditional paths of raising kids, they are just plain wrong. I was disappointed. The book is also unfortunately poorly edited, with many basic grammatical errors. I am still all for the philosophy behind Ms. Fitzenreiter's book, but I wish it had been written with a more open-minded spirit and more skillfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I'd hoped","review":"We have been \\"unschooling\\" since birth- not radically, but very child led. I was disappointed in the broad generalizations made by this author seemingly based on her expierience with her one female child. Having 4 children, 2 boys and 2 girls- I just don't see her particular method of unschooling working for every child or all families. It seemed to me that nearly each chapter had some sweeping statement about \\"all children\\" \\"we parents\\" etc. I'm glad it worked out so well for her and her girl- but I'd love to see her take my 3rd child- a boy and have it work out just the same. She seems to not recognize that all children are different and while her radical unschooling and unparenting worked for her- it is not as one sided as she presents it to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only book I have ever thrown in the trash","review":"We are an AP family, homeschoolers, with a definite leaning toward unschooling. I expected to love this book, and yet it ended up going in the trash because I couldn't even bear to pass it on to someone else. The author practically has her judgment of anyone who does things differently than she did dripping from the pages. All I could think of as I read it was \\"Well, sure you can do that if you only have one child.\\" The moment you enter a sibling into that environment you have chaos. I think it's absolutely wonderful the author was able to raise her daughter the way she did. I would have appreciated it better if I hadn't felt that she feels very superior to anyone who does otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Every Parent","review":"I have read and reread this book. I loan it to friends and give it as gifts. This book describes how parenting should be. How we should live with our children, not waiting for what they might become. Enjoying every moment in life. This is a great example of peaceful parenting, respecting children for the individuals they are. With the goal to support that individual watching their life unfold in front of your eyes. Every child should be treated with the same respect, trust and dignity as Valerie's child. What a wonderful testament to the parent child bond. What that bond should be.

Ecce Homo changed that. The man who writes in Ecce Homo is a sincere and spiritual human being who bears no ill will toward anyone--rather his conflict is against ideas and he wages war on them without taking the hammer to their creators (Schopenhauer, Wagner, Christ). To truly understand Nietzsche as a human being rather than a collection of ideas I recommend reading Ecce Homo first... and also perhaps last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I bought this book because I know that Nietzsche is considered one of the most important philosophers of all times and wanted to learn something about him. I tried before to read \\"Thus Spake Zarathustra\\" but it was very hard to understand anything, so I decided to buy his autobiography in the hope of finally learning something.The book is hard to read, his ideas are not clear, but at least the book is thin so you can read it fast (one day is enough). Thanks god (oh, I forgot he is dead!)! I would not read it to the end if it were thicker.The conclusion is: if you are not an expert in philosophy or had not attended to many lectures explaining Nietzsche, do not waste your time reading this book.

The movie is free on YouTube. This baby food product contains the FDA approved amount of mercury, which is in the tuna oil ingredient, in this baby food product. You may not be aware, BUT, mercury never leaves the body, unless you remove it by means of medical treatment removal; look that method up as well.

I think that the plot is drawn out so much that it makes the reading frustrating. She seems to give a large part of the story to characters that are inconsequential to the plot. Although, the plot is a bit dark (childhood trauma) you are hooked right away. But the interest may fade with all of the added stories. I found myself skimming pages looking for the real plot to pickup again. If you have a lot of time and patience this is the book for you. For those of us that have little patience and much less time, it is an exasperating read and I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motivating, and a pleasure to read, plus great recipes.","review":"It's true that the information in the book is not groundbreaking, but it was encouraging, and practical, and reinforced all the things I've been telling myself to do but not really doing.

A recent study out of Harvard Medical School says that the number ONE thing to do to prevent chronic illness is to control one's weight and not remain overweight. This ranked over even such vices as smoking and drinking.

Since it's just salt by itself, you need to:1) make sure your face is wet when you use it or2) add it to a face washBe careful for little cuts you might have because the salt will make it sting a bit. I gave this 4 stars because I used it up pretty quickly (washing my face with it once a day), and it was kind of expensive for the amount that you get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great exfoliator","review":"I loved these salts...they help wounds/rashes heal and after a scrub your face has a shine.

For the money, it's the best upgrade I ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Work of Genius","review":"This experimental novel crackles and sizzles with intelligence and sardonic wit. As others here have pointed out, each chapter is a self-contained or modular unit, a complete short story. The shadowy figure of Wylie aka Tom Hanna flickers in and out of these chapters. You're never sure what lies or mayhem will follow. The prose style is hallucinatory. As someone else said, it torques up reality to an intensity that renders even the most banal act in poetic terms, while the sporadic violence is mind-numbingly intense and intimate.I can't understand why this book is currently out of print. It is a towering literary achievement, one of the greatest novels of modern times. If you're ready for a blizzard of dizzying language, a breakneck narrative drive and the intricacies of a kaliedoscopic novelistic form, then you too will love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but not engaging","review":"Stephen Wright shows a respectable command of the English language here but ultimately this book did not engage me.

It's like a twisted CSI TV show with one liners that make you think Jerry Bruckheimer should pick up the movie. I could see David Duchovny playing the main character.Basic plot is about this guy named Nick Polchak who they call \\"The Bug Man\\" because the guy basically knows more about bugs than anyone. It is almost as if he knows what they are thinking and can hear them talking.Packed with action and some thought-provoking clues and evidence which is mind boggling at times, Shoofly Pie is the latest book to hit my top ten list. The last one was Tim Brown's DaVinci Code if that tells you anything.If for no other reason, get the book cause it's got one of the coolest book covers out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent forensic mystery novel suitable for teens and above","review":"While no one describes a tomato patch quite like Grisham, no one describes necrophilic-feasting insects chowing down on a decomposing body quite like Downs. I picked this novel up in the bargain bin at my local Kroger store for about $8 and it's probably the best $8 I've ever spent. I was pleasantly surprised with the deft at which Downs crafted this mystery/thriller since it was his first fiction novel. I knew nothing about Downs when I picked it up. But once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. I went straight from it to Chop Shop and now have Plague Maker on pre order. Every bit as compelling as Grisham's early work and paced very much like a Dan Brown novel but unnoticeably void of any sex or foul language. I say unnoticeably because it absolutely does not detract from the suspense in any way and makes it a great novel to share with your teen reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"The title says it all","review":"I enjoyed the book immensely to the point my husband would beg me to turnthe side-table lamp off well after midnight when I was still reading on awork night.

He is venal, craven, and ruthless -- and utterly oblivious to all of this. As he rockets up the Washington journalistic career ladder, he genuinely seems not to know that he is crushing everyone -- family, friends, wives, mentors -- he crosses paths with. For this alone, Sladder is a character worth discovering. His characterization was the strongest part of the book.It is also interesting to see how Sladder moved up the ranks of punditry, following a career path that rings relatively close to the truth. I did find it a shame, however, that Frank chose to portray Sladder's increasingly conservative views as a sign of his repugnance -- a bit of bias the author does not defend, and that the book did not require."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely fabulous","review":"I loved this book and raced through it in two short sittings. Hilarious and wistful at the same time, Frank has near perfect pitch. Frank has E.L. Doctorow's gift for story-telling (the writing in The Columnist reminded me at times of Billy Bathgate) and Theodore Dreiser's talent for writing about raw ambition. Frank's day job as an editor at the New Yorker shines through - there is not a wasted word here. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wickedly funny","review":"I found Jeffrey Frank's portrait of a political columnist and all-round cad to be both dead-on accurate and wickedly funny. Having lived in Washington for many years, I can vouch for the book's accuracy. What's even better is Frank's adroit juggling act. Hardly a page went by that I did not laugh out loud. And yet in the end, I truly felt for this rotter and the hash he's made of his life. That's a trick few writers can pull off. Frank does it masterfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"COLUMNIST IS A TUNE WITH ONE NOTE -SOUR!","review":"Page after page in this very short book presents a modern Sammy Glick as a columnist.Not an original idea .Everyone knows that Washington journalists became entertainers in the Reagan era ...So they earn ten times as much by entertaining the masses with pure 100% nonsense.Describing that from the inside would have made a smashing book .

I'm looking forward to seeing what Joy brings to the third trimester workout. I also like that the workouts aren't too long or too short.

It was all I could do to bring myself to finish it. The only order imposed on this tangle of reflections appears to have been a seasonal one; the book opens in spring and ends in winter. Otherwise, it is too long, too heavily reliant on adjectives, and highly repetitious. In particular, all the author's sniffing, arranging, and swooning over her roses began to make me wish the Japanese beetles would win. I do think that gardens are difficult to write about, but Ackerman's descriptions proliferate like an invasive plant---purple loosestrife, perhaps.

She's a wonderful combination of poet, naturalist and gardener. An inspiring book, a sheer delight on every page."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a book for gardeners","review":"I have seldom come across such an amalgamation of misinformation, silliness and self-absorption as this writing contains. There is no cohesiveness, no order, no continuity even from one sentence to another. The book is filled with inappropriate, clumsy analogies and cliches; frankly, the writing is lousy. Apparently, the author believes that the reader will be fascinated by her perceptions of the world around her no matter how banal, maudlin and inane.

It's filled with creative gardening ideas I would never have thought of (even though I've been gardening for decades), but it's mainly a book about our relationship with nature, as well as many other things. It reminds me a lot of her A Natural History of the Senses, because it's fascinating, thoughtful, poetic, and practical all at the same. A gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a smaller vehicle","review":"This is a great cargo bag.

We put some grippy shelf liner under it, and added a couple of our own rachet straps to really hold it down, and it didn't make a sound.

I found it excessively wordy, repetitive, and prone to grandiose statements about Astrofit's place in the general scheme of things. The diet, for which they consulted a NASA dietician, is atrocious. Though Evans claims it is \\"high protein\\", it is really 60% carb, 20% protein, and 20% fat. He then claims that weight loss on low carb diets is mostly water (I'd like him to explain that to my sister who has lost 102 lbs since January on the Perricone Diet). Well, maybe when you're lifting weights you should eat tons of simple carbohydrates and sugar - far be it for me to argue with a DOCTOR.

I particularly like their remake of \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\", which uses electric guitar, piano, and some new, creative 12-bar improvs. And yet some tunes are redone very similar to the way you might have heard the Stones perform it.If you feel like checking out other tribute albums, I also enjoyed: Tribute to Fleetwood Mac (with Elton John, Matchbox 20, Cranberries, Jewel, Goo Goo Dolls), Subdivisions: A Tribute to Rush, & Tribute to Moby."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"1\\" because I couldn't give this thing the \\"0\\" it deserves","review":"Save your money, folks; THIS IS NOT THE ROLLING STONES!

Yet there are few who come right out and point to the obvious inequities in our tax laws. John Fox has written a clear, forthright, non-polemical analysis of what deserves questioning and change. His book makes one wonder at the emperor's-clothes denial we have employed in not seeing the obvious. Using clear, concise, examples he outlines the oddities of our tax laws putting them into language that our political candidates can understand if we bring it to their attention.

The plot was choppy, the characters unrealistic, the grammar confusing, and the thesis anti-religion. I did not find it intellectually stimulating due to the author's obviously overt efforts to bend his readers to a certain point of view through awkward conversations between his characters and through character developments throughout the plot. Such conversations and such developments would not take place in real life the way the author depicts them in his book. The ultimate problem is that his book becomes an awkward cross between a theological essay and a fictional novel - leaving the reader confused as to whether he or she should be trying to enjoy the plot or trying to seriously consider the thesis. And where were the editors?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Da Vinci-wannabe?","review":"I picked this up after reading Dan Brown's \\"Angels and Demons\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", and thought this book would be in the same vein. While it does cover a Vatican cover-up of significant proportions, the execution of the book was poor, at best. Rather than turning pages, I found that I had to force myself to continue reading.The characters seem either cardboard or unlikely. For instance, a cop who suddenly turns himself into a professor of philosophy/religion. The sudden re-emergence of the KGB (which I thought died out when the Soviet Union dissolved, and was now called something like the CIS...?) A priest with shrapnel in his brain, who understandably does not wish to make any sudden moves who rides bumpy snowmobiles, springs to his feet, drops to the floor, etc, etc. Also a mystery \\"American\\" whose identity is painfully obvious almost right from the start.I cannot honestly say that I would recommend this book, and will probably shy away from this author's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"facts, what facts?","review":"This is a great premise, and the Sophia plot is convincingly presented, as far as it goes. Sadly, Perdue wants to be Thomas Gifford (The Assissini) without the homework. The number of errors in church history (not cover-up sort of stuff, just plain and simple goofs) is staggering. If you don't care about someone (mis)taking the real info and making a good yarn out of it, this is a fairly zippy read. If you want conspiracy based on good research, read Gifford."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP TRICK","review":"This is virtually the SAME book sold by Perdue under the title The Linz Testament. I have seen books where the cover states \\"previously published under the title 'blah-blah'\\" which is, at least, forthcoming - but not here. Since The Daughter of God contained no such declaration, I felt hoodwinked and taken advantage of - and robbed. Perdue renamed the main characters and added some new paragraphs, but most of the book is literally a xerox of the earlier publication. I've lost respect for this author. With each duplicate royalty he should feel ashamed. It's OK to get on the DaVinci bandwagon, but not by trying to scam us in this way. Be up front about republishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is EXACTLY the same as The Linz Testament","review":"by another publisher!!!! I read this book and then bought The Linz Testament.

Also almost every character in the book is eventually dead, sometimes after speaking just a few words. Besides you will find a lot of unrealistic escapes.

There are not a lot of books of this kind, so I recommend it to everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I got This as a present","review":"A good friend of mine gave me this book for my birthday and I enjoyed it thoroughly and am planning to take a look at some of this author's other works.It worked for me as a thriller and it also worked to make me think about religion and faith.But most intriguing were the discussions between Zoe and Thalia where they talk about the concept of God gradually changed to a male-dominated deity. One of the most striking parts is the discussion of how the changeover from a hunter-gatherer culture to agriculture may have have been the cause. And ironically, women basically invented agriculture and caused the Goddess' downfall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"[...] I was very disappointed. Although I can appreciate the author's imagination and ideas, he is just not a good enough writer to turn his ideas into interesting reading. \\"Daughter of God\\" started with a great premise which promised an exciting thriller but the writing was just terrible, the situations were ridiculous, the characters were wooden, and the cliches were many.

Unfortunately it isn't. The writer gets so caught up in giving unnecessary details that the reader is tempted to skim read to get through it. Do we really need over 15 different descriptions of what it looks like when someone's head is blown off? Of what it looks and smells like when someone is gutted by a knife or Uzi while still alive?

Z Sweet uses Erythritol mixed with a bit of Stevia (though there is NO licorice aftertaste at all). Erythritol seems to have all the same advantages as Xylitol, but has fewer side effects. The taste is nearly identical - though I prefer the Z Sweet combo.

This problem may be seem is minor, but for a new programmer this is a great problem. This is because when we save our file with the .java, what appear in the screen is another name. For example if the programmer save the file as MyFile.java, the name that appears in the screen is MyFi~1.jav, so he will compile it with \\"javac MyFi~1.jav\\" because this is file that show in the screen. In this section, I think the way that presented by the book \\"Teach yourself JAVA in 21 days\\" is better. I hope that the authors can take note about it and have a great improvement in the next book. Finally I would like to say this is a good book but a perfect one !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!","review":"This is by far the BEST Java book I've seen to date. The material is presented well, and the examples make sense. The authors clearly define all aspects of the JDK 1.1. Usually books of this size have a huge reference section that takes up most of the book. Not this one! Its everything you will ever need in a Java book, whether you're just starting out, or coming from another language and want to get started quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK if you're new to Java, but even then there's better books","review":"I hate to be contradictory to the general flow of reviews, but I thought this book sucked. Perhaps it was the setting I used the book in (3rd year university transition-to-java course), but I had previously read the explanation of Object Orentation in Core Java and found that to be substantially better. I found the treatment of several areas to be rather superficial - too light to get the job done.

I was especially happy with the book because it had more than the fundamentals (which you can get from just about any Java book).

What is funny to me about Dilbert is how he preceives and reacts to the disturbing intrusions of insanity into the workplace. Now there is no sanity left anywhere. Scott Adams appears to think that every person on the planet is too dumb to remember to breathe. . . .and that it is sooo funny to just now discover it. If you think that imagining that every single person who has a job is one of the leads in \\"Dumb and Dumber,\\" then you might like this, then again, maybe not. He seems to be quite taken with his own brilliance in seeing just how far beneath him all humanity is.This book is like a conversation with the most caustic egotist you've ever met.

Adams accuses everyone of having manipulative intentions. But Adams doesn't feel the need to prove anything. In truth, Adams is the one with the manipulative intentions. These tactics are the same tactics Joe McCarthy used in the 1950's when he accused everyone of being a communist. Baseless accusations, that play on people's fears of being called a 'Communist'. If you do read this book, substitute the word 'Communist', or 'Witch', or any negative label used in history, for the word 'Weasel'.This book is an endless litany of name calling and mean-spirited humor.

We either have the same old saws about management cleverly called \\"Management Weasels\\" as if it were new insights or what comes down to prose versions of the strips.

The result of forbidding people to use certain letters of the alphabet is catastrophic; it results in physical punishment, exile, the breakup of families and loss of property -- even death.Yet this novel is also a creative and entertaining read, uplifting and, in places, humorous.

I was also amazed at the author's ability to write from several character perspectives and genders. My question as I was reading was \\"Do men really think like this?\\" However, I definitely believe there was an element of realness in the book. The Womanizer's will have you flipping the pages; I'm glad the author decided to allow some of the men to have redeeming qualities.

Sad to say that women like her do indeed exist. I was proud of Max in the end even though I never understood why. Dwayne could have done a better job at digging deeper in to Max's reasoning. I guess it's safe to say that a near death experience could change who you are. Shay was one of the stronger characters... She was proof that even strength can't defy love.

Almost all doctors and nutritionists will agree that once a week is ideal for weigh-ins, and more frequency can cause obsessive behavior.This book is only for the strong-willed reader who is intellegent enough to pick and choose miss Ehrlich's methods. Many individuals with addictive tendencies, such as those targeted by this book, could find themselves in a spiral of bad behaviors and obsessions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Very helpful, well written book.

Nothing worked. A friend mentioned a book that dealt with losing weight through a behavioral approach. Needless to say, I HAD to read this. The book of course was Conquer Your Food Addiction. As you read it, you realize how sensible Caryl Ehrlich's program is. It's clear to follow, and by the end of the book, you're eat differently, and the best part, you're thinner. It really worked!

It made sense, I followed it - fairly easy to do. In a reasonably short time, I went from 203 1/2 pounds to 191 1/2 pounds, where I've leveled out.The reason the program was easy to follow was that it made logical sense to me, and it didn't seem constraining. The book also didn't nag, or make false promises.I had not focused on weight before, but the 12 pounds makes a noticeable difference to me - I am glad I came across the book. Highly recommended -"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many unhealthy tips!","review":"I read this book, and although it is \\"helpful\\" in some ways, I found a lot of the information in there to be a bit obsessive.

Speaking as someone who has had anorexia for the last 15 years, I'd have to say that this book doesn't so much teach one to conquer their food addiction as it does teach one to become obsessed with avoiding food. I can't believe some of the things it suggests you do...

Both Volume I and Volume II are necessary additions to ANY university library. It is THE book to read for any and all people whose personal or professional lives deal with Korea or Koreans. Reading both volumes is a task, but there is something for everyone in this work, even if you just skip around. It is supported by heavy use of primary documentation and the sources are well cited. There are simply no sources on Korean history, society and politcs that do better (and more) than this work. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tattered Thesis","review":"Cumings is called a 'revisionist' historian. Well, as all history is revision, the label means little. It's better to say simply that in this book Cumings is wrong. His thesis about the beginnings of the Korean War - that it was a civil war started by the South - has been stripped bare for all to see since the destruction of the USSR and the subsequent opening of her archives. They show how South Korea was the victim of an international Communist hit squad organized by Kim Il Sung, Mao and Stalin.

I came to this album expecting it to be good and it far surpassed my expectations. There are a few new songs but on a whole this is a live album that has a worship \\"feel\\" to it. Third day took some of their more worshipful songs, recorded them live, and threw in a few extra worship songs. The album reminds me of how great it is to go to a Third Day concert and experience the audience participation. If I have any complaints about the album they are: 1) the crowd was not mixed in at a very high level - it is hard to hear the audience singing with Third Day, 2) they didn't include \\"praise song\\" - which I obviously wish they would have done. Still this is an excellent album. Third Day continues to get better and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome album!","review":"I am an avid music listener (mostly rock) and this is a great album! I didn't really think I'd be able to really \\"rock out\\" to a Christian worship album, but this one is different. It has the quintescential Third Day rock and beat, and I can blast it in my car and have a great ride home from work! Every song is good and if I had the chance, I'd buy this one again. If you like Third Day, you'll definitely love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worship","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite worship albums. I have enjoyed it from the first time I ever put it in the Cd player. The guys in Third day can really rock, and on this album they mix the rocking energy into a well captured worship service. Their cover of Bob Dylan's \\"saved\\" is more than worth the price of the album by itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Worship CD!","review":"Third Day has put together an awesome compilation of new and classic songs in \\"Offerings\\". It's Third Day's best cd yet. Containes live versions of \\"Your Love, Oh Lord\\", \\"My Hope Is You\\", \\"Thief\\", and \\"Love Song\\". This is heartfelt praise and worship, and it will become one of your favorite cd's. I guarantee it.

However, this album emerges near the top.Quite frankly, I find just about every song on this recording to be memorable. My personal favorites are \\"All the Heavens\\" and \\"Love Song,\\" which wrap things up admirably.The live nature of several of the tracks are great, as we experience some of the beauty of a Third Day concert. (I saw them in concert years ago and found that experience to be much better than any of their other recordings besides this one.)Third Day chose songs for this worship album with great spiritual depth, outstanding musical diversity, and great technical skill. And Mac Powell's voice is fantastic, as always.If I could only choose one worship album for my collection, this one would certainly be in the running!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"much better than Offerings II","review":"My first exposure to a Third Day album was Offerings II. I had heard some of their songs before and liked them, so I jumped at the chance to listen. Though I saw signs of greatness in that album, I was left quite disappointed. How could a band with such obvious passion be putting me to sleep?Fortunately, I decided to give them one more chance with Offerings. Am I ever glad I did! This collection captures Third Day's southern rock sound with edge, energy and enthusiasm. The slower, more pensive type songs that drained the life out of Offerings II are still there, but in a proportion that simply adds depth to this album. There's something to be said for balance.No denying that these guys are passionate about what they are doing, and gifted at it. If this is what Third Day is really like, consider me converted.Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory"},{"rating":"2","title":"What you've come to expect from Third Day","review":"This worship album is a mix of familiar Third Day songs (mostly live and somewhat slowed down), and new songs. The album gives a good snapshot of what a Third Day show is like, as several of the live tracks contain pre- and post-song comments from Mac Powell. If you are already a Third Day fan, buy this album, you won't be disappointed. If you don't know much about Third Day, and are looking for a band who is as good live as in the studio, buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Action...","review":"If you like Third Day....even if you don't like em and love praising God then you will love this album.

The songs on this album is great, many classics for example \\"Your Love Oh Lord\\" and the best song from them \\"Consuming Fire\\", which was the first song they ever played as a band, and they do it pretty well. Some songs, they did not write for example \\"These Thousand Hills\\", but played it very well. Mac Powell's voice is piercing, powerful and pure. The music is rock driven, since they are from the south, yet we can still worship along. Overall great worship at its best, Third Day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"phenominal","review":"All the reviews on this are right, this is a great cd, one that every Christian should have in his/her collection.Mac Powell's voice is raspy, in a great kind of way :).

It draws out the souls in search of something meaningful in life and this will raise your spirit to the sky. Hey ..it's better than the \\" woe is me \\" music that seems to be popular with the young folks ...get into something positive and listen to this CD and all of Third Days recordings !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glorious","review":"This is a wonderful collection of worship music. The lyrics and vocals are superb and the feeling that the music generates is deep and intense. I think the music truly glorifies God and Jesus Christ, not the musicians. The utter dependence we have on the grace and mercy of God comes out in every song and the peace and joy in finding that grace and mercy is palpable. Worship music is best used as an expression of one's actual experience and feelings toward God. If it encourages one to seek God more earnestly that's good too. Good worship music can be relied on to help us in these areas and to fail miserably when used as a canned attempt to produce good feelings as a substitute for a genuine encounter with God. This is very good worship music."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Increadible Album!","review":"Third Day is quite possibly the best Christian rock band that is around today. I have not heard a band that can express their faith with such a passionte way without coming across as chessy or threatening. These guys are as serious about making good music as they are about lifting up the name of Jesus. They do this in the most powerful and spiritual sense without the typical \\"Jesus Rocks, Dude!\\" menality of some new bands. I have many non-Chistian friends that have expressed interest in hearing more from Third Day and found their CDs to be great witnessing tools. Offerings is an amazing album. You will find yourself wanting to lift your hands in praise as you listen. There are a couple of new songs, live tracks and good covers including \\"Saved\\" by Bob Dylan. The highlight of the CD is a live version of Consuming Fire that will blow you away! If you are a Third Day fan, this is a must have! If you ever get a chance to catch these guys life, don't miss it.

In prose that is often beautiful, she evokes the intimacy and the struggle that exist between the females of the family, and shows how the generations learn to tolerate what they cannot love in each other. What's especially astonishing is that Manning is able so often to accomplish her purpose with gentle humor--the book keeps you smiling from cover to cover, even when it's describing difficult passages in life. I recommend it unconditionally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this one!","review":"I found this book to be very enjoyable. The relationship between a mother and daughter is extremely complex and changes through out ones life. She handles each stage masterfully addressing what is going on with each member of this union. Her style, humor, and knowledge make this easy to read. She uses real life examples that makes her descriptions to flow easily.

Erickson is a skilled writer, but he is no Pynchon or DeLillo, at least not yet. This book is clever, and vastly ambitious, both in its subject and in its shear temporal scope . . . but it's often over-written and un-focused, with a self-conscious significance that feels forced and unnecessary. Erickson's writing is often provocative and daring, but just as often it's pretentious and obtuse; the characters are intriguing, but the story is so aloof from them that it remains unmoving. Erickson's constructed a good novel, but it's nowhere near as good as some people say it is. He's a promising writer, and you should read this book to see what he's up to -- but wait for the paperback version first.

Learning to slide on the balls of your feet then drop your heels at the end takes a little practice, but it's not horribly difficult, and this is a very versatile form of exercise. I don't recommend it for beginners, however, because most people skip any instructional segments, and some of the moves in this DVD (sliding bridge, for instance) are all but guaranteed to result in injury if you're not wise. If you're experienced enough to know how to protect yourself, though, this program works nearly every muscle group and is adaptable to nearly any level. Even fairly advanced excercisers will find the pushup variations a challenge, and the control required really works your core.

Actually, it's quite alright - you won't be swinging glowsticks like mad, but you won't go unhappy either. DJ Eddie-X spins out a great blend of New York-style lounge and Miami-style house. Most of the CD is satisfyingly groovy and delectably light at the same time. The first volume is a bit more vocal and swingey, highlighted by \\"We Come to Party\\" and \\"Can You Handle It\\". The second half is deeper, darker, sexier, packs more bass, and overflows with Eddie's South Beach decadence.

It looks as though they downloaded the translation of the story without adjusting for changes in format or checking for errors. Shame on them. Although this particular novel is difficult to find in an English edition, do not waste your money. Let us put an end to cheap publishers demeaning good works. Do not purchase this version--search for another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book! New 2009 Edition!","review":"We were appalled by many of the editions of this book currently on Amazon because of the poor editing, layout, and design. Our company reedited this Jules Verne classic, with a new cover, and page design, and added 90 vintage illustrations from the original 1873 edition. When the book was published and placed on Amazon in 2009, Amazon automatically attached to it several older reviews from other publishers' editions. These reviews do not accurately describe this new edition. Look at the dates the reviews were written, if they are dated before 2009 they are not describing this edition of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent orphan book","review":"I read this book in Spanish when I was a child. It is one of my favorite books by Verne. It is as captivating as 20,000 leagues under the sea, journey to the center of the earth, and other books by Verne. I was surprised to see that there was no English version when I looked for one two years ago! I highly recommend it to people from all ages. Briefly, it is the story of two children who travel all around the world looking for his missing father. Throughout their journey they are many times on the brink of losing their lives, from being hunted by a giant condor, to sharing with a jaguar a sole tree set afire by an electric bolt in the Argentinian pampas. This book will become very popular among English speakers very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good grouping vocabluary","review":"The ESL Miscellany groups words, phrases, and idioms by topics such as cooking, transportation, hotels, restaurants, medicine and health, etc. All together, there are sixty different topics. About six years ago--I was in graduate school; that's how I remember--there was a discussion on this list centering around the question, \\"If you could take just five books..., what would they be?\\" The ESL Miscellany rated very high on the list. My Vietnamese students who are studying to become beauticians find the vocabulary (classified under barber and beautician) very useful. I would recommend this book for those learners who need good book on vocabulary groupped by category."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended for Those Interested in the Future","review":"I attended a lecture the author gave summarizing his book. If you're interested in globalization, the environment, or any other global problems, I highly recommend reading this book.

A mix with little bass, little clarity and no dynamics. It looks like the only way anyone will be able to fully enjoy this music from now on is if they can find an old vinyl copy. As other reviewers have pointed out, Sony didn't even bother to put much effort into the liner notes - nope, just cranking out another McCD for the masses. Very sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"DARING MUSICAL WORK","review":"Caravanserai is a daring album even by Santana's high standard.This album was not Rock nor Salsa; but Jazz-Rock and simply very adventurous to any musician even for someone with the musical popularity like Santana.Full of heartfelt, introspective guitar solos, yet very different from the previous albums, Santana or Abraxas.In my humble opinion, this is one of the finest accomplishment for this great artist.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made In China","review":"Wrench appears to function ok.

Oh author how I resent thee.Believe you me, dear reader, you DO NOT want to waste your money on this crime against publishing, why? you ask. Here is why:- The author seems to have saved his knowledge of the underlying technology for a better occasion. He did not deem us worthy of it on this book.- All chapters are incredibly superficial.- Claims \\"complete annotation of 802.16 specification\\". Need I say that is, er, not true?- You can get --for free!-- documents on the web from the WiMax forum with more details and depth about the issue at hand.Being a non-engineer is not an excuse to waste your money this way.This is one of those cases when you end up frustrated because Amazon does not allow to give a book ZERO stars.That makes me even more bitter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handbook???","review":"This book calls itself \\"handbook\\".

Just like the author's other WiMAX book (WiMAX in 50 pages), it is more of a WiMAX forum whitepaper rather than a thorough and well-thought out presentation on WiMAX.If you are a non-technical person that wants to read a one-sided & biased view of what WiMAX is, this is the book for you.If you would like a detailed technical discussion on WiMAX that is objective and discusses the strengths and weakness of the technology, then you may look elsewhere.Also, WiMAX is still evolving and a book published in 2005 is hopelessly outdated in 4 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing book","review":"I have the same opinion as jose-r.s. this book is terrible.

When I see this publisher I just skip."},{"rating":"2","title":"The way things are going...","review":"I work in investments and I found this book very helpful in uderstanding what the buzz about WiMAX is. If you start to see it as a lever toward new technologies like IPTV and mobile VoIP and data giving service providers the triple and quadruple play, then you start to see how WiMAX is \\"da bomb\\".This book really helped me understand more than frequency plans and adaptive antennas. The second half of this book goes into the implications of the technology which is really what I bought the book for in the first place. Ergo, it gets my 5-star rating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best NES game made","review":"Back in my day, I played this game more than all others combined. It never has been a well known game and I never understood why. While the graphics are dated and admittedly primitive by today's standards, it's a solid adventure. It has a \\"Lord of the rings\\" / \`middle ages' feel and put into a side-scrolling format. The entire game is fought with edged weapons and magic powers. Your character receives protection with a shield and suit of armor. As the quest progresses, you'll need to purchase better / more powerful equipment.My only complaint is with how difficult it is to resume your game. The string of code has both upper and lower case letters, as well as numbers. If even one character in the string is off . . . you're screwed.This and Zelda are basically the great-granddaddy's of all your modern fantasy games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Tom Savini is a genius.

The clip that keeps it on the rim of the cup/glass/beaker/etc. isn't strong enough and the cable's weight made it tilt to the side such that only 60-70% of the coil was immersed. Apparently that was enough to kill it. Also it isn't fully immersible which means that it only heats the top surface of the liquid--frequent stirring is required otherwise because convection currents cannot be established.

Ian Anderson on the flute,the piano in the live gig, are real highlights of this albumn. It combines the best of rock, classical and Jazz into one co-hesive musical experience.The recording, the creativity of the music and strength of lyrics, the clarity of the recording is still just as fresh as I recall, and for me, reminds me why Jethro Tull was one of the greatest bands of its time.

But, I've never had a smooth paper feed since I got the printer. It's not a calibration issue, it seems to not know when paper is in, when it should feed it, and it grabs at the paper so quickly that crooked prints are inevitible.I wish I could write a good rec for this printer, but it's a high maintenance beauty not worth the frustration.

Although GBS was in fact married and Stella a widow, the magnetic pull that kept these two spirits together is clear when reading their letters. Both were successful on their own in their craft, but the witty, razor-sharp and yet somehow romatic exchanges between the two are second to none. These letters make the reader wonder just what else was happening between GBS and Stella when they did meet face to face and make you wish that they had both said to hell with convention and ran away together.

How I Learned to Drive deals with a taboo topic in literature and in most of society - familial sexual abuse.

As the story unfolds, the readers find themselves flopping between one character and the other. You're never really sure who is abusing who.The Mineola Twins is a very fine social satire of alternate lifestyles and obsession with power. The quirkiness of the characters and some of the absurd situations provide an extremely insightful and amusing view on Boomerism and society's interest in appearances.Both plays are great reads - especially when taken in this one-two punch of a book.

Benefit is where Ian Anderson finally discovered his \\"voice\\". This is a personal favorite of mine; the songwriting is wondrous, the album's production values are advanced, especially for 1970, the combinbation of Martin Barre's Les Paul crunch with Ian's acoustic strumming makes for a delightful contrast. Also, the flute arrangements fit nicely within the fabric of the songs, moreso than with previous releases.

Soon after, I added \\"Stand Up\\" to my collection. \\"Benefit\\" is more straight ahead Rock than \\"Stand Up\\", but not quite up to it as a whole, and not quite as good as \\"Aqualung\\", which got overplayed by commercial radio to the point of annoyance. There's not a really weak track here, just some that are head and shoulders above the others. The first 6 tracks are my favorites, though I do really like \\"Teacher\\", which is another song that repetitive commercial radio ruined for me. The playing is brilliant without the over production that marred later works.

The feedback in \\"A Time For Everything\\" and musique concrete in \\"Play in Time\\", once agreeably au courant, now seem awkward and superfluous. The beats of \\"Benefit\\" are more conventional than that of the two previous and three subsequent records: for the first and last time everything is in four (oh, except \\"With You There to Help Me\\").

The best song on the album is the propulsive \\"Teacher\\" that ranks among the band's best songs. The album was their breakout in the US peaking at number eleven on the charts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon, your disgusting censorship cannot stand!!!!!","review":"Digitally remastered reissue of 1970 album includes four bonus tracks, 'Teacher' (Original UK Mix), 'Witch's Promise', 'Just Trying To Be' & 'Singing All Day'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jethro Tull Classic","review":"This is probably my favorite Jethro Tull effort. The quality musicanship on \\"Benefit\\" is obvious but what really hits me when I listen to this cd is the emotional aspect of the songwriting by Ian Anderson and band. A darker,deeper, more heartfelt effort yet the lyrics are driven home with an incredible sense of passion and fury by the band. Even the slower numbers weave intricately around Ian Anderson's singing creating a sound not heard on earlier Tull releases. If you look at the line-up for this release you begin to realize the amount of talent at this time in the band. Many would consider Tull's next release \\"Aqualung\\" to be their masterpiece but \\"Benefit\\" should not be overlooked as it is an essential piece of Jethro Tull history and stands up very well on its own merits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Benefit","review":"This album is often overlooked, being between Stand Up and Aqualung. However, it is very underrated and an excellent album. It is a bit darker than previous albums, but it makes it different and more enjoyable. Just buy it along with the rest of Tull's albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great early Tull albums","review":"Benefit is, in my opinion, one of Tull's best albums. This is progressive rock a-la Tull without the later foray's into concept albums. And it works wonderfully.Listening to it again all these years later I'm remain fascinated at what a good band they were before the break-out. To me this is some of Tull at their best- experimenting but remaining within a conventional format. Benefit remains, for me, one of my favorite Jethro Tull albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Soundtrack of My Teens","review":"I am very pleased to see the wonderful reviews of this record. Twenty-eight years ago, when I was right in the middle of high school, I discovered the incredible Jethro Tull. Such sublime alienation! Such sweet melancholy! This, and \\"Stand Up\\", are my favorites from Ian Anderson & band. There is nothing like remembering rainy afternoons when I was 16, sitting in my room with poetry books, listening to this record -- identifying with Ian Anderson as the \\"moody intellectual\\". I have gone on to love all kinds of music, but these songs retain a unique place in my heart. This recording is a time machine that can instantly take me back almost 30 years. Extraordinary."},{"rating":"2","title":"get it","review":"This may be J. Tull's greatest album. Before the glorious extravagence of Thick as a Brick and a Passion Play (yes, I know Aqualung was inbetween), there was this. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great and important effort","review":"Great music from Ian's \\"angry man\\" days. This is a young and hungry Tull and it is evident by the rough edges on these songs. But they add character and flavor to the great musicianship and intense lyrical stories of Anderson. You can really feel the energy on the hard numbers and the haunting lyrics and melodies of other passages blend in beautifully. This is Tull at their rawest best."},{"rating":"1","title":"GO SLOW PARTS.","review":"Stay away. i ordered a bug guard for my dad's truck for Christmas present on December 10th and they still haven't even shipped it yet.

The book is a narrative overview of reparations in the treaty and through the occupation of the Ruhr. Trachtenberg provides a detailed account of the negotiations at the conference by each delegation as well as the economic versus political decisions made over the reparations issues. The author takes special care to point out that the policies established by the victors were not intended to crush Germany forever and that reasonable attempts were made to formulate and implement a workable settlement."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I Could Give It More Stars...","review":"Hank Jones... let's just say there is NO GREATER JAZZ PIANO PLAYER!

I've never seen a mango flavored liquorice before. I like it. It is a little bit harder than another Australian liquorice I bought at Target before that may have been made by the same company. That's why I'm giving 4 stars. It is a lot of liquorice for the price and imported at well. The fact that it is imported was another reason I bought it. A bag could easily be shared among two people. Flavor is light but true like eating real mango. The flavor also sticks around for a little while after you've swallowed. The total fat is 1g. The sugar is 16g. Quite a delicious and cheap snack/candy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not reorder","review":"I also ordered the black liquorice and absolutely loved it. But the mango didn't have that much flavor.

I was half way through the book before a murder actually happened. Most of the book was concerned about those damn flyers-which was just the weakest plot line ever. The author tried way too hard and way too many times to show how much in love Annie and Max were. And then she had all these supposed \\"quirky\\" characters just rambling on and on.

The chilled out Ambient tracks range from horribly repetitive to cliched ramblings that you could come up with playing with a couple keyboards.

Even when I find myself into a track just a bit.. it finds it self in a horrible never ending loop that doesn't change.

Finished it the next day. Great weekend or vacation reading.This is great fiction and a must-read if you like adventure books and authors such as David Baldacci and Nelson DeMille."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"I never had a chance to use my new kayak before my seat pad came in so I don't really have a before and after story. The seat pad was not as thick as I thought it would be, only about 1/2\\" thick. I was suprised at how comfortable it was. Super easy to install. Just peal the backing off, make sure it is where it needs to be and drop it in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"No security","review":"If you are intending to include these envelopes with your invoices so that your customers can return their payment, think again. They do not have any security features. They are just thin plain white envelopes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck together right out of the box","review":"The items themselves are nonspectacular - white envelopes that fit in No. 10 envelopes. But almost all of them were already sealed together right out of the box; I had to gently use a letter opener to get them opened! I don't know why - maybe they were improperly stored? I saw no water damage on the box or any of the envelopes. Very frustrating. Won't buy from this manufacturer again."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE NECESSARY TOOLS TO START A SMALL BUSINESS","review":"This guide has helpful guidance and virtually any form a new business needs to get started, and maintain a legal operation.

There's another anti-Moore documentarian who found Moore on the street and just walked right up to him and Moore gladly gave him an interview. It's online if you would like to see it. Others have proved how easy it is to get in touch with Moore if you really want to. Mike Wilson didn't want an interview with him because he wanted to make a movie. Plain and simple. This \\"film\\" is about nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE AMERICA","review":"Michael More is a complete idiot!! He needs to leave this great Country...For Good!! Quit supporting his stupidity...Don't buy the fictious film..."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"IMHOWho lie, who say the right... we don't care, we are (i supposed) enough wise for known the truth, of course truth is not fox, cnn and such.Anyways, the documentary's value of this movie is low, just is almost all biased and not credible that some Moore movies. In fact the facts in this movies are just childish and no-professional at all.Funny?Moore made the movies more funny, this movie (i admit) i cannot saw completely cause tedious. Even when i'm fans of THC and Discovery still found boring this \\"documental\\" (or whatever it is)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Moore and America","review":"Uncomfortable with his own title? Well, he should be. It discredits the work. Anyone who thinks Michael Moore hates America has got a serious neurons-missing problem. It is obvious that Michael Moore desperately loves America - but his America is a different one from the America of his critics. One can agree or disagree with him and still see that this is true. Come on, people! Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton disagreed deeply, probably more fundamentally than Michael Moore and Rush Limbaugh do. But are there grounds for saying that both did not love their country?"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MICHAEL MOORE HATES AMERICA.","review":"Like some reviewers said before Michael Wilson use this title in order to get attention but this documentary is really about the criticism of Michael Moore's theories and the way he exaggerate his points of view on his movies: Bowling for Columbine, Roger and Me and Farenheit 9/11.Im sure that everything that Michael Moore says is NOT always true but he has many interesting points of view that we should think about them and not think of him as an american hater. He is a STRONG CRITICIZER! and he use to exaggerate in order to entertain the people that likes controversy. Of course, he doesn't offer many solutions but I understand that criticism is not exactly about solutions, is more about offering your points of view.P.S: Im not saying that I support Michael Moore in every way because there are MANY things that I disagree with him but I don't think of him as an enemy.Adios."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Someone Who Doesn't Like Michael Moore","review":"The criticism surrounding Moore is extremely weak and at times feels contrived. This guy berates Moore for tricky editing, then turns around and splices in out-of-context scenes of Moore which portray him negatively. Look, Moore may have douche bag qualities, but it's for reasons other than what this documentarian is trying to argue. Very, very, very weak. I would like my 1 hour and 33 minutes back please."},{"rating":"1","title":"just pure self indulgence","review":"This is just pure self indulgence with no ability to connect any threads with an overall effort as juvenile as its title.The film focuses on the minutia of detail not the major points of Moore's documentaries. For example it spends a significant amount of time on the issue covered in Bowling for Columbine of where exactly a local Bank gives free guns away to it customers. When the major point is A LOCAL BANK IS GIVING FREE GUNS AWAY TO CUSTOMERS.This Film Maker doesn't seem to have a point other than his own belief's that he is right and Michael Moore is wrong. He's given the opportunity on a TV news show to explain his point of his film project and what he wants from Moore and it is just as incoherent as his film.In regards to the interview the film maker wanted with Moore I believe he never had any desire to Interview Moore and would have done even worse then he did in his TV interview had he gotten the chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bet he got an invitation to the White House","review":"I'm surprised George Bush hasn't been waving this around. This film is for Americans who look at a map of the world and see America and a few islands. Hello to Americans in Michael Wilsons light. There are other great in fact greater countries out there, than America and yes they are important, even if they don't have oil Bush can steal. This film is for Americans who believe America is the centre of the Earth! Send your $10 to some orphan in Iraq instead of buying this pathetic excuse of a movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal","review":"This movie is truly poor. I was looking forward to seeing this movie, but I was waiting for the theater release and didn't want to buy a copy. Luckily, a friend of mine bought a copy, so I watched it at her place. It's truly dire from beginning to end. Wilson has no charm or grace or talent and the movie belongs in the bargain-section, not on Amazon for $20 +"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repugnant","review":"A truely bad documentary. For all Moore's flaws, he's still a genius compared to these amateurs...Enough said"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bilge","review":"This move should be boycotted for the appalling title alone. It is not enough to say that the title is 'satirical' or 'it goes deeper than the title' . The title is odious and unfair, and means this movie is worthy of only a one star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad, It's Terrible","review":"Mike Wilson is a miserable right-wing failure who has made an appalling film that has failed. It's that simple. Anyone who thinks there is more than that to say is fooling themselves, and giving this movie more respect than it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Indeed","review":"If Mike Wilson wants to direct, he needs to stick to wedding videos and childrens parties. This truly abysmal movie is an amateurish slopfest from beginning to end, only enlivened briefly by Penn Jillette.Definitely one to be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain silly","review":"Let me start of saying that even though Micheal Moore has made some very provocative and entertaining documentaries, I agree that he has been known to manipulate his material for persuasive reasons. Is that really a revelation? Most filmmakers, as \\"unbiased\\" as they might claim to be, have some sort of agenda. That same is true of the author of this documentary. The title and premise of this film is really quite silly. I am not sure how Evert and Roeper gave it two thumbs up, but I suppose it is not the first time I have disagreed with them. Anyways, I just find it ironic that a filmmaker would make a highly biased documentary attacking the biases of another documentarion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tell it like it is!","review":"Truth, justice and the American way! Something Michael Moore seems to know very little about."},{"rating":"1","title":"He didnt speak about facts Moore brought in his films","review":"I think from the first moment you see this film you think its a good film and he really tries to show us the truth,but at the end you cant deny the fact that Factories had moved to Mexico to gain more profit,you cant deny the fact that 11000 People were Shot cause of guns every where,you cant deny any fact Moore has brought in all his films,whatever the way.I think this person is the one that hates America as Moore has said,and he is the one that destroys the American Dream,dealing with people as Numbers and Statics instead of human beings thats a dangerous thing,if this man was a real human and he really cares about Americans he would be sad all his life for one person has been shot and died.I dont know Moore in personal,and i dont know if he really feels what he says or not,but for me at least i was touched to hear him saying we would be judged on how we treat the least among us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prejudice on Parade","review":"This guy is guilty of everything he accuses Moore of. Innuendo and half truth doesn't make it so. This movie is like Fox News, opinion as though it were fact. Another swift boating. Two stars because it is a well made movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"LACKS SUBSTANCE/FILTHY language","review":"I will admit, I'm no nun but when you have characters with disgusting nose rings in your film cursing left and right, like this cheesy film had, (I still don't know who was that hippie looking guy cursing in the film) the story begins to lose credibility very FAST for me.Michael Moore points out facts, facts that people don't want to hear or admit, but that's THE FACTS!That doesn't mean Michael Moore necessarily hates America. This film DID NOT substantiate that allegation and basically just bashed Michael Moore with no real facts. Sometimes I think the Michael Wilson has his personal agenda against Moore, and I'm not sure what that is.The film did many generalizations that are stupid. I wonder how much people got paid in this film to bash Moore.I'm not getting into a political discussion here but if you're going to make a film throwing some stupid allegation, you need to back it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too many F words!","review":"I can't give this less than 4 stars, because the guy really does hate Michael Moore, and he made a movie. But I was watching the movie with my kids and it was embarassing to have the F word dropped so many times. Also Not enough clips of M-M making an ass out of himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"Lots of boring emotional stories, ad hominem attacks, I think I counted 2 actual criticisms of what Moore actually claims. I bought this DVD mainly because it says John Stossell is in it, he is NOT. I feel extremely ripped off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duh","review":"I knew the title was true but wanted to see it anyways. It debunks most of Moore's lies and exposes him for the liar that he is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wasn't as bad as I thought","review":"I thought this was going to be a MM bashing session. It wasn't. The film maker is fair in his methods, which he actively talks about in the film, and is fair to MM, which he doesn't deserve.I gave it 4 stars because the film didn't focus on the gross deceptions coming from MM. It focuses more on MM's methods than on his facts; the latter being much more important to expose.Overall I was impressed by the restraint to bash MM but disappointed by the shortage of lie-exposing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Accurate Material","review":"This was good accurate material, and shows, proves , how the left despises the truth and doesn't care whether its true or not. Michael Moore basically made millions of dollars from peoples ignorance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Moore Hates America.","review":"Excellent Expose on one of America's many pariahs. people who do more than criticize this great country while eschewing capitalism they live off of it. a Movie should not be made about this guy anymore than you should take this guy's movies serious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlike the M. Moore who lies to the audience...","review":"...this is a real documentary. Exposes M.M. for the people exploiting hypocrite hatch job he is. Expect to see bad reviews from brainless zombie M.M. zealots/fanboys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Two Thumbs Up Indeed!","review":"Fascinating look behind the man, his agenda and deceptive film techniques. the fact are here ... he certainly does Hate America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let the title fool you","review":"Let me start this by saying I *AM* a fan of Michael Moore.That being said, I do find some of his filmmaking techniques sloppy. That is the price you pay for trying to pack big issues into a two hour movie.Is using the title \\"Michael Moore Hates America\\" any more inflamatory than titling a book \\"Dude, Where's My Country?\\" The fact of the matter is that this is the way that this form of entertainment appeals to its core audience, from either political spectrum.What we have here is a delightful, if somewhat provocative film by a first time filmmaker. Is it good? Ebert and Roeper gave it two thumbs up. I'd say I have to agree with their assesment.This is an important film for anyone who wants to be informed of both sides of the issues in Mr Moore's more recent films. Knowing both sides of a discussion is the only way a person can make intellectual decisions.See this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth seeing","review":"...I couldn't finish the thing. It's boring, petty, and obnoxious. Plus, it demonstrates Michael Moore's skill as a documentarian through its makers' obvious lack of talent. I'm guilty of contributing money to this pathetic endeavor, but I hope you save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than a PowerPoint youtube video","review":"Amateur film making at it's worst. Disjointed and lacks focus.Worthless interviews of people who don't matter although NRA stuff is very good (but that has nothing to do with the interviewer) and no one needs to hear wind bag Penn Jillette anymore. Probably the only \\"name\\" he could get.I don't like Michael Moore and this \\"film\\" uses the exact tactics. A nobody filmmaker wonders why he can't get an interview just like Moore couldn't in ROGER & ME.Waste of plastic the DVD is printed on."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],x={key:0},N={key:1};function R(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(M,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-f5f395eb"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/6.md","filePath":"quotes/6.md"}'),H={name:"quotes/6.md"},j=Object.assign(H,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{P as __pageData,j as default};
