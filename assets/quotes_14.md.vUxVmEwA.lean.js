I know I'm not saying anything that the other reviews haven't said, but this game actually hurt.I've played all of the Myst games except URU which won't run on a Mac. Then I had a kid; he's four, and he sits next to me and plays them too, so playing Myst has become an intergenerational meaningful experience......which Myst V completely destroyed. It is SO bad that I feel like Cyan has robbed me of the enjoyment of doing something fun with my kid. It is a betrayal of everything that the earlier games excelled at. I'm heartbroken, truly pained."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Myst Games are Great","review":"I have all of the Myst Games and enjoy each very much.

Myst V is the absoulte worst of the bunch. The game seems as if it was built in a rush by third stringers using leftovers from URU and Myst 1. The puzzles are lame and the graphics poor with detail, clickable or otherwise, minimal and no interactive video. Worst of all seems to be the poor quality control: I have run all the Myst Games as well as URU on the same machine and only with Myst V did I have so many technical problems, including a Crashed Hard drive.The only good Part was David Ogden Stiers as the voice of Esher and, of course, Atreus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Using the game in a 64 bit Vista machine","review":"We have all the Myst programs and they were all good.

Twice Amazon shipped me the MAC version, and refuses to believe that I didn't order the wrong thing. The picture and the description said Windows version when I ordered it.

Then I remembered - it is awful. I loved the rest of the Myst series and really looked forward to playing them. I used a few hints here and there but managed pretty well, this game just seems nonsensical. I agree with whoever said that scope was small enough to be a demo and therefore they seem to have crammed a lot of daft, intricate tasks into it. I'm not even going to play it any more with a walkthrough, where is the fun in that? Really disappointed. Will see if the older games will play on my new PC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with recent direct X","review":"Never was able to play this game, it caused stack errors while trying to start it. Problem was it will not work with Direct X 10. Ubisoft provided no resolution. Thus if you have Vista or Direct X 10, do no purchase this game, it will not work, and Ubisoft does not support any updates or patches to help it work..it is basically a ripoff as they don't tell you this. I am out the funds it cost for this game and am writting this to help others not waste their money buying something that causes stack errors and the maker of the game could care less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major let down","review":"Basically I agree with the previous detractors. This installment was a complete and utter let down. I was expecting a grand finale, but it was a soggy firework instead. Way to easy, not really puzzle based at all (or at least too few and too simple), and visually disappointing also. Stick with the first 4 games and give this a miss unless you are a real fan and really care what happens in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad,bad,bad,bad.","review":"This game was terrable. It's not worth any amount of money. Maybe if it cost one cent with free shipping and you are extremly bored, it will help you pass the hour, but if you played and liked the first 4 Mysts, you will hate this game. Characters were badly anemated, to much talking, to confusing, half the time there were no clues to tell you where you should go and what you should do next and the other half it was like they thought you were to stupid to be alive because they told you step by step by step what to do, when to do it and how to do it. Very, very bad game. on a scale of 0 to 10 this game is a 1 only because the most entertaining part is telling all my family and friends how bad it is and seeing the look of shock that the makers of Myst put out a bad game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"Like the previous Myst games, this one follows in the same great tradition. Fun game to play.

You have to have them absolutely perfect or you'll spend hours redrawing them. This is the most frustrating game I've ever played. I finished all the other Myst games in a few days. And enjoyed them mostly. I've spent 3 days and numerous game guide sites trying to figure out how to draw a symbol in Todelmer good enough to move along. If it wasn't for the startegy guide I would have assumed I was on the wrong path. I was able to get the first few slate drawings to work only after multiple tries. Never did see the difference from one that worked and ones that didn't. Any one want to buy this before I throw it the trash? I wouldn't even take your money. It's that bad.

I guess this'll be another brightly colored coaster for my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock N Roll Reunion 61'","review":"The songs included are not the original versions; instead, they are newly recorded takes by the original artists. Unsurprisingly, there is never an instance in which a new version tops the original, so the whole series should be avoided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treading Water for the Series","review":"Months after reading the rest of the books, I finally found my copy and re-read it. A simple opinion of the book is this:It is simply a transitional book, with no real impact of its own.The book wraps up previous plots (Toby in Washington, Sierra oil skullduggery, Janessa's doctoring, etc.) Outside of Janessa's involvment with birth control, no new plots are devised, and the plot concerning Frank is simply stretched into the Yukon, but lacks much of the feel for the territory.Ross already knew he wanted the next book to be heavily around the Spanish-American War,a nd simply sacrificed this book to get us there.WHat a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Good book, part of a series of ten books, good author, have read several of her books, I enjoyed all of them"},{"rating":"1","title":"practically flavorless","review":"I bought this tea on sale, without having tried it previously.

I loved most of them, but there were a couple that were not my favorites. None of them tasted bad, and most of them seemed to enlighten me in some way. I would not buy the variety pack again-in bulk. The favorites that I liked will be purchased in bulk. I would recommend if you buy this, give a box or two away to a friend or family member. Then you can pick and choose or trade teas.

Oh well, back to the overpriced HP originals."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've probably read it at least 3 times","review":"I like this novel much more than any other done by the author. At times its sloppy, at times its slow and plodding. I tend to like these type of 'mistakes' by an author because it adds some dissonance to otherwise consonant writing. The main character is kind of cerebral, pitiful and lonely, but those are themes I understand and appreciate, so its okay. Actually, I kind of think of this novel as a re-write of Mambo Kings, it employs many of the same novelistic devices, especially, an artist's relationship to his or her own song lyrics or music. Its not a novel where I 'felt' for any of the characters, I've already outgrown that, I'm more interested in character development, plot development, themes and use of voice. One thing I'd like to ask the author is why his Cuban protagonists are always so ehm...well endowed, and why discuss so much what they do with it? Does size matter?"},{"rating":"1","title":"contrived and flat","review":"We read this novel for Book Club, and all agreed that it did not live up to the glowing reviews. The characters were flat and unbelievable, the plot contrived. It's not that the situation could not have happened, but rather that the author wrote it clumsily, so that it did not come across as believable. In fact the heavy and clumsy writing detracted considerably from enjoyment of the book. The \\"subtitles\\" and translations in parentheses were quite annoying. None of us felt that there was any literary quality to the novel; it seemed more that Hijuelos was coasting on his reputation. If you want to read it, try the library first--I wouldn't recommend spending money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A deep and enlightening story","review":"The composer Israel Levis became so real for me while reading this novel that I, with a degree in musicology, had to go online and see if he was indeed a \\"real\\" person! While there were parts of Levis' personality I found somewhat... revolting, the author's command of the world of Cuban music, Cuban history, European cultural life and European history are stunning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Simple Habana Melody","review":"It is a wonderful rare treat when an author keeps me anxiously, deliciously turning the pages.

Though you wouldn't guess it from the book description or the other reviews, the book gives advice that just isn't appropriate in small or mid-sized firm applications; some of the advice, such as sending out transcripts with every resume, is just plain hurtful to most candidates.

The puzzle pieces are sweet, and each pair has a different texture to feel. However, they (of course) fall out as the pages are turned, which causes her sorrow and grief, and then trying to put the pieces back in the little case is very frustrating, as they can only go in one way, and some have to be inserted upside down to fit correctly. A forgettable experience for both of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title and jacket","review":"This book is not at all what it seems. The Mapmaker's wife, Isabel, whom the story is supposed to be about, does not really enter the plot until page 200. If you like math and the history of how the world's shape was calculated, this journal-like book is for you. If you are looking for a story and character development, make sure to pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Read","review":"Fell in love with the country of Ecuador this year and then fell harder when I read this book...fabulous story, well written and incredibly irresistible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mapmaker's wife - NOT!","review":"As the 1-star reviews point out, this book is NOT about the mapmaker's wife. It certainly isn't about the title character who was the mapmaker's assistant's wife. The wife hardly plays any role in this book. While the book is filled with all sorts of interesting characters and events, it's too much a hodge-podge of information. The story deserves a much better author's hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating view of life in South America in the 16th C","review":"People looking for a historical romance novel will be dissapointed. This often happens to those taken in by marketing ploys to sell reality history books to the general novel-reading public.Truth is stranger, and more interesting, than fiction. Other reviewers have already given a lot of details. I will say that the part toward the end dealing with the main female character's trip down the Amazon is completely amazing and unbelievable. What people went through to travel back then or even just to deliver a letter!The only place the book bogged down for me a bit was in the details regarding the cartographic measurements that the French scientists made in Ecuador. This is a minor point. The rest is fascinating. For those interested in the real thing; well-written, readable history, this is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A biographically epic tale of discovery and exploration","review":"Robert Whitaker's The Mapmaker's Wife: A True Tale Of Love, Murder, And Survival In The Amazon, is a biographically epic tale of discovery and exploration by a woman whose journey was inspired by love for a man she hadn't seen in 20 years. In 1769 Isabel Grameson, an upper-class Peruvian woman who lived her life close to home, set out across the Andes and down the Amazon to rejoin her husband in French Guinea. Her journey through untamed wilderness was one few had made before her, and provides a fascinating early story of achievement."},{"rating":"1","title":"stereotypes!","review":"It's a shame the author didn't read a bit more about Spain and Spanish America. He resurrects the Black Legend about the Spanish and makes Peruvians sound like mindless robots who follow the Crown/Church orders. Anyone with historical background will want to throw this at the wall at times. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Started out okay with the promise of interesting characters, but just got dull and wordy. Didn't finish it. Maybe more enjoyable for a South-American history buff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Tough Characters","review":"Amazing what the main character goes through in this book. Not only that, it's a great history of Peru/Ecuador during the early colonial times and provided me with insight as to what the region was like in the 1700s.

It will not fit the 13/16 shafts.Also, it is not an exact clone of the GM part. This part was essentially copied upside down, with the flat \\"key\\" on the wrong side of the casting. It will work fine, but your steering wheel will be upside-down unless you also take apart your column and flip the ball joint 180 degrees. If you don't have tilt steering, you'll have to modify this part or just live with the upside down wheel.Also, the bolts it comes with are short, so it's difficult to bolt to the lower steering shaft.

Forrestal.","review":"This is a great read, and it took me all of three days to read this story of the fire on the U.S.S. Forrestal. I am surprised this book did not become a bigger seller than others. Freeman does a great job of detailing the life on this carrier and the result of the fire and deaths as a result of the accidental firing of the Zuni rockets. One gets a sense of purpose of those people who work their lives on the carriers.This book taught the value of following procedures in dangerous situations. Those who circumvented the rules indirectly caused the firing the rocket into McCain's aircraft. The government using old WWII ordinance also bears some of the blame. The young crew are to be truly commended for fighting such a dangerous blaze at the risk of their lives. Their actions saved the ship. Freeman tells an amazing story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Former USS FORRESTAL Sailor","review":"I enjoyed this book because it answered many questions for me as to what happened that fateful day. I sailed on FORRESTAL for three months prior to her deployment to Vietnam. I lost seven friends/squadron mates in that fire. I left the Navy in May 1967. My squadron and ship went on to Vietnam. I was shocked on July 29, 1967. This book was written so that anyone who has a love for ships, planes and the military will appreciate. This is a story that needed to be told. It is a tragic event in Naval history. The writer has done a excellent job of telling the story. The ship will become a museum in Baltimore, MD. Read the book and then visit the ship. She where history was made and innocent lives were lost helping defend our country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a great book","review":"As many reviewers before have mentioned, this could have been a much better book if only it had been sent to an editor that had served in the Navy and specifically on aircraft carries.The author describes seaplanes from a cruiser with 2 engines and describes the Japanese Betty bomber as a fighter. But he even confuses the Midway class carriers with the Essex class when trying to compare the size of the new Forrestal class carriers. (I served on the USS Midway and he is wrong on the facts)It could have been so much better with a little more editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailors to the End: The Deadly Fire on the USS Forrestal...","review":"Riveting!

I thought Kevin Conway did an excellent job narrating this book and my attention never lagged once. The story and the narrating were as good as it gets. Inagine yourself with bombs \\"cooking off\\" around you with jet fuel spilling everywhere and death staring at you in the face. These sailors never wavered.

Yeah I know the GCN was made for \\"kids\\" and all but Square-Enix could've gave them something better, I guess they just wanted to keep all the good FFs on PS2, lol. Also the characters look really stupid! What is with that thing with the long neck? I know they were \\"trying\\" to do something original and all but that thing just looked stupid! The only reason I am giving this game 1 star is because the multiplayer part of the game, that is something I have been wanting to do for years in FFs (besides wanting to battle party vs. party in Chrono Cross)."},{"rating":"2","title":"rpgplayer","review":"this game is a beautiful mix between super nes's secret ofmana and a legend of zelda title(don't care what title asthey're all great).it combines the fabulous feeling of unlimited freedom we got from playing OoT,and blasting away an enemy with overpowered spells that are able to cause major damage.i like rpg's because in those games you feel like you have a world to go through where everybody seems to know,like,or dislike you."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are you?

The graphics are simply awesome. the story is not very indepth, but thats not a big issue. To play multiplayer each player must have a GBA (or GBASP) and each must have a Gcube-GBA link cable. The reason they have that is so each player can access his/her menus so not to annoy and hold up the other players. Alot of people that have a gamecube, also have a GBA (or SP), because of other games that get bonuses when the GCN game is linked to the GBA version. so get this game (and dont listen to the people who badmouthed it because it wasnt on the PS2 or something (or reveiwed before the game came out)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Way to go Nintendo!","review":"Hey moron with the review before mine- nintendo had final fatasy 1,2 and 3 before playstation even came out!

Graphics are not that great, musics/sounds only so so, and the storyline, the empties of any Final Fantasy game I have seen so far.

It is impossible on Single Player. The spells take alot of time to power up, and in that time, I'm dead. SO, I have to restart the field, and go through again.

It's design meant it just flattend out. I merely straightened it, readjusted it and kept on riding. The trick is to follow the instructions on using it! I prefer the longer model because I like to HAVE to turn my head slightly to check the traffic...it lets the drivers know I'm checking them.

This one is SO much better. It's a nice, large viewing area (I have the regular size, not the small), and because it's frameless, it doesn't draw my eye to it as much. It's also quite a bit stiffer than the plastic one so it grips the frame of my glasses tightly and really holds its position once I've adjusted it.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"This cycling mirror is one of the best that I have owned. My previous mirror was made of plastic and originally tightened by pressing the ball into the socket. This worked for about six months. After that, every bump moved the mirror down and rendered it useless. The Bike Peddler mirror is metal and is built in a way that won't loosen over time. It was easy to bend the non-brass part of the Peddler to fit my helmet. In addition, the unit arrived in great condition because the packaging was fantastic (bubble wrap in a box). I ordered the classic version as I wanted the larger mirror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"Great product especially for the price. It took some time to figure out how to mount it properly but in my case I wound up drilling three holes in my helmet and used epoxy to hold it in place. Now it is very stable and works great.

A little patience is handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very lightweight and clear mirror.","review":"I normally go into a long-winded dissertation when I review products, but there's not much to say other than this mirror is very nice and works great for me. Doesn't bob or shake too much when I'm riding, so I can still see cars behind me with ease. It's lightweight and stays on fairly well, though I'd recommend taping it on if you're getting into really rough trails or roads, because I hit a very hard bump and it did come loose. But it's only done that once, and not again.Return policy and warranty is excellent as well. Even if you screw it up by crushing it on accident or something, they'll still send you a replacement for a couple dollars (to cover shipping). I recommend many times over. It has kept me out of trouble since I usually ride on a winding country road with drivers who speed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love having this mirror when I ride!","review":"Great for keeping an eye on the traffic behind you. My husband and I both got one. We mounted to our helmets. Clipped them to our visor and secured with small zip ties. When I rode on real bumpy roads (we live in the country), the mirror seemed to bounce up and down on its arm, making it hard to see, but we drilled a tiny hole farther up on the visor and secured with another small zip tie. Now it works great. Didn't want it attached to my glasses because by bifocals made it hard to focus. Takes a little getting used to, but now I would be lost without it. No more cranking my head around all the time, or previously, I had a mirror that attached to the end of the handlebar, and I always struggled to see behind me, having to move handlebars, etc. I would defintely buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a Look Cycling Eyeglass Mirrow [Original]","review":"This is a great device, only problem I had was getting the correct angle of view, once you go pass that tricky part works extremly well.

I'm not sure about attaching it to my actual glasses, though: I attached it to the visor on my Giro helmet, and added duct tape to secure it. True: it may look slightly nerdy but it's my safety that counts, not my image!It took a little practice to figure out how to adjust it. I finally learned that I should be able to see my left ear and a bit of my left shoulder. Then everything behind will be just where you want it.If I go for a ride without it, I feel naked! Even though I wear glasses, I've learned to find the mirror in the upper right corner of my left lens. I've gotten to where I can check out traffic behind me and make lane changes with confidence, as long as the traffic is light. It may, however, surprise motorists who don't realize you can see behind you without twisting your head around! As long as they are far behind me, I don't worry about them, however, except to signal were appropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but works perfectly","review":"I opened the package and thought, \\"is this all there is\\". Basically, it's a piece of stiff wire with a small mirror. Not sure what I was expecting, but thought this was sure to be a return to Amazon. It turns out, this mirror is excellent. I clip it to the visor of my helmet. I moved it left and right on the visor until I found a spot where I could see behind me. It lines up almost perfect - the mirror easily tilts and swivels for fine tuning. It's rock solid when riding, does not have to be adjusted every few minutes, and has a wide field of view. It's so simple but it works perfectly. Far superior to hand grip mirrors or the small round helmet mirrors I've tried. For an avid recreational rider like me, this is as good as it gets in a rear view mirror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very important for bike safety","review":"I think that this is the best cycle mirror on the market. It's hand-made out of very simple materials... however, it's designed to be durable in a way that the molded plastic \\"Third-Eye\\" mirrors are not.

I got the \\"original version\\" and now wish that I had gotten the \\"compact\\" version instead (though I see that I probably can cut it down to size). The original version extends from your glasses 3 1/2 inches, and I find that it tends to knock into stuff, if I've put it on a few minutes before mounting my bike. Also, the farther the mirror is from your eye, the less stable the image tends to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy little mirror","review":"This is our second set of eyeglass mirrors. They are easy to use and once you get used to using them you don't want to go anywhere without them. I even find myself checking my \\"mirror\\" when I'm walking and don't have it on. One drawback that we've found is that if your frames are flimsy they could get bent. But that hasn't really been an issue for us.Give these easy to use mirrors a try. I won't ride without one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a great rear view mirror","review":"As a bicycle commuter it's very important that I have an idea of what sort of traffic is behind me out on the streets. I've tried several different brands of mirror and this is, by far, the best I've tried yet.The other mirrors I've used have attached to my helmet and are generally okay for getting a glimpse of approaching traffic unless your helmet moves; then they can be useless. In addition the models I've tried have had varying degrees of accuracy. Some had so much distortion that it was only possible to tell something was behind me.The \\"Take a Look\\" mirror corrects most of the these problems. By mounting on my eyeglasses I find they are less likely to move around as did the helmet mounted models. And, unlike other brands, the mirror itself is wonderful, giving me a very clear and accurate view of what is behind me.I'll probably be ordering a spare as my only real concern is losing it.Aloha!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Augghhhhhhhhh","review":"Oh, Man! I really screwed up on this. First of all I ended up ordering 2 (when I thought I had only ordered one!)THEN, I find the mirror goes ON YOUR HELMET OR GLASSES!!

I thought it went on the bile HANDLE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking Back","review":"This mirror attaches firmly to your glasses or sunglasses and stays in place. When adjusted and after a bit of getting used to, the mirror provides a pivoting look back that beats any attached to the bike mirror I've used. If you don't use glasses or sunglasses when riding there is a kit available at extra cost that will allow attachment to your helmet. I've used this product and another plastic one, this one is the way to ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good mirror when used with glasses","review":"Not sure about all the glowing reviews here. For me, this mirror is no good at all. I do not have a bill on my helmet so I do not know about that config, but clamping to my eyewear does not work. I have tried every possible angle and combination, but mostly I am looking at my shoulder and only with strain can i occassionally see something in the road behind me. Quite useless"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's just me...","review":"... but this thing seems to add a hazard to my ride. I can't really see much using it. I've been used to looking over my shoulder as I ride, and while this is not the safest thing to do, I get the whole picture when I do it. I did not feel comfortable using this -- AND I ended up looking over my shoulder, anyway. Like I said, maybe it's just me. If you like mirrors on your helmet or on your eyewear, well, disregard this review... Either way, be safe out there, brother and sister riders!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressed","review":"I was a little skeptical even with the great reviews, but after putting this on my cycling helmet and making my adjustments I've been extremely impressed. I cycled in wind with 32 mph gusts and didn't affect my mirror adjustments. The size of the original mirror is great, too. My cycling team member is also getting one. I recommend this mirror highly to anyone who is looking for a cycling mirror and a bit of added cycling safety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed it","review":"Have had this item awhile , use it all the time .

However, after purchasing a helmet mirror and not being able to attach it well to my Giro bike helmet, I decided to go with this model. Wow, it is perfect. It is well constructed and provides great visibility when attached to my glasses. I have put it both on my sun glasses and once on my regular glasses that are the half frame wire type. Both fit nicely with no issues.If you are looking for a mirror option and don't want to have one on the handle bars, this is the option for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"every cyclist should have this mirror","review":"This is a great mirror, stays in place on the cycling glasses, multi adjustable pivoting points.

This mirror is easy to place on the bow of your glasses, AND easy to adjust, AND remains in place to see what is behind me. Good product--am ordering more for friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"It takes some time to find the right angle","review":"It works great for bike with upright riding position, such as cruiser. But with MTB and road bike which rider's upper body leans forward, you would see your shoulder fills half of the mirror when you look straight forward. The mirror is at the far left end of peripheral vision, it's difficult to focus with both eyes.To see what is behind me on a MTB, I bring my upper body upward a bit and close right eye, then turn my head at 11 o'clock position and scan it with left eye. For me the reflection comes in focus immediately when I scan it with one eye. That works for me, it's not a bad workaround. Of course, I always turn my head to look back and use hand signal before I change lane."},{"rating":"2","title":"best bike mirror I've used","review":"I have tried other bicycle mirrors previously, but could never get the mirror quite where I wanted it. And in trying to position it on my sunglasses, I broke the mount on the last one I owned.The take a look was highly recommended on the bike forums so I tried it and love it. The image in the mirror is crisp and sharp. The mirror and mount are extremely flexible in that the mirror can be tilted side-to-side and up and down. You can also position the mirror farther from your eyes than other mirrors I've tried - which seems less distracting.This purchase was a gift for a fellow biker, who loves it as much as I do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who cares if they're dorky?","review":"I know a lot very strong roadies (OK, they're not racers.) who use these. Mirrors are great safety features, and these are the best I've used. Don't vibrate like helmet mounts. Good view with rectangular shape. Metal is strong enough to last a long time; in 20 years of use, I've lost one, given one away, but never had one break. Easy multi-directional adjustments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit","review":"Great back visibility, and fit perfect on different glasses.....Maybe a little big, but U get use to....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eyes in the back of my head.","review":"This product does what it says with an almost old world simple directness.This is form following funtion and economy with beautiful result.

The image reflection is excellent. I think this model may be as good as cycling rearview mirrors get!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cycling Mirror: Inherent Co-pilot","review":"Exceeded my expectations! The Take-a-Look Cycling Mirror was an excellent purchase. It provides an easy, safe and unobstructive view of the traffic that is approaching from the rear. No need for head-turning and taking ones eyes off of the road up ahead. This is a huge benefit when meandering along winding country roads that are not bordered by \\"bike lanes.\\" Take-a-Look lets you know well in advance that you are about to share the road...Great mini-investments that reaps immediate and lasting rewards...I made my purchase via Amazon, which gave me a price range, delivery options and a buying experience that I easily and convenietly tailored to my personal my needs and preferences. Amazon catered uniquely to me! From now on, I'll window shop at the Big Box, or specialty stores, but when I've found exactly what I'm looking for - I'll make my purchase at Amazon.com!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works; just be prepared to fine-tune for optimum performance","review":"This product works. When set properly, I can glance at the mirror and have a pretty good rear view down the road. The trick is to set it properly. It requires a lot of adjustments initially, for you to figure out how this simple contraption works. It took me almost 3 weeks to appreciate it's functionality.Once you learn how to use it properly, a few seconds is all it takes to adjust. I find it best to fine-tune the adjustments while riding (with one hand).When I am positioned in the drops, I lose the 'sweet spot' rear view. I think it works best when riding in one position. So I always adjust it in my dominant riding position(which is on the hoods).Also, I usually get a lot of stares, smiles and occasional comments about the mirror as this type is not common where I live."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid value","review":"A useful mirror for biking, it feels more satisfying than the plastic versions being sold for twice the price in the bike stores.It is definitely heavier than them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this product","review":"I have gone through several of these mirrors because my sunglass frames are thick. But, I love this product, hate riding without it, and have bought a spare just in case.

I have two helmets by Specialized: one I had no problem attaching to, the other, the helmet bindings were in the way and could not get the mirror attachment to fit properly. It would be to your advantage to research and design the mirror attachment to fit all helmets. This would help the buyer from purchasing a new helmet just to fit the mirror attachment. Whether or not you print this review does not matter to me. This review is intended for your design department. Thanks for the mirror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bicycle mirror made, for most glasses wearers","review":"A few reviewers state these glasses can't be worn with wire-rimmed glasses. Although this is undoubtedly true for some glasses, I have been wearing this mirror for over 5 years on 3 different pairs of wire-rimmed glasses with no problem, so if you wear wire-rimmed glasses, don't be discouraged without trying them first. The trick is, I put the first brace in front of the hinge rather than putting all 3 braces on the temple as one would with wider temples. I also mount the braces horizontally rather than vertically as one would with wide temples. On my glasses (Polo and Safilo brands) this gives a snug, secure fit. We have busy streets around where I live, and I would never head out the door without this mirror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Rowing!!!","review":"I have used the \\"take a look\\" mirror extensively while rowing. It provides the most secure fit and widest field of view among the mirrors I've tried. It is rugged and will last a long time.

This one seems likely to last longer, as the mount is not made of plastic, so shouldn't go brittle in our cold British winters. Despite being made for people who ride on the wrong side of the road, it adapts well to being mounted on the right-hand arm of my spectacles for British roads. It gives a good field of view, with no distortion, and there is far less vibration than with helmet or handlebar mounted mirrors."},{"rating":"1","title":"to small","review":"This mirror fits the glasses frame nicely and is fairly easy to install. It is, however. much to small. It is very difficult to see behind you because the mirror is so small.

Over all it is a real pain to use so I replaced it with a bolt on rear view bicycle mirror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cumbersome mirror","review":"Seriously don't waste your money.

It surprised me, though. It moves back and forth through time. A mummy in current day Denver is being researched. A man's head is also wrapped with the mummy. (This is not normal.) We see the modern day researchers looking for the answers and we see the ancient Egyptians (the owner of the head and the person who became the mummy)involved in their own mysteries.

It's very hard to keep track of the Egyptian characters because you don't constantly read about them and they call each other by nicknames. (Too much work.) Also, it's pretty hard to care about the female character in the past when it's obvious by her mummy in the present that she dies a gruesome death--you know this by page 75 or so! So immediately you distance yourself from her because you know she's going to be killed. (Too much work.) It also bothered me that the author decided Nefertiti was a horrible person. I eventually gave up and just read the \\"present\\" chapters about the medical illustrator and the doctor... and was still frustrated, because they missed a lot of obvious things.

The code motion formulations have slightly different boolean logic in some places relative to other works on the topic, such a Morgan or Muchnick's books. This can make keeping track of the novel changes to the algorithms a bit tricky.However, this book presents some significant improvements to earlier code motion algorithms and as the primary source for some variations (notably including accounting optimally for register pressure) should be considered required reading for anybody working on code motion transformations in a modern optimizing compiler."},{"rating":"1","title":"minimally adequate","review":"The fit and finish on these cutters was disappointing.

The author, Andrew Marshall, seems to be a journalist based in Thailand, from where he has been able to travel to Burma relatively easily. While in Burma, he tries hard to make contact with tribal people, especially the Shans, who Scott spent so much time with 100 years before. The narrative is split between Scott's travels in the nineteenth century, and Marshall's present day experiences.Occasionally, Marshall's informal style of writing, with his use of British slang, gets a bit thick for me. Nevertheless, the case that he makes against the Burmese military is quite compelling. I've heard friends and acquaintances argue on both sides of the question of whether traveling to or working in modern day Burma provides support for the brutal government there. After reading this book, however, I don't see myself going anywhere near the country until there is a regime change."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Offbeat and Thrilling Journey in Burma","review":"This book held my attention all the way through.Historical facts were mixed with exciting adventures and humour.

An excellent book from this Scottish writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Finished the book. Did I like it? Not really. Men might enjoy the bits of fourth grade humor (farts, etc.). A gripe: surely after slogging through almost 300 pages and finally reaching the mythical Wa lake with the author and his friend, David, the reader deserves at least one photo of it. If you do choose to read this adventure don't skip the short Epilogue. Of course so much has changed (hopefully for the better) since it was written. It's definitely not a book to prepare you for a present day first or second visit to Burma."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the Shadow of Empire?","review":"Boring.

Although I usually wear lighter floral scents like Annick Goutal's Gardenia, I adore the lightly spicy complexity of Mandragore. Although the scent of ginger is the predominant note to begin with, it dries down to reveal delicious whiffs of pepper, bergamot and a powdery herb that I believe is the titular mandrake. I don't know what it is about this perfume that made me stray from florals, but both me and my boyfriend adore this one. Highly recommended for those wanting a light playful scent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised by Mandragore","review":"I purchased this fragrance as a gift for my wife. She has worn Element of Surprise by Beth Terry for years. I always loved that scent as it had a definite citrus flavor without overpowering the senses. Her friend has worn Mandragore and I plied the name out of her husband. I'm not disappointed here either. While I feel it is a softer, more understated scent than EOS (or I haven't gotten a good feel for it if I'm wrong on that), it still is a very classical fragrance. You would not be disappointed.

The book is divided into two sections, the first is titled \\"Reading,\\" and the second \\"Writing,\\" and I think that's an excellent summary of his life. Sartre recounts his early childhood, being born into a family without a father, and ultimately living a secluded a childhood submerged in his grandfather's library. Sartre then discusses life at the Ecole Superior, when he began to develop as a writer of prodigious genius. Sartre doesn't discuss his work particularly; this text is not a critical examination of his literary and philosophical work. Rather, it is a deeply introspective reflection and inquiry into the powerful and lasting effects words can have in life. I recommend it to all fans of reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Error of Isolation","review":"He wanted us to read about his life, to discover how he turned himself into a genius, to find the turn that made him conclude earnestly, \\"God does not exist.\\" It's as if atheism became his raison d'etre, a true a priori thinker though he professed exactly the opposite. As Marvin Farber wrote, \\"Some reading in the literature of evolution, and especially of cultural anthropology, might have (had) a salutary effect on his thinking and writing.\\" In short, Sartre confused his literary devices with actual reality. That he thought his words would provide him immortality attests to his intellectual arrogance. \\"I am the giver and the gift,\\" he wrote. Actually, his right hand didn't know what his left hand was really doing. His ignorance of what was really happening behind the Iron Curtain is his true legacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"very small cross","review":"This was delivered very quickly but was much smaller and delicate than I expected.

Otherwise this is chock full of excellent guitar rock which hasn't really been the norm this decade. His cover of the Beatles song is actually better than when George did it in 68.

It just goes straight to the ground. My husband can get the plane to fly. I was quite upset because I do know how to fly RC planes. Then, I discovered the controls take a few seconds to get in gear. You need a drop greater of 4-5 feet to have the plane fly and have the controls to take over. Well, I'm only able to get it about 5 1/2 feet off the ground. My husband is 6ft and is able to get at least another foot so, the controls have enough time to take over before it hits the ground. With me it nosedives. So, if you are tall its okay.

It might be really hard to control at first, but after around 15 tries you'll get the hang of it.It yook me about 15 tries until I got and it is so much fun when you have the controls down. I love mine.Always remember to throw it level with the ground and not up. That trick will only work if you are throwing it against the wind. Make sure your flying it in a very open area with very few trees.

It was a fairly calm day so that may have contributed to the problem, but kids won't check the weather before bringing out a toy to play! I brought it back the next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Flies !!","review":"My son and I spent as much time laughing as we did flying. It's definitely a fun toy meant for novices on no-wind or calm-wind days. Think of it as a free-flight model with some limited directional control. So it needs some room - get out to the football field or large open grassy park. Being complete R/C novices, it took some serious crashes and didn't break, but we were in medium-length grass.If you're after serious R/C, go to a serious hobby store and spend $400. If you're want an afternoon of fun, buy this. It won't last forever, but fun's the word, and it's a great father/son thing to do.Ours hasn't broken yet, but I suggest you bring along superglue and tape - fixing things can be as much fun as playing with things if you're in the right frame of mind.

He took it out of th box and the tale cracked completely off on one side? I think that this is such a flimsy toy, how can it fly high in the air and come back to the ground with out falling appart when just removeing it from the box is enough for it to break?

But every penny spent on this was wasted.The first problem you will encounter is recharging the plane itself. We were able to charge it one time, and after that no more. To charge it, you have to hold the plane firmly against a charging point on the remote while holding a button on the remote depressed.When we attempted to fly it the first time, the wing broke. While the box states that the plane is made of \\"High-density ESP Foam,\\" it is very flimsy, and just putting it back in the box caused another part of the plane to crack.Don't make our mistake.

In my mind I was sure I would have hours of enjoyment and playtime with my son. What I sadly discovered was that after approximately 20 minutes of trying to get the plane to fly and not nosedive directly into the ground (Yes I did charge it twice prior to the 1st flight)the plane was not durable and fractured at the tail. Now I did not think I was buying the world's best plane for 30.00 bucks, however I expected more then 20 minutes of failed flying.

Now that I've gotten halfway through, I've realized that it is basically sugar coated fluff. It's a collection of modern management homilies illustrated with cute little stories about Elizabeth I. I was hoping for a dicussion of the problems and opportunities she faced, with an in-depth discussion of how she and her people addressed them, which is not at all what is offered. It's a pity, because she did live in very interesting times and an insightful exposition could be quite valuable - perhaps someone will write the book I was hoping to read someday.If you have extra time & enjoy stories, this is worth reading, otherwise don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great topic, but trite outcome","review":"In fairly short order Elizabeth I moved a kingdom from near bankruptcy to the Golden Age. She touched every aspect of her world from politics, art, religion/spirituality, to science. In light of the challenges faced by modern business leaders, Elizabeth provides an intriguing roadmap to excellence, integrity, and success; however, this book approaches Elizabeth's leadership style in a trite and shallow way, with very little analysis of her strategies or how they apply to issues faced by business leaders of our time. The book is a bathroom reader at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful!","review":"You may have regarded Queen Elizabeth I of England in many ways - as a ruler, as a dramatic historical figure, as the prototype of a powerful woman, but have you ever thought of her as a corporate manager? Alan Axelrod has. He explains how the Virgin Queen exemplified principles of good business leadership during her reign from 1558 to 1603. He shows how these ideals helped her survive to become queen and how she used them to transform England from a tumultuous country to a powerful empire. Lessons from her rule can show any CEO a few things about leadership in perilous times. The book's combination of management principles with the drama of Elizabethan history makes for compelling reading. One critical note - the book skips around historically, which muddies the sequence of events. Otherwise, we at getAbstract recommend this excellent mix of enjoyable historical reading with powerful reminders about the fundamental principles of effective leadership."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close but no Cigar","review":"The author was on to a good idea with drawing from a well known historical figure and applying it to todays business world. Unfortunately the delivery has to be improved.The book cover says \\"strategic\\", but I saw nothing strategic about it. It reads like a cook book. A pinch of this a dash of that and you are on your way to being an effective leader. He also repeatedly draws on the same tool chest of examples to illustrate his points. You would think that after rules for all 40+ years there would be more to draw upon.On the upside I gained some insight on the historical aspects of the Elizabethan era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"Axelrod has done it again! Elizaabeth I, CEO is a must read, especially for those of you, like me, who enjoy a bit of history tossed in with your leadership lessons. It's nice to know that all this leadership stuff has some historical perspective. Axelrod does a super job making history relevant to the present. It's well put together too, and a page-turner.

Even if your kids are careful, non-messy (hahahahahaaa! yeah, right), one touch and their hands will have stains that don't wash off.

We are working with him on writing his name & this holds his interest because he wants to see what colors it will be. It's nice that the markers don't show up when he writes on other things.

There's even ice cream recipes that are based on instant pudding and one on jello!The author covers a brief history of ice cream and covers each of the main ingredients as well as why they're needed.Negatives:All of the recipes make about a gallon so you'll have to size them down if your machine can't handle a full gallon.

Both were life-changingly brilliant.And now this drivel. Badly motivated, messy, carelessly structured, one-dimensional characters, cliched dialogue, turgid prose.The plot turns on a dime for no rhyme or reason. The tedious sub-plots and ludicrous names ring false and forced. There were moments where I thought this novel was going somewhere, but alas, it sunk under its own pretensions. Rushdie's style somehow just seems best suited for the colorful, eclectic, surreal of India. Maybe his imagination fails him in America. I just hope there's some earthly reason, because I want him back. Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Furious","review":"I have never critiqued a book on Amazon. However, I am so sorely dissappointed by Rushdies latest book, Fury, that I feel obligated to warn Rushdie fans to avoid this book at all costs. If you have respect for his previous works, like I have, than this book will definitely wreck your image of a genious writer with the gift of magical realism. However, if you are interested in hearing an intellectual writer snobbishly gloat for nearly 250 pages about his life then buy it. I have my reservations about American Society as well as he does - but geez to dwell on it for so many pages and then 'cut and paste' people magazine into the novel makes me wonder if he secretely loves to hate the country he loves. To top it all off, this is the most amatuer plot I have read - since I've reread my own writing when I used to think I could write. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This book is an interesting study in how little work you need to do to get published if you have a brand name like Mr. Rushdie's. Mr. Rushdie, interested primarily in showing off his worldliness and making sweeping judgements on the state of things, misses the mark repeatedly and comes off as a wide-eyed arriviste completely blinded by the glitz. He has no personal reference point for New York and any reader who knows a bit about the city will immediately feel herself in the fraudulent company of a novice trying to pass off as an expert. This makes the wordplay and bombast and topical commentary especially untenable. Oh yes, he throws in a \\"murder mystery\\" as a plea to readers to stay with him through his gratuitous ramblings. Overall, the book reads like a first novel your college roommate wrote after visiting New York City for the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Babe Ruth Strikes Out.","review":"After the bristling pace and hair-raising experiences of reading Midnight's Children, The Satantic Verses, and Shame, I had high hopes for Fury. Alas, this book staggers, slumps, drags--it stinks. There are flashes of Salman the BIG FISH here, brilliant flashes, but ultimately the book is a flop. Even the Babe struck out now and then."},{"rating":"2","title":"unusual, but not for Rushdie","review":"I always hesitate to pick up a Rushdie as my next read. I have trouble settling in to his language and conventions, having to reread until I can catch his rhythm. This is the first Rushdie (besides Haroun and the Sea of Stories, but that's more elementary) that I could read without turning the pages backward.Malik Solanka is inventor of a modern-day Dora the Explorer who's been turned Bratz by commercialism. Fearing the rage that burns inside him, he leaves his London life and attempts to disappear into the unbranded rush of New York City only to find his internal furor replaced by a much larger external one.I couldn't help thinking ofHeart of Darknessand the twisted trip down the Congo, with itsApocalypse NowMarlon Brando looming at the end. As the story escalates, so do Solanka's shadowy strangers-come-friends (accomplices?) and bizarro never-never-land of Fury."},{"rating":"1","title":"Before this edition","review":"I read this book in 2002 before the united states printing to draw a personal conclusion on the subject of the writing of salman rushdie. I found it to be on par with the writing of anais nin. I don't think it's the author's fault for printing it. This book is a waste of time on par with a trip to an adult bookstore. I suppose anyone who is a registered sex offender would like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Style, no substance!","review":"A good literary creation is not only clever phrases, it also requires a larger order and symmetry.

I generally devore them, savor each line and word, and simply can't put them down.The minute I heard that he had a new book out I ran out and bought it that same day. Unfortunatly it turned out to be less enthralling than his other works. It was disturbing the way the Sept. 11th attacks appear, it certainly touched a nerve.This is a dark book, but lacks the ability to laugh at life, and find passion that are hallmarks of his other works.I had trouble getting through this one, I didn't enjoy it as much as \\"The Ground Benieth her Feet\\" or \\"Haroun and the Sea of Stories.\\"It is a good, solid book, but it didn't live up to the hype and expectation of his name. I even saw it on a Newsweek worst of 2001 list, how uncharacteristic is that?Make of it what you will, I still wait on baited breath for his next work...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This was my first read of Rushdie. I read gushing reviews of this book and thought I'd give him a try. I only got 60 pages in and had to put it down. I thought he was trying to prove how smart and clever he is, and I am convinced. But that doesn't make for an enjoyable read. Maybe the critics get wet reading this type book full of ego-driven intellectual gymnastics, but I'll pass. There has to be some heart, something I can relate to my life, and a break from the sarcasm and chest puffing. I read for enjoyment, not self abuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for audacity","review":"Apparently, Rushdie's fame has given him the audacity to write such bombastic and boring drivel as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book About Nothing and Everything","review":"This novel was more a mesh-mash than anything else. Though it's focused on the life and times of Malik Solanka the main character and reading this novel I identified closely with Malik who leaves his wife and child for New York City to well...lose himself and deal with his \\"fury\\". A form of anger that only the person feeling it can understand. It's like your own personal anger and it's understandable that only you can understand it as it pertains to your personal experiences. Well, Malik seems to play a passive observer to the general absurdity of human society which in part infuriates him at the same time this anger keeps him on the sideline. The other characters don't seem to be fully developed the seem more like personas than actual people but now I am just being picky. This novel carried on more like a Woody Allen film but infinitely more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Down and Out in London and New York","review":"Something made Salman Rushdie, an author of prodigious talents, have to write this book, but you don't have to read it. Rushdie's \\"Midnight's Children\\" and \\"The Satanic Verses\\" soar with their larger than life characters, rich depictions of the Indian subcontinent, lyrical prose, and magic realism, and they tell fine stories. \\"Fury,\\" by contrast, is a ruminating monologue, a screed, which wrestles darkly with American mass culture, the overclass, personas, the political pretensions of the Indian diaspora, intellectual honesty, and the dilemma of love.There is narrative heat here but precious little light. Rushdie's characters fail to engage. His issues fail to resolve. A tragedy worthy of the Greek Furies, who horribly punish unavenged crimes, utterly fails to develop. Unless you happen to be writing your dissertation on Rushdie, you can safely pass on \\"Fury.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but it's a failure for a superb writer like Rushdie","review":"I have eagerly enjoyed all of Mr. Rushdie's previous books. Some were excellent, some were simply good or at least worth reading. This is simply bad. I'm sorry to say this, for I really think Rushdie is an outstanding writer, but this book is sort of a bizarre patchwork that only my loyalty to its author(and the hope that it might improve as I progressed through it, which it did not)prevented me from turning down half way through.Don't waste your time, read any other of his books instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwrought and superficial","review":"The metaphor of fury is a nice a idea, but just doesn't pan out for all of America. Rushdie skims over the surface of things, but doesn't really get past the consumer culture facade he tries to creakily prop up and lampoon. The protagonist is the only character with any depth. Also, the murder and coup subplots are just plain unbelievable. The book reads like a hasty, cutsey, journalistic first draft.Finally, the events of 9/11 make the whole book seem dated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived and disappointing","review":"I was excited to pick up Fury, having read other books by Rushdie and also based on the premise of the book. I was so disappointed, I almost didn't finish it, and I bet I could have guessed the ending had I cared enough to try. I felt like I was being hit over the head with all of the obvious analogies and, since the book is entitled \\"Fury,\\" there's really no need to keep referring to the fury within, the Furies, fury of the city, fury of lust/passion/pain. We get it! And yes, we all know that America in the 21st century is a vast wasteland--move on and get to the point of the story.

It is glossy and well illustrated however it lacks content for anyone who has built a cabinet or two. It does contain some good points on basic cabinet construction that will be beneficial to someone just starting woodworking however if you are looking for construction details on lots of different styles this is not the book for you. The book contains a lot of the same thing with many construction sheets repeated with only minor changes to a single dimension. For example pages 20 to 27, which contain 28 separate construction sheets (one per page), have exactly the same cabinet illustration and cutting list with one minor change in width on each sheet. This pattern appears to be repeated throughout the book (e.g. pages 32-39, 44-59). However like I said it is well made and would be a good first reference but is definitely not for anyone above beginner level."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst Amazon marketplace seller ever!!!!","review":"Of all the Amazon marketplace sellers I have bought from, this one is the worst! Not only did they ship merchandise that was totally different from what they described as \\"used-like new\\" ---it arrived without a dust jacket and corners of the book were totally bent, pages bent and torn, but when I went through the Amazon process of requesting a credit for the item, the refused and kept sending emails for a week asking if I wanted another copy of the same book! Not wanting to deal with them again, I kept stating in emails back to them that all I wanted was a credit for the first damaged book and to return said book to them, but that fell on deaf ears.

This book tells of a tragedy which Marie suffers and how she is devastated by it. It also tells of her promiscuous sex life, and of her flitting from one interest to another, but I could not care about her and while the translation is eminently readable I kept thinking \\"why should I care about this woman?\\" I never found an answer.

The women modeling are pretty much the same, same bone structure, similar weight, skin color, ethnicity and age. There is only one young male model, and one older male model. That part was really disappointing. And what it bother me the most was the background color. in all the pictures is the same, white!. A darker color, gray or black on any other color for that matter would be great! the fact that all the models are REALLY white becomes obnoxious. At certain points the background blends with their sking color, making it hard to differentiate one from the other. With a different background the model would \\"pop-out\\", and the artist's eyes would easily focus on his/her subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best I've found","review":"The poses are great for the most part. The plain white background is great. The lighting can blow out some features occasionally, but it's not a huge deal. The big thing I would like to see is the camera moving around the figure instead of the figure rotating so the lighting direction doesn't change as you rotate.Otherwise, the CD that accompanies is the best I've found. It has plenty of views and is a lot more user friendly than having to sift through 25 photos of the same model.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Resource but...","review":"Good resource, but the author should not \\"fuzz\\" out parts of the body, it's not just annoying, it's disturbing to break the flow of natural features. If the author chooses to \\"fuzz\\" any body part, then the pose should be removed from the pose file. (I have seen some others (not Virtual Pose) even fuzz-out the face). Although, some features are not drawn, the images are disturbing, and borders on mutilation. The models are good, some images distressfull, prefer the author exclude the pose -- rather than obscure the pose. Will return this to Amazon.

Seriously, it would just waste space on a bookshelf.Why don't they show any samples from inside the book? Because if they did, you wouldn't buy it. The photos are small and the poses are awkward, scrunched up on a little platform. The pictures on disk are really disappointing- just as grainy as in the book and it forces you to use a weird animation thing.There's only 80 pages and many of those are taken up with fluff and no photos- which isn't useful at all.

The pianissimi are so beautiful and projected The Price recording is the only competition and I like the contrasts in Gencer's performance even more that the liquid beauty of Price's voice. Di Stefano is the perfect partner for this performance in an unusually sensitive reading. Then you get Cesare Siepi as Padre Guardiano. The voice is liquid gold here.

If you want to own every Avengers novel ever written then you will be satisfied. Otherwise, interlibrary loan the book and then purchase it if you want to afterward. I was very disappointed. MacNee and his co-writer assigned a subservient role to Emma. No humor, no banter. They should have adapted one of the TV scripts that was a delight to watch. The plot was very weak.

I greatly enjoyed Krauze's approach of presenting Mexican history through mini biographies of it leaders for the last two hundred years. You feel like you are reading a series of related essays, which helps in making your way through a book of this size (700+).

He manages to describe nearly 500 years of Mexican history in this giant volume in a highly interesting and entertaining way, with some important insights into how certain events went down in Mexican history, and why (in particular, read the chapter on \\"Collapse of the Criollos\\").My only worry is that it might eventually start getting dated unless Krauze updates it (the book was published in 1997), but I believe its overall history will generally remain good; Krauze tries to avoid succumbing to any type of historical mythology or over-emphasis on \\"heroic figures.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the best approach to past and present mexican really!","review":"Krauze is one of the top three in contemporary Mexican literature, so thats a garanty too!

I have read that book before and I am a fan of the Amelia Peadody-series which I have read completely. The books vary in quality but they are always enjoyable. The present title is one of the most unique stories - best explained as being a satirical citation of Henry Rider Haggards SHE. I also like audiobooks and last year I first heard a Peabody-novel narrated by Barbara Rosenblat. It was quite a treat. I wasn't able to get \\"The last Camel..\\" read by her then, but was content to order this unabridged version read by Susan O'Malley. However, it was the worst audiobook I ever listened to. ...I therefore recommend that if one ever want's to listen to an Elizabeth Peters audiobook than only if Barbara Rosenblat is the narrator.

Along the way Peabody, with her husband and son have uninspired encounters with the local natives in egypt. The native they are traveling with is really a prince of a lost ancient civilization, the crooked porters run off with their camels and supplies. I don't know if it was just incredibly bad forecasting or just that it was so darn predictable, but I found myself wanting to fast forward just to get to the good part.

Egyptologist Amelia Peabody, her husband Emerson, and her son Ramses, are in dire straits on the sun-scorched desert sands when their last camel dies as they are deep in Nubia's vast waste land. Their very survival depends on Amelia being able to solve a mystery as old as ancient Egypt and as timeless as human greed and revenge! The Last Camel Died At Noon is a superbly written mystery by Elizabeth Peters given a flawless narrative performance by Susan O'Malley, and a technically excellent eleven compact disc audiobook format from Blackstone Audiobooks. The Last Camel Died At Noon is also available in a nine 90 minute cassette audiobook format as well (...)."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"If you are like me, and were looking for some original 60's hits, DO NOT buy ANY of these class reunion CD's.

A great 7 minute version of Black Magic Woman sounds pretty good, as does Jumpin at Shadows, and some others. A mixed bag.

Power should also be commended for her passion and idealism on the subject. Unfortunately, though, Power tends to distort the facts to fit in with her pre-conceived conclusions. For another more realistic perspective on genocides and the complexities involved in preventing them, I would recommend instead Alan J. Kuperman's book \\"The Limits of Humanitarian Intervention\\" -- which gives a more well-thought out and detailed analysis of the genocide in Rwanda and possible actions the United States could have taken."},{"rating":"1","title":"melanie from D.C","review":"Samantha Power's book is interesting but, it is misleading in many aspects. It has been lot of writers failure to write about something as deep as a so called genocide topic, without having the expertise that is required to do so.One need not to be turkish or an armenian in order to comment I guess? So, let's leave historical facts to the historians, rather than publishing inefficient books such as these. In fact,her comments reflect her point of view, which provides the reader some perspective of its kind whereas this is not a novel so, it requires a well-established reference and research to write about such a strong topic.For that reason, it is only a book to learn about a different perspective, but that is all that it can contribute."},{"rating":"1","title":"world view translated","review":"speaking as a non-US citizen who studied and spent quite a bit of time there as well as other places all over the world i see this as a watered down translation for an American crowd. while not fully aware of all the events she discusses the ones i were lacked the in depth study but based itself more on easy to understand blocks for consumption and thereby skipping on certain details which were historically critical for the complete story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyper-Hypocrisy","review":"This book would warrant a much higher rating, despite the fact that I disagree with much of it, except for some glaring, unconscionable omissions. Little quarter is granted to the Soviet Empire and Communist China, both of which managed to butcher more of their citizens than even the Nazis. Are Russian and Chinese lives really worth so little, as compared to Rwandan and Jewish lives, as to not even merit acknowledgement in this book? Or could it be that Ms Power has a a pro-communist agenda cloaked in the sanctimonious rhetoric of human rights? Don't waste your time on this book if you are truly concerned with the rights of ALL people, and not just those groups that are deemed worthy of the PC imprimatur. Had Ms Power taken off her ideological blinders, she would have made a very important contribution to the human rights dialog. As is, this book is morally equivalent to Holocaust denial. Have you no shame, Ms Power?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Compatible with Historical Facts","review":"The contents of this book are not only biased/politicized but they also are not compatible with historical facts as provided by eminent historians such as Justin MCCarthy and Bernard Lewis as well as official British, Russian and Turkish records. The contents of this book are well challenged by a new book on the topic by S. A. Weems ' The Secrets of a Christian Terrorist State, Armenia'. The present Republic of Armenia is indeed a totalitarian state of terror according to our state department. Although majority of Armanians including the ones who are living in peace in Turley and the The Republic of Armenia ready to make peace with Turkey such publications unfortunately provoke further hatred especially in these times when we need peace more than ever. In short this book has no credibility with respect to historical facts and well serves the purpose of provoking hatred by spreading misinformation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Omission awarded?","review":"Despite the Israeli policy towards the Palestinians fits the definition of genocide given in the book, Power ignores the Palestinian case.

Samantha Power likes to throw blame to everyone to the Turks who suffered terribly near World War One, to the United States and many others. The Armenians had begun slaughtering and ethnically cleansing the Turks for the purpose of creating an independent Armenia since the 1880s, why does Samantha Power omit such important details about European history?

She shines a bright light into the dark corners where inhumanity flourishes. No one wants to read about genocide because it upsets our sensibility and the false image we carry around in our heads about our supposed love and tolerance for one another. But in spite of what the politicians say, genocide continues to be a defining feature of modern life. This book should be read by everyone concerned about where we are now and where we are headed.

You will be a better person for the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an amazing book, very true to histroy and fact","review":"I have never given a review on any book prior to this, but this book was so well written that I felt I needed to give it review.

I highly recommend this book to anyone that seeks to better understand the concept of genocide.Great job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MISSING THE BOOK","review":"The problem with this book is that the author completely overlooks the culpability of the U.S. in the acts of genocide discussed. The U.S.bombing of Cambodia although not in itself an act of genocide was the reason why peasants flocked to the Khmer Rouge who previously were a marginal group. It was the U.S. who blocked any attempts of the UN to send more soldiers to Rawanda. As well, it was the U.S. that armed Indonesia so that they could attack and occupy East Timor, a clear case of Genocide. etc. etc. etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"While this book was a difficult read, is was well researched and every argument fully supported by factual data. It really makes the reader comprehend what an impossible situation the United Stated is faced with in the age of genocide and what moral responsibility the US has in preventing genocide, if any. The book starts with the foundations of the term \\"genocide\\" and it many interpretations and then focuses on the major genocides in recent history, discussing the role of the US and what the US could have done or should have done to prevent the genocide. The reader is also left to ponder at what cost should the US intervene in international conflicts that have little or no bearing on US interests. This book is a must read for anyone interested in genocide and what role, if any, the US should take to prevent genocide from occurring, if prevention is even possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and depressing","review":"This book is a fascinating look at the unwillingness of the US to act in the face of genocide in other countries. It shares the horrors of Turkey, Germany, Iraq, Cambodia, Bosnia, Rwanda, and other such situations of \\"ethnic cleansing\\" and genocide, and the US's steadfast avoidance of acting when it easily could. It provides a very worthy background for thinking about the obligations (or not) of a so-called moral super power. It also provided an eye opening look at several administrations, casting none of them in a good light.

In fact to give the government such power would require at minimum a curtailment of U.S. citizen rights.There is one way, and one way only, to stop or at least minimize the possibilities of successful genocide. Simply put all people must realize that they have a God given right to defend themselves their families and fellow citizens from aggression in all its forms.Unfortunately, to teach such a viewpoint wpould be diametrically opposite to the beliefs of most authors who decry Genocide."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Naive Historian","review":"While this book addresses serious and important issues regarding genocide and U.S. policy regarding such, it ignores a great deal of American history...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Often in error, seldom in doubt","review":"Power defines \\"genocide\\" so broadly that it includes virtually any criminal act in the world, and she argues that the U.S. has a duty to predict and intervene in any situation to which her definition applies. She wants the U.S. to become the \\"Big Brother\\" of the world. She does not supply any historical or philosophical evidence to support her fantastic thesis. Her recent appearance on Bill Moyer's weekly PBS program did not enhance her credibility. She is one of those persons who believes that she knows everything and expects others to accept her statements without question. On course, Moyers nevcer asked for her evidence.

The author should have looked at culprits like the French(whohanded over Jews to the Nazis and whose forces did nothing to prevent the slaughter in Rwanda).The book should accuse the world community in its weakness in preventing genocide even though in each of the cases the world knew exactly what was happening.

Amongst the books which in my eyes offer more are\\"Bf109, Classic aircraft no. 2, their history and how to model them\\" (offers a wealth of information about the early Bf109's);\\"Messerschmitt 0-nine gallery\\"(offers a wealth of information about the later Bf109's);the three books in the Monogram close-up series (Gustav 1 and 2 and Bf109K) and\\"The Ausburg Eagle, a documentary history\\",but generally these books are bigger and therefore able to pack more information.

Where are our inventors, musicians, explorers (space) and just ordinary hard working people. A waste of paper and time preparing. Thanks to the Amazon return policy I had it out of the house in 24 hours. Admittedly, I only glanced at the pictures and looked at the table of contents, but that was enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee Table Books For Dummies","review":"Isn't it funny that a book allegedly written by \\"Journalists\\" and \\"Reporters\\" can be so poorly fact-checked as this one is? First off, Jennings purports that the 20th Century ends at December 31, 1999. It doesn't. It ends December 31, 2000, so says the Royal Greenwich Observatory and the United States Naval Observatory.Besides that, as others have pointed out in these reviews, way too many people have been left out of \\"The Century\\" - as if their contributions to history do not matter nor exist.It's a nice-looking coffee table book, but those who buy it should not think for a second that it is anything more than a glossy and large (if narrow) view of the past 98 1/2 years. There are many better history books out there if that's what you're after."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Century that forgot the Titanic Sinking!","review":"Peter Jennings forgot one of the most talked about accidents in history. How could he write about the century and forget the sinking of the Titanic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"A fair job on content, a great job on photography. This isn't the definitive work on the century, but it has its strong points. I bet Paul Johnson liked the pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Armenian Genocide","review":"No book reviewing the 20th century should be allowed to print without mentioning the Armenian Genocide during World War One. It was the first genocide of the 20th century. Over one million Armenians were murdered in Turkey. I guess Peter Jennings is very friendly with the Turkish government. I guess the truth is again suppressed. So what's new?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Century","review":"The publication date pf 1998 is just shy of a century, which is the title of the textbook. I personally think the book is excellent (I am a history lover) but to stay true to the title, the book probably should have been published in 2001, which would then incorporate a century (1900-2000). All in all, it is an excellent book and compares favorably with other historic accounts of the decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great text about the last century","review":"The CENTURY is an excellent collection of narrative and photography from the last century. If you know who Peter Jennings is and what he sounds like, you can hear his voice as you read this book. It is not a fast read, more of a coffee table book to browse thru and most likely to spark conversation. Some of the photos could have been better edited.-ex. There is a BEATLES photo that catches all four of them with their eyes in between blinks. That seemed to be a poor choice by the editors of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting for what is included","review":"I liked the book, it is very readable and the pictures and sidebars help maintain interest. Obviously no single book (even at 600 pages) can cover every significant event of the century. I focused more on what the authors selected for inclusion and their heavy emphasis on wars. I was also struck by similarities between the periods 1918-1929 and 1988-1999."},{"rating":"1","title":"A view of the century for Americans by Americans","review":"I really expected a more international flavour from a transplanted Canadian like Peter Jennings. The authors almost forget that there are people outside the United States that shaped peoples lives and defined the century. A more appropriate title would have been \\"The Century as Seen by Uncle Sam\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Most excellent!","review":"I enjoyed reading the one page excerpts from people's lives. For example: Eva Krutein's experiences of a young woman with a small child surviving in a destroyed Germany is heart wrenching and enlightening. The pictures are inspiring. The history is a wonderful recap. I look forward to Mr. Jennings' TV show on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"At the dawn of a new millennium...","review":"As I read this book I am moved by many thoughts and emotions: pride about having being part of the \\"information generation\\"; sadness about the fact that this century is almost over; amazement about all that has been accomplished; anticipation and hope about the coming millennium. This book could not be timelier. Peter Jennings and Todd Brewster have done a wonderful job in summarizing this amazing century in 608 wonderfully written and illustrated pages. This book will become a classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great listen","review":"I bought the audio version of this because I drive a long way to a summer place every weekend, and have found the tapes riveting. The sections on the two world wars were especially compelling--for the first time I understood the power of Hitler over a Germany reeling from the double whammy of WWI and the Depression. The section on WWI was unbelievable--with all that came after it is easy to forget how cruel and bloody and POINTLESS that conflict was. Frankly, audio books tend to put me to sleep, but with the voices of live participants in the events, the music, the sound clips and the Jennings naration, this one was a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great overview of the 20th century.","review":"Unlike many who read this book,I didn't expectfor this to be a complete and detailed history. When you look at it as a historical overview of the growth of people in the 20th century. and their sometimes downful,it can be very wonderful reading. Some of the personal stories felt and sounded like stories I heard from my Grandfather and Father and later stories I told my children. Bravo for this wonderful readbradley2@"},{"rating":"1","title":"Future historians will find it worthless.","review":"If this book was intended to be a summary of news stories, embellished by anecdotal information, then the authors' objectives have been met.If, however, the authors were hoping to memorialize events which, at the end of the next century, left an imprint on our nation and the world, then they missed the boat.The impact of surging human populations, and the complications resulting from migration, have been the story of our century. But it never became the story for Jennings' The Century. Future historians in the next 100 years will look back on demographics and migration as having a profound impact on our culture, civilization, freedoms and body of laws.Migration was mentioned for the 1920s. Thereafter, the issue vanished from the book. But it has not vanished for the rest of us.It is lamentable that a 606 page work on The Century would overlook these factors."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book fails the Emma Goldman Test","review":"How can a book that proports to cover the history of the US this century not even mention Emma Goldman? Yet it does includes Bernard Geotz. It only makes a passing mention of anarchists in a reference to the Russian Revolution. The American Century by Harold Evans is a much better book. The book is a hack job which would be best out of print."},{"rating":"1","title":"yada yada yada","review":"The question isn't what the book leaves out. Armenians, Italians, the Titanic -- OK, but what do you want from one book, fat as it is? My beef is that it's so predictable. Nothing surprising, nothing daring, nothing unconventional, nothing I couldn't have gotten from Life magazine, but the whole thing is shot through with this smug sense of \\"Has ABC News got a Century for you!\\" Clearly what they really wanted were blockbuster bestseller and an anointed \\"intellectual\\" anchor."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Jennings were re-writing history it would be much shorter","review":"HOW COULD A MAN OF JENNINGS CALIBER WRITE A BOOK ENTITLED \\"THE CENTURY\\" AND FORGET TO INCLUDE THE SINKING IF THE TITANIC? THERE ARE ABOUT TWO OR THREE OTHER BOOKS ON THE MARKET WHICH COVER THE 20TH CENTURY. MY ADVICE IS TO GO AND FIND THEM AND BUY ANY OF THOSE AND NOT THIS ONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable reading with great personal accounts","review":"I was pleased with the ease at which one can read this book. Unlike the majority of history books, this book keeps the reader's attention and provides interesting personal accounts by people who experienced these monumental events and periods of history. It is much easier to identify with a person who is telling you about their life and how history shaped their activities than to read a narrative account of \\"the way it was..\\" I think the average reader as well as history buffs alike will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"TV Journalism in print","review":"I have to admit I didn't read the entire thing; I started reading it in a Borders and finally put it back, pretty much disgusted with the shallowness and the boas of the book.Even the presence of a Jennings' ghost writer doesn't save this thing. It's a picture book for the MTV generation, catering to fashionable views with nothing that you could call scholarship. At best it's a comic book that might interest a child in delving deeper into a subject.A far more interesting and detailed book (though just as biased in its own way) is Paul Johnson's \\"Modern Times\\". If you buy the Jennings book, get Johnson's as well and from the two you may get a more interesting and complete picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dick and Jane on leadership","review":"This book is 150 pages dedicated to some very simple principals. Create open communication, follow through, and treat others as you want to be treated. Do we need 150 pages of cutesy story to get that message across? I don't think so and do not see the value proposition in this book. If you want a good book on getting things done, buy Execution by Bossidy. If you want to learn leadership and communication principals, read anything by Maxwell (I would recommend reading several). Unless you are targeting someone just entering leadership with no skills, I can't see them getting much from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well researched and compelling written biography.","review":"Simon Schama's rich biography of Rembrandt, Rembrandt's Eyes uses his pictures to reconstruct his life, weaving descriptions and interpretations of his works with a dialogue which examines Rembrandt's life and times anew. This is a recommended pick for those who already have a more casual perspective of the artist, and who are seeking in-depth information. Artistic criticism, literature and scholarship blends in an excellent survey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive, Exhaustive, but......","review":"I agree with most of the 4 and 5 star reviewers that this is an amazing tour de force. My only objections to keep this from 5 star are the bizarre use of profanity in places where most scholarly works would use a euphemism. Maybe calling a spade a spade or 'dung', 's..t' appeals to some but it distracts for me. Also, a lot of the excessive detail detracts. Even so I learned a lot. The analysis of \\"Night Watch\\" is the best I've ever read. Overall I would recommend reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't have a focus and objective....very boring","review":"When i bought this book, I thought that it would be an amazing and definitive book about one of the most brilliant genius of art.But i was wrong, this is doesn't have a point, it goes to the biography of Rubens fathers, passing thru history, economy, and anything else you imagine, this is so borring for the people that actually want to know about Rembrandt and his work. So if you are looking for a book abou Rembrand and his work, this IS NOT...."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent guide for Panama Canal Visitors","review":"Anne Vipond continues her series of excellent books with this guide to cruising the Panama Canal. Really, anyone visiting Panama would find this book useful, but people on cruise ships will find it invaluable. Anne does an excellent job of relating the history and geography of the Panama Canal. She also delves into the details of the actual ports, including the new cruise port in Colon. This is the best guide to the shore excursions from Colon and on Gatun Lake. If you're traveling the Panama Canal, this book will bring you much better understanding of this unique destination. Anyone who will be debarking for the day in Panama will find that the book will save them much time and money. Highly Recommended!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I too am disappointed in this book. It's all over the place with other destinations, format is terrible.

I got it because Garmin claims it reads depth accurately in shallow water. I am really pleased with it. It is very accurate and doesn't flake out like an older Piranha Max unit I had previously. Also a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price, but...","review":"I could give it 5 stars for the graph itself, but I could give it 0 for the universal Transom/Trollmotor transducer. It hangs down low under the trolling motor housing in harms way. (Go to Garmin's website and download the owner's manual to view how the transducer mounts to the motor).I broke it first time out. I fabricated a mounting bracket from aluminum plate. So far so good. This product should be available with a puck style transducer just for mounting to trolling motor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Fishfinder 140","review":"For the money, this fish finder works great. Installation is fairly simple. The lead wire could have a plug-in so as to be able to run through installed wire chases."},{"rating":"2","title":"fishfinder","review":"Installtion was easy for transducer and main unit. The picture is clear and has enough detail. It worked well in shallow as well as deep water and up to speeds of about 20-25 mph. Positioning the transducer farther from turbulant (lift starkes etc.) water may help higher speed operation, but it's more than sufficient as is. The unit has never locked up on me. I'd get one for my other boat, but it seems as if they as hard to find now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I've had this product for 3 months and it stopped working 3 weeks ago. It simply will not turn on and prior to it not working anymore it has problems with freezing and not scanning. If you move from shallow to deep water you have to reset the unit for it to start reading the bottom correctly. Sometimes it will stop reading all together and you have to reset the unit. It takes about 30 seconds between resets for it to start reading the bottom correctly. The plug that goes into the back of the unit doesn't always seat in correctly. So sometimes it takes several attempts to seat it before all of the pins make contact.The only good thing is that it did come with a trolling motor mount."},{"rating":"2","title":"...Pleased...","review":"This fish finder is what it says it is. A basic entry level unit. With that being said I think it's somewhat better than just entry level. Having several settings that can be adjusted and changed left me feeling better in control of the information I recieve. Like that! Large, clear info with sound(beeps). The display is easly viewable in direct sunlight and is backlite for night. Comes with mounting bracket that turns and tilts but is not heavy duty. Off shore rigs might want to upgrade to a stronger mount, but for the lakes in TN it seems to be just fine. Only bad thing to say would be the size of the transducer plug. The plug is way to big! Cutting a 1\\" hole into a transom is not for the weak at heart. Then had to come with a large sealing gromet, sealant and large clam shell. None of which is included. Over-all, very pleased! I really like the water temp and voltage display. Unit seems to be well worth the money invested."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"excellent they have all worked for me and are still working on the boats I have.

The unit has 6 wires in a 22 pin plug.If it was not for time rquirements I would have sent it back.Garmin if you are going to continue along this idea, include a wire cover big enough to cover the massive hole!Then Garmin elected to ignore my complaint.Good Job Garmin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fishfinder 140","review":"This fishfinder works well and is easy to read, even in bright sunlight. It gives reliable information at all boat speeds. The price I got the unit for was 20% cheaper than any of the local outlets. The only drawback is during installation. Due to the size of the electrical connector, to attach the transducer cord to the back of the fishfinder, it makes it fairly difficult to thread through the hull of the boat, but once in, the unit works fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great depthfinder!","review":"The Garmin 140 replaced a Lowrance unit I've had on my boat for 7 years, and it's got many features the Lowrance didn't have, including dual frequency transducer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this","review":"Fab product, arrived as described new, works as described.

However, this unit was easy to operate and it gave depth readings that matched the chart that I was following.

However, for the most part it seemed to give an accurate reading and showed the structures that I expected to see.Also, the screen is easy to use, the buttons are easy to operate, and the menu seemed intuitive. I'll get around to reading the instruction manual sooner or later, but the default settings seemed to work just fine.With some modifications to this item (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009PCP6I), I was able to have a nice, portable fish finder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a size chart so you can order the right size","review":"I ended up googling these type of panty hose so i could try and find a size chart in order to make sure i got the right size and didn't just guess.

It actually reads much more like an essay. This is a message book...Rosenbaum has a rather heavy-handed message that he is bent on delivering. There is a tremendous lack of depth or realness in the characters and the plot is overly contrived and uninvolving. The reason is simply that the characters are only devices Rosenbaum uses to further communicate his message. Indeed, the characters are anything but fully fleshed out (no pun intended)...they as well as everything about this book exists for the sole purpose of preaching. Very uninvolving. The message itself is educational and somewhat interesting, but buyer beware - this is an overlong essay...not a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I bought this book in the interest of getting a sense of the work of some of the writers that Rosenbaum includes in his cast; I finished GOLEMS hoping that the rambling would led to a satisfying end. Neither of these ideas panned out. Reading Andrine's review, I was so relieved to read that someone agreed that book just didn't do anything interesting with its material.Also, based on the little research I've done on the topic and the other, better books I've read that include them, Rosenbaum's golems aren't even golems. What's going on with that? A much better book that includes the concept and some satisfying background information on its history is Marge Piercy's Body of Glass (published in the States as He, She, and It)."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did I manage to get through this?","review":"I began this novel because a friend sent it to me when we were studying Primo Levi together. What begins as a fascinating premise deteriorates into tedium within a hundred pages. Would that he had stopped there! I agree with the reviewers who describe the characters as uninvolving, worse, self-pitying and boring, even the great writers who are invoked. Primo Levi, Jean Amery and the other golems would be embarrassed by the quality of the writing. I can't believe Elie Wiesel would approve, either.

I kept wondering whether his editor was on vacation for allowing the contant ranting and philosophical tangents, leaving absent the \\"showing\\" that might have been more appropriate to a novel. The story had interesting ideas to explore regarding holocaust victims and their children, but doesn't bring any light to the ideas, just a overblown ghost story which doesn't deal with the concept of \\"golem\\" at all and instead virtually slanders a generation of disturbed writers, despite the apology at the outset of the novel.

Given the acoustics in the church where this is recorded is quite vibrant he allows loads of breathing space at phrase ends (especially in louder passages) and this helps with resultant murky textures.

If the whole purpose of this book is THE SONG OF THE 144000, that alone makes it worth reading. In reading this book I noted twelve pages I want to go back to read again and again.

It is imaginative in places, and wordy and trite almost continually. As novels go, not so good, and that's the scary part. With all the glowing reviews, either they're planted or some people must want to believe this is a true account. Doesn't anyone out there see the reasons to doubt the veracity of the author?

That is only one element of the importance of children's picture books -- the STORY is really the main event that sparks imaginations and opens those priceless discussions. Trupp did not do that for us.As others here have pointed out, Trupp kind of meanders pointlessly on a journey that ends rather abruptly. The moral of the story is compassion and kindness to the homeless. I felt that this message was a little obvious and heavyhanded; it almost substituted for an actual storyline. In the end, Trupp: a Fuzzhead Tale comes across as bland and preachy.There are not a lot of children's picture books out there that address the homeless, and for that I must give Cannon credit for trying to touch on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Social commentary","review":"Add the phrases \\"in the mountains of Tora Bora\\" and \\"burqa\\" and name the described city as New York and you have yourself a whole other (intended?) tale.

But he is aware of the fact that the primary systems of analysis are very limited to these traditional sounds and harmonies. Therefore Schoenberg sets out to put into work a new system for harmonic analysis which will work fine on traditional harmonies as well as on newer, more outside progressions. He achieves all of this through his idea of regions within music, a specific idea with a broad goal. By leaving the intricacies of traditional harmonic analysis and widening his scope, Schoenberg presents a system we may all need to take a second look at."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice supplementary book on harmony","review":"This book will be difficult for those without a deep knowledge of how western harmony works.

Hodges's book. . . is that to the best of my knowledge not one significant interpreter of Scripture in the entire history of the church has held to Hodges' interpretation of the passages he treats. That does not necessarily mean Hodges is wrong; but it certainly means he is probably wrong, and it probably means he has not reflected seriously enough on the array of fallacies connected with [reading one's own presuppositions into the biblical text].\\"Hodges' book is a classic example of agenda-driven exegesis.

I found little new information that wasn't culled from her previous books--\\"Poison Pen...\\", \\"Conversations with the Spirit World, or her online diaries. (which have been removed). I expected the book to have the chronological flow of a diary, but, though there were some amazing stories, I found they were difficult to follow.As for the self-help advice. Too much \\"Do\\" and not enough realistic \\"How to\\".I feel Lysa could have provided much more depth and insight than could be absorbed and utilized in a \\"couldn't put down\\", \\"read in 24 hours\\", quick fix book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Real","review":"I was glad that Lysa didn't write another book that says all you have to do is give it to god or prey to your angels to work out your problems. She honestly states that you have to do it yourself. If you want something you have to go after it wether you fail in the process or not. You really do have to work it out yourself. No one is going to do it for you but you. But Lysa what do you do if you have a burning desire every day of your life to do something but you don't know what it is because you don't have any talents. I mean none.

That alone holds your attention, but I really think the biographical areas are not as interesting or as necessary as she seems to think. But it is good to see the story of a psychic's life where the psychic was not foretelling someone's future by the time she was 5. Lysa seems to be such a regular person, a person who sort of became this thing later in life. It gives hope to the rest of us that we might too find out there is much, much more to be being human than we think."},{"rating":"2","title":"saved my life - thank you","review":"I just wanted to take a moment to thank you, Lysa, for saving my life.

In particular I like to know the reasons for the inclusion of certain features.There are many books available about castles, but this is the one that best suits my needs. The first chapter deals with the early beginnings of fortifications, which involved only building walls around towns. Subsequent chapters give information on historical advances in design of castles, country by country, covering Britain and the European continent. There are even a few pages on Japanese fortresses, South American fortifications and North American forts.The production is classy, being printed on quality paper with appropriate and plentiful coloured illustrations. It is large enough to allow sufficient detail for the interested amateur, but is still not too big and heavy to hold comfortably while seated in your favourite armchair."},{"rating":"1","title":"The History of Castles","review":"I ordered this book with high expectations. Alas, it was a waste of money. The author, I'm sure, knows a lot about castles. However, he is not at all articulate in communicating his knowledge and he has as much logical organisation as a dozen monkeys sitting at typewriters and gibbering away at random. At times, technical terms are introduced without definition, and without appearing in the very limited glossary at the back of the book. Not even the images can make an investment in this book worthwhile -- if arranged and annotated more helpfully, they could have been instructive but as matters stand they are about as much help, and have about as much aesthetic appeal, as holiday snaps found in an abandoned album."},{"rating":"1","title":"no loop for the lens strap","review":"had i known this lens cap did NOT come with a loop so that i can attach it to the lens strap, i would NOT have bought it... its hard to imagine a lens cap you you have to put into your pocket each time you use the camera... it'll be lost in a week...anyway...a waste of $3.49 plus $6.95 shipping..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Children Suffer","review":"James Q. Wilson's book is an enlightening look at the state of marriage in America (although he cites statistics from other countries as well.) The work is easy to read and is credible. The reader will gain a clearer understanding of what is happening to families in the U.S. The children, of course, are the victims in the breakdown of the family. As they grow up, the cycle of divorce and single parenting continues. Wilson gives adequate solutions to these grave social problems that we face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasticness!","review":"A fantastic jazz reed!

It is a psychological thriller that alternates the narrative between two surviving victims of \\"the Student Slasher\\", a serial killer who brutalizes female university students in a grisly manner. This is tightly woven, suspenseful story of revenge told in tandem from two perspectives until they merge for a satisfying climax."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Cut by Peter Robinson","review":"I have loved all of his books with Chief Inspector Alan Banks, this book is a \\"stand alone\\" book, but he writes great."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Depressing Dissapointment","review":"I discovered Robinson this spring, when I picked up a copy of the wonderful In A Dry Season, and have spent the summer happily reading everything he's written. The First Cut was the only dissapointment in the bunch. Such a depressing novel that I couldn't finish it: too many books and too little time. While I understand that women who have been brutally assualted would also be depressed, it does not make for exciting reading, rather the opposite.While I love Robinson's measured rather than frantic pace, his novels full of texture from description of sceanery to the so human evolution of Bank's personality, this book lacked that texture. Rather, it was monotone, like a slow, boring tunnel that leads to the conclusion with no sceanery along the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"no psychological thriller","review":"After reading the online reviews of this book, I was all set for a psychological thriller, but it was anything but.

If you like mysteries, this book is it. It is also very well-written ~~ like Agatha Christie mystery and clean too ~~ with a very few smattering of curse words or sex.

Because it deals with subjects, rather than code sections, it is much easier to understand. For instance, weapons laws can be found in the Penal Code, Vehicle Code, Health and Safety Code, Military and Veterans Code, Government Code and so forth. This book puts all the weapons laws in one section, making them far easier to undestand. It is an easy read, in that besides listing the laws, case laws are presented with the reasoning behind them. This is, BY FAR, the best book on the subject I have encountered and I highly recommend it for anyone who is in a police academy or taking police promotionals where an understanding of California criminal law may be important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!","review":"I bought these covers last year and they cracked and split right away.

After all, the stories of these guys are well documented to the point of pop legend. Mark Leibovich, however, shows that in capable hands much can be learned through looking at the past, present, and future.He writes in a clear, direct tone and has obviously done a ton of research. One of the best things he does is lay out the facts objectively and let the reader reach his/her own conclusions about his subjects ( e.g, 'Are Gates, Ellison ruthless'? ) and about the big picture ( 'Does the burst of the bubble diminish tech in general' ?)

I did some research and found out that Broderbund licenses the Kidpix title to two different companies one the maker of this version Riverdeep and the other Mackiev. Mackiev has spent quite a bit of resources developing their version and it shows in the quality of their work. If you have Mac OSX you should buy KidPix 3X available at the Mac Store. It is more expensive but in this case you definetely get what you pay for. KidPix 3X not only runs on OSX but it is integrated with the ILife applications among many other incredible features.

This collection includes some of Petula's own hits plus her interpretations of classic songs from that decade. The immortal Downtown, Don't Sleep In The Subway and This Is My Song fall into the first category. Her elegant covers of We Can Work It Out, Groovy Kind Of Love, Let It Be Me and Games People Play have that 60s magic and are great to hear in a female vocal. Every track is enjoyable with her appealing voice and the lush instrumentation. The title \\"The Essential\\" is probably a bit misleading as there are plenty of compilations available with a broader spectrum of her own hits, which were many. Nevertheless, this album is a wonderful way to relive those golden years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but not well","review":"This tripod features a quick release and easy flip from portrait shooting to landscape shooting, however, when in landscape mode the tri-pod mounting surface never goes flat, so all your pictures come out crooked with no way to adjust it.

To say it is poor quality is an understatement! It is very cheaply made of low quality tin and plastic - it reminds me of cheap toys I had as a child. The telescoping legs don't even have locks on all the sections. The quick-release plate is held in place by a single, cheap looking screw, and is very wobbly.

The phone is inserted face-in to protect the screen. The only down side is that the phone will only fit without a protective jacket.

I had been reluctant to purchase it because it was so very unglamorous. However, it has been a godsend to my combination skin. I very rarely break out, and when I do it is much less severe than it used to be, and I don't use any acne medications. I used to think that I needed to use harsh cleansers to clean the oil from my skin, but in fact, those harsh cleansers strip your skin so severely they increase oil production. No other product makes my skin as soft and smooth. It's also perfect for delicate areas such as your decolletage and feminine regions, and cleans makeup without irritating skin or eyes.When I want to exfoliate a few times a week I use Cetaphil with a teaspoon of sea salt.

After several uses, I started noticing tiny little bumps popping up alllll over my face. My face seriously looked like I had goose bumps all the time. I immediately stopped using it, and it took over a week for my skin to completely clear up!

It is amazing to see how Karajan succeeded to destroy even this. As usual, his performance is very sharp, very smooth, but reveals no true sentiment. Karajan and his orchestra remain cold even in the most sensitive pieces, and only the excellent solo singers give it some human touch (take the \\"Herr\\" for instance). the worst parts are the fortissimo bars, where Karajan, ready to battle, reaches his peak of arrogance and violence.If you are looking for a moving performance - take Barenboim.

But they don't scrub down hard enough to get it up without taking me an hour at least in my kitchen and dining area. PLUS after about an hour or even less, something happens to the machine that lifts the scubbers in protest and I have to let it rest for a bit before it will work again. So yes, I was disappointed, but then again, maybe my expectations were too high and I need to bite the bullet and re-tile my floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unorthodox to say the least.","review":"Leonard Bernstein adopted some SLOW tempos in his late DG recordings.

Now the motor cannot turn the blades, so it is useless. Can't find replacement parts, so it has to go in the trash.

As you make a drink it will leak all over the counter as soon as you pour in liquid. I sure didn't get my money's worth out of this and you probably won't either.

Then it becomes difficult to get the cap on & off, or the dispenser starts leaking. Once I tried to clean the container without removing the dispenser. True story--the next time I went to use my smoothie maker, there were fly larvae in the dispenser. Disgusting. I was on my 2nd Back to Basics smoothie maker pro when the glass container broke. Come to find out, there are no replacement parts. I purchased a Kitchenaid 3 speed blender. Not only does it make better smoothies, in way less time--you do not even need a stir stick and it is so easy to clean. Well worth the extra cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective blender base, cracks easily","review":"I too own this blender, & instantly fell in love with the power & ability to grind large quantities of ice. I new it was too good to be true though. After about a year & a half of ownership, one day my wife & I were making some smoothies when we noticed liquid running all over the counter. First thought was we assembled the gasket wrong after its last cleaning. So after cleaning up the mess, we took it apart, and discovered a very long hairline crack within the base. At least two other reviewers also had this same problem, so I don't think it was just my bad luck.To make matters worse, the only place we could find replacement parts was from the manufacturer's website. The part is only $7.00 dollars, but you have to pay almost another $10.00 to get it shipped. Add tax, and you're at half the cost of the blender!My recommendation: Pass on this unit due to a potential defect in the blender base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great honeymoon period....","review":"Blender did what it was supposed to do, that is, blend fruit into shakes, for about 6 months of use. I was happy.Blender comes with 2 caps for the base - a small screw on tap and a spout. The spout is difficult to clean and adds little benefit so I used the screw on cap. After about 6 months the cap cracked from normal wear and tear and smoothie maker began leak into the base and on the counter top. I reverted to using the spout cap and this cracked after 3--that's right 3--uses. I resorted back to using the small cap wrapped in a towel for about 2 months. Then yesterday during blending the base started to smoke as the bottom part of the blade ground into the smoothie base it is attached to. Plastic splintered everywhere and now I have no smoothie.If a good blender for you is 6 months worth of use, buy this blender.

Before she left she asked if I wanted anything in particular as a souvenir; I said get something interesting from a record store. She found a small shop in Sydney and asked the man at the counter for something poppy, uniquely Australian, and which hadn't made it to the US yet. He handed her this album. I didn't know what to make of it after playing it the first time -- it starts out with a mournful classical piece that would make the Kronos Quartet proud, then segues into fanciful folk-pop. But the more I listened to it, the more I (and my housemate) fell in love with it and had a hard time extracting it from the CD player. It's a bit schizophrenic in tone and tune, veering between the brooding instrumentals of the title and the frisky pop-oriented songs (which evoke John Prine and Greg Brown). But ultimately, the whole is definitely worth the sum of its parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing performances","review":"This DVD gives you amazing performances by some of the best out there: Sheryl Crow, Shawn Colvin, the Indigo Girls, and Sarah Mclachlan are all brilliant, and Meredith Brooks and Jewel are in fine form too. The interviews are great, and the backstage jam session with Crow and the Indigo Girls -- they're teaching her \\"Tried to be True\\" -- is a little gem that (as another reviewer noted) captures the spirit of Lilith Fair beautifully.On the technical end: the camera work is marvelous, with closeups and great angles for that you-are-there feeling. In fact I would have given this DVD 5 stars but for the occasionally spotty sound. I can't comment on the 5.1 because I've only got stereo. But be forewarned that at times the volume drops suddenly and inexplicably; and in a couple of places, the muddy mix cheats the listener, as in the closing moments of Crow's otherwise gorgeous \\"I Shall Believe.\\"Even so, I wouldn't have missed this for anything.

However, this CD is awful. There is no song on it that was not vastly better done by The Beatles. Instead of the group singing that once marked the Persuasions it is merely a lead singer singing everything at the same pace (one song is nearly indistinguishable from any other) with the other members of the group doing a little doo wop on the side.

This is without a doubt the worst recording of this symphony I have ever heard (I have heard at least 20). The combination of an infantile humor in the dance sections with a grotesque portentousness elsewhere is unique in my music listening experience. It sounds as if the conductor is alternately a drunken Bugs Bunny and Von Karajan at his worst. And does the scherzo plod on and on and on...Can this be the great Concertgebouw? They are technically fine, but sound like the backup band for a Jerry Herman show. How did Lenny achieve this? The musicians must have laughed all the way home.It would be a genuine shame if someone coming to this music for the first time judged it by this distorted egomaniacal performance. Instead, try Kubelik, Haitink 1 or Walter. Or for moments of true Mahlerian genius, listen to Horenstein, if you can find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Stories, written with \\"Flair\\"","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book!! Although I am not involved in the classical/orchestra type of music field, I found the many stories and experiences of the writer to be outrageously humorous and insightful. It definitely provides a different perspective of this industry, similar to the scene in Dead Poet's Society, where the teacher makes all the students view the room from standing on top of his desk. There is definitely a profound amount of humor and subtle wit that went into the making of this book. I would suggest it for anyone who appreciates music, regardless of the style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justin Locke is a convivial storyteller with a personal touch.","review":"To one critical reviewer who thought that Justin Locke's book was 'disjointed,' I must defend the author.

As a fellow musician whose history is full of similar stories, I must thank him for being so candid and yet gentle with all the principals in the drama, notably Arthur Fiedler.

Russian of the main singers is bearable enough, especially comparing to the Solti interpretation that sounds really strange. I mean pretty strange conducting, strange choose for the singers, and dreadful, unprofessionally sounding Russian. I can point out just two strong points of that interpretation, which are Giaurov as Gremin and thorough booklet. Otherwise Levine's CD is fine. Probably, Freni is the best Tatiana recorded ever, Shikoff is fabulous (just compare with Burrows!), Levine conducts agreeably, and the record is beautifully scaled.

The first book in this trilogy is awesome. The second book was so-so and naturally I thought the final book of the trilogy would boost the worthiness of reading the second book. I got to a point when reading this book that I just wanted to discard it and move onto something better. I do not expect spectacular dialogue or likeable characters from the Warhammer universe because it is a very dark and depressing atmosphere. This book made Watsons work with that horrible A.I. flick seem genius. My greatest problem with the book is that none of the storylines from the trilogy come to a conclusion.

Warning warning. Donate your money to a worthy charity. On no account buy this book. Ostensibly written by Ian Watson who did such a astonishingly marvellous job with ''INQUISITOR'' (the 1st in this trilogy), ''Chaos Child'' (the 3rd book in this trilogy) does not have any meaningful plot, no action to speak of, no logical sequencing, just utter, utter inexplicable confusion. Its as if Ian Watson commissioned a ghost-writer who is unfamiliar with the rich and baroquely complex WH40K universe, then did nothing but proof-read spelling errors and lent his name to the titlepage. An utter utter waste of time and money for the reader. This is the first book EVER that I have reviewed that I use the term execrable. Its not even so bad that - sometimes - it became good.

With that in mind I thought the Aviation and Space treatment was good in variety and detail presented.The ideas presented throughout the book of complexity and coupling make a lot of sense. The drawback to this book is that it was written in the 80's and updated in 1999. I wish I remembered more of some accidents described beyond the headlines. Some of the accidents are great examples of how analysis both in depth and quick at a glance still miss the big picture.I plan to read the Author's follow on book recently published (The Next Catastrophe...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"prejudice and scientific facts?","review":"I was intrigued by the title of the book. I was disappointed by the contents. This book is high on fear factors and prejudice and low on verifiable facts. Far from downplaying the risks of complex physical and chemical plants I still feel that this books lacks the data required for a serious piece of work and instead takes the easy route of scaremongering.Since I prefer to back up my feelings with verifiable facts I checked out the author on the number of citations on publications in the scientific literature. Unfortunately these coincided with my own impressions. Very few references to this work, or any other scientific publication co-authored by this author, are made.If you're afraid of nuclear reactors and DNA this book could become one of your Bibles.

Safety and reliability engineers prefer quantitative approaches, which are abundantly available in the area of systems reliability.The author does have an attractive style of writing. Especially the presentation on dam failures (the Grand Teton, the Malpasset and Vaiont dam failures) was interesting to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introduction to systems analysis of risks","review":"This is a fascinating analysis of some famous and some not-so-famous accidents.

The book built on Perrow's years' of experiences on the interactions between technologies and organizations, and launched a subfield of management researchers looking at the social-technological construction of catastrophes.

The sets are wonderful, but it's the story development that makes this series so delightful. In the second season, Owen, the Torchwood doctor, comes front and center. Without giving away too much plot, he becomes the ying to Jack's yang: the man who can't die. It was an unexpected and interesting plot development. There is also a wacky episode around Gwen's wedding, which gives new meaning to a wedding day gone wrong. We also learn a bit more about Jack's childhood in the far future.

This Bruckner 8th dates from a concert in Oct. 1988; he had less than a year to live. The 8th was a work Karajan felt especially close to, and all three recordings that I have from him are outstanding, yet as he aged I often found myself out of sympathy with Karajan's approach, once it lost its fire and inner life. In his prime he was far from being a cool, aristocratic, cosmopolitan musician, whatever his personality may have been.In many ways this valedictory Eighth belies all expectations. It is, for me, the greatest recording from Karajan's last decade. The Adagio alone is a mircle of expression, pacing, and innigkeit. I value the contemporary Giulini recording that's so highly praised here, and also the more recent Boulez reading. But if I had to choose, this CD would be my desert island choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful playing, pity about the conducting.","review":"As all ways with this conductor, the music comes a distant second. And while most Italian opera survived Karajan's showmanship and superficiality. The music of Bruckner most often died a horrible death.

I am not a big Karajan fan. But no matter how hard I try, after I listened to this Bruckner's 8th by Karajan, no other is doing it for me. Karajan's tempo, his weighty orchestration, the atmosphere this recording creates is simply absent in any other Bruckner 8th. There is something massive about the way Karajan conducts this one. The Hi fidelity crytstal clear sterophonic sound creates such a panaromic spectrum, so grand, so large. The last movement under Karajan almost feels like the soundtrack of a the dark knight batman movie. Theatrical, Epic, Grandiose, Solemn, Sturdy, Polished....come to mind. Bruckner heaven."},{"rating":"2","title":"a search for an incandescent Bruckner 8","review":"Having listened to countless Bruckner 8ths, does one traversal of the vast score exist out there that hands down conveys an incandescent experience? I bought the von Karajan version on the strength of the positive reviews in trade journals. For the most part, it unfolds and develops as a great musical journey. Nonetheless, I have difficulty with the conductor's rather slow pacing and languid flow of the first movement. Everything else, conversely , moves along on very sound ground. Yet, I still return to an old Horenstein monaural recording on a Vox label which gets under my skin everytime I listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!

William Baldwin and Jeanne Tripplehorn play a caricatures of American celebrity couples of the era. For a caricature to work, it has to be funny and I'm afraid these weren't amusing at all. Julie Andrews muddles through as the matriarch of a stately British family and she appears to merely walk through each scene and smile sedately.

I really appreciate the insights for family and partnership in the book, but I was terribly disappointed by the audio book! The author sounds bored, not as energetic as in the original. And the wording, yes, most sentences are 80% same with the audio book of \\"highly effective people\\". This book would have deserved a better audio book version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great so far","review":"I got this book because EVERYONE reccommends the 7 habits books. I have thoroughly enjoyed the first couple chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent ideas.","review":"Gives plenty of 'food for thought' and helps you really look at your family in a new way. The ideas can help you improve family life. It does require some thinking to figure out how exactly to make these ideas work for you, as it gives more of a blueprint or concept to work from. I'd compliment this book with a 'plain-talk' parenting guiide such as Elizabeth Pantley's Perfect Parenting Dictionary for daily real-world answers."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Masterpieces from the Masters!!!!","review":"The listing for this collection is complete and, if you were to discover just exactly is on this album, and I couldn't have done it any better. But I'll say that for those of you who love classical music, this is one of the finest collections out there. I listened to it at home and in the car, and although when I'm driving, I can't put my feet up, my mind is transported to calm waters as I listen to the works of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Grieg, Mendelssohn, Bartholdy, Brahms, and my all time favorite, which is \\"Moonlight Sonata,\\" and played at the tempo which I believe is appropriate.Need I say more, but there's also the music of Frederic Chopin, Robert Schumann, and Franz Schubert as well.A marvelous collection and one for your own personal library.!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aluratek USB External Hard Drive Enclosure","review":"I had to return my harddrive enclosure to Amazon for a refund.

The Pirc, for the benefit of the doubt, is so advanced that I could not understand. The Rules of Thumb, so general that I could find from other books. This book, only the first thin section is about Fischer, the rest is like a condensed version of chess magazines. It takes only 10 minutes to read all about Fischer in this book. I recommend the Gufeld's book about Fischer, deeper, more stories and games of Fischer's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Excellent for every educator.

I believe it outlines the new trends in the structure of education, so it would be very important for that reason, since I am a recent graduate in education. However, it appears to be written in the dryest possible terms imaginable. Someone else is really going to have to convince me that I need this and why, in order to get through it. It looks painfully tedious and analytical.For those highly intellectual types who enjoy theories and concepts, I am sure this is just the book for you. I am a hands-on kind of person and enjoy what is practical and that I can use right now.

I would actually like a slow speed, as well as pulse and on. It goes together well, although the main bowl is not as big as I expected when you consider overflow from the middle spindle. Sometimes it doesn't chop all the food until it's pulverised - I couldn't get coarse chopped tomatoes that didn't have chunks, but overall I like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bowl Broke Replacement is 60 dollars","review":"I have had this product for about a year. gentle use, marinades, the bowl broke while in use, marinade all over the counter.

I expected more for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...never buy based on brand name","review":"We have the Kitchen Aide mixer. It is solid, will built and works well so we thought the food processor would be the same quality.....boy were we wrong. The bowel and lid are made of cheap plastic and already we have had to replace the bowel twice because it keeps breaking. My wife is fed up with this thing. I got this for her less than a year ago. Don't be fooled it is not the same quality as the mixer! I remember deciding between this one and the Cuisinart and went with the Kitchen Aide based on the reviews and the quality of the mixer. Big mistake. If you are deciding between the two, get the Cuisinart. I will say Kitchen Aide has replaced the bowel both times without toooo much hassle but the customer service representative said you have to be careful when you handle the bowel. So I guess you need a surgeon's touch to use this thing. Two stars pending delivery of the 2nd cup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best gift to Give!","review":"My sister absolutely loves this product!!

No complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"the maximum liquid level sucks!","review":"I just took delivery of this unit and I am horribly disappointed. I got it to primarily make sauces and I expected a 7 cup capacity. Yet, now that I see this thing in person, I see that the maximum liquid line is at 2 to 2.5 cups. How lame! To think that I bought this thing to replace my Cuisanart Mini Prep because it had a small 2.25 cup capacity. Its going back. Darn it, burned again by buying something off the internet.Searching the web, I found that the VFP12BK VIKING 12 cup food processor boasts a large liquid capacity for sauces/pestos. Its a bit bigger and more expensive but I would rather have what I want/need. I will likely order that from Amazon as a replacement to this one that is headed back today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect","review":"Simple to use, well built, works perfectly. I've had one for a year, and just bought the same model for my mother. I've mostly used it for hummus and shredding cheese. The shredder attachment is really useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"It has a home on my counter","review":"I've been enjoying my food processor over the past few weeks. I've been using it to dice, slice, puree, shred, blend, etc. It is very powerful and not too loud. It does a great job with purees and blending. It is a little too powerful for dicing. Onions and such get pulverized by the time all the pieces are contacted by the blade. The pulse feature helps somewhat, and small batches help also. It slices well, but the slices are very thin. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and plan to use it at least a few times a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it was suppose to be great.","review":"I purchased this processor because of Kitchenaid's reputation of having great and powerfull food processors. And for the most part this one, I thought fit that bill until recently. While processing canned tomatoes, it just died. No extra load on the machine, (processed tomatoes in juice), but it just quit. Now I get a hum only. So much for reliability and quality. I called Kitchenaid customer service, but because it was just out of warrenty, I would have to ship it out to be fixed at my expense. And that would be out of state. It is not worth the cost. Their response was \\"oh well\\".Before this happened I mostly used the large processing cup. One reason is the mini cup did an ok job but cuts were off and Iratic. As for the dicing blade, it did not work well at all. I had to physically chop items up after they went through the processor. I will most likely not purchase another Kitchenaid processor after seeing what this one does."},{"rating":"1","title":"chef maria","review":"I own many KitchenAid appliances... this one is a piece of junk. I have only owned it for several months and the handle on the bowl has broken twice. KitchenAid replaced it both times, however, the second time (two weeks later)the service dept representative was very rude and refused to replace it. I told her that I wished to speak to the manager and only then was she willing to replace the part. I would not purchase this item!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy!","review":"I was very excited about the KitchenAid food processor as it would be my first processor, but after only three uses the thing stopped working. I have had a commercial KitchenAid mixer for twenty years but after this I will rethink buying another KitchenAid product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Food Processor","review":"A fantastic food processor that rarely lets me down - small and light enough that I can move it around my kitchen, large enough for almost everything that I need. Have used it to make cakes, bread/dough, chop, mince, dice, mix, and puree - my only complaint is that liquid has a tendency to slop out if you aren't careful with it (probably my own fault for overfilling). Very glad I made this purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good motor but expensive to replace the bowl!","review":"The handle has broken on the bowl. It must be in working order for the processor to work. It broke awhile ago and my husband was able to fix it. Now it has fallen apart and we found it is about $65.00 to replace it. We only spend $75.00 for it originally. Needless to say, I'm not very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Parts","review":"We bought this food processor as a Christmas gift. When my son and his girlfriend assembled it to prepare after-holiday goodies, it was missing the mini bowl, one of the features that makes it unique.We were able to contact the original manufacturer who mailed the part a week later.Now all works well and there are no complaints.

I DO NOT EVER put nylon on any of my horses, but leather halters are so expensive to keep replacing when they are growing out of them so quickly. I was looking for an inexpensive halter that was still somewhat decent quality, and this far exceeded my expectations. The weanling size truly fits a weanling size QH/TB head. The hardware seems very nice, and the leather is soft. It doesn't smell like great leather out of the box, but pretty soon it will smell like a horse, anyway. I really wish I had ordered another wealing size while the price was still lower, as well as yearling halters for the near future. If I had only known how nice it was going to be!!!I will be anxious to see how well it holds up, but I expect it will be perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great everyday halter at great price.","review":"Graet everyday halter at great price.

Reading the works of the grand theorists like Waltz, Keohane and Nye is kind of like geometry at time...you wonder how does this affect me in real life? Hulsman tries to make that connection.Hulsman outlines the major theories and then quantifies how real people (policymakers like Clinton, William Perry, Strobe Talbot, Congressmen like Joe Biden, etc.) show their leanings as neo-realists or institutionalists based on intiatives they have supported or voting records, for example.This is a fascinating book bridging the gap between theory and practice...and shows that International Relations Theory is not just a matter for academics to ponder on college campuses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horsin' around!","review":"I get a ton of compliments on this stylish necklace.

The story starts out well enough with Easy Rawlins, a high school janitor, agreeing to watch the little yellow dog of a popular teacher. Then the teacher's husband and brother-in-law turn up dead and she disappears. The plot and my interest thinned. Easy's principal goals seem to be solving this mystery and having sex with every woman he meets. Although why he wants to do either is more of a mystery. The latter would land him in jail, the former dead. Rather than titallating, it was annoying. Other than Easy, only the dog had some interesting character development, and even that was minor. I just couldn't care about any of the characters, the mystery, or how it was resolved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"The writing is very simple. I have better things to do with my time than reading about how ex criminals think about their privates throughout every day and screw women within ten minutes of exchanging names. I also appreciated the ongoing sexist remarks and convenient \\"little yellow dog\\" that seems to be the motif of the novel and represents the abused \\"dogs\\" of this novel. I think next time he should just replace the dog with a woman or a white person and then everything would make more sense. Or replace the title with, \\"Gangsta Black Panther in Trouble and he IIlegally got two Youngins.\\" Has anyone seen the movie, Gone Baby Gone, directed by Ben Affleck? Morgan Freeman does NOT raise the girl at the end of the movie! He is sent to jail for kidnapping.

Moreover, the killings aren't all at the beginning (many mysteries only have one that occurs early, why would this be a problem if it were so?) Although this is a historical novel (set in 1963) it portrays the \\"always outgunned\\" milieu of someone automatically suspect because of his skin color in specific, convincing detail (i.e., there is no chasm between Easy's world and Socrates's in _Always Outunumbered, Always Outgunned_.

He's too sloooow and most of all empty. He's character are not very interesting and the stories always lag, drag and fizzz out. I don't see how the reviewers see Walter Mosley as a black writer with something powerful to say about the black condition/experience etc. He hasn't said anything, let alone anything profound. In fact he doesn't even scratch the service. He should be writing kids books because that is where his composing skills have remained. Snails think faster than Walter Mosley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent-- couldn't put it down!!!","review":"I just finished ' A Little Yellow dog'.

The author is expressing something along the line of a quick fix for Christianity. I believe the proof is in the pudding or should I say the parishes or diocese.

It won't work Bishop Spong; the liberal-left will continue to hate Christianity no matter how you try to distort it in order to fit their creed of political correctness and so-called tolerance.

It's basically an ultraliberal view of the bible and Christianity. It is a great thing when one questions creeds and deeds, but Spong rejects so much of it that there really is no reason to call what he believes Christianity anymore. There isn't any new Christianity that you could possibly come up with by rejecting so much of what he does. I love Paul Tillich and Spong claims to be inspired by him. Yet their theologies are nothing alike. Tillich believes in a personal God and miracles. The ground of all being doesn't mean that God is no longer personal, it means that God brings us our being to a healed and true existence. It's not Tillich's way of redefining God, its his way of explaining OUR unity in existence.

If you're looking for anything new besides the same old tired diatribes against orthodoxy, this book will leave you sorely dissatisfied. Bishop Spong...advocates nothing more than a slightly more radical form of 19th century theological liberalism.It is readily accepted by both liberal and conservative scholars that 19th century liberal Christianity died because it sought to accommodate itself to sorrounding cultural expectations and thus lost its distinctiveness and its unique message. Spong now urges other Christians to \\"drink the same kool-aid\\" that killed his tradition.In short, don't waste your money. But if you like this sort of thing just read some old works by Rauschenbusch, A. T. Robinson, or Paul Tillich, they same the same thing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another attack on Christianity","review":"Once again, we see an attack on Biblical Christianity from a former leader within the \\"church\\". The problem with Mr. Spong's views is that he provides no basis for \\"truth\\" and determining what is right and what is wrong. Once we abandon the Bible as the source for truth, and instead look to science or society, we lose all moorings and begin wandering in a relativistic jungle. Christianity does not need to change, it has done just fine in the last 2000 years following the teachings of Christ and His apostles. While our application of biblical principles will change from generation to generation, the foundation of God's word as truth and the truths of the faith will not, and must not, ever change."},{"rating":"1","title":"A new christianity - might as well rename it as spongism","review":"How can someone purport to be redefining Christianity, when they are throwing away the basics of Christianity completely? There is no supreme being, Christ did not walk the earth - this is what SPong is telling us. If he is dissatisfied with Christianity, he should start his own religion.

Instead, he uses staw men type arguments. He will not allow the people of antiquity the priviledge to use anthropomorphic idoms, but of course, us more enlighten people can use them today.Spong's diatribe is old and was first introduced under the older mind sceince cults that grew out of the Enlightenment period.

He has been given the tools to lead all of us to a new and deeper relationship with the Christ we have known,and to the realistic Christ we have been searching for. We have the opportunity to have a more united world for all faiths in the future, and hopefully, we will be able to enjoy more peacefull lives for all man kind with the use of his wisdom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please!","review":"Once again, Reverend Spong tries to disguise his secular liberalism as a religious revlation---whoops, sorry---for Spong, a bad analogy: no revelation possible as that would entail God.I for one am tired of this wheezy, tired old man, who obviously has lost any faith he ever had, indulge in stage 3 of cognitive dissonance-- the stage where you try and convert others to your beliefs as a means of relieving the mental dissonance--and, as a means of never, ever, thinking new thoughts and never, ever changing those beliefs that you hold onto for dear life. The ones that others challenge--or, your experience challenges --or, that still, small voice inside you challenges.

This is such a book. Mr. Spong, a retired protestant bishop who made a career out of throwing out any portions of the Bible that did not accord with the latest editorials of the New York Times, has now written a book in which he decrees that traditional Christianity, by which I assume he means Christianity based at least somewhat on the Bible, is dying out. What a hoot! It is liberal non-Chrisitianity, of which Spong the doubter is a terrific exemplar, which is on life support while orthodox Christian sects are thriving. Proof of this is provided by just a glance at how the mainline Protestant churches infected by this type of nonsense are dwindling to insignificance while the Evangelicals, Catholics and Orthodox are thriving. An interesting example of projection. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading unintentional humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Happy Retirement","review":"Spong's theology, like this book is only useful for those that want to embrace a spiritual life which does not demand dying to their own ego projections, a psychological condition that transpersonal psychologist Ken Wilber refers to as Boomeritis. \\"Boomeritis\\" would in fact be my suggestion for a concurrent reading.As an Episocoplaion preparing for seminary, I read Spong because I know that I will be confronted with those that embrace his work and I want to be prepared for such encounters. It is not an enjoyable position. Theism is not dead, it just needs to be redifined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must give up dogmatic , archaic definitions of God - Yes","review":"The author advocates giving up our dogmatic, archaic definitions of God.

The problem with the previous reviewer is that he/she tried to burn a Blu-ray disk on a Standard DVD Player/Burner. You can't do that! You must have a Blu-ray burner to burn a Blu-ray disk! As with other Hi Defination devices, it is usually the \\"user\\" that is at fault, rather than the product. For instance, many people [still] believe that just because they own a HDTV, they will see HD programming. Not so! The same goes for Blu-ray. Just because you bought a blank Blu-ray disk doesn't automatically give you the ability to burn a Blu-ray disk. Both Sony and Panasonic make some very nice Blu-ray computer drives which can both read and write Blu-ray disks.

Musically and Artistically there music was ahead of most groups of there time. To combine Jazz, Rock, Gospel, African and Cuban influence with Pop and Classical, this group\`s talents were clearly evident.

The infighting at the beginning of the movie between the humans is unbelievable. Have the writers not ever met someone in the military?

Besides the wealth of parenting guidance in chapters, Brenda offers an age appropriate gift giving guide, charted stages of development and a resource index for specific need-to-know issues such as thumb sucking, tantrums, toilet training, and eating.After reading it, I recognized being in the presence of a wise and caring woman, who longs to aid parents and children.You can succeed at parenting with this \\"winning wealth\\" of information.

Her shirt looks like two pieces of cloth tied around her breasts in a poor attempt to cover them. The other dress(or that's what I hope it is) looks like one of those bathing suits 5-year-olds wear that consists of a one pice with a little skirt attached to it. This is horrible. Absolutely disgusting. They needed to be more daring, but not like this.

My daughter will be nine next month and, as always, she wants a Barbie doll for her birthday. This is one doll that not only will my daughter NOT be getting, but one that she will never even see if I can help it. Little girls love things that are shiny and sparkly and glitzy, but this doll goes way beyond that. The doll looks like a [...]. The clothes and makeup just do not make sense in any other context. Yes, it's just a doll, and it's the parent's responsibility--not the toy company's--to teach kids what is okay and what isn't.

What is the point of having a children's foundation if your are also on the other end pouring trash into our children's minds? The fact that Mattel (or any parent for that matter) would EVER think this doll is ok for ANY child, of ANY age, is scary. I am 35, and I loved Barbie as a child. If I had ever seen this doll as a child I would have thought it was a joke. Sad, that our standards have dropped so far that some people actually can't see what is wrong with this doll!!!!

Then the other day I saw this tall, skinny girl wearing a skirt so short I was sure the slightest breeze would lift it up. Fortunately for her it didn't, so she must've had it super glued to her thighs. Whatever! Bling Bling??? That sounds like baby talk! I can't believe everyone jumped aboard the dumb rapper bandwagon and uses that babble! For real! Anyway, this doll is a major $LUT and she might as well be wearing fig leaves!

In this story, he carries two women that have links to the army. In both cases the women are not wanted by the men they came to meet and the sargent is blamed for bringing them. A lot more action is involved and the sargent and one of the women fall in love making things a lot more complicated as she is a officers wife and he is a enlisted man.

Instead it blew open the concept of being an Indian woman in Western society, but made sure never to victimise the main character Nila. I liked that since Indian literature has a tendency to glorify and exoticise, whereas this writer shows us a well rounded woman who can be weak but is only out to see who she really is. There are the other victimised characters in the novel, in the shape of Nila's mother who dies and her friend who commits suicide, yet the writer does not get overly sentimental, choosing instead to show what is behind their deaths. Though it was a bit stilted in places, perhaps due to the translation, it was an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Symphony No.9","review":"A legendary recording taken live in 1989.

Although his concept was laudatory, IMO only half of the rather short (37 min.) album hits his intended mark. His weakest tracks are the eponymous track \\"Tennessee Firebird\\", and \\"Beauty Contest\\"-both are jam sessions between his jazz group, and the country folks as foils. On the other hand, Hank Williams' \\"Alone and Forsaken\\" and Ferlin Husky's \\"Gone\\" are the strongest tunes on here. They come out both complex and wistful.In reading the liner notes, Gary comes off as appreciative of the country musicians, yet seems somewhat contemptuous of their abilities. And that seems to show in his underuse of Buddy Emmons in an attempt to make an album that is neither fish nor fowl.

I think the point was that the book is meant to be personal and about \\"me\\", so the publisher offered the book in 2 editions so that African American children would not be looking at pictures of children with white skin and wondering why the picture doesn't match up. Are you that small-minded that you couldn't see that? I think to offer books in only one edition is the true diservice. The story is not different, just the color of the children.

Thisabsolutely shocked me. How could someone writing about how God madeeach child special have two versions of a book based on color?I hope that perhaps you realize that this is not in line with your\\"character builder for kids\\" mantra and sadly far from being a goodChristian.

Instead, I will be throwing this bookaway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy and overly-saccharine","review":"The title is misleading; there is no demonstration of how a child ought to think itself special. The text is a poorly-rhymed and badly-scansioned listing of sense organs and positive emotions, and the things the child can perceive or feel with them. The items tend to run toward junk food (ice cream, pizza) and female relatives (mothers, aunts and grandmothers). The drawings are mock-primitive, meant to look as though a child drew them, but too regular to be authentic.A Jewish, Christian or Muslim parent who gives this book to a child thinking it will reinforce the family's religion will be making an error: the God portrayed in the text is not the God of Abraham, and the child-reader created by the book's God suffers no original sin. This is a New-Age religion.The only reason we still have it is that a friend of my wife gave it to our child as a birth-gift"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie, very thought-provoking!","review":"I loved this movie.

Two of the kidnappers are male, one is female. Of course there's a love triangle. They drink quite a bit and smoke some pot.

I paid $19.95 for 5 packages of misting nozzles, and I paid $24.95 for shipping. They claim that Amazon won't let them combine shipping costs and said the misting nozzles were still cheap even if I figured in all the shipping costs.

This first book of fiction won the 1988 Associated Writing Programs Novel Award for good reason. The reader's in very capable hands from page one, as the details of Mamie's and Christian's journey unfold with equal measures of wisdom and hilarity.

She likes the Disney Princesses, and gets a big kick out of operating the projector and making up stories for the pictures. I agree with other reviewers, the light level in the room has to be too low to read in order to view the pictures, which right there defeats the purpose of the set, which is to be able to read the book AND view the projected images at the same time. Maybe an older kid that is not that interested in the pictures would do better with the reading side of it.I still give it a high mark because of the many hours my kid has spent playing with it.

This is the second product in one month where we've really felt ripped off by Disney. The projector image is so tiny and blurry, its sometimes impossible to recognize the characters. Its obvious from the reviews that this is the norm, so it seems Disney knowingly is selling a defective product.

Buy a 'plain old' picture book instead, your children won't be risking eye strain looking at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating and disappointing","review":"Great idea, but the images are so tiny when projected and blurry.

My daughter started looking inside it like a viewmaster just to see anything and I had to take it away because I am afraid she is hurting her eyes since there is a tiny lightbulb in there. The book itself is ok, but NOT for $20. Why make this projector at all? It is not a quality product and reflects poorly on Disney, and cannot even be used as an effective toy. It is a glorified flashlight. Do not buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, bad projector","review":"The storybook is good, contains five standard princess stories - Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White.I've seen many comments about the quality of the projector.

Rather than focusing on management - which is performance and situation specific - the focus needs to be on the development and training of a principles based culture where the employee/family member/ etc can apply the principles in any situation.

It isn't as easy to apply, confirm, or understand as the 7 habits. It contains some fresh material but much of it is a repeat from the 7 Habits. Much of Principle-Centered is repetitive within itself. This book is very pale and disappointing in comparison with The Seven Habits. In it, Covey attempts to negate Freud's theories by saying they were developed his theories from the study of neurotic and psychotic people.

Of course, I don't know how efficient it is, so I tried plugging the adapter into a Kill-A-Watt power meter. The laptop (with a partially charged battery) uses about 21-25 watts of power while watching a disk-based video file (not a DVD). Our experience in the car with the T41 AC adapter plugged in to the Smart AC 120: the unit gets very warm while in use AND after about 10 minutes of use, the fan kicked in with an unbearably loud buzzing sound. Even freeway road noise at 60-70 MPH could not drown it out. So Mr. Dave's review from 3/12/2008 is right on the money.

You'll be laughing and laughing until you reach the part where Asimov is joking about what his last words will be and says (after the joke) that really his last words will be an affirmation of love for his wife; his wife here adds an editor's note that, those were, indeed, his last words. And then you go \\"Awwww\\" and feel bad for laughing at this poor guy. After all, he did write \\"Nightfall\\" and _Foundation_. But this book, this book is awful.If you want to read a good sf memoir, read Pohl's masterful _The Way the Future Was_ and see how it ought to be done; if you want to read a worse one you're goingto be hard pressed (but Anthony's _Bio of an Ogre_ might do the trick)."},{"rating":"1","title":"free association kind of memoir","review":"I was a bit disappointed with this book. In Asimov's science fiction novels, his plot hangs together well, and the various details tie into the bigger picture. This is not at all true of his autobiography. Told in tiny chapters according to whatever bit of his history Asimov decided to write about at that moment, characters appear and disappear, and events are recorded with no explanation of their greater significance. Some chapters were wonderful, and I was laughing out loud. Others left me wondering why they had been written.Some parts of this book are definitely worth reading. As a whole, though, I'm not sure it's worth the reader's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not finish reading it","review":"I am always trying to finish books. I hate giving up in the middle.But I could not finish reading this one. A lot of the stuff he writes sounds like \\"How great he is\\" and so on... Of course he was a great personality.

Perhaps this would be a good book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I.

After King gets away in his car, the Korean owner is able to get the license number so King can get arrested. The author says King was just \\"luckless as usual\\".I like the way she distances King's motives from his own self by using the article \\"the\\" instead of \\"his\\" to describe greed, stress, and helplessness/hopeless. Subtle, but telling. And damn that Korean store owner for giving Rodney bad luck yet again! I mean, hey, doesn't he appreciate that King just hit him with a tire iron and didn't shoot his ass?

As other reviewers here have said, it is the characters that make this book - they are flawed, quirky, and mismatched, yet so likeable and such a joy to read about. Anyone old enough to read the Redwall books or The Chronicles of Narnia should be able to enjoy \\"The Blood Jaguar\\", but there is plenty here that adult readers will appreciate. For example, while not overtly comedic, there are some humorous twists on a few cliches from the fantasy genre.Payne has very good writing style. Some books pile on the colorful, descriptive phraesology until it's like trying to eat a dessert so rich it's hard to finish, but \\"The Blood Jaguar\\" provides just the right amount (or perhaps the right type) to enhance the reading experience.My biggest complaint about the book is that it was too short.

The way the story was set up fascinated me, especially the idea that it had all happened before. I enjoyed the \\"impossible tasks\\" set before the heroes and the way everything was acknowledged as part of a complete story. The Curials, however, were the most fascinating part.

Mr. Rashid bucks the trend (pun intended!)of many popular horse-authorities today by challlenging the notion that one must be \\"dominant\\" over the horse and MAKE the horse do exactly what is asked, the first time, every time. I have seen many horses ruined by overly zealous followers of this line of thinking: it is indeed a breath of fresh air to find someone who rightly questions the \\"intimidate-and-dominate\\" approach.

It is less a course in horse training, and more a wonderful book of short stories that describe a horse behavior, along with the typcial method of dealing with it, and then the \\"old mans\\" method of dealing with it. I agree with most everyone here, and read the entire book from cover to cover before putting it down.

His fifth is due on in October 2005. He is SO Insightful about horses and how they relate to each other with actions and movement.The passive leadership he speaks of makes so much sense. To have a good relationship with your horse and for him to WANT to be with you because he Trusts you is the ultimate.If only I can remember 1/4 of what he's written I'll be a much better horse owner and rider. His books are truly amazing truths about his every day learning from horses he's known."},{"rating":"2","title":"As engaging as the first book!","review":"As much as \\"Considering the Horse\\" opened our eyes to a gentle, understanding method of interacting with our horses (I shouldn't use the word \\"training!\\") \\"Horses Never Lie\\" exposes us to a new philosophy of what we should be for our equine partners - kind, understanding, supportive. Mark effectively debunks the \\"Be the Alpha Horse\\" theory, and offers an approach that the horse understands, that helps the horse WANT to be with you. He becomes your friend, not a subservient being that should obey. It has opened my eyes - again! If you're at all interested in Natural Horsemanship, buy this book - TODAY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read all three of Rashid's books!!","review":"Just one of Mark Rashid's books contains more insight to horses than all of the horse books I have ever read combined. I have read all of his books, and each one has opened my eyes more and more to horses. Mark sees horses as equals, not subordinates or machines to do his bidding. Mark truly understands horses and how they think and feel.\\"Horses Never Lie\\" is Rashid's third book (I think), and it seems to be the most \\"advanced\\" of the three. I recommend starting with \\"A Good Horse is Never a Bad Color\\" and then \\"Considering the Horse\\". I feel like they really prepared me to better understand \\"Horses Never Lie\\".Once you pickup one of Mark's books you'll never want to put it down. I have read all of them at least twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horses","review":"Horseback riding is my new passion. I've always wanted to learn but thought that I had to have my own horse. I am buying magazines, books, DVDs -- anything that will get me more connected to the horse. This book has helped me to do that. In reading this story of a little boy's experience with horses which developed into a passion is wonderful. I learned so much from these experiences and plan to use the things I learned during my riding lessons and when I purchase my own horse. This was a great book, which I would read again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's hard to put this book down","review":"You don't want to stop reading! The book is filled with several stories about how the author dealt with problem horses. It is less a book about training, but more about sensitive insight into the nature of horses thoughts and reactions. Well worth reading. Through the authors experiences you learn how to become more aware of the signals the horse is giving the rider."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"This is the first book by Mark that I have read, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, and learned some lessons too.

He doesn't necessarily give you the 3-step formula in curing every problem, but instead, tells you of his experiences and how he has solved them. He makes sure that you understand most horse problems are actually people problems. Problem horses are almost always a result of poor horsemanship/incorrect training. I learned a lot about horses and myself reading his books. If you want to understand horses better and improve your horsemanship, read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author Lies About Horses, Delusional Horsemanship","review":"Horse's don't lie?, but people sure do lie, especially to themselves and this book is full of lies about horses and their relationships with humans that I am sure the delusional author really believes. The author's lying problem is anthropomorphing horses and their behavior. If you want to really learn about horse behavior and horsemanship with no anthropomorphic nonsense, horse whispering, psychobabble, mind reading, astrology, or anything but science based knowledge then read the books by Paul McGreevy. If you believe that Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny,and the Tooth Fairy are real then you will really enjoy Horses Never Lie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the perspective of the horse","review":"I love how Mark Rashid writes from the perspective of the horse. I'm always wondering what my horse is thinking and trying tolearn more so that we can begin to start to have a common language together based on respect and compassion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me re-think my riding","review":"I was having problems achieving my riding goals and picked up this book for help. After the first couple pages I completely changed my view about riding. Previous instructors have drilled the \\"cue-response\\" method into my head: when you combine certain aids the horse responds by doing X and if the horse doesn't respond then there must be something wrong with the horse and you must work at it until you get the correct response. I know notice the little tries my horse is giving me and I've learned to have communication be a two way street. I now try to listen to my mare's opinions, taking them into consideration and gently but firmly showing her why we should do it my way (if my way is truly better). If you've ever thought of horses as more than just a pile of bone and muscle breed to do your bidding, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horses Never Lie Book Review","review":"How do you get a horse to WANT to listen to you? How do you develop a trusting relationship with your horse? How do you give a horse, choices without forcing the results? All these questions will be answered. Horses never Lie, the heart of passive leadership By Mark Rashid, is a book that will show you how to have a trusting non-force relationship with your horse. He uses many intriguing stories form his own experienced, stories to help you understand the horse's mind.Personally I think this is an amazing story if you are looking for the feel of a relationship, but if you are looking for new \\"techniques\\" so you can get your horse to listen and work faster you are in the wrong place. However, if you want to learn how to listen to your horse choices and how to create a trusting bond between the both of you, then you have come to the perfect place. Overall, this book can show you the maybe less desirable ways you are treating your, horse and how you can better this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth in the title","review":"What a great book and presentation. By telling the reader about true stories and events Rashid teaches you to reflect on your own experiences and put his lessons into practice with your own horses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring book on leadership","review":"A good read that made me think about leadership a little differently. I found his take on herd leadership very interesting when comparing leaders that the herd is afraid of versus leaders that the herd wants to follow and be with. Some good insight given from his experiences with horses. A worthwhile read and I think all levels of horse lovers could learn something from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Levine is wonderful, best in the Bartered Bride excerpts","review":"Levine was making some brash, over-driven recordings with the Berlin Phil. and the Chicago Sym. on DG (Sibelius Second and Prokofiev Fifth are cases in point)at the same time he was all metling charm with the Vienna Phil. Who knows why? But his Mozart symphonies from Vienna are almost lilting, a quality one doesn't associate with this Szell protoge. His Tchaikovsky ballet suites are magnificent in every way, and so are the excrepts from The Bartered Bride on this CD.The orchestra is so ravishing, and the recording captures them so well, that Levine would only need to be half as good. Yet great conductors can outshine themselves, and here he displays joy and brio throughout. The excerpts from Ma vlast are distinctly cooler, no match for Karajan's grand sweep, until the third one, which is rich and dramatic. So call this CD a treasure for at least half the music on it and very good for the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"The PS 6 Bible is a fat disappointment","review":"I prefer to use software books as references. Many of the \\"Bible\\" books are really useful this way. But in order for that to be so, the book has to have a decent index. This \\"Bible\\" fails miserably on that count. An example: I tried to look up \\"Acrobat\\" to see if I could save a file in the PDF format from Photoshop. Adobe Acrobat files are a standard in the publishing industry these days. There is actually a page and a half in the Bible on saving as a PDF, but there is no entry for \\"Acrobat\\" or \\"Adobe Acrobat\\" in the skimpy index. The last \\"Photoshop Bible\\" that I bought was for PS 3. A lot has changed in the program since then. Versions 5, 5.5, and 6 of PS have all been major revisions, but there is relatively little new material in the PS 6 Bible compared to the PS 3 Bible. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Understandable for someone with a masters in Botany...not me","review":"There were no reviews when I bought this so I wasn't expecting a lot, but I was expecting something with more general information on plants, maybe some pictures, and information on what plants help with what. It's in very complicated terms, there are no pictures, and it's basically records of what a botanist found after a whole lot of research on different plants. I have to look up all of the scientific words and re-read a lot of it to try and get an idea of what the book is trying to tell me. It is not well written at all, and has theories and conclusions of plants that end up to have no medicinal purpose. Definitely not what I was looking for. It would probably be useful to a hard core botanist, but not the average person looking for clear information about medicinal plants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid detailng of a sacred ceremony...","review":"Ellis Avery gives the reader an opportunity to see the world of Tea Ceremony otherwise unfamiliar to the non Japanese person. The words and details are drawn out, much like the tea ceremonies themselves to preserve the art and beauty of the subject matter. Temae is used as a vessel to unfold the stories of a lifetime shared between the characters. This book reads like a life story should, so readers should not expect it to be a fast paced dramatic ensemble. The characters are human, and contrasting, the visuals are rich. The story focuses on human relationships, and the struggle to belong in a world where one is marked as a foreign object. The reader is walked through the historical changes that take place in Japan throughout the course of the story, while the main character, Aurelia, is faced with forbidden love, and teeters between two worlds, The Foreign and Japan.I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult book to get into.","review":"I started this book and found it very slow going. Difficult to get into, difficult to get to know the characters. I read about halfway, and then gave up entirely. I don't know if something important happened in the second half, but now I don't really care. I don't even remember the unmemorable characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Avery, PLEASE WRITE MORE!","review":"Ms. Avery was so knowledgeable in writing this book. The story and characters are so real that you swear you were there watching the dialog and scenery as it took place.

During the first few chapters I hoped it might become interesting. It had the potential to be a good story as the motherless girl was shipped off on her own, into a strange new culture. But once she got settled in, the story got horribly, terribly boring. More and more characters were introduced in each paragraph, and there were no reasons to care about them. I do consider myself a good reader, yet found the text incredibly difficult to read. This is only the second novel I have EVER given up on, and that does make me sad.

I found myself having to reread often - to remember the significance of the many new characters - who come and then are gone - by the next chapter.

On the night they arrive, the place in which they're staying burns, and Aurelia runs away. She is taken in by Yurako, a young woman whose father owns a teahouse in Miyako, later Kyoto. Aurelia then becomes Urako. The book begins in 1866 and ends in the 1920s, and covers a period in which the cultures of East and West meet, sometimes with adverse results. It's a wonderfully well-written novel, though sometimes the language is hard to follow. But other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed The Teahouse Fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Japanese story","review":"At the beginning I found the book interesting but after the girl has been in Japan a while I found it a bit dragging on too much and lost interest.

I recently installed it and gave it a try. To my surprise I was totally amazed by this lil unknown game. If you love the diablo series then you'll love this game. Its just as addicting and just as long as Diablo 2. Although the interface is a lil diff, its easy to get used to. The music is prob the best part of this game, the soundtrack in my opinion is a masterpiece. I deff recommend this title for anyone whos into hack and slash games.

This is the most I've enjoyed playing a computer game in years. There are enough quests to keep your attention, but which quests you do are, for the most part, optional, and the storyline is only partially linear. You can make of your character whatever you want, so I, for example, ended up playing a thief who was too nice to steal things, but who did a ... of a job in battle. Go figure. :)The only reason I haven't given this game 5 stars is because it makes my computer drag, and after more than a couple of hours of gameplay, it gets visibly and audibly slower. This is a major deal becauase the game is a year old, but my computer is only three weeks old, and pretty close to top-of-the-line, so that simply shouldn't happen. Overall, though, the game itself is so excellent that I can overlook performance issues--and that's saying a LOT."},{"rating":"2","title":"a review of the normal","review":"now first off i want to say that this is a GREAT GAME. This is the best rpg i have seen in a VERY long time.

It is based on all other ones, gain experence and at a ridiculous number, and at that number you level up and gain 5 stat points with those stat points you can use them tword streagth(boots attack and stamina) agility(increases accuracy and dodge ability) constitutian(vitality and stamina) and mana(spell power) the main problem is that by the 15 level you have to get 500000 points."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taxi Driver...","review":"Fascinating and at times chilling account of what it's like to drive a cab overnight in a big city (in this case, Toronto).

The first part is just forewords, telling the background of the Warrior Koans, how they were used, and how to use them in the present day. It also explains that it will take years for the dedicated reader to get through the book, and that I agree with!What I like with this book is that it does not promise a quick fix. It clearly states that it takes time and dedication. Long time and serious dedication. I am not through it yet. I can also see that the very process of going through the book and understanding the koans will create a certain peace of mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book Not For Everyone","review":"Trevor Leggett does his usual outstanding job.

I looked a long time for a version of this symphony that will sound different every time I listen to it (the way Bruno Walter said). Listening to this CD was the revelation I expected. A wonderfull orchestra in the hands of a master. An ever fresh sound, beatufully blended and right at the heart of Schubert. Arrau said that Schubert's latest works suggest the composer's feeling of fatality. You can understand this if you listen to Arrau's recordings of the latest Schubert Sonatas (especially no21) and Giulini's version of the \\"Unfinished\\" symphony. Dvorak's 9th is also a very fine version even though I consider Celibidache's version with Munchner Philharmoniker the last word \\"From New World\\". But make time to listen Giulini.

The price was right, but the shipping cost was almost as much. However, since the two together cost less than what I saw at a retail store, it was definitely worth it. Plus, the Konica Minolta logo is on it. My only concern is that the case has a magnetic latch. But I guess the magnet isn't strong enough since it hasn't affected the pictures (or my credit cards that sit next to it in my bag).

These well-reported, beautifully crafted profiles of both known and unknown characters show her at the top of her form. Orlean has a knack for being at the right place at the right time to capture a telling detail or quote and, contrary to the wrongheaded and ignorant comments in a few of the customer reviews here, she is, if anything, self-effacing and unobtrusive as she brings the reader deeply into the lives of her subjects. Literary journalism as an art form necessarily includes the author's voice and point of view -- these are what make it less artificial and far more interesting than standard \\"objective\\" reporting. The rave reviews for this book in the New York Times and other publications are well justified."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to Our Susan Orlean?","review":"Before Susan Orlean became self-obsessed, she was a journalist who was posed to inherit the literary tradition of Didion, McPhee, Capote, Wolfe, etc. But something's happened. With the fluke popularity of the Orhard Thief--a very uneven book, one of those extended New Yorker articles that shuld have been left as is because it now reads as merely a struggle to fill up space--she's turned herself into a New York, high powered, high profile \\"celebrity\\" writer who seems to have lost touch with the small, quiet reporter who was fascinated first and foremost with her subjects...not herself. This book is a disappointment. How telling of her new attitude toward her subjects that on the cover of a book about OTHER people (\\"Encounters with Extraordinary People\\") she's posed seductively and made-up to the hilt. This is a shame of a book. I once adored this writer's older work."},{"rating":"2","title":"a thoroughly enjoyable collection of thumbnail sketches","review":"Though the hip New Yorker style may not be for everyone, I loved just about every one of these stories. For all the criticisms leveled against Orlean, she has an uncanny ability to capture her subjects and get inside their lifestyle. The range of these stories is what makes them so interesting -- one of my favorites was the simple portrait of a typical 10 year old boy. In fact, I enjoyed the obscure people's portraits more than those of famous people like Bill Blass and Tonya Harding. Orleans is great at picking out the nuances of everyday life that make humans so fascinating. It's the type of book that's best split up into smaller sections. I read it straight through which can get a bit repetitive, but I still found myself reading late into the night to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"Such a great title.

At best they're very fluent and well-reported, at worst they cloy and preen with a glib, narcissistic flatness that may not bug you too much until you try to read the piece a second time. (In this respect Orlean and Adam Gopnick are the Homecoming Queen and King of enamelled profundity in literary journalism.) She (or her editors) generally choose her subjects wisely, so novelty and variation disguise her remarkably narrow range. Will someone want to read this stuff in 10 or 20 years?

The game model has sacrificed a lot of historical accuaracy - not surprising in a RTS game. If this translated into a fun, playable game it would be an acceptable trade-off, but I find the playability to be rather poor. My least favorite aspect is that all in-game tactics revolve around LOS (line of sight) to potential targets. But the LOS model is ludicrous suffering from a very Borg-like situation where if one of your units can see a target then magically all of your units can see the target. A reluctant negative review from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad","review":"When I usually buy games I look at the package and when I see reviews on it that give the game praise it usually helps.

No reflections from my room lights. No problems with viewing angle. I was a bit hesitant to buy it because I figured apple might be coming out with a new one soon. I am seriously glad I did not wait because many of the newer screens coming out have a high gloss surface that just makes me crazy with the reflections of any light source in the room. This display has a matt surface that makes that a non issue. It's also nice and bright, has a great color range and is a piece of cake to get dialed in with accurate color.

Dead as a doornail. Looking online caused me to realize I was not the Lone Ranger. Many people had similar issues with this or similar models. Not good for a $900 item. I had a Mac Mini and the DVD drive died after a little more than a year. The motherboard on my powerbook failed after 2 and a half years. Powerbook power adapters have been notorious for failure.

Anyhoo, my sophomore year in high school we read the 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens and studied it and analyzed and used it's concepts throughout the entire year. Maybe it's just the way I was taught the book, but I will NEVER look at a 7 Habits book ever again. Most of the 7 habits were unrealistic for people and was written to Sean Covey who appears to have no concept of the 'real world'. The 7 Habits to me is a cult gone seriously wrong.

That's how you lower someone's self-image. Why tell us not to react? If you don't react in some way to everything, then you're not really alive. Overall, it's just terrible and pointless.

I thought it would be a good idea to buy the audio version, since my older teen loves audio books, but this product is not what you think it is. I thought it would be someone reading the book, hopefully the author. But it turns out, it is some sort of interview with the author mixed in with teenagers talking about their lives. I'm sorry, but it was really boring. I didn't care about the various teens because the interviews with them were not in depth. None of the benefits of the book are in this audio version.

The layout of the book is fun and appeals to readers of any age. This makes it easier to read. One thing I have to say, is that this book is one of the most powerful positive thinking books on the market. Although it's aimed at teens, the values and tips can apply to anyone. I loved the little excercises which are still applicable. Sean's frankness on matters really inspired me.

But instead of getting frustrated- I learned that maybe that granny just broke her hip (or something) and is the only person in her household who could drive to the hospital, and cant go fast.

I am disappointed, and next time will take the extra effort to either rip open the cover or better yet, continue to look for a quality tech manual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Language Book I Ever Bought","review":"This book is very good, I don't know how to say it other than that. I recomend it more than the normal version BUT you must first know ALL heragana and it helps to be in the process of learning katakana (but it is easy to learn as you go). This version differs from the normal version in that there is no translation of the heragana into phonetical sounds, as in you wont see \\"ohiyou gozaimasu\\" but only the heragana equlivent. they explain that it is proven to help learn the language if you just through out the alphabet. Not to confuse anyone, the book is in english helping you learn japanese, and in my opnion it is very good.I recomend this book to anyone"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does this book even exist?","review":"The standard version of \\"Japanese for Busy People 1\\" has kana and romanization. This book just has the romanization removed. By adding \\"kana version\\" to the title they make sound as if the other version doesn't have kana. I say if you don't like the romanization then just don't use it. How is a beginner supposed to use this book? Especially a busy beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"While I am beginning to understand the rationale for how this textbook is designed, I still feel that it is too targeted to business users to be of true value to anyone not needing to do business in japan. In other words, if you are learning japanese out of personal or family interest, look elsewhere. Also as other reviewers have said it relies heavily on rote memorization which is good and/or necessary for some things (days of the week, numbers, dates, etc) but really bad for others (verb forms and conjugation)."},{"rating":"1","title":"full of info you can't use","review":"well, i have to say i was pretty disappointed with this book. maybe i was naive to think that, as a beginner, i'd be able to learn japanese from a book. still, there's way too much information here for my brain to process. even though it's a japanese I book, it requires a basic understanding of japanese (which, sadly, i don't have). also, i ran into a lot of concepts that i wouldn't have known if i wasn't an english major. if you don't know what the words 'fricative,' or 'subjunctive' mean, don't buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the serious student","review":"The book allows you to learn at a good pace, using a fair amount of repetition through exercises and a quiz at the end of each lesson. The vocabulary is relevant, and the reader is expected to learn it at a reasonable rate, unlike some other books. Although, if you want to be able to speak fluently volume one will not be enough. The only reason I gave the book four stars instead of five is that it is almost all in the polite form of the language. There is little of the casual form used when speaking with non-business friends. However, this is by no means a crucial fallback, since the differences are by no means great. Assuming the reader is dedicated, this book acts as an excellent tool both for vocabulary and for grammar. Gambatte!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not effective","review":"Grammatical structure in this book is not addressed properly. Asking students to memorize numerous verb conjugations is difficult and tedious. It would be far more effective to have students learn the rule for verb conjugation. That way they can apply it to any verb. This book takes this approach to most other grammatical technicalities, making it difficult for a student to learn Japanese effectively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"Only to be used if you want to learn to converse a bit in Japanese.

Two projects are covered (I admit, in detail and with good photos) but there is no foundation whatsoever for those 20 pages. What kind of knife do you use? How do you hold it? What strokes are used for carving? What do you need to know about cutting with or across the grain? None of these questions are answered in this book. If you are a beginner picking up this book, you will be completely lost.The section on the history and practitioners of Scandinavian woodcarving takes up the majority of this book.

The photos are bright and the steps clear enough to not leave you hanging (avoids being a very frustrated beginner.) For those of you lucky enough, Harley still teaches classes in the upper midwest and occasionally at our nations craft houses. What I learned most about Harley's methods, is you really don't need a bucket full of hand tools. Every thing is done with a knife. Finding his particular knife is not easy. A sturdy bench knife will do just fine. I never carved a thing in my life until I picked up this book. I followed along and eventually discovered what the photo was telling me.

After scanning through the rest of the book, I was disappointed that no distinct prayers to God were offered.

Now, 9+ years later, I have been doing them daily.I know that these exercises are a key to my vitality and also opened up a deep spirituality in me that I had not known before. That was quite unexpected. Side effects include feeling younger, more energetic and also more connected to something out there that wants to help you live a full and joyful life.

But if you have serious difficulty executing certain of the rites in Book 1, this one will give you some easier alternatives -which of course were not in the original teachings- but might be beneficial as well.

For all those who are interested in the passing from the old school of art to the new concepts that gave way to modern art as we understand it, this book is for you.

But for a newcomer to Matisse, her presentation is confusing and frustrating.

I learned a lot about Matisse, but I didn't enjoy it, and I'm confused about much that I read. Overall, I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best art biography I've read","review":"What a book. Spurling writes a complete biography of Matisse, looking not just at his art and artisitc influences but at his entire life. Unlike Richardson in his biographies of Picasso, Spurling never stoops to cheerleading or excuse-making. (However, seeing as Spurling's book was written years after Richardson's first two Picasso volumes, I can't help but wonder how the two writers portray the Steins so differently. I wish Spurling had been willing to take on Richardson a bit more directly.) Instead she explains and enlightens. The pace of the text is perfect. Of particular fascination is Spurling's accounts of Matisse's artistic breakthrough, starting in the Fauve summer in 1905. This book is exciting, breath-taking, insightful and I can't wait for volume two. Quite possibly the best book I read in 1999."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE REAL LUCY: Her Life, Love, and Legacy","review":"On screen, Lucy Ball was one of the funniest women America had ever seen--but off screen, life wasn't always a comedy. This biography is enough to tell you that, and tells about some perticularlly important I LOVE LUCY episodes. But the text is dry and not lively and detialed. While it is a nice book to read for beginning readers who love the Recardos, it is not detialed, and focuses more on Lucy's acting career than her personal life. If you want a good biography, try \\"Love Lucy\\", Lucy's autobiography. While it was written a few years before her death, it won't have close-to-end-of-life information, but it will be a whole lot more detialed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Love LUCY...not this!","review":"This is a flat, dry, boring biography of Lucille Ball.

She was so excited because she has always wanted a Mermaid Barbie but I could never find one. This year with the Mermaidia movie released, her and I were both thrilled to see Mermaid barbies on the store shelves! She loves the movie too. She loves playing with this doll, especially in the bathtub where you can change her haircolor and \\"bodyart\\".

My daughter had this doll all of one day before the fin snapped off the tail. It was the end of the world for my daughter. The fin part of the tail is very poorly made!

This game is terribly addicting, you'll find yourself playing for hours and hours every day. You'll probly get on right when you get off of work and wont get off unless you absolutely have to, its that bad. I've heard of people killing themselves because they somehow lose all their equipment. They even have addiction groups to join (think AA but for EQ) to try and stop playing. How sad is that?

Then you decide to turn to Trade skills. Another nice concept if you have alot of spare cash sitting around and don't want to ever make a profit from it unless you are of a few special classes Shaman and Enchanter come to mind.

These bloodpledges are always trying to capture castles that other bloodpledges control and its a great thing to do after you get to a high level unlike in Everquest when you stand around waiting for teh next expansion pack when you get to a high enough level.Speaking of expansion packs Lineage releases a new episode every month(its now on epiode 9) and a new continent 4 times a year.

California is really out of date, however, and caused miles and miles and hours of wasted time. In particular we were traveling in Northern California, and time after time, the map failed to indicate that roads no longer were open to the public due to privatization, development, gated resort compounds, logging, etc. Mileage accuracy was also poor for the region near Mount Shasta.

I have noticed some may think that this is one of those films that is not for the fans of violence and gore which is absolutely right. But neither is this for fans of the psychological themes with no violence. I agree completely that horror needs no violence whatsoever to be a success. Take the Blair Witch for instance.

The young girl playing Anna gives a fine performance, and the film is visually very beautiful.

However, it took less than 2 minutes for me to realize I had too much confidence in von Karajan & Co.

I did try to \\"give it a chance\\" and listen all the way through... but after sampling several tracks and being in pain each time, I had to stop. I don't doubt the other reviewers who enjoyed this recording, I simply have different expectations for a performance of this piece.

Yet in the first speech printed in the book de Villepin argues that military force should not be used against Iraq, as the use of force would cause instability in the region and would be contrary to international law. He then goes on to argue that military force can be authorized by the UN and used as a last resort. Such contradictory and illogical reasoning made it impossible for there to be a debate about the real issue; was the UN at the point of last resort.It is disappointing that the editors saw fit to describe de Villepin's reasoning so inaccurately.

Unless I'm not recalling correctly, each chapter stands alone, so there's no real plot as such. The other thing that bothered me was that the author bothered to create a defiant, irreverant, spunky girl hero, yet her two friends are stereotypically male and female, to the extent that they don't even have personalities--they're just cardboard cutouts, foils for the main character. Not only is Annika fearful, hesitant, afraid of risking adult disapproval, and not wanting to get her dress dirty, but she's not in the least influenced by Pippi to be more adventurous. Lindgren sold lots of books but to my mind didn't accomplish much. Unlike Caddie Woodlawn, this protagonist is too far out in left field to truly inspire girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pipi Longstocking","review":"Pipi LongstockingPippi Longstocking by Astrid Lindgren is an inspiring tale about a girl named Pipi.

I regret having done so. Mind you, the recorded DGG sound is gorgeous, as is the playing of the VPO, as one expects it to be. But there is such a sense of boredom and malaise that permeates this performance (I only heard the 5th symphony, and not the 7th) that one cannot help but wonder if LB was not in the best of health when he recorded it. All of the magic, wonder and grandeur of this piece, captured so beautifully in the earlier New York Phil recording (and by other conductors such as Rattle, Berglund, etc.), is lost in this version. The Maestro, who had given the world so many electrifying performances, was just not having a good day in the recording studio."},{"rating":"1","title":"A breeze to read","review":"Perhaps my opinion of this book is affected because I read it immediately after reading Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series, but this book was kind of a joke! I guess I am used to heavy details, realism, lushly written and complex characters. The author seemed so monotone and the language was just so skeletal. It seemed like a blow by blow account with not much feeling. I really didn't \\"worry\\" about the characters that much and the villain - well, he just seemed villainous because - he felt like it??? It would have been much more intriguing if the mother was behind it and sent David out to kill James or something (seeing as how odd her behavior was at James and Ellen's relationship).

Ms. Palma has been a member of the renowned Orpheus Chamber Orchestra since 1980 and is one of the leading flutists in the World. Her incomparable tone, phrasing and understanding of these pieces, coupled with the usual Orpheus magic make this THE version of these pieces to own. Ms. Palma's tone is her calling card, enabling her to convey the beauty of the pieces with the coolness and ease of a jazz artist. She avoids the tight, perfunctory \\"perfect\\" reading most flutists project and the cadenzas (which she composed herself) are marvelous. A beautiful recording by Deutsche Grammaphon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic \\"Ear Candy\\" with Clarity","review":"Ok, maybe the other reviewer is correct. But sonically, like so many of the Orpheus recordings, the clarity of the instruments is simply tops. If you have a really great stereo, you can appreciate these performances way beyond other recordings. I just love the piece with both flute and harp. Maybe they are not as warm and fuzzy in artistry, but the sonic clarity is unsurpassed. A great listening experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skilled playing, cold performances","review":"I found this CD quite disappointing. As skilled as the Orpheus CO is, these performances sound cool and machine-like, hardly Mozartian qualities.

Perhaps they could have used a conductor for this one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful !","review":"This is a delightfully airy and delicate cd. Both concertos are well played.

The warmth of the playing, the perfect tone of the sound, and the obvious care in production on that cd highlights the indifference of the playing on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"As much as I like this CD, I've heard a few other versions of these concertos that are slightly better. The cadenzas were a little more virtuostic and the performances were slightly better. You could check out the flute concertos on the Laserlight label. That's a good one, although the Vienna Mozart Ensemble sound on the Flute & Harp concerto was like inside a small room. James Galway, on another CD, made one of the best renditions of the flute concertos (specifically the CD with Sir Neville Marriner). If you were to get one of the 2 CDs I just mentioned, only be aware that they don't have the Adagio for Flute and Orchestra. I don't mean to say that this Deutsche Grammophon CD should be avoided. The Orpheus Chamber Orchestra usually makes very fine recordings. The performance is very good. The sound is distinctive.

The South African support cast are also impressive. The film is not a masterpiece, but it holds attention because of the power of the story, and the first class acting.

The text is pallid at best, with no real style and certainly nothing to mark it as very original. I found it impossible to believe that the boy, much less the donkey, would actually consider the butcher a viable alternative...is this supposed to show nobility of character? Is it trying to make a point about sacrifice? Could it be some kind of misguided, heavy-handed attempt to foreshadow the crucifixion? Or is it just really bad writing?

I could not believe this was made by the same person who made the original! TCM 2 held nothing back- it ever so casually showed a man getting blugeoned to death by a hammer as his assalent sat over him laughing. I realize that shock has some value, and graphic violence was present in the original as well, but it the original the violence was SCARY and in the sequel it's just disgusting.

The whole idea is that Dennis Hopper wants to get revenge for what happened to his nephew Frankie (The wheel chair kid in the first) and hid neice (Who was committed). That wouldn't be enough though so they throw in some punk kids who call a radio DJ on a cell phone and then get killed by LEather Face. She takes the tape to Hopper who then asks for her to play the tape on her station and lure them out.... The question is how one specific member of his clan survive, the brother.

I still wish I had not bothered. This film is dire. For one thing it is not half as violent as I was expecting it to be, and lets face it, without the violence this film has little to recommend it. I thought the first movie was overrated, but Tobe Hooper has come no where near as close to making a decent movie since.

Then there is this whole thing with Leatherface molesting some poor girl with his chainsaw! I swear that was the most uncomfortable moment in any movie ever.The only reason I didn't give this movie one star was because at least it had some minor dark comedy. Like the fact that the family makes award winning chilly with a special ingrediant (don't forget they are cannibals).

Hooper returned to direct this first sequel with a bit bigger budget, more graceful camera work, more gore, and Dennis Hopper. Hopper plays a sheriff seeking revenge against the infamous cannibal family for the deaths of his brother's children, and Caroline Williams plays a radio DJ the family kidnaps after she hears them {murder} a couple of yuppies. The performances are crazed (Hopper is his usual bare bone psycho self), and the film is laugh out loud hilarious and ludicrous at the same time. Chop Top had me laughing my head off during his entire screen time, and the rest of the cast seems to be having some fun during the filming.

I'd buy this DVD if you got a couple bucks to spend."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are you thinking Tobe????","review":"In case you don't know, I am the greatest Chainsaw fan, the first one that is.

There's a lot of action scenes, and blood scenes, but overall this movies sucked ass. To tell you straight out why it sucked was because it's a predictable story and leatherface looks like he got f$%#@@ in the face.

The cast was likable, diverse, and great. The environments were dark, creepy, and mysterious. Even the original house has a bad feeling about it. The death scenes were gritty, original, and great for its time. That was the original...The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 however, is a poor sequel, installment, and ridiculous entry in the series. Why did they go from living in a house to a hole underground? Why does it contain more comedy than horror? The ending was even quick and unfortunate. You barely get any closure as to what happens to the remaining people and the deaths were quick and sparing. In fact, this film doesn't even feel like a Texas Chainsaw Massacre!Don't waste your money or time on TCM 2. The original (1974) and the remake (2004) are the best ones to go with."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHATASEQUEL","review":"Pretty good slasher sequel that continues and ends the series' storyline...the director calls it a mistake, but I thought it was pretty cool for a movie of it's kind...this coming from a kid who loves films like Halloween, Fatal Attraction and Psycho...Tobe Hooper put it down!

This is not 'so bad it's good' bad, this is 'when i'm on my deathbed I shall curse this movie for wasting two hours of my life' bad. Preposterous and corny, Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 will leave you wondering exactly who the target audience was for this abomination.The character of Chop Top was about as 'scary' as Beetlejuice. Leatherface 'falling in love' has already been discussed a hundred times in the other 1-star reviews.Don't waste your time.

And the gore is pitiful such as in the beginning a guy has the top of his head cut off and when he bled it was short little squirts like an on and off fountain. And not to mention there is like a zombie dude at the end with his face cut off and still living and he also has his stomach skin cut off. This is the worst movie i have ever seen.

I will admit that I only watched the 1st hour or so, but at that point there was nothing that could be done to salvage this disaster. It was almost bad enough to be so bad it's good. But sadly it failed in even that regard. The crazy rednick killers are actually wearing business suits this time. Absurd. Plus, the opening credits were like 90 minutes long. I love the way Texans are portrayed in this movie though. I'm from Dallas and if anyone actually thinks Dallas is like this then they are way off.

A trashy sequel to a wonderful horror movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even One Star Is Too Good For This Film","review":"What happened? This film is an embarrassment to the 1974 classic. It's not at all scary, it has way too much gore, the acting is WAY over the top, and its unsuccessfull attempts at black humor make it goofy! Plus, I hated the way Leatherface and Stretch played out as the sentimental King Kong and his damsel in distress. I also kept wondering whatever happened to the family's secluded run down house? Now you could say they're living in luxury even! The annoying DJ Stretch is irritating just standing around screaming and not trying to save herself! And Dennis Hopper's character Enright doesn't help much either as he runs around sawing apart everything around him! I'm sorry Tobe Hooper, but you really blew it on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody Awful","review":"How can anyone pay money for this piece of absolute [junk]? The acting is so corny, the effects are laughable (sorry Tom Savini) and the plot is so thin it makes the other sequels look like masterpieces. This film still remains banned in several countries due to it's sexually implied violence...i think it's been banned because the censors saw how [junky] this film really is and decided it wasn't worth spending any money on to release it.

That in it's self is hilarious,but once you see this film,you will go from being terrorfied and grossed out to laughing your bag off.There are three major differences between this and the original.First,the aforementioned humor that is very similar to Evil Dead 2. Trust me on this one,if you enjoyed Evil Dead 2,you HAVE to see this movie. Second,where the first merely suggested violence and gore,this one goes overboard with it. From chainsaw labotomys while driving down a dark Texas highway to actually being witness to Leatherface making a new..umm...leatherface.Thirdly,this movie isn't based on anything but characters from the first film,no true life occurences,so it doesn't have the same kind of ambiance as the first film,but it was still a great ride.I f you like your horror movies funny and gross,this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"best movie ever made, dammit","review":"every minute of this Tobe Hooper classic is drenched in blood! madness, mayhem, and a classic chainsaw battle between Dennis hopper and Leatherface make this a video to be cherished for years to come. oh, yeah, and that guy scratching his head with a heated coat hanger! too cool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer","review":"I bought this book for a friend who draws.

If you're lucky you can find treatises as sweeping as McPherson's tomb on reconstruction, or David Kennedy's work on the New Deal -- very, very good books with broad topical approaches, yet extremely narrow in their chronological scope. There must be a couple of books on U.S. History analyzing the \\"revolutionary\\" to present-day U.S. I am positive there is not one book other than Zinn's that attempts to cover as long a period as the last 500 years.Zinn's \\"people\\"-perspective definitely is only one of many possible approaches to history. Yet his narrow analytical approach to long-term history makes for a fun read.

Even the title of his book \\"A People's History of the United States\\" has a socialist ring to it. \\"Comrade Zinn\\" is (or was) a well-paid academic who's been out of touch with the real world for some time. He's part of the liberal establishment that is prevalent in the universities. \\"Comrade Zionist Zinn\\" will bad-talk and bash the United States all day long, but he won't say a word about the injustices done to Palestinians by Zionists in Israel.

It sickened me to have such things focused on exclusively without any balance. I left feeling that I live in the worst country on the planet! I suggest that Mr. Zinn utilize his critical talents to examine other countries, then compare their dark history against ours - I think the U.S. would be looked upon very favorably. A few countries may be squeaky clean, but you don't become a world leader without mistakes along the way.

It's as if he doesn't realize (or more likely, chooses not to) that for many of them the plight of \\"the worker\\" was so much cover for their own power grab.

I have received a very wholesome dose of traditional (winner-based) history and I feel that I should also see what happened to the napalmed/massacred/nuked civilians - whoever the perpetrator.Now, I really want to see Zinn's and others views on the recent Crusades against US-identified infidels.

But he takes this idea further. He argues that historians should not even TRY to write balanced or comprehensive history, but instead they should write a version that supports the political and social values they support. He doesn't care about presenting both sides of a story, leaving it to other historians to tell the other side. In other words, Zinn puts ideology and propoganda over objectivity. He doesn't care if the resulting work is distorted, one-sided or misleading; he argues that if readers want balance they should read somebody else's work and sort things out for themselves. This book is a result of that approach. History of this kind is a lot easier to write, and left-wingers love it.

If you love our country, and the founding ideals, then this is the last book I would have your teenager read. This book only further subscribes to the indoctrination that all things are possible through Government, instead, of all things are possbile through hard work, self governance, self reliance, and the Creator's guidance.

However, America was not and is not and has not been a \\"socialist democracy\\" or a society of equality.America, historically, is a country founded on the essence that individuals have a right to express themselves within certain constraints in a manner that is not necessarily popular or preferred.This individual liberty is what allows our nation to grow and evolve into a nation that is REACHING but has yet to achieve \\"equality\\". Often, we forget that Equality is the Goal not the Fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tilted!","review":"When reading history, remember to consider the source.

His book is replete with anti- establishment, anti- corporation, anti- white male, anti- patriotic bias. And lest the reader have any question as to his agenda, read the final two chapters in which he openly advocates the overthrow of our current way of life, the forced redistribution of wealth, and in it's place, a new utopian existence based on failed social experiements of the past.This book does not represent a balanced view of American History. It's an entirely negative, depressing view of our nation as seen from a depressed Marxist who looks for the overthrow of our country."},{"rating":"1","title":"total garbage","review":"This is one of the worst most biased history compilations I have ever read. Anyone who wishes to read it would be advised to look into the black history of the author"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow.","review":"Howard Zinn can be a communist if he wants to be, but he has no right to call this book a history, when it really should be called \\"Why America sucks and should be a communist country\\". Not only that, but he has to be the worst scholar I've ever come across. Footnotes, anyone? Also, if you read all of the five-star reviews, they're liberals calling conservatives biggots and saying that this \\"new look\\" at history is refreshing. As if they're alone in the world. Take at look at the ratio of five-star reviews to one and two-star review. All alone. Poor liberals. My deepest sympathies to you all."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I was very saddened that after Zinn's passing away it was revealed that he was indeed a communist. I cannot give much weight to a book about America that was written by an life long communist. So now I have to read it again and with a skeptical eye knowing that he was a communist and supporter of the communist philosophy that his been responsible for the deaths of more than 130 million people (at least 61 million in the Soviet Union and 70 million in Mao's China alone). I may end up being sorry that I ever read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different perspective","review":"Howard Zinn's A People's History of The United States is a fascinating book that reveals historys from a unique standpoint. While many school text books sugar-coat American history and downplay the faults of many key figures in our past, Zinn is brutally honest and reflects the past through the eyes of those who lived it. The book is laceed with eyewitness accounts and makes for an enjoyable and memorable read. While the vast ammount of detail can make the text a bit tetious at times, this book is a treasure for anyone looking to increase their knowlegde of the history of the United States."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistently the Best","review":"I just ordered another three copies of this book and I have owned dozens of them. It is my favorite gift to young people because it is a history they don't usually read and a necessary balance to what they are spoon fed as American history in school. I have one granddaughter who just graduated high school and starts college and I want her to read this book first. History is written by winners which is why a history about the real movers and shakers of history, the masses who suffer under the yoke of the ruling classes is necessary. It is one of the best books about history ever written because it is the most honest and balanced (yes, balanced because the right has already had their turn) presentation of an often ignoble history. Thanks Howard Zinn.

This book tells all the facts interlaced with real documents, letters, statements from the people who lived before us. This book made American history very real for me.

Hats off to Zinn, for allowing these people to voice their cries from the pages of history, finally."},{"rating":"2","title":"History from view point of the masses and the victims.","review":"History is usually written by the conquerors, rulers and powerful and most history books are written from the point of view or favoring these entities whether along economic, race or political lines.This book was a great read and I learnt a lot about the early days of the colonies in the new world, the USA and the harsh treatment meted out to the indigenous peoples and slaves.Mr. Zinn comes across as left leaning but that is OK as long as the reader remains objective in his or her analysis.This is a long book and sometimes can get overwhelming with the amount of incidents of the various movements mentioned in this book. That's why the 4 stars.Overall a great read if you're a history buff or would like to get a different perspective which is not available in most books available to our young ones and students in high schools and colleges and also if you want to be educated on how the US foreign and economic policy affects the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Show me the data!","review":"I find it disturbing that this book is being used in classrooms accross the United States. Zinn manages to condemn everything about the history of the United States and villify the people who built this great country. I don't believe that Karl Marx was the greatest man that ever walked the planet as Zinn does or that capitalism is an evil that needs to be crushed, but I can't fault the book for the ideals that Zinn idolizes. I can fault the book for shoddy phrases such as \\"everyone knows that....\\" or \\"it seems like they wanted to.......\\". If this is to be a history book or....gasp...a history TEXT, he really should have tried to stick to the facts and not constantly interject his communist/socialist bias into every nook and cranny that he possibly could.

The reason its one sided, if youd read the last chapter, is because the other side has already been told, as a student i know, ive learned it for the last 11 years, finally i can hear something new though, in a clear way that almost anyone can understand. Very Good. Also Look at \\"Lies my Teachers Told me\\" by James Lowen"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete","review":"For people who are already very familiar with American history, Zinn provides an interesting alternative view of events. I disagree with many of his premises and most of his conclusions, but he lays out his arguments clearly and provides a starting point for worthwhile debate.That said, I would not recommend this book to someone wanting an overview of American history. Zinn jumps around and fails to provide important background information on many of his subjects. Unless the reader is already very familiar with the events being discussed, they will be misled into accepting one man's rather biased and depressing view of America.Finally, I know this has been mentioned before, but I found the lack of foot-notes and the scantily compiled bibliography rather inadequate for a 'scholarly' book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zinn...

I also enjoy digging deeper than what the old school textbooks and the nightly news tells me. As they say, \\"there are two sides to every story.\\" Zinn epitomizes that concept. If you really want to know the history of the USA, then you must consider several perspectives. \\"A People's History\\" is one of the best books out there that gives the voiceless in history a spotlight."},{"rating":"2","title":"History as it was meant to be written","review":"Howard Zinn is one of my own personal heroes. When I first read \\"People's History\\" in High School, I was thrilled to see that a grown-up, an expert, a teacher, was writing about the things that my awakening political consciousness was beginning to suspect. As a history major in college, he provided me with a constant example of how history should be written: clearly and passionately. More than that, though, he taught me to fight for what you believe in, stand up for justice, and speak the truth, however unpalatable it may be. Surely that is a lesson that everyone can respect, regardless of political loyalties. As our country enters a new era of bloodshed, I have turned again to Zinn for guidance. I find myself once again wishing our world's leaders were as wise and compassionate as he is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"My teacher uses this book all the time. And to everyone who says it is biased: that is the point. The point is to offer a point of view other than the traditional textbook. If he offered both points of view it would be missing the point. We could go and pick up any other textbook or go to any website and find the other view. We couldn't find Zinn's view in many other places. This is an excellent book which lets you, for once, think about America in a different way. It gives you some sense of all the people who have led their lives based on the principles of money and power. A must read for anyone who likes history."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 for history 5 for alternate perspective","review":"While this book does show some bias, I would say no more than my high school textbooks. Refreshingly, it comes from the other side. An entertaining read, but I would not use it as a serious historical text. It does a good job of showing an alternative perspective on things, but takes it a bit too far in my opinion.

The author is probably making large sums of money for teaching fake history. Although I agree that the 'peoples' side of the story does need to be told, he ignores numerous facts, creates his own facts, and uses misquotes to express and to 'prove' his points.

But, just thumb through it. From Columbus to Lincoln to Reagan, all white men are bad. And, white republican men are really bad (despite their introduction of suffrage, elimination of slavery, and overwhelming support for civil rights laws). Just as you need not drink but a gulp of the ocean to know what it tastes like, Zinn's book can be fully comprehended in five pages or less. Just apply the Columbus story to every other major event and every other prominent white male in American history and you have read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Revisionist Screed","review":"This is just another piece of liberal revisionist screed about how bad America and Americans have been and are.

(1) The insights are not surprising, and (2) there is hardly any evidence of worthy research behind the opinions of the author.He often cites completely absurd sources to make a point, like a bumpersticker in 2000 or \\"one person writing in the Gazette in 1764\\". I am sure you can prove anything if you can argue with \\"one person once said\\".I was expecting from a book on the \\"history of the people\\" to trully investigate how \\"the people\\" have felt and lived history in this country. What you get, instead, is how the author's modern western and quite leftish view of things perceives history in hindsight. Quite a different thing.The book doesn't read like the work of an academic, but rather, like an angry ultra-left superficial view of the world. The kind of writing one finds in free weekly newspapers like \\"Citypaper\\". At least those editorials have humor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! It was Amazing!","review":"For all the low-brow types out there: this book blew chunks! Never have I read a more depressing book that takes so many pot-shots at America. Most people are not blind to the truth, not flag flying conservatives that ignore or disregard what is truth.The main challenge that I have with the book is that it is written by a person who lives in a nation that he hates. How in God's name can a person have NOTHTING good to say about America and yet continue to NOT move to a country that embodies the ideals that he wants? Makes me feel sorry for him and glad that I read this book on my own and wasn't required to read it for school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeleslly outdated and baised narrative","review":"In the entire opus magnum there isn't a single fact cited that may shed any (god forbid!!!) positive light on any of Mr. Zinn's numerous shadow boxing partners, which includes every single one of American Presidents including Washington, JFK and Clinton.Yes, the book cites some interesting and obscure facts which need to be illuminated. But Zinn does it with such a messianic, Rush Limbaugh-like bias as the make the entire thing a hopeless waste of time. Despite trying very hard Zinn is no Lenin, certainly not in the intellectual capacity department."},{"rating":"1","title":"Socialist Propaganda","review":"Only avowed Socialists would find this propaganda book intellectually honest.

If you don't, just remember my admonition. To my leftist detractors: The truth hurts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerously Manipulative to the Uninformed","review":"A reader must be very discerning with this review of American history. Though he presents many facts and events worth knowing about for their informational value, Howard Zinn is overtly naive and socialistic in his approach. Deliberately twisting the truth, as Zinn repeatedly accuses other historians and the US government of doing, he uses a stockpile of out-of-context and biased evidence to support his overly-sympathetic views. Though worth reading for its historical insight, a reader must be wary of Zinn's unctuous appeal to their emotional sense of injustice and, as with all history books, not believe everything to which he so glibly makes claim. In addition to this, I wish to add a personal comment. There is no such thing as \\"neighborly socialism\\" and by claiming so, Howard Zinn shows a profound misunderstanding of socialism, its ideals and its inevitable results."},{"rating":"1","title":"History?","review":"After reading this book for a school assignment I was disgusted. How can someone seem to hate the country that allowed him the right to concoct such a tome in the first place? It would be unfair to say that Zinn is biased because all history is interpreted by the each author or historian in diffrent ways. The book is extremely well written and I suggest, if you are going to read it, pair it with A Patriot's History of the United States, by Larry Schweikart and Michael Allen to wash the bad taste out of your mouth. I do disagree with Zinn; it is a book that challenged everything I grew up learning and also was a challenge to read, but it was still interesting to see how the left side of America thinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"Well researched and well written, this book looks into the not so bright side of the U.S. government. The most shocking thing to me was the mass revolts of prisons in the seventies and the desertions that happened in the Mexican-American War. A true masterpiece, a most read for anyone who is interested in history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A People's History of the United States","review":"Provides the reader with a different perspective of the history of the United States as seen through the eyes of African Americans, Native Americans, women, prisoners, laborers.

It is thought provoking and compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a veteran history teacher, I find this book very lacking.","review":"As a veteran history teacher, I found this book to be very lacking.

Explain the History of the United States with a focus on the \\"little guy.\\" In the end it's pretty typical leftist history.

The pages were in very good condition, however, the book jacket was quite worn. When the book is closed one can see where a student has written his name in large print across the bottom of the book. While this might not occur frequently, it would definitely make me think twice about ordering another book from the same company, American Textbooks. I will accept some responsibility for my casual disappointment due to the fact I relied on the status of the book being in \\"very good\\" condition without having prior experience with the company. My prior experience purchasing used books in \\"very good\\" condition means they usually arrive at my door in stellar condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-Side of the Story","review":"Unfortunately this book is very-one sided. Zinn leaves out crucial events and issues that help to validate his attacks on America. In dealing with the Japanese/Attack on Pearl Harbor, he leaves out extremely crucial information about why the United States was forced to drop the nuclear bombs on Japan. He leaves out the part about the 25 million Chinese who had been relentlessly slaughtered by the Japanese and how Tojo had armed civilians in case a fight between the Allies and Japan would take place on Japanese soil. He blatanly leaves out references to events like the Rape of Naking and the horrible slaughter of American GI's in the Pacific Theatre. Unfortunately, there is so much crucial information left out of this book, that is it absolutely useless as a reference for Amerian History.

Have we always done right by our own people? No! But the principles of our founding are those that we can focus on to become a better and more enlightened people. Zinn and those like him (like my son's High School US History teacher who uses this book for his classroom text) are attempting to educate a generation of citizens who hate our country and do not understand what we stand for.

(I found errors is his history of Lincoln, Native Americans, and (most commonly) modern economics).I don't think that this is intentional.

This switch is a handy way of doing that without having to unscrew the incoming F connector.

If you have shut off your heart and mind as a biblical literalist, worshipping the bible as an idol, and allowed yourself to obsess over what folks do in the bedroom (as an example, see \\"great deception\\" review of this book), you won't get it, which is a pity. Christianity is SO much more than taking snippets of Bible verses out of context to justify limited views based on a conception of God that isn't anything more than a reflection of your own prejudices and judgments staring back at you (the proverbial log in the eye). Jim Manion has followed in the steps of the great Christian mystics and ascetics, dug down deep, and mined Christianity's real riches and shared them.

This film is sensual, unique and poignant. The characters are so well drawn and unique. The cast is magnificent, and we watch them perform various forms of art, from traditional to modern, especially dance. Almodovar wraps and joins love stories around profoundly forward-thinking social statements like a female bullfighter (played by Rosario Flores), who is both believable and fascinating as one of the principals. In this film we are given the great gift of culture with some of the best artists and performances of today, in addition to a unique and touching human story of the one-sided love a disconnected young man has for a coma patient, formerly a dancer he espied through his front window. There is also a silent film within this film which is fine and comedic and erotic. This is artistic film-making at its best and should not be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrifying","review":"This film condones the rape and consequent impregnation of a comatose woman.

The cinematography was beautiful and I tried hard to sympathize with the protagonists presented by Almodovar. But ultimately I found it impossible to identify with a rapist. This movie is yet another example of rape and other violence against women is normalized and eroticised in film. It's really very simple and the complex statement about how love crosses boundaries, is false. A man having sex with a woman who is not able to consent, because she is in a coma, is disgusting and makes me very angry."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALMODOVAR's WORST!!!","review":"The only reason this movie gets one star is because it is its lowest rating. I am a HUGE Almodovar fan and I find that this is his WORST MOVIE EVER! It's only saving grace is the small silent movie that is completely out of place in this hideously bad film. I found the acting to be very poor. I cannot understand for the life of me how this movie won two Oscars. If you want to see a truly unique Almodovar film rent \\"Matador\\" or \\"Live Flesh\\".

He is one of the very few directors in film history that creates movies that are hugely artistic and commercialy successful. He managed to create a style of his own, visually and conceptually. This movie is a lot different from all his earlier movies. You can recognize his camera style, the acting, the music, and the light comedy but you will not see the strong melodrama and the camp elemets. This movie is Almodvar mixed with a bit of Bergman. This is a start of a new phase in his directing career and I am looking forward to see what he is going to do next.."},{"rating":"2","title":"The supreme masterpiece of Almodovar","review":"Almodovar reached the highest peak with this imaginative, potent, original and powerful movie.A disturbed man of introspective character falls in love with the woman of his dreams , his muse .Suddenly she will have an awful accident who will allow to Almodovar to make an intimate jouney through the psiquis and the hidden feelings of that anonymus guy who will become in his fellow guardian .The caleidoscopic , arresting and surrealist images will envolve the viewer in a complex web of unthinkable situations in which the love and death will act as a perfect syncronized mechanism of watch .This film awarded the best original script , but in my personal point of view , this work is by far the best achievement of the notable career of this talented and irreverent film maker in this well gifted generation of spanish directors.Superb in all its powerful meaning ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope, didn't like it","review":"I actually had to watch this film because of my job. I never liked Almodovar's films because his \\"women\\" are not even real characters. Here, both were in comas (previous films, they are victimized, molested, etc). This \\"kind\\" male nurse STALKED the girl, entered her home under false pretenses, entered her bedroom, saw her naked, then later bathes and dresses her while she's in her coma. It's like the only way he can have her is like this. He never wanted an equal, he wanted someone dependent (there seem to be no strong women in Almodovar's films).As for the \\"erotic\\" silent film in the middle...why? Why was it there? Sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 stars for this entertaining and divisive film","review":"It seems that people are of two minds about this film; either they think it was offensive (\\"glorifies rape\\"), or they think it was one of Almodovar's best films (part of his \\"mature stage\\"). I will offer a third view: like all of Almodovar's films, it's entertaining but ultimately trivial; not even worth the fuss of such serious discussion.Habla con Ella certainly marks Almodovar's \\"mature\\" stage, in the sense that the music and themes are more serious and less neurotic or whimsical, and the production value looks to be at an all-time high for his films. Perhaps this is because he recently turned 60. But despite this, his consistent trademark is still maintained here: the film is very entertaining yet never displays any poignancy that could elevate it to classic status."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good movie, sometimes pretty funny","review":"there is a scene in the movie that is so funny but quite unspeakable or writeable here. this is a beautifully produced spanish film. by viewing this film, you can also realize that spain now is in a pretty good shaped economy, no wonder so many our dringos moved over there to enjoy a higher quality living standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great space opera","review":"Wonderful action-packed rollercoaster ride.

This is a very valuable tool, with specific examples and exercises which will be immediately applicable.

Specifically, when making the tag of the fly.The video close ups could be of better quality, and who ever is controlling the microphone sometimes creates noise or static.It is however the best product out there for instuction of tying classic wet flies and I will be purchasing his second video after I complete tying several of the flies in the video."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fantastic surprise!","review":"My Florence + the Machine Pandora station would cycle through a song from this EP once or twice a day when I listen at work.

Then the addiction grew with Love Always Remains. The songs are a mix of pop, electronica and dance. It's kind of an awesome mix that makes for perfect summertime listening.

The playing of the Berlin Philharmonic isn't BAD (through most of the piece, but there were a couple of parts where i just dropped my jaw at how pathetic it was. Wrong rythms, poor ensemble, etc.), but they DO NOT do this brilliant, savage piece of music justice.

It has everything -- romance, humor, fantasy, tragedy. First chance I got, I ran to the record store to get a copy. This is the version I chose. Although I am not a connoisseur of opera, to my untrained ears the performances sound beautiful. Placido Domingo infuses his rendition of Hoffmann with the appropriate angst. One very nice feature of this edition is that it comes with a complete libretto in four languages. It also includes essays on the real-life Hoffmann and the various ways this unfinished work has been reconstructed through the years. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes good music and a good story. It has borne many, many repeated listenings in my house."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"This game has the potential to be fun. Unlike others who say this is \\"dumbed down\\" from the first one, I thought the the original B&W; spent too much time forcing the player to set up cities and play the game with limited resources. This does correct some of the imbalance and allows for a more direct way to conquer other cities (namely, armies).The problem is this sequel was designed like an after-thought. It, quite simply, doesn't work. My specs exceed what is needed - however, the game (and this is from forums dedicated to it) was not designed to be compatible with Windows XP, let alone Windows XP 64 Pro (which is what I run).The result is that every time the game gets interested it crashes. Not to a blue screen, not directly to windows, but instead freezes, takes forever to get to the Windows Error screen, and then forces you to restart and go through the entire intro again.So, no matter how much fun and pretty the game may look, it's unplayable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Black & White","review":"It's an older game with graphics that are still good to this day.

The building menus are poorly designed. Early in the game, when there are few buildings available, it's not a factor.

The dialogue with your conscience angel and devil are excessively long winded, and you can't skip them. If you ever restart a game, you get to listen to the same unbypassable tutorial every time.

I found them more interesting than watching the movie. The only reason I gave it 2 stars versus one is because the filmmaker does make interesting points about life and idiotic relationships. He does touch on real human weaknesses and expose them, and maybe that was why it was painful for me to watch some of it? I really disliked the main male protagonist... the Director. Yes, he was damaged, but why inflict it on other damaged souls? I feel he was using the women to cure his writers block. I wished the women would've turned around and run from him.. immediately... and kept their dignity. The ending was also unexpected... unpredictable... abrupt, but gave me some hope.

From the first few pages I knew that he would become one of my favorite authors because he doesn't try to fill your head with nonsense, but instead encourages you by introducing new ways of thinking and being more open minded. I really enjoy this book and look forward to reading more by him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Keeper","review":"This is a book to keep in your library for periodic re-reading.

If one's wisdom is such that it evokes admiration for the thought rather than for the thinker, then one has indeed spoken well.

I forced myself to read 3/4 of it. If you want to get useful info.. Put up a book on buddism or yoga meditation. I found nothing special about this book. I read a lot of books on meditation, yoga, and buddism, and this book doesn't hold up to any of them. I read the reviews on this site and ran out to buy this book.

True to his style of revealing the extraordinary aspects of the otherwise ordinary, this book shows the reader how to enrich many day-to-day activities through mindful living.I particularly enjoyed the format. The book first introduces the reader to the concept of mindfulness and then it provides short chapters about how mindfulness can be applied to various aspects of life. Making the chapters short and focused on a particular facet allows the reader to quickly read and apply the techniques in a step-wise fashion, incrementally applying mindfulness to different aspects of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY too complicated","review":"this is way too many CD's and not good for a beginner.

I would buy \\"The Power of Now\\" and another book on meditation or attend to a meditation group. I don't like this book after experiencing \\"The Power of Now\\", a much better book that delivers almost the same information in a more captivating way - which makes it easier for the reader/listener (I bought the audio book) to follow and pay attention.

I have been practicing Yoga for 8 years and teaching it for 2. Mine is an ongoing quest to understand my self. I practice the 8 limbs of Yoga on the mat and off it.The Yoga Sutras and the works of other Yoga masters guide me daily. Yet there have been times when I have needed something more to bring presence into my daily life.'Wherever You Go There You Are' has provided me with what I have been looking for. The works in this book help me see myself a little bit better, a little bit clearer. They provide direction on how to proceed when I feel stuck or confused. They also provide techniques and tools to overcome the bumps or challenges that I may be experiencing at any one moment.So, thank you so much for this insightful piece of work. You are a true guru. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I found this book to be transformative","review":"While I recognize that the power of some books rest only in that they come along at the right time of one's life...this book was simply beautiful. From the first chapter until about 3/4 of the way through, I was completely drawn in and found most of what Kabat-Zinn wrote to be compelling, relevant and so totally perceptive. He spends the first half of the book building the case for meditation and what it means for live life in the present moment of everyday. He then goes into detail about how to effectively meditate. I also purchased the tape companion meditation tapes and have used them to great effect. The book and the tapes have been a great introduction to the power of meditation in one's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its good to know what you're facing","review":"This book is great. It helped me face radiotherapy, and I incorporate this into my teaching (I'm a science teacher)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read on this subject.","review":"Written by two nurses who understand the questions patients have before and during chemotherapy or radiation therapy, this book is very easy to read but doesn't skimp on technical details when necessary. The chapters cover basics about the treatment, how to deal with side-effects, getting good nutrition, support, and bone-marrow transplants. I work at a Cancer Center and our patients really like this book because it de-mystifies the process and helps guide them through from beginning to end. There is comfort in knowing what is coming and they feel reassured to know that there are ways to deal with just about everything that may come their way. Since our patients are usually very interested in mind/body techniques during chemotherapy, I especially like the chapters on Mind/Body techniques, relaxation and visualization. The authors seem to know just what patients are looking for and what they need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little info for Radiation","review":"I bought this book expecting information for dealing with radiation. There was very little information on radiation at all. The book may be useful for Chemotherapy patients (which is why I give it two stars). It had no stars of value for me dealing with radiation. My doctor told me more. \\"Cancer for dummies\\" and \\"just get me through this\\" have more information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This was a great book.

So seems like the motor burned out. Do not buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the concept, but motor is too weak","review":"I've now owned four of these. Each has had the motor die. One after a single day. The longest was six months. The system is a good one. The bottle works well and is a good size. But, the motor simply can't handle regular use.You can limp it along by putting fewer frozen pieces in -- say under half the bottle -- or by only mixing for a few seconds, before walking away and letting it rest. But, in all, you shouldn't have to baby it quite so much.I'll probably try another type next to see if it works better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was great while it lasted!!","review":"I bought this unit after trying one out at my buddies house. He had just recently got one as a gift.Great concept! I ordered mine the same night. I used it 4 days a week for 3 weeks for post- workout protein shakes. Here I am 3 weeks later ,blender wont start, called my buddy, guess what? His crapped out also!

I use it twice a day to blend up a mixture of juice, frozen and fresh fruits, and protein for pre- and post-workout nourishment. I love it. I haven't had any problems blending anything I've thrown in. The motor and blades seem very capable. It's the perfect size. It's quick, it's easy, and was well priced. The only negative is the bottle can't take hot liquids...like dishwasher temperatures. This is a minor issue as it is easy enough just to hand wash when necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"too bad this doesn't work better","review":"The concept is great but the mechanics of the design are fatally flawed. I got one of these and it worked fine, and so I ordered a few as gifts. Most of them don't work, and the main problem is the way the bottle interacts with the base. This is made even worse by bad workmanship. The tabs pop out, the links don't connect, etc. It is very frustrating to have gifts fail to work. I ordered one for my daughter; it won't work at all; I ordered another, and its tabs jump off. This needs a technical re-design to be a reliable and satisfactory product to live up to the good idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"shake and take is great","review":"Shake n TakeThis product made blending my frozen fruits into smoothie's a real pleasure.Its so easy to use, literally, just shake and take.

Then the motor burnt out. Thought \\"no problem\\", got a lot of use out of it. I will happily order another one. The replacement burned out after a few uses. So, I ordered another one. That one burned out after a few uses also. Tried one more, that one lasted a few weeks. We used to love this product. The only thing I can think of is they started using cheaper motors. I am now going to look for a replacement product. Shake 'n Take... let me know when you start making a quality product again and I'll come back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but the motor is simply not strong enough","review":"Got one for Christmas. Tried it on the 26th and thought it was a very novel idea; convenient, easy to use, easy to clean, etc. 8 days later the motor dies. What's up with that? No ice was used, only frozen banana mixed with juice - that's it, motor died! A better motor and the item would probably last years and I'd give it 5 stars. Not sure the company will even replace it now, but I'm not sure I really want them to either! I know it will just die again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke first use","review":"I got this for xmas a few years ago. I got it out tonight to use for the first time.

I make two shakes every morning with frozen blueberries, bananas, rice milk and protien powder. The trick is to use it for no more than 15 seconds at a time.

I love this product and only wish that I was the one that I had invented it first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Purchase","review":"The only reason this is getting one star is because when you can actually get it to lock it does work, however then you have to FIGHT to get it to unlock to clean. Blending takes about 60 sec. opening and closing close to 10 min. Very NOT user friendly. Would not purchase this product unless your a weight lifter. Going in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has the quality changed?","review":"I bought one of these blenders 4 or 5 years ago and it's awesome. I use it almost daily. The blades on my shaker bottles were starting to get a little dull, perhaps because I use the dishwasher as opposed to hand washing immediately after use. At either rate, I ordered some new shaker bottles from Amazon.com and was sent the blender instead. I decided to keep the blender and use my old one as a spare. That idea only lasted a single use because the new blender was incapable of blending the exact same ingredients I've used hundreds of times on the blender. And, the motor now smells of overheating. So, I'm not sure if I got a bad batch or if the quality of the electic motors has been reduced since my first purchase. I hope not. I was planning on using this product for the rest of my life as it is a very convenient product."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product does NOT work.","review":"I ordered this product and though the delivery was very fast, right out of the box i tried it after giving it a quick wash, and nope, it would not work AT ALL.

Please dont buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shake 'n Take Smoothie Maker","review":"The product is a great idea but it is poorly constructed. The sports bottle lid allows liquid to drip out at the base of the spout, so I have avoided drinking from the spout. The motor still works on the blender, but I need to pour the contents into a glass or another portable container. The manual for the product says there is a one year limited warranty, but the cost of shipping and handling is about $12, almost half what I paid for the product. I do not recommend this product. Make your smoothies in a good blender and pour the contents into a well constructed portable beverage holder."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"I am disappointed that the bottom of shake and take bottle does not come apart to clean.

When it was mixed to cd, it seems that the synch got screwed, because everything is a little bit too fast, and Bobby and Jerry sound more like Alvin and the Chipmunks than you'd want to hear - especially since the track listing is great, and the jams they recorded were excellent. I find it to be a good background disc if you don't listen to the vocals, or just sing over them yourself. Morning Dew is definately the highlight for me, but if you listen to it clear-headed, you'll keep wondering how they got recorded before puberty. Good playing guys, but bad form you lame import cd companies.

They are one of my favorite bands, and I could listen to them for all of eternity if I had to. Look, this is a good show. But it's botched here. It sounds like they sped it up about 10x the normal speed. They sound like they were inhaling massive quantities of helium throughout the concert and playing. Consider this Alvin & the Chipmunks Meets the Grateful Dead. It's that horrible. 1971 was a great year for the Dead (let me rephrase that -- an ESSENTIAL year for the Dead), but stick with 'Skull & Roses' and the various archival 1971 releases that Grateful Dead/Arista/Rhino have released over the years. You'll be far happier and you'll hear the Dead at the proper speed.If you ever wondered what the Dead would sound like on helium and you were willing to shell out some cash to hear it, then it is your lucky day.

I filled my humidifier with spring water and a few days after usage, the filter had turned completely yellow around the edges and had a smell, kind of like what you would smell on a used car filter. I tried another one, thinking maybe I just got a hold of a bad one. It did the same thing. I went to the store and bought my usual filter and compared the two.

If you're in academia, you've long suspected this, but you also think that anyone who says this is experiencing \\"sour grapes.\\" Who knows?Well, this 1958 book confirms the most cynical interpretation of the academic job market. It was written in the boom years, when there were too many position and not enough people, but the persuit of prestige uber alles and the moral hazard engendered by tenure are well documented in this work. I'm sure it was popular among critics of higher ed when criticism of higher ed was fashionable in the 1960s, and now that criticism of higher ed is fashionable again, perhaps a new generation of readers buy used copies for a bargain price.So if you ever thought it was just you, buy this book and you'll see you're not alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Same Ole' Same","review":"The first book I read by E.

This time, I got \\"Abide With Me.\\" Hated it. It seemed like a repeat of \\"And This Too Shall Past.\\" I am not against homosexuality, and I do know that Mr. Harris is a gay writer, but personally, I feel he gets to detailed with the gay love scenes, and I just haven't gotten use to reading such material.

These characters seem to not have a clear understanding of where they stand. Confusion was not part of God's plan. Homosexuality is abnormal. It's clearly a chemical imbalance. Yes, It's too harsh for the media to admit but it's the truth. Justifying it is not a cure. We were created either as man or woman not both. Emotions can be controlled - having emotions for someone of the same sex doesn't mean it's normal.Get real! Stop justifying every mess that we claim to be truth. The truth is that woman was created for man (conversely).Our actions will be judged - let's live right. E. Lynn Harris knows the truth.

I read it in one and a half days (like I have done his other books)and was crushed by it's ending! In my opinion E. Lynn Harris seemed to be at a lost that last chapter. Were we to be set up for yet another sequel? Or did he just run out of ways to end the book?

One question I do have is Please Mr. Harris continue writing because this artist's life would not be the same without!

NICOLE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SAVVY SISTER;WHEN DID SHE GET SO DUMB? TOO MANY LOOSE ENDS TO COUNT. IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT A SEQUEL IS PENDING HERE BUT THE ENDING WAS SOMETHING OUT OF TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL.

The subject matter is unbelievable and extreme; the characters are so one-dimensional they've become caricatures; and the only thing that I can give Mr. Harris credit for is the fact that he was able to dupe someone into publishing this.

I am not saying African-Americans do not lead these kind of successful lives, it was just that some of the elitism is hard to take.The book is quick reading, and has its interesting tales of the lifestyles of the well-off. Its gossipy stories would naturally make it hard to put down, only because the reader wants to see what happens to these brats.There were no interesting words flowing from Mr. Harris' pen.

The characters were too predictable and very simple. It was, in essence, too much of a fantasy world Everybody is, as in all the other novels, upper class and well to do. News flash: the majority of people are not like that. Also, there's an element of prejudice with facial features of the main characters: Green or Grey eyes, and \\"good hair?\\" All in all, the novel is more like a book soap opera.

This book was ok at the beginning, but the ending seemed rushed and I felt as if there was no closure. THIS BOOK IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE OTHERS AND DON'T BASE YOUR LIKING FOR E.

There was lots of drama but it just didn't seem to go anywhere. Everyone (his mama, his man, his friend, etc) seemed to know what Raymond was thinking all of the time --- bad writing or is the brother that transparent.

The update/closure on Raymond was satisfying but the Nicole storyline was a little off. There is sweet and then there is stupid.

He will definitely be the main character in a future novel.This is light reading which exposes us to a different kind of lifestyle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that sizzles your mind, heart and soul.","review":"There is nothing that E Lynn writes that I would not buy.

I think Mr. Harris has got caught up in his celebrity. He thinks that he can just put anything out now and people will snap it up. I seen better plots in a soap opera. The characters were silly and unbelievable especially the Yancey character. It was hard to believe that Ava would even care about a mediocre Nicole's career. Mr. Harris was stretching for story ideas. I can not believe he calls the series finished. It left more questions unanswered than answered.

This has been the only opera DVD I have purchased that I felt obliged to watch straight through (it got better and better) and then I watched it again the following day in its entirety.

The real issue for me is that you can not really keep pictures on this device as Apple would have you think UNLESS YOU BUY ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE. For Apple users, you have to have have iPhoto 4.0.3 and for Windows users you have to have Adobe Photoshop Album 2.0 or Elements 3.0.

I don't care about the color screen and that you can have a picture slideshow. You can get the same 40GB iPod that stills holds 10,000 songs for much less than this. I hate the expensive versions of the iPod because who the heck would use 10,000-15,000 songs? I might use 2,000 songs but that's it. That's why the iPod mini is horrible also. The 60GB is way out of a person's reach (moneywise)and the 40GB is just a waste of money because Apple makes the same gigabyte space for a cheaper price. We don't need color screens we just need a thing that plays music (nothing high-tech!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"My husband and I both found this book to be ridiculous. The writer is naive as to what really went on/goes on in a communist country. Did she not do her homework before she adopted? She couldn't believe people actually knew her every move ... what world does she live in? We feel she saw things as she wanted to see things, not as they really are. We also don't find her point of view to be of any help. Let's face it ... the average person does not have the means to spend that kind of money to live in China for 2 months after having spent $20,000 to $30,000 to adopt. We're looking for something more realistic on teaching our daughter's heritage."},{"rating":"2","title":"From someone planning a homeland tour","review":"The previous reviews show a wide range of reactions to this book. As someone who is about to take her 8 and 4 year old adopted daughters on a homeland tour that will include a brief stay in each of their home towns, I obviously see nothing wrong with taking a child Lulu's age back to China. I didn't agree with everything the author said and did, but the book gave me a lot to think about before we go on our trip. Many of the negative reviews were written in the days when homeland tours were fairly rare. Emily Prager was a pioneer! Many people have taken their adopted children back to China since then and I think we know by now that these trips are generally positive experiences for the children. There are a variety of opinions on the age at which children should return. I think that it really depends on the child and the financial resources of the parent (i.e., how often they can afford to go back)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puzzling, misleading and too cute","review":"The premise of this book is troubling: the author takes her not-yet-five year old daughter to trace her Chinese roots. As a parent who has also adopted, I find the idea of taking a child on such a long \\"roots\\" journey to be questionable, considering the child's youth and the complexity of this particular journey (and, of course, it's expensive). What can such a young child understand and retain of this experience? And if this little girl is as confused and concerned about her roots as the mother says, doesn't such a trip prompt even more confusion? My sense is that Prager wanted to write another book and take a good trip and her daughter provided a lot of good material for one. The two really good things about the book - and that's why I give it two stars - is that 1) it's well written - Prager is good at that and 2) it lists some other good books for folks who have adopted or are thinking of adopting. But otherwise, this book gave me the creeps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musings And Rantings -- AND CONJECTURE","review":"As the parent of a child adopted from China, I found this book highly contrived and genunely offensive on a variety of levels. First, and foremost, it is an intimate account of the psyche of a FIVE YEAR OLD CHILD adopted from China and her feelings about her adoption. But not by the child, by her mother. This is ridiculous and impossible and an invasion of the child's very soul. And her privacy What will this girl think of her mother's convoluted conjecture about the way in which she felt -- and behaved -- when she was in kindergarten as this kid grows up?This is a powerful subject: taking an internationally adopted child back to the country and culture in which she was born and now the author has RUINED any chances of ANYONE ever writing another book on the subject again -- and writing it with or on behalf of a child who is mature enough to consent to the work.Thumbs down. Don't honor this book by purchasing it asks this adoptive parent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"Wuhu Diary records the author's trip to Wuhu China with the daughter whom she adopted from that city. Adopted as an infant, Ms. Prager's daughter is five-years-old during the narrative, and has been coming to grips with being Chinese and American, and the daughter of a single white woman. When I heard the author interviewed on NPR I felt that the daughter was much too young for such an emotionally demanding trip and after reading the book I am all the more convinced that this is true. Not only does the daughter go to an orphanage (not the same one where she stayed ) but she is shown the bridge where she was abandoned. Before the trip she had thought she'd been left at a hospital, small comfort but at least some comfort. Now the daughter must, at five years old, process the truth of her abandonment to the elements and to sheer chance. I find the psychodrama unleashed upon the daughter positively appalling, and I only hope that she has a therapeutic avenue available to her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Felt like I was visiting China with them","review":"When we adopted our daughter in 1999 we were not able to visit her hometown of Wuhu. This book helped us to connect with her birthplace, and let us relive the excitement of forming our family through adoption. Through detailed descriptions of the people and places Emily Prager has given us a great gift. I felt like I was right beside her. Maybe I am biased, but I think this is a wonderful book for anybody adopting internationally. It hit home for us in a big way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting disk of (mostly) second drawer Prokofiev","review":"This disk is a must have for all Prokofiev fans even though it features some of his less inspired music.There are a number of highlights. The music to \\"Hamlet\\" is Prokofiev at his most inspired and worth the price of the disk.

Only someone as great as Prokofiev could write a piece of such quality to such a banal text dedicated to such an evil subject. The other propoganda piece on the disk \\"Flourish, Mightly Land\\" (1947) is also worth listening to.The other pieces \\"Autumnal\\" and \\"Egyptian Nights\\" are second drawer Prokofiev, but not without merits.The works are all given committed performances by the Russian performers and are well recorded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smartly Compiled, yet...","review":"A true Prokofiev aficionado will find Rozhdestvensky's rendition of the EGYPTIAN NIGHTS, op.61 - made with the Leningrad Philharmonic, when Mravinsky was still alive(!) - much more inspired.

Taken as a whole, this disc is like so many early Classical compilations -- delightful at the time and leaving a nice glow, even if you can't quite hum the details afterward. The six symphonies were written by Herschel in the early 1760s, when he was approaching his mid-twenties. There's nothing terribly special about them, but they are, as I've said, nice little works that can delight. Matthias Bamert leads the London Mozart Players in performances that are polished and nicely recorded, just like the other discs in this series of music by Mozart's contemporaries. If you already have at least one disc of short symphonies by those contemporaries, you may not need this, but there's certainly no harm in owning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for potato chips!","review":"A good quiet machine, easy to clean BUT the slicing disc is only good for potato chips.

My favorite packaging to appear thus far is \\"Karajan Gold.\\" Karajan skates across the surface of Beethoven as he does with most other composers. There is little involvement here with the music, but you'll hear many flashy attention getting effects orchestrated by the egomaniacal Maestro. All is gloss and special effects. It is often said that this is the preferred set of Karajan's 3 (or is it 4) transversals of the great nine; and the sad truth is that this may very well be the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Those who ignore repeats should be taken outside and shot","review":"Karajan shows no respect for the balance of Beethoven's score.

These are exhilarating performances of most of Beethoven's symphonies, with the finest performances probably those of the 7th and 8th symphonies. Although the sound quality in this set is very good, those interested in hearing the finest version of this cycle should find a copy of the digital imaging bit remastered version which is part of Deutsche Grammophon's Complete Beethoven Edition. Unfortunately, that edition may be out of print. Personally I have never been a fan of this cycle or Karajan's other two Berlin Philharmonic cycles (The third cycle - which many regard as his worst - does have a fine version of the 3rd Symphony.); those interested in hearing exceptional Beethoven symphony cycles recorded in the 1960's or 1970's might be better advised to listen to Bohm's and Bernstein's versions with the Vienna Philharmonic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent collection","review":"I've always wanted to have Beethoven's 9 symphonies in one set, and this item is an inexpensive way to acquire it.

Let's agree that the Berlin Philharmonic in the 60s was a bunch of fantastic musicians. Let's also agree that Von Karajan was a man of iron will, who knew what he wanted and how to get it. Let's agree that Deutsche Gramophone was probably the state of the art in recording in the period.But that's it. The 6th Symphony virtually everyone agrees is awful. Listen to Bruno Walter (with an inferior outfit -- the Columbia Symphony) and one quickly sees what is missing from this recording. In the 9th, the chorus is shrill, and the 3rd movement totally uninvolved -- pick up the Furtwangler for a totally awesome, hair-raising performance. The first and second lack Mozartian grace -- listen to Szell and Cleveland!The best of the set is the 5th -- all sturm and drang as it should be -- but even here, the Carlos Kleiber, also with the Berlin, is a superior recording.I expect this set will fade with time as an interesting period piece, but with no strong lasting value."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful","review":"It is fashionable to deprecate Von Karajan - maybe because of his Nazi youth.

If you're looking for a set, you won't find a better, unless it's Bohm."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent recording, but the chorus is lacking","review":"After hearing this recording, I can now understand why it has been praised by many and hounded by others. Karajan's tempi are, as expected, usually right on the money. The Berlin Philharmonic, for the most part, executes the symphonies very well. However, something I really didn't expect was the under-par performance of the chorus - notably the sopranos. On many occassions, they seem shrill and flat (I am tempted to get out my ear plugs for portions of the 9th symphony.) The quartet, on the other hand, performs well. The analog recording is good, considering its age, but definately falls short of a modern-day DDD recording. All in all, I feel this recording is essential to any Beethoven collector, because Karajan's interpretation is wonderful. However, the execution of that interpretation has a few flaws, and should be considered before making this the only Beethoven you listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morphine, anyone?","review":"The symphonies are capable of compelling one's emotions from the depth of tragic despair to the pinnacle of majestic triumph. Karajan's interpretation leaves one with the overall sense of being drowned in a bowl of oatmeal. The size of the Philharmoniker doesn't make up for their lack of enthusiasm or of clean articulation. Instead of reaching out and grabbing ones attention and enthralling them with its sheer genius, this interpretation is more a sedative, dulling the senses with its insipid blurriness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good!","review":"Strange, but I like this recording better, than the last recording Karajan made of Beethoven. It is very alive, very beautiful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Five With A Caveat!","review":"This set is good value for money. What you here is Karajan before he became the jet-setting, multi-zillionaire God of classical music that some think he was. This is not the glossed over Karajan of digital stereo.

If you really want high energy exciting Beehoven, I suggest you purchase Music And Arts excellent set Furtwangler Conducts Beethoven!

The Seventh symphony is especially pleasing. Compared to many other recordings of this symphony, it is the most exciting. In the fourth movement, the intensity is incredible. Other performances lack compared to this one. The playing of the Berlin Philharmonic is superb. The Eroica symphony is great as well. Then there is the 9th Symphony. This has to be the very best recording of the Ninth Symphony ever recorded and it's my guess that it won't be passed. This set may not have the best recordings of every symphony, but it is the best cycle available of the symphonies, and it does come with at the very least two of the greatest recordings of Beethoven's symphonies.

THe friend had been dead for so short of a time, neither of them should have even THOUGHT of getting together.THere are too many characters, that you just don't care about. I had a hard time keeping them straight. My favorite character in the book is the cat. The rest just aren't very interesting. I had a hard time finishing the book at all.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"LARGE TARGET is a Winner!","review":"Lynne Murray's LARGE TARGET is a delight.

I spotted it in the children's section in our bookstore and decided that it is somethign worth getting for my son (a couple of years will pass before he is old enough for ths, but as an ambitious mother I have already started building a library--I kow it is silly, but it is amazing how many really good children's books are rarely reprinted)I read it and was laughing out loud. It is a simple story--Rudolph goes on strike and Santa needs to use Rover, the dog. The short chapters are hilarious, and the illustrations are beautiful. Some situations are absurd, and this absurdity is reinforced by the way the novel is structured (with recurring chapters and ads).Doyle has a great, multi-layered sense of humor, that borh children and adults will enjoy. He reminded me a lot of Terry Pratchett."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over Grinch..here comes Rover","review":"Roddy Doyle has indeed done it again. This book ( a sequel to The Giggler Treatment) has all of the traits that made the original a must read book, wit, intelligence and a great sense of fun.Rover is not your basic 'dog next door' and neither is the book. As you might expect, Rudolph has decided not to guide Santa's sleigh on Xmas Eve and it is up to Rover to make sure that all the good kids in the world get their toys.If anyone has read \\"The Giggler Treatment\\" to know what to expect. A fun romp where the reader (from 8 to 80) never knows quite what is going to happen next, but that the gifts will arrive on time.Unlike some authors Roddy Doyle does not insult his reader, while giving them an exciting and playful story.Read the Giggler Treatment to your class first if you are a teacher like I am , and then expect your class to want this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"let down--read the Giggler Treatment instead","review":"When my children and I found out that the Giggler Treatment had a sequel we ordered it immediately only to be very disappointed.

However, I was so completely taken aback by the live performance of the 7th, that as soon as I could, I purchased the CD set. The 7th is a seemingly overgrown work, too overt and cumbersome, (think of Bartok making fun of it in his Concerto for Orchestra) yet it delivers an emotional jolt that makes one want to stand up and cheer. This Berstein recording got me back onto his side in 1989. It is sad that he had so little time left, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my...","review":"After listening to this recording, I was almost in shock. Both symphonies are interpreted and played to the extreme, but the kicker is the ending of the 7th, which is practically terrifying in its sheer volume. Bernstein unleashed the CSO brass, and amazingly, the full intensity seems to be captured on this CD. With playing like this, it's no surprise that Lenny and the orchestra won the Grammy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immense Power and Tension!!!!","review":"This is by far the best recording of the Leningrad Symphony by Shostakovich. The Bass Trombone at the conclusion of the finale is incredable! I do take exception to some of Bernstein's tempo selections, such as the first half of the last movement. It should be faster. However, the brass of the Chicago Symphony cannot be outplayed, and the Horns are magnificent. This is the best of the best! All other recordings pale in comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I love this cd. It is very relaxing.

Imagine my shock when a couple of weeks later when I visited caphalon's web site and I see the same knife with a retail price of....$39.95!! Instead of a deal I paid retail! 40% off would have been $26. I emailed amazon about this and all I got back was a canned email about how they try to get the best deals.

It's a good thing that Jon and Ken decided to perform as the Posies again and that we have the Not Lame box set to look forward to, 'cause this here live album really wasn't much of a going-away present.Maybe it's the fact that it's taken straight from one show instead of compliled from a bunch of performances. Whatever it is, this album does not do justice to the Posies as a live band. The mix sounds sloppy, the harmonies are off more than they're on, and the song selection leaves a lot to be desired. It seems as if most of the effort was spent on Ken's incredibly detailed (and interesting) liner notes. Even the Cheap Trick cover is uninspiring.As a Posies live album, this was better than nothing, I suppose, but not much.Check out the far superior acoustic live album, \\"In Case You Didn't Feel Like Plugging In\\". It's a *much* better release than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read for the writing, not the recipes","review":"Unfortunately, the recipes in this book haven't aged well.

For example, the authors repeatedly inform us of what an overpowering presence Stephen Hawking has but they never provide any evidence of this. Good writers show you what they mean - they don't just repeatedly tell you.This book seems to based on no actual contact with Stephen or Jane Hawking or any of his colleagues.

I was wrong. It had readouts of feet, a running inches readout (for example, 30\\", 31\\" etc.), but no readout that will tell you 5 feet 6 inches, for example. You can use it to find that your measurement is 66 inches & do the arithmetic in your head, but no convenient way to know that the readout is equivalent to 5 feet 6 inches. Because it's so common to find feet + inch readouts, I think the description of the item should mention that it had readouts in 1/8\\" ONLY, & no one inch readouts.

Kathleen, however is torn between following the Patriot cause and doing what is right, such as helping a wounded British soldier.

When the President is assasinated, the agent in charge of his safety (Gooding) and a maverick reporter (Angie Harmon) go on the trail of the conspiracy behind the crime. The dull investigation requires all the deductive expertise of a child's connect-the-dots puzzle, existing merely as a skeleton upon which to hang the various action scenes, some of which are quite good.

I prefer a good book or BBC series for intellectual stimulation.I also get bored of \\"rock\\" without lyrics. My reaction was the same when 10 or 15 years ago I purchased Stewart Copeland's solo/instrumental album. It was a yawner.

My mom bought it for the song itself.At home, we listened to it, and weren't sure if we liked it or not. It sounded almost to mysterious and weird. But then, it began to grow on us.

For those of us who are sick of Enya, DON'T BUY THIS CD! I'm always disappointed in any artist who falls into the trap of creating formulaic music. Almost every song on this CD consists of virtually identical sounds that have been rearranged into a different song. Basically, every song is comprised of a whimsical piano melody overlaid with a violin. BORING! Yes, the music is relaxing, but so unimaginative as to render this CD to the realms of mediocrity. Stick with Loreena McKennitt for relaxing music, or I highly recommend Chris Spheeris' newest CD \\"Dancing with the Muse.\\" Now some irony. I bought \\"Songs From A Secret Garden\\" because of a review I read on this Web site, so take everything I (or anybody else) writes with a healthy dose of skepticism.

This cd is arguably on of the best (semi) instrumentals I have ever heard, each track is wonderfully arranged; harmonising the piano and violin flawlessly.

I'll soon be returning to Peru and have read both the Lonely Planet and Insight Guides. Lonely Planet has the most interesting and useful travel information, and a generous helping of history as well. The guide is compact, and if I have any complaints at all, it's that the small print is a bit hard to read by the end of the day; however, it is easier to pack. There are a lot of great city maps, and they ARE big enough to read. Lonely Planet gives you information you won't find in other guides. They have a personal touch only possible when you've been to the place you're writing about. They helped me travel solo in India in 1988 and 1990 and they are as good as ever in 2001. Thanks Lonely Planet! Keep those great guides coming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good content terrible on the iPad/Kindle","review":"The content is not bad--places to go, things to do, cost of alternative options, etc. But this book is terrible to read on the iPad.

Stick with the paper copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lonely Planet Peru fails to deliver","review":"A lot of the information about Peru was wrong! Tickets for Machu Picchu can be reserved from the USA, and should be reserved at least a week in advance in the OFF-season. I'm not sure how far in advance they should be reserved during the high season, but we could only get tickets for 3 days later (at earliest) when we got to Peru. Also, train tickets absolutely need to be purchased in advance, contrary to the book's recommendation of one day. In addition, many of the maps were entirely incorrect, at least in Cusco. I normally like Lonely Planet (I've used them for various places in Europe and Asia), but this one was way off base."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book gives a misguided impression","review":"I am extremely disapointed with the tone Lonely Plane has decided to take with this book. Instead of highlighting the beautiful spots, the wonderful people and overall magnificent country that Peru is - the author has decided to take a negative tone throughout the book. No side trips off the beaten track, it goes into detail describing typical tourist traps (certainly not why what one goes to LonelyPlanet looking for). Not enough recommendations for day itineraries, an overall boring read with no insightful advice on what to do. And a flat negative tone for everything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"great country, good book, watch the altitude","review":"Peru is a remarkably interesting country. This is a pretty good guidebook. One area where the guide could be improved is advising tourists on itineraries that work up to high altitude gradually. The easiest trips to arrange go straight from Lima at sea level to sleeping in a hotel in Cusco at 11,000' above sea level. At best you won't feel good and at worst you could get acute altitude sickness. A bit of planning, however, and you can either zip straight from the airport at Cusco to Aguas Calientes below Macchu Pichu (about 8000') or work your way up to Cusco from some towns that are at 7000'. Simply by reshuffling your itinerary you can have a trip where you are feeling good and strong all the time rather than a trip where you stagger around breathlessly and suck down aspirin for the pounding headache."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic guide book","review":"Its not up to date (2010), but gives you an idea of what you're getting yourself into.

This was evident in the Peru guide, the first of these new Lonely Planets I have used. The voice has really changed, and many of the suggested sites and so forth no longer speak to travellers on a small budget or travellers wanting to get off the beaten path. The clarity of the guide remained intact. The maps were great, and many of the essential details I found deficient in the Rough Guide were included in the Lonely Planet. But without the Rough Guide, I would have missed many of the great experiences I had in Peru."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful - of course","review":"What else could you expect of Lonely Planet than a very useful guide with nearly all the information you could wish for. It's a miracle they succeed in keeping these books as up-to-date as they do.Anyway, it helped me a lot during a one month's journey in the Cuzco area.I just wish the index would be more extensive, although, of course, it would add some extra grams to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"moving worship","review":"I am using these clips to preface watching the Alpha video course with some women, sort of in place of having live worship (it is a highly varied group, and I lack instruments).

Mr. Webb was the first author to suggest that, that I've seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, what a great book","review":"Joe Webb's guide to being a consultant in the Information Technologies field is informative and, unlike many books on the subject, gives comprehensive strategies with real world examples.I would further recommend this book for any person in the IT field not yet comfortable taking the step into consulting, but wanting to move up in IT management and / or interested in increasing his or her compensation. Joe's candid explanation and suggestions on separation of work from self, along with directed instructions on how to deal with clients would be very beneficial to the aspiring IT professional. It is far too often the case that talented and ambitious IT folks limit their own growth and potential by not mastering these two skills even though technically they improve year to year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it","review":"I will be going back to this book as I move into to the consulting phase of my career.

She is better now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, but only for some...","review":"This book contained an interesting look into our legal system, and all the wrangling that goes on between lawyers in a high-profile lawsuit. I found that the book was bogged down with details occaisionally, and thus dragged a bit. However, if you're intrigued by the legal system, you'll enjoy this book. If you're looking for closure, you won't find it here, as the book forces you to make the final decision for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating about the legal system - does not aid the reasons one gets away in a book","review":"The book gives an excellent insight into the machinations and interactions of lawyers and the legal system. But the lack of a resolution detracts from the reason one escapes into books for entertainment. After reading about the inconsistencies in other reviews and editorials about the book, since I wondered if any of it was based on some facts, (I drive an Explorer, previous year of the one in the book) that I feel my car is safe. I just felt such a let down at the end. It tends to keep you interested that something \\"juicy\\" will happen and then your back to the dry legal interactions. So I mainly found this an entertaining form of education."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the ease of paperback","review":"Purchased this as the required text for three terms of Anatomy & Physiology. This book served me well. It is a paperback version which is lighter and way easier to handle then the hardcover edition. With all the books we have to tote around as college students, the paperback feature is a huge plus! The bonus dvd is an awesome learning tool. Make sure to watch this invaluable resource and make it a consistent addition to your study ritual. Many times when taking my A&P exams, the visuals of the dvd came to life in my mind which helped me to ace the test. Although I prefer a different author's writing style for A&P (Saladin), as this was the required text for my course, I had to get it and it was overall a good informative read. Again...very happy to get it in paperback. Wish they made all textbooks that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A short review for a short opera","review":"This recording is just amazing. Domingo is incredible everytime he makes a sound, but specially in his \\"O Lola\\" and in his \\"Mamma, quel vino �� generoso\\". Every part of the chorus is just amazing, specially when they sing the brindis with Turiddu \\"Viva il vino spumeggiante\\". Baltsa is also very good and she makes a perfect alongside Domingo. Pons, althoguh Alfio doesn't have that much vocal appearance, is great(to hear Pons well listen to him in La Traviata). The orchestra and Sinopoli do a great job and they put a lot of emotion into the music. I highly recommend this Cavalleria."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely marvellous!","review":"Although the general sound of this recording is sometimes a bit 'blank', which is probably due to the recording location chosen, this is truly one of the most wonderful recordings of Cav. I have ever heard. This is such great music! Baltsa is great as Santuzza, although her live performances of this role are are 'spicier' and more passionate than she is letting us hear on this CD.

It's great for my 10 year old for in her room because she can't turn it up too loud or it starts to sound bad.So, for the price, it's good for a young kid who might not notice sound quality, but that's about it.They need to update the description for this item so everyone is aware it doesn't work with the ipod touch or iphone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work with my Ipod","review":"I sent this product back because it doesn't work with my Ipod 8GB.

When I ordered this I did not realize my MP3 would not fit it. I don't think it was very clear that this was for an iPod. But with the Aux cable it works nicely. It is very easy to install and use. The sound is very good for the size. My only issue with this was the black feet on each speaker. They leave small black circles on whatever surface they sit on. It has damaged my furniture and I am not able to get the black marks off.

I felt like the cords were all over the place. One to go to each speaker and one for the plug. No battery option either. When stacked the unit was pretty unstable. It fell over and apart (and my ipod feel off the dock) when I barely touched it. Though the sound quality was pretty good it lacks an AM/FM tuner which come on most other dock/speaker combos for around this price.

I plugged my nano into it and an error message came on the screen: charging on this device is not supported.In addition, no sound came out of the speakers. It's as if the thing wasn't plugged into anything, it refused to recognize my ipod - no charge, no sound.I'm returning this product after owning it for only 2 hours.EDIT: After speaking with the returns department for Tiger Direct, on behalf of Comp USA, I found out that this is ONLY compatible with the first generation iPod Nano and NOT ALL IPODS like it is stated on the Amazon page. They said that this is clear on their OWN page at Comp USA, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad sound, occasionally destroys iPods by overcharging","review":"The sound quality is rather mediocre, tinny and without definition. That's ok, though; it's still more than good enough for kids or background music. What isn't ok, is the fact that these destroy iPods by overcharging them. Ours killed two iPods before we figured out what is happening.If you buy one of these DO NOT leave the iPod in it for too long. There seems to be a problem with the charging circuit on these, and it may overcharge your iPod. The resulting overheating may destroy the screen, if not more, and will definitely damage the battery. As I said, we've had two screens damaged by leaving an iPod charging in one of these, so I'm fairly confident this device is to blame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tech Details Incorrect - NOT COMPATIBLE w/ IPOD TOUCH","review":"I purchased this based off of it's Technical Details stating \\"Compatible with all versions of the iPod, including the iPod mini\\".In our family we have one Ipod Shuffle and two Ipod touches.

At first I was very confused and yes a bit irritated, but then I started to listening intently and found that it was quite intriguing. Salvatore Accardo is a very accomplished violinist and I am sure that Paganini himself would have been satisfied with this fine recording. The book-let is a mixed bag. The cover is atrocious and looks like , well I have no idea what it is supposed to look like and that is just plain irritating. This is not modern art (which I do not like anyway). The book-let contains a very well-written essay by Edward Neil. All in all I give this recording 4 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alli Artisti","review":"Paganini's masterwork is dedicated 'Alli Artisti', meaning the listeners, not the players. Paganini himself never gave public performance of his work. And rightly so. Frequently, their performance is mistakenly judged on brilliance of sound, speed, 'eclat', or artifact: public effect. It should not be so. Accardo' s performance is among the very few making justice to this masterwork. Technically it is perfect,clean,sober. Mastery of the instrument allows his intimate understanding of the music to emerge, and reach the listener. The hidden, 24-faceted gem is discreetly uncovered."},{"rating":"2","title":"good interpretation","review":"My favorite 24 caprices performer is Frank Peter Zimmermann.Accardo's recording is near. Nice intonation, good quality sound and not crazy tempo.But i still recommend Zimmermann or Midori.

When it comes of Le Mer though, I recommend you to buy elsewhere. Lenny with Santa Cecilia Orchestra is played rather slowly and gently. The first movement, compared to the one with the New York Phil, is more calming, but a bit lacking on the climax part. The final movement too, he and Santa Cecilia Orchestra is less thrilling. I don't really think it's a really bad idea to buy this CD, because overall it's beautiful. But I recommend you to buy the one when Lenny was with the New York Phil, when he was younger, or Karajan with the Berlin Phil, or Boulez with the Cleveland Orchestra. Lenny with New York Phil, and Charlie the Tuna (that's Boulez), I believe, especially plays with enthusiasm. The Prelude with Santa Cecilia is very smoothly played, and Images are played just fine too. This CD is not at all bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't that thrilled","review":"Listened to this as audiobook as I do most books.

Ready to move on to the next read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious!","review":"I started reading the book full of expectation. After the first hundred pages or so, I could not take the slow pace and multiple digressions with the occasional sexual references (probably to keep readers going) any longer.The plot is simple: make everybody a suspect; include the basic sleaze, power and money ingredients; and end up with the least suspect of all characters as the guilty one.To make the whole thing more palatable, a couple of hundred pages would have been more decent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than your average beach/airport novel","review":"This is a strong, compelling story with a page-turner drive. Though longer than average, it's easy to read and took only a couple of days of concentrated effort to finish, and it was a pleasure to do so. My impression is that the most powerful element of this book is the characters - they are well drawn, with good voices, and consistent through the arc of the story. My only criticism is that some of the strong voices are stereotypical - but, of course, stereotypes come from somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best legal thriller","review":"Legal thrillers don't get any better than this, but it goesbeyond its genre by showing the corruptions of the political/legalsystem and because it is a great study of the consequences of sexual obssession.

Nevertheless, I was driven on by the plot: I absolutely wanted to know what happened to the main character. Approximately half way into the book, I suddenly realized: \\"Wait! If what I'm told is true, only one of two people could have committed this crime.\\" In fact, the murderer was one of these two people. I found it a bit disappointing to know at the halfway point, with certainty, that only one of two people could have committed the crime. I would have liked to have been in suspense longer than that. Still, it was a great read, a tours de force -- I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Female Characters--SPOILER ALERT!","review":"One woman in this book is portrayed as a dangerous, sexual being (who is murdered, of course). The other women is the loyal housewife who is willing to kill \\"the other woman\\" to protect her husband.

What I like about the book and I think is the authors best quality is the court room and leagal drama he can create. I love the detail and do not get bogged down by it.

In my opinion, it's clearly better than the Grisham books I've read, which makes me wonder why Turow is not as big as Grisham. Well, for whatever reason, this book is good enough to convince me to look for more Turow books and to encourage you to read this one. The story is very well constructed, the writing appealing and the characters interesting. Plenty of surprises and enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Yet","review":"In my opinion this is the best legal thriller yet written. The power and tension of this work is translated onto each page with something that I can only describe as desperate enthusiasm.The characters are real and touching, even the ones you will come to hate are human and vivid. The storyline never stops moving and never once disappoints.Turow takes us into the minds of people wo would like to know or love to hate, moves us through a dismal midwestern autumn and winter like few authors can and delivers the literary punch to keep the reader on the edge of their seat.Don't be satisfied with having seen the movie, read Presumed Innocent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and overhyped!!","review":"I've read that Scott Turow's Presumed Innocent was a classic and can't miss read. After finding it at a library sale I had a chance to see if I agreed with popular opinion and to be blunt, I do not. I struggled immensely to et into this book. The characters were bland and the writing style was off-putting. I couldn't even finish the novel. While I'm not proud of that, because that is rarely the case for me, that does illustrate how much of a let down this book was to me. Overall, definitely overhyped and not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"There are few books I never finish; this was one.

This is a book for those who are merely searching for thrills. The author fails to make you think about the nature of the system or of human nature. The novel is full of common places and sentences that pretend to be poetic and are merely corny. But I must admit that this terribly flawed novel is very readable. The plot is certainly imaginative, though not terribly credible. The actors lack any depth and are simply caricatures of human beings. But, perhaps because of curiosity about the ending, I could not put it then. I wouldn't recommend it to any serious reader. And I do not intend to keep my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Presumed BORING","review":"Funny how Hollywood can turn a seemingly DULL book into an engaging, exciting movie. Here's one example that stands out from the rest. Turow's writing is as boring and lifeless as a legal brief. Not surprising, when you consider that he's a lawyer-turned writer.Turow's characters are 2-dimensional, with very little redeeming value. I found myself sympathizing with NONE of them. My interest in the characters as a whole made this book a tedious read (not to mention all the internal dialogue that went on within certain characters).If you MUST read this book, don't spend money on it. Borrow it from your local library.Better yet...don't waste the time READING...just watch the MOVIE (starring Harrison Ford, Raul Julia, Brian Dennehy, etc. etc.).Peace Out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Explicit sex","review":"I am writing this review for those who don't care for explicit sex in novels.

When I read there was a sequel I decided to reread Presumed Innocent before I went to the sequel. I am glad I took the time. It is a powerful legal book. Rusty is a difficult character. I was never sure how to react to him. He certainly is more introspective than most mystery heros.I particularly enjoyed the court room scenes and Sandy Stern is a memorable trial lawyer. All the major characters are a mixture of good and bad.

I was unimpressed by the rather vague characterization of the differences between mainstream schools of thought (military, religious etc.) and cults as the Authors identify them - I'm left with the idea that she's particularly concerned with not attacking deeply rooted beliefs and patriotic feelings, but the analysis of the difference - if there really IS a difference - is largely unconvincing. It is important to notice that the treatment of Large Group Awareness Training (LGAT) programs is incomplete in the paperback edition, due to a pending cause with Landmark Education.

In this book Margaret Singer continues her hackneyed crusade against those who do not think like her (and thank the lucky stars they don't!). She comes from the dying CULT of psychology. The seudo-science that has been pretending to have answers. Singer has no answers. She just tries to make us fear those \\"CULTS\\". 50 years ago it would have been \\"Communists in Our Midst\\". One bio of Singer says \\"Singer stands alone in her extraordinary knowledge of the psychology of cults...\\". I agree. She stands totally alone! By reading this book I managed to glean more about Singer's bizarre psychology than about cults. Singer has made a career of witch hunts against cults. Sounds like she might be a little insecure. The end goal of course is to chain us to the \\"cult of psychology\\". If we don't think like her and the psychology party line then we're DANGEROUS.

It turns out the 9/11 attacks were all America's fault, for trying to force fed globalization into an unwanting world. The rest of the book continues in the same vein, with the author lambasting multinationals, neoliberals, the North, and above all evil Americans for all the worlds troubles. A mugshot of Bill Gates is included.Steger has no grasp of economics whatsoever, so all his economic assumptions about the effects of globalization are totally wrong. The classical example is trying to demonstrate the widening gap between rich and poor countries without taking account of countries population size or PPP. With China growing at a rate of 10% this looks specially silly.I strongly recommendWhy Globalization Works (Yale Nota Bene)instead of this drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Respect My Authority! \\"","review":"the first episode,chickenlover,was the funniest,the second episode,Ike's Bris was cool,but not that funny.im not saying that it was completely unfunny,but chickenlover was the funniest.i love this tape and i own it.so disgusting and funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THOSE KIDS","review":"AFTER HEARING ALL THE BAD THINGS MY FRIENDS HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE \\"SOUTH PARK\\" SHOW I HAD TO SEE AND HEAR FOR MYSELF.

Around one third of the way through, she talks about her faith and the rejection of Jesus by the Jews in a way that is to her honest. I am a devout Jew who had read this book thinking it would be interesting background to my upcoming trip to the Galilee. It is interesting background, but perhaps because of many initial references to her Jewish upbringing and even her attendance at Yom Kippur services, I was shocked to learn that she had embraced Jesus. I was also thinking that her name \\"Levy\\" suggested that she was Jewish. I, unlike the author, believe that being a Jew and believing in Jesus are mutually exclusive. The bottom line is, as long as you know this, the book is a fine introduction to the area. I do think, however, that believing Christians would be able to embrace it more than I did.

They do not. They have the consistency of what you would find in a peanut butter cup, but not the taste. Another reviewer said these taste just like Mexican wedding cake cookies. This is actually the review that sold me on getting these. They do not taste like that either. I think the consistency is what sold these reviewers on the response that they give. I will admit that the consistency is fun, it's crumbly, and makes it seem more appealing, the flavor is in no way appealing to me.What these do taste like is a mix between powdered sugar and the faintest hint of peanut butter. The powdered sugar overwhelms this product and is not appealing to my taste buds. If you like eating powdered sugar than you will probably enjoy these.

In comparison to most albums that came out this year and the ending of last year (including Monica's \\"After The Storm', Toni Braxton's \\"More Than A Woman\\") this album is definately worth it.

Davis takes rather common knowledge to the average mob researcher for individuals for the three main 'characters' Carlo Gambino, Paul Castellano and John Gotti. There is nothing revealing or of noteworthy in this book. Davis did very little research, splicing other book sources and the most notable was 'Boss of Bosses'.Nice try John but no cigar and when have you become a mob expert?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that impressed........","review":"I would not order it again.

I like Ham and Daisy, is one smart dog, however they could not carry this book. Too much talk and not enough action and if Harry Crisp is based on a real life FBI agent and if he is the norm, God help us all!!! I know there is inter-agency rivalry, but I would hope they get their act together for the sake of this country. Are the cameos of Stone Barrington going to lead somewhere?

The first 10 chapters were good and kept me interested, however, after that this book just dragged on and on and on. I mean I thought the novels were about Holly Barker not her father Ham. This book focused more on Ham and him investigating a group of individuals than it did on Holly and her investigative skills. I hope this book doesn't deter me from reading other Holly Barker novels. There were some pretty good points in the book though, some parts I actually really enjoyed, esepcially how Mr. Woods tied in Stone Barrington to this particular story. I loved that! Other than that I felt like this book was a really long read for me and I'd actually have to say it bored me most of the time.

What are the chances that a small town police chief would be involved in TWO world conspiracies within a year, or ever? Woods also still is bad at writing women.

But there just aren't enough of them to really make a difference.Moods tend to clash against each other preventing the album from really setting an atmosphere or developing, and the music goes from the rather beautiful \\"Healing Song\\" to the plodding. pedestrian RB of \\"Children Hold On\\".

But apart from the full orchestral force, a bit of sensibility is needed to sort out this monumental piece. In this recording, the tempo and brilliance of some parts are extraordinary (specially Mars, Jupiter(wow!) and Uranus). But in my opinion it sounds a bit sloppy sometimes, mainly in the slow movements. I rather prefer Venus, Saturn and Neptune to be played more calmly and with more delicacy. However, the quality of both the orchestra and the conductor are undeniable, and overall the CD is worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"yeah, they're awesome","review":"As they always do, Chicago displays that wonderful sound, that amazing brass section (climax of movement VI is amazing.) I must admit, having performed the work playing second trombone, that the recording left a little to be desired in spots.

I was really disappointed. \\"Come Back Alive\\" is a decent opener, but it tends to trail on like this on most of the tracks. \\"Mind War\\" was a decent track, but it never caught my attention. However, I liked the U2 cover of \\"Bullet The Blue Sky\\", even though I hate U2 with a passion. But the outcome is that it is easy to forget this CD. If you must buy it, buy it used, like bloodlust 69 recommended.

He shows his own style, and it's very good. Like Against and Nation, Roorback shows a furious hardcore mixed with metal. The truth is that Sepultura is a new band without Max, and it's a great band, for sure. The band is really connected and far more creative in this new Sepultura. Open your mind and forget Max, and you will find a great hardcore metal band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sepultura returns to form","review":"\\"Roorback\\" is a monumental album for Sepultura for more than one reason. It is the first album not to be on Roadrunner Records (Sepultura left the label soon after their previous release, 2001's \\"Nation\\"), and it is undoubtadly the best album to feature singer Derrick Green. Most of the band's tribal type sound that has been a part of Sepultura is hardly here; instead we are treated to a pounding thrash blast that is very reminiscent of the band's legendary early years. Standout tracks include the excellent opener \\"Come Back Alive\\", \\"Godless\\", \\"Apes of God\\", \\"As It Is\\", and \\"The Rift\\", all of which is the best material from Sepultura in almost a decade. It still can't compare with \\"Arise\\" or \\"Beneath the Remains\\", but \\"Roorback\\" is a welcome return to form for the Brazilian bashers."},{"rating":"1","title":"not enough information, very complicated and hard to understand...","review":"I needed help with my illness and I read this book.

Some of the tempi ARE a little slow for everyone's taste, but I don't see this as a sign of lack of musicianship. Obviously Ivo has dazzling technical ability but I would say he is thoughtful too and very musical. As for the comparison with Glenn Gould, I feel this is a red herring. I don't detect that he is imitative in the least. A lot of music is a matter of personal taste and aptitude and so in conclusion I say that I find this a high quality reading of some exceptional music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suprising but not genuine...","review":"I was very dissapointed in this CD. i am currently learning all 24 chopin preludes, and i decided this would be nice to add to my collection. But these preludes are not of the high calibur of many artists before him. His quirky \\"hiccup\\" sound and lightness on the fast peices merely brush the surface of what Chopin intended. And he draws out the long peices to a painful extent, No. 15 ecspecially..the dramatic melody is lost because he is going so slowly. His interpretations of the pieces are either to far one way or the other. for a true recording of these peices, try Martha Argerich."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying To Plug The Leak","review":"McKenzie plays the part of the little boy who puts his finger in the dam, trying to stop the leak.Christianity simply cannot honestly be reconciled with history.

Certainly a very interesting picture of the slow death of British colonialism, despite Zimbabwean independence in 1980. And the successive trips provide a living view of changing attitudes and opinions, both of European expatriates and Nationals. Her inner dialogue of changes, good and bad (both very grey categories), is very informative as well.That said, there is only a loose thread of continuing story that flows through the entire text. Granted, she's documenting her travels, but it seems a bit more perspective (or a more involved editor) could have helped give the book a bit more flow. I'd recommend it quickly to those interested in an authentic look at Africa, but probably not for those looking for a casual read during lunch breaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Photo Book","review":"This book has a nice selection of photographs that take you through Auburn's history from the early years until 1936, when Auburn ceased production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Example of Bad Design Changes","review":"Being as I was born in the fifties I still remember the tinkertoys from that era.

Today, I was disappointed to get a set of Tinkertoys with lots of end caps & elbows, & not enough spools. A few of the rods were too big, in that they could not get into the holes in the spools, and other rods were too small in that they were spinning & eventually fall out. A few of the rods' slits were so small that we bent a flag just trying to get it in. Even with the elbows, many of the rods fall out, much to the disappointment of my 4 year old. At the moment I'm helping her play with them because at times she cannot get some pieces to pull apart, and other pieces to stay together. And sad that she already admits she's afraid to break them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music to make your blood run cold","review":"Terrifying and loveless music. This album's baroque drive and brilliant use of classical forms bring a theatrical excess to its despair. All the cruelty and luxury of the eighteenth century are here. The castrato \\"Micro Cuts\\" is excoriating - one can almost see the Marquis de Sade watching from the gallery. Debates about \\"Radiohead\\" or \\"not Radiohead\\" are missing the point. This is \\"progressive rock\\" in the very best sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abolutely Amazed","review":"I've been a fan of Muse for a while but just recently bought this CD.

Absolution is my favorite Muse album so far, but this one is second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic Journey","review":"I first got into Muse when they were announced as part of the Big Day Out 2004 lineup. Origin of Symmetry was the first album of Muse that I came across and to this day remains one of my favourite albums ever. In one review, Origins is described as forgettable. This is certainly not the case! This album take you on an journey through 11 truly epic songs.Stand out songs for me are New Born, Plug In Baby, Darkshines and Feeling Good. These were hard to pick as the whole album is totally fantastic.A necessity for all great album collections, I strongly recommend going out and getting yourself a copy. I also recommend Muse's other albums Absolution and Showbiz and if you can, go and see them live. It's an amazing experience that I have had the pleasure of having 2 times already. Hullabaloo, Muse's live album, does a great job in capturing their amazing stage presence and passion.If you already love Muse, or are just getting into them, go and get this album. You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I bought this not having heard anything from the band on the strengh of the review by Q Magazine. As happens when you go in without knowing too much, you run the great risk of being dissatisfied. I don't know what I expected coming in, but the reviews were likening it to Radiohead and Queen. Maybe they just meant in their progressive and orchestral aspects, which certainly can be found here. But this certainly had nothing that those other bands posses which make them memorable, mainly hooks and panache, which are completely lacking in this effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just AMAZING!","review":"This is just one GREAT cd! Has space/hard/alternative rock and a lot more! And of course, we couldn't expect less from Muse.

These rockers are keeping the prog flame alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"i'd give this 1000000+ stars","review":"Before I begin this review, I felt it necessary to say that this here is my all time favorite band, and favorite album. I know I don't have the greatest taste in music compared to some, but if I were to reccommend ANY album to anyone, this would be my first suggestion.I retrieved this CD for Christmas from my boyfriend, who doesn't like this band too much.. but he's one of those \\"if it's not screaming, I ain't listening to it\\" hoo-has. And I will admit, it takes a while to appreciate such a talented and amazing band. Not many people have taken much interest into this band, especially kids under perhaps the age of 16. Little teens aren't too into the techno-rock sounds of this band. Take my little brother for instance, he hates this band.But if you're big into different music that will leave you wanting more, this is the band for you. Their album 'Absolution' is just as good! Two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as Good as absolution","review":"Get your hands on this album right away. the reason being, well if you've heard absolution and like it then there is no reason you should'nt own this, because it's a complete tie with how good absolution is. IF you don't own any muse or are curious about this album, it is a deffinate must have because it feels a little darker than absolution, and a little harder, yet very intellegent and classy. The lead singer ( who by the way plays both the guitar and the piano ) is such an incredible artist that even if you don't like rock than you should still hear him. Give this a try , and listen to it over and over . I don't know why you wouldn't but... yes,,,, Get it sooooon!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"muse- origin of symmetry","review":"i bought the album after i heard the blinding single newborn. the cd isn't (...) like steriophonics. it has some absoloutly brilliant tracks on there like plug in baby. its actually quite heavy sometimes but there are some good but not so heavy tracks like feeling good. i would recomend this to any alternitive person thats not into really heavy stuff like slipknot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant beginning can only partially recover","review":"With one of the most unabashedly potent 1-(especially)2-3 opening punches of alternative pop-rock in recent decades, this take-no-prisoners trio of a haunted melodic momentum is hard pressed to follow the entire album up with that kind of startling starting energy. There continues to be plenty of strong moments throughout, but the trail-off is evident and especially damaging when the band goes into their faux-RATM aggro-mode."},{"rating":"2","title":"not breakthrough, but something interesting...","review":"well, having spent the summer of this cd's release in france, i can give a first hand account of the mania that surrounded it. almost like a late 90's britney spears/n'sync sort of thing in the states, excepting only that this music is extremely good! i hate to list influences, or similar sounding bands, so read the list provided..., it's pretty accurate. the best way i would describe this sound is along the lines of classical music on mind-altering drugs. it's certainly not poppy at all, with no chance whatsoever of radio play, but the music is synthesized so craftily that it will take a mere track or two to forget that it's synthesized at all. creative, dreamy lyrics layer the album and give the ambient melodies texture. try it out if you're interested in european electronic pop, but don't expect this genre to define it exactly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"My cd came quick and it was in great condition! The cd (as well as the case) was in excellent condition and it was as if I had bought it brand new. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OOS","review":"OOS is the best of alternative rockers Muse.Much compared to Radiohead, this record delivers more rock and explores more sinister sides of life.Packed with distorted guitar, excellent piano (believe me, those parts are hard to play-as I found out when I tried to cover Nwborn) and Matt's amazing array of vocalic armament.The highlights of the album are NEWBORn and BLISS which are real hard rocking, alternative music of class.If you want a song which is loud, but doesn't feature the heavy, philosophical lyrics of Muse, try for PLUG-IN BABY. Or if you want a Queen-like song go for SPACE DEMENTIA-a strange venture into spacey, bizarre terittory which surprises with its originality.Listening to this album reminded me of Pink Floyd's best moments-mainly because of the mysterious, Niestche lyrics and the pounding bass. Of course comparing Muse to the legendary band might sound like an overstatement but buy the CD and you should see (read-hear) for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the albums of 2001.","review":"This CD is completely over the top. As a matter of fact it is so far past it, the top is only a dot to Muse. They don't care about expectations, songwriting rules or the current taste in the music market. Every song is a winner and the lyrics are brilliant. You have to check these ones out: the 3 singles 'Plug In Baby', 'New Born' and 'Bliss', the rock opera 'Micro Cuts' and the cover 'Feeling Good'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic cd, cracked case.","review":"I absolutely love Muse. This is probably my second favorite album besides The 2nd Law. The delivery was speedy, but was handled poorly (cracked case). No big tho, I didn't buy it for the case!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good music","review":"I really like the cd, although it's not as deep as 'the resistance'. The song 'Feeling good' is the initial reason I bought it because I heard it on youtube and loved it. The rest of the cd is also really good. I can always count of Muse to give me good music without a lot of unnecessary cursing. They've a very talented band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive followup on Showbiz","review":"Muse's first album, Showbiz, was a tantalizing but uneven effort. This album is a succesful followup. The formula is the same -- driving technified guitar backed by synthesizers, overload melodies, Thome-Yorke-esque vocals -- but is better executed here. Muse have progressed as songwriters, and Symmetry is full of powerful pieces -- especially Bliss and Plug In Baby, each of which are worth the price of the album by themselves. Symmetry can get a bit repetitive at times, but is overall a worthwhile buy, and shows potential for further progress in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A joy to listen to...","review":"Listening to this CD is like witnessing something ground-breaking, earth-shaking happening. The individual songs seem almost alive, eager to be played out and listened to. They bristle with energy. The different instruments and synths weave themselves among each other and create an intricate mesh that is a beauty to behold and listen to. It is hard to believe that someone could add to this atmosphere with their vocals without distracting, but Bellamy has done it. He has an incredible range and manages to strengthen the structure of each song. If I had one word to describe this CD, it would be epic, and even that does not do enough justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything About You Is so Easy To Love...","review":"This is the best album I've heard all year. Elements of Radiohead, pre-KID A. I'd have to say every song on \\"Origin of Symmetry\\" blows me away. Hyper Music, New Born, Space Dementia, faves. I can't believe I had the opportunity to see Muse live while in the UK last summer but declined as I hadn't heard of them yet at that point and didn't feel up to slending money on a ticket to see a band I wasn't sure whether I'd enjoy or not. I should have taken the chance!! Muse rock. Buy this record. 'Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Muse album","review":"A very excellent album. This Muse cd is probably my second favorite Muse album behind Absolution, although in my opinion, you really can't go wrong in buying any of their cds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"First off, I am a thirteen year old American kid. I am the only person in my school who has even heard of Muse. And let me tell you, Origin of Symmetry is absolutely incredible. It contains some of Muse's best stuff, like Plug in Baby and Citizen Erased. If you are used to the Resistance, you may not like this album. But I guarentee if you give it enough time you will certainly warm up to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative, original, technical, aggressive","review":"Excellent CD! Easily in top 5-10 favotrite CD's ever made.What makes this so unique is the technical ability of three musicians and the level of mastery they all possess. This is a CD that hits on all cylinders from the first song, New Born, up until the end, with Megalomania. What amazes me the most is just how effective Muse were in fuzing aggressive songwriting with the more laid-back style that most Muse fans know. In my opinion, this is Muse's best work as there are so many jaw-dropping moments; the chorus of Citizen Erased, the opening piano lines of Space Dementia, the haunting space-opera of Micro Cuts, the manic pace of New Born...I could go on and on.If you are a music lover, you need this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"What RUBBISH!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!","review":"Muse have never been ''on the scene''. And in my opinion they never will be. This album it's not a hit,it's a disgrace. Even the title Origin of Symetry, it sounds like an Italian opera not an album (if you even class it as a piece of music). I can't stand the voice of Mr.Belamey. The high pitched cry. If you can spend 12.99 on this, you might as well buy P.Daddy's rubbish too.One star for the cover, that's it.Oh! and answer me two things 1. Why does Matt Belamey try to immitate Thom Yorke and fail miserably 2. Can you without looking at the lyrics understand anything he says. Didn't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not original","review":"Hmmmmmmm....sounds awfully familiar. Sounds like Radiohead. If you own a Radiohead CD don't buy this album. Your not hearing this from some pretensious wannabe musician that claims they have a seasoned ear for this kind of stuff because they play the piano, your hearing this from someone who has an unbiased ear and is calling a spade a spade. Muse might be a great band, but this album carries a sound that has already been played."},{"rating":"2","title":"all the way to the stars","review":"You may or you may not like the music Muse make, but you can't simply ignore it. At least not now. Although 'Showbiz', their debut, had an astonishingly good music coming from so young musicians, it didn't get the thumbs up you'd expect. The only reason mentioned: they're copycats. Well, it can't be denied that at times they really sounded a lot like Radiohead, but even it is so, is it a good enough reason to disregard music with that quality? The winds have changed. Radiohead have gone their way and Muse evolved into something you may even fear of. Introduced by the rather one-faced but tricky single 'Plug-In Baby', this album is really something close to a space opera. It is loud and atmospheric and it constantly morphes into something you didn't expect, led by one of the most original frontmen in the moment, Bellamy. That's about it. Don't want to be fun-spoiler. Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiohead who?? MUSE is what rock needs","review":"The first song i ever heard from Muse was off of a live video clip from their Hullabaloo DVD called \\"Microcuts\\". It sounded like an opera gone awry filled in with some of the coolest guitar I've ever heard. I decided to look into them more and I am now obsessed. If you're looking for good new rock, MUSE IS THE ANSWER!!I've never listened to Radiohead before (and I don't really care to), I didn't listen to Coldplay or any of those other British rock bands so trust me, you don't have to be into other British alt-rock bands to enjoy Muse.I urge you to look past vocals for this album as well. Mathew Belamy's expert guitar and piano playing bring out the best of this album alongside Chris Wolstenhome's intricate and creative basslines. This is by far one of the greatest bands I've ever heard and I can't wait for their American splashdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Muse make Radiohead's bombast seem demure and subtle. This is just plain kitsch. The music is really derivative and cheesey. The vocals are painfully awful. Some fool had the audacity to say Muse's singer is better than Jeff Buckley in thier review of Grace...i laughed hard. Muse are not pretty nor do they rock, they are just annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty lame","review":"I bought this cd based on a review in a guitar magazine that raved about this singer/guitar player like he was the next guitar god. It turns out he's not even that knowledgable of the instrument and very amature in his playing and song writing. Nothing interesting going on at all. It sounds too much like Radiohead but not as good with some Tom Murello guitar licks thrown in. I see why they have'nt released this in America yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album but.......","review":"Muse are not the best band ever, neither are they all that original, they sound a lot like bands who were around in the early 90s and late 80s, but saying that, they do have a little spark of originality to them.Also, why the hell are people comparing them to radiohead, apart from the fact that radiohead suck and muse dont, they both sound completely different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much noise.","review":"I listened to a couple of sample songs from Muse's \\"Absolution\\" in the store and absolutely like them and since \\"Symmetry\\" was on sale I decided to buy that one. Wasn't a good idea. I had a completely different impression. Generally too much noise and screaming. At times it seems the singer has some kind of a breathing problem. Or at least he occasionally does sound he is choking or something. Musically rather bland, not too many good ideas and not too melodic either. And I do not think his voice is in any way similar to that of Thom Yorke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"If you like over done, contrived music, then you'll like this. The singer is annoying constantly singing way above his range with way too much vibrato. Sounds like he's being killed.It's like Radiohead combined with ranchero music."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous","review":"I was first told about Muse from a british girl I was talking with about music, Radiohead namely. She said if I loved Radiohead, I would love Muse, and she was right. I downloaded New Born, Muscle Museum, and Plug In Baby, and loved them. I bought this album for my love with New Born and Plug In Baby, and the rest of the album didn't dissapoint at all.Muse sounds a lot like Radiohead at first, In an era that I think would fit between OK Computer and Kid A, but the more you listen, the more distinct they become. If you like Radiohead, this is a sure shot, no dissapointment purchase for sure, but Muse isnt just walking in Radiohead's footsteps.They have a combination of sounds, from almost Rage Against the Machine-like in Hyper Music to almost Air-like in Plug in Baby (listen to this and then Air's \\"Sexy Boy\\") and of course, to Radiohead.If you took the interest to look at this album, I would say buy it, you won't see it out of your player anytime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I bought this album while in the UK on holiday after hearing so much about from friends and I have to say that Muse are another great rock band. Although often compared to Radiohead I think they are a lot better, all of the songs on this album are amazing. With bands like this coming from the UK it shows us why the US isn't the home of Rock but of no name carbon copy pop bands and solo 'artists'. Put it this way the best we can come up with is ahem Nickleback and it's why the Foo Fighters are always in England and the Red Hot Chili Peppers sing songs about London.Come on we cant let them steal the limelight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Late model weak","review":"Weak coverage on the later model front wheel drive Mopars.

It is widely considered to be one of his best recordings of this period.The whole recording sounds surprisingly fresh. The Hymn of Praise brings a captivating, completely full sound... The choral singing is remarkable in its vividness. Both the Scottish Symphony and the Italian one demonstrates why the Berliner Philarmoniker was king of the hill at that point in time: superb playing with displays of geniality that would put a smile on Mendelssohn's face. A must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK if you like beethovenish interpretations.","review":"Overall, it is all right, except the tempo lags here and there (notably the Sym. 5). Personally, my favorite one here is the Sym. 3, especially the 3rd mvt. The choice of chorus in the Sym. 2 is indeed a poor one. Particularly, the sopranos pretty much screamed themselves out, one of the worst performances I've ever heard.

The outdoor pictures were great! But once you take that camera inside and the light is low forget about image quality. I tried all the scene modes, this camera just can't compare to other compact cams on the market. The pictures come out blurry, colors blend into each other. Interior lighting causes all kinds of interior blur streaks to appear in the images.I get rave reviews on the looks, but I just can't stand having to tinker endlessly to get a nonblurry inside picture.

You can still view old pictures, but all new pictures come out completely black. This is apparently a VERY common problem with Nikons, particularly this model. They have a service advisory for several other Coolpix models to fix this same problem, but not for the S3-S6 models - and Nikon will charge you a significant amount of money to fix it. DO NOT get suckered into buying this camera, or any Nikon for that matter - I was extrememly disappointed with the camera, but especially with their service."},{"rating":"1","title":"it can happen to you","review":"Before buying this camera I read all the reviews posted. Most people were satisfied with this product, but a few complained that after a period of time the screen went black and the camera was unable to take photos. I thought that this would never happen to me and bought it anyway. Sure enough durring a fishing trip when I wanted to take photos of the lunkers I was catching the screen went black. I almost threw it in the river. Now I'm careful with my things, especialy sesitive camera equipment, so this was of no fault of my own. Spare yourself the frustration and buy a different camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aggravating!","review":"I initially loved this camera. I don't use my camera that much, but when I do, I expect it to work. I charged the battery the night before I left for a vacation. The next day I took a few pictures and then realized that the battery was almost dead. I hadn't even used the camera but for a total of about five minutes since I last charged it! It was not exposed to any extreme temperatures that would mess up the battery, either. Also, when I try to review my pictures, about 80% of the time, the camera says that it cannot read the card. I have to take out the memory card and put it back in. (even then it doesn't read it sometimes.) If this camera won't even work half of the time, what's the point in bothering to carry it with me?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Small","review":"Quality and features are fine, but camera is probably too small for you if you have large hands. If I use two hands I am fighting to keep my fingers out of my shots. Because of the shape and weight distrubution I find it difficult to shoot with one hand. I have a much larger camera (Canon S1 IS) that I often use one-handed with no issues.To be fair, this criticism certainly applies to lots of super small digital cams. The S3 seems even worse than many others to me though. Be sure to at least handle one before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"It looks cool and it's easy to carry, but that is about it. Camera is slow and pictures are often blurry.

I admire her artistry and that beautiful, honey-toned voice that envelops you in the drama of Brahms' exquisitely crafted, haunting music. It has been awhile since I listened to this CD but I am overdue. She is an intelligent and very emotionally/mentally aware singer, and it is hard to find any vocal or dramatic limitations on this CD. I am waiting for the day when I can see her live (and maybe sing on the same stage next to her!) This album is very worth its price, but prepare for a very dramatic journey--this is not easy, light, or background music--this music will make you feel intensely if you let it. (Also, for a very different interpretation and equally valid, in my opinion, check out the darker and thicker contralto voice of Mitsuko Shirai/Hartmut H?ll in Brahms: 21 Lieder.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous interpreter of Brahmsian Lieder","review":"She is electrifying in this recording.

The plot is rather weak and the acting was flat. There were attempts at comedy but they were not well executed so the humour was lost. Also, I think the lesson that it's not right for a guy to date two girls at the same time didn't come through - the criticism was more on the girls for wanting the same man. At the end, the message about acts of righteousness needing to be done selflessly was good but came too late - I had already mentally switched off and was just waiting for the movie to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it is supposed to.","review":"The enclosure keeps your drive cool which is what really matters.However, it is loud...

Despite it's mini-series length, the film commands your attention. Premeiring at a time when there was much labor strife, Stallone shows his range as an actor. And it is a range nobody imagined. More than the GREAT film ROCKY, F.I.S.T shows the development of a disgruntled poorly educated man who defies the odds, and rises to the top. In the process, he compromises himself and becomes the very person he so dearly hated. There is a high body count. The ending is worth a fortune. The first half of the film is loosely based on the early life of Governor (then Senator) Harold Hughes of Iowa, the only multiply convicted felon (he did 11 years), to occupy such offices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stallone is top notch","review":"Stallone is and has always been a fine actor.I agree when some say he strayed away from it over the years,but to say he is bad and be surprised that he can do good work is an insult.His performance in this very entertaining and epic drama is perfect example(while films like Tango & Cash are examples of \\"just pay me\\"Stallone).I'm never surprised when he is great in a film,I'm more surprised when he coasts through.Check this film out if you want to be entertained,and watch an underated thespian at his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"F.I.S.T.","review":"Stallone at his very worst.

It was hard to tell, because the VCR wasn't used as much. Right now, it makes for a nice big paper weight. What a piece of junk. My final comment: Hey Sony, if you want to get into the low end market and sell your products cheap, make sure they perform up to your reputation and customer's expectations of your quality.

And after 2 weeks of use I'm back to my old setup.The DVD next chapter function pauses for a second before going to the next chapter. The VCR commercial skip skips to the middle of the next commercial rather than the beginning; so, when you get back to the show you had taped, you have to rewind for serveral seconds. And, if you fast forward manually, there is a pause before the fast forward stops after letting up on the button. Causing you to rewind to get back to where you want to go.Also, unlike my older (1-year) Sony DVD player, every time you put in a DVD, even one that had been in the player before, the unit will play the unable-to-be-skipped title graphics and FBI warning.I would recommend passing on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of trash","review":"Well, bought Sony because of its reputation in the electronics industry.

So, I continued to use this piece of junk until it started to eat my tapes. Called again and then the solution was for me to ship the defective one to Sony and then pay for another plus shipping.

Putting, OMG, and hitting a half-swing shot is impossible with the wiimote. I'll give it a two because it's there first offering with the wii and honestly I'm glad that they released this game for the wii but I can't deny that I was dissappointed. Like and earlier post, I was worried that I'd mess up my real golf swing trying to adapt to this game and it's inaccurate controls.

Also, the included golfers are great, but if you want to start your own, you'll be lucky to get enough power on your drive to make it to the fairway on the included courses.I assume my swing is wrong since I suck at real golf, but the game will decide my swing is over before I finish my backswing quite often and hit at about 50%, which usually screws me pretty bad. Also, the announcers are beyond annoying, even to the point of being jerks.

If you want to play the game where you actually use the controller as a golf club, you \\"lose\\" swings. Occasionally, (about 4 times in a 9 hole round for me), the game misses your swing. You take your backswing as normal, but when you bring it around for the hit, the game jumps the gun and hits it too early. This results in a weak, off target shot.I can't think of anything more frustrating than to play a good hole right up to the short shot and then have the game mess up in this way, causing you to lose the hole and possibly the match.In short, this game is bugged.

The sound of the orchestra is essentially the same as in all Karajan/Berlin recordings of German repertoire. What Karajan fails to realize is that Berlioz requires a completely different approach, not least because of his unique orchestration and its demands on orchestral color, phrasing and ensemble playing. The BPO have proven themselves more than capable of mesmerizing performances of French repertoire under other conductors. But this recording is disappointing not only because of Karajan's failure to connect with the score, but also because of an unusual (for the BPO) amount of imprecise and messy ensemble playing and bad balancing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect bells...","review":"Regardless of the very particular style of Karajan conducting the most well known works from seldom composers, in this recording he achieved the most in one of the best performances of the Berlioz's Symphony Fantastique.The reason is simple: No other conductor but him could feel the overwhelming sense of the death that an artist lives when tries to suicide, and in his trial there are bells driving himself through a gateway toward his fatal destiny.There could be thousands of bells used to perform this work, but once you \\"live\\" the sound of the ones Karajan use, all others are worthless.Maybe this is not the finest version but it really has a highly interesting improvement in the last movement.

In the final analysis, the author encourages us to trust the Holy Scriptures as the Word of God on these difficult questions, rather than to rely upon human reasoning and logic. I heartily agree!My only reservation is that Clotfelter was too charitable in the book to George MacDonald, a well-known and famous author of the 19th century who believed and taught universal salvation, denied eternal punishment, denied the substitutionary atonement of Christ for believers, and denied the imputed righteousness of Christ to believers.

The third one was defective so I exchanged it. The fourth one will be returned today. The technical representative with Palm said that if I purchase through them then I can get technical support. I thought that was provided even if purchased from a third party vendor. Maybe they don't give you accurate answers unless you buy directly from them.

Customer support is terrible and did nothing to rectify the problems. I even sent it to them at one point and they sent it back in exactly the same condition I sent it to them.

It sticks to the pocket lining and I was specifically avoiding the listings for the blue version. Also, the seller included the wrong stylus and it's difficult to put in and take out of the groove.

This book is a light hearted, well written, look at the plight of the Sox in the many years after Ruth was sold. Shaughnessy was kind enough to invite me into the press box in Baltimore when I approached him to autograph my copy of his book.

I take great pleasure in lining my ferrets cage with Shaughnessy's newspaper articles, where they get the treatment they deserve.

Potential buyers should beware that what is represented in this book as a factual framework has been shredded to pieces by Red Sox Century. The writing itself is a series of transparent setups for a play on words that you can always see coming a half page off.

But he uses his music to create a devilish rhythm that never stops. He uses the strings to lead the way of an everlasting hunt or chase that is so rapid and so dynamic that we are made dizzy by this infernal race. So we let ourselves go into the movement and we just enjoy the trip. We probably can say there is no inner and hidden meaning in all this running, and yet this is in perfect phase with our everspeeding world. We always go faster and run after dreams or goals that are never realized or reached. We maybe can see a slight ironical comment on our willful and powerful world that forces us into overworking, overspeeding, overliving. We kind of sigh with relief when it is all over. Could we turn off our world that takes us so fast on such accelarating and greasy rails ? A beautiful music for a trip into speedoland.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sting was the only disappointment","review":"Growing up with the 1963 DG recording of Peter and the Wolf performed by the French National Orchestra and narrated by Alec Clunes soured me on this rendition. I would say, however, that all of the performances without Sting's over-the-top narration are fabulous. The performance of the music in the story portion was on the same level as that in the older recording, but with a sound that suggested a lot of post-production level mixing (which is a bit of a turn-off in classical.) It was Sting's rewording and overacting that really killed the story portion of this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A practical, readable explanation of Bible teaching on faith","review":"A practical, readable exposition of scripture and explanation of difficult and/or often misinterpreted Bible passages relating to faith, works, salvation, and rewards.

It all seemed like a riddle to me. Parts of It still elude me but, it doesn't keep me awake at night anymore because i KNOW i have eternal life now.

It is laid out in plain english but still in depth enough to answer every question i had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exegetical Work from a FG View","review":"Dr. Wilkin has done a lot of good writing this book that engages sixteen difficult passages from the scripure in relation to salvation and an individual's assurance of it. The book is well-integrated with good analogies and examples as introductions to each chapter. Dr. Wilkin also discusses much of his own personal background within an extreme-Arminian viewpoint.I think the book is well organized, engages readers in a very practical way, and gives clarity to what the 'gospel' message and response is. This is a good work which engages the layman to be able to express clearly that salvation is by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone. A must-read for every Christian."},{"rating":"2","title":"The SACD Version of this concert is excellent","review":"Am listening to this concert in the SACD format through B and O headphones and the sound quality is excellent. Perhaps I am biased as I was at this concert right near the front and remember being enthralled. A great selection of songs from a group that puts most of today's music to shame.John Entwistle's bass solo on 515 is worth the price of the collection itself. Catch it on DVD as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardcore","review":"An intresting live performance by one of rock's greatest bands. Daltry's voice has matured which is sometimes good and sometimes bad. On \\"The Kids are Alright\\" he provides a glourious update but while on other songs like \\"I Can't Explain\\" he sounds outdated. Townshend provides his always stellar guirtar playing. Entwhistle (RIP) provides great bass lines and holds the whole band together. The drumming is resmblent of Keith Moons but doesn't quite have the catch. Also, the guest appearances are passable performances but don't really bring alot more spark to the concert (which sometimes had plenty of to begin with).Overall, this live performance is for the hardcore Who fans only.

This movie was an overfluffed self-indulgent ego trip, no one could be such a perfect child/adolescent as Cameron Crowe was supposed to be. The movie was 100% predictable and contrived. The story line was an assault on my intelligence, and the characters were totally uninspiring. Maybe this stuff seemed more interesting to everyone in 70's when they were stoned, I remember these types of people as directionless buffoons (I was ~10 at the time the movie took place). And now I am certain that with this kind of sentimental crap, the birth of Punk Rock was an inevitability. The movie did have excellent: acting, cinematography and costumes/sets, however I get really irritated when a movie is used as someones self-glorifying ego-trip.

She owes a great debt to Crowe (who is a master at creating likeable, yet shallow characters who play off all the obvious archetypes)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Classic","review":"I firmly believe that Almost Famous is a modern-day classic. It is one of my favourite movies of all time and never gets old, regardless of how many times I've seen it. The story takes place in 1973, when real music ruled the world and people turned their love for it into a lifestyle. It's a life I've often fantasized about myself, and I know I'm not alone there. Almost Famous follows 15-year old rock journalist William whose dreams come true when he is asked by Rolling Stone to go on tour with the fictional band Stillwater and write a piece about them.William, the band, and their faithful Band-Aids go through a multitude of emotions over the course of the film. The story is dynamic and offers a lot to the viewer, including a fantastic resolution at the end. The soundtrack isn't too shabby, either. This is the ultimate movie for music lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it in spades","review":"If you love this film, you'll love the unedited version...deepens the experience. The VO commentary with Crowe and his mom rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock and Roll Fantasy","review":"although a based on a true story, Almost Famous plays like every 16 year olds rock and roll fantasy. i love this movie.i cant vouch for its authenticity but you want to believe its all true...who wouldnt want to run away with a rock band..live among the stars and fall in love with Penny Lane..even for a short time..the movie shows the ups and downs of a touring band trying to make it big..in the still some-what innocent times of the 1970's. humor, tears, and hey even a happy ending..just a great movie for anyone who loves music..the dvd has great extras too the deleted scene with \\"air-drumming\\" to stairway to heaven is absolutely hysterical."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best version of my favorite film","review":"This movie is tied with Clerks as my all-time favorite film. I could go into deatil about why this movie is great, but everyone else already has. The characters are wonderfully constructed and easy to identify with, the movie is darkly hilarious, everything about it is great. But why buy the Bootleg Cut, which costs twice as much as the standard DVD? If you're just a casual moviegoer, you wouldn't care about the extra footage, but if you like this movie enough to buy it, you will love the added and expanded scenes. There's about a half hour added onto to movie and it's all worthwhile and meaningful. And in case you're watching it with people with shorter attention spans, it comes with the original version as well. I would recommend this to any Almost Famous fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I'm a Golden God\\" (It's from the movie)","review":"This is a really great movie. It's the story of William, who's a 15-year-old kid who wants to be a rock journalist. Thinking he's in his 30s, Rolling Stone Magazine sends him on a tour with the band Stillwater to do an article that could possibly make the cover. Along his trip that just keeps getting extended, William has some crazy encounters. He has to rescue a suicidal band member on Acid, he meets Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), whom he really grows to love, and almost gets killed in a plane. This movie is a great movie for all people who love rock and the 70s. It's also a good story about friendship, family, and relationships in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"DO NOT BUY!

I wanted more and I just felt with this version while very good and the actors deserving of the praise and accolades rendered I felt like there were some moments that were cut short. For example, the scene of Penny Lane dancing in the theatre actually lasts about five minutes and much of it was cut from the theatrical release. There are some other scenes as well that were cut and an additional scene from the end. This is the only reason I am giving it four stars. If you are unfamiliar with this film, watch it. It is a feel-good film no doubt, but well-written with expertly drawn characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This movie explores the life of rock stars, and gives an in depth glimpse into their minds, exposing true feelings about stardom, fans, their music, and life in general. I recommend this DVD to anyone who is searching for a break from your normal and cliched movies with the same plot, actors, and music. Kate Hudson does a wonderful job playing Penny Lane, a band aid, and convinced me thouroughly into believing her character could be real. The music in the film is also exceptional; I recommend the soundtrack to any music fan of the rock and roll era. Overall, I believe this movie to be very well made, and I hope everyone will give it a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost worth watching","review":"What an over hyped disappointment.I was really looking forward to seeing this,but is not in the same league as Crowe's other movies.Crowe normally has good actors in his films,but in this one,well,all I can say to Patrick Fugit is don't give up your day job.His was probably the worst performance by a leading man in recent memory and ultimately lets the film down,and as for the overrated Kate Hudson,an oscar nod for staring into space half the time,it seemed to me that she was just reciting lines from a script and not acting at all.Thank God for Frances McDormand for giving it a touch of class. Overall,I felt emotionally detached from this movie,which is strange for a Cameron Crowe film,but his self-indulgence here is to blame,and I also couldn't help thinking that\\"This is Spinal Tap\\" is the final word in rock movies,so do yourself a favour and watch that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Amost\\" is the best than can be said.","review":"My title says it all.

While the ex-hippies might be enjoying this boring movie if you're looking for a fun movie to watch you might try something else. What's ridiculous about this is that the critics gave the movie a good review and I watched it because of that. But the movie is a lot of feel-good nonsense in the tradition of the 70's.

Needless to say,I was quite disappointed. What's the big deal with Kate Hudson? She had a few good lines, but all she did was prance around and smile. The young man who played Crowe should've had the movie all to himself, because he did a fine job, and followed through with his dialogue, sincerity of the character, and the innocence that was showing in his face as became quickly involved in such a corrupt, whirlwind environment.

People who liked this movie have nothing better to do than watch paint dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I purchased the almost famous dvd because I am a fan of Fairuza Balk and she is listed in the cast, she is completely cut from this dvd and to me this is false advertising"},{"rating":"1","title":"almost worthless... oh, wait... I mean totally worthless","review":"The only possibly interesting relationship in this movie is the boy journalist's relationship with the editor of Creem, who acts as a mentor to him. But this gets about 30 seconds of screen time. For the rest of the time, you get to hear the protagonist getting nagged by his cliche mother who urges him at regular intervals, \\"Don't do drugs!\\" You also get to hear him getting the runaround while on tour with the Abe Smellman Group - a band with no appeal, no talent, no existence. The highlight of this band's creativity is when the lead guitarist drops acid and announces, \\"I am a golden god!\\" The movie is more or less This is Spinal Tap, with a fifteen year old journalist thrown in... oh yes, and a sixteen year old groupie who bangs all the rockers. That's wholesome, isn't it? Well, its supposed to be. You are not supposed to come walking outta the theater wondering why these guys aren't getting sent up for statutory rape."},{"rating":"1","title":"a strange movie","review":"Characters in it are delirious, at least for me (I am not addicted to the 70's); some of them even do not seem human (or humane), but I can probably understand why in the particular contxet of this movie.. You can find an excellent summary of the movie in the bonus tracks (DVD version), especially the first track which which shows the main characters all assembled to listen to Led Zeppelin's \\"Stairway to HEAVEN\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehash","review":"I was actually excited when I saw the previews for this movie. The problem with this movie isn't the story. It's the screen play (cookie cutter formula for people who didn't live through the 1970's), the script (unbelievably predictable), the acting (marginal at best, but not horrible) and the music (similar to a bad Led Zeppelin). If you end up liking this movie you might want to see \\"Detroit Rock City\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"You tell me...","review":"I just don't get it. This movie was MAYBE good. People treat Crowe like he is the Second Coming after this flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life is nice in England","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this film, it showed me the music in American cities that we only read about in Melody Maker and Rolling Stone. I was mighty impressed that Peter Frampton helped to keep the '70's music sound real and Still Water lived the dream. Kate Hudson is a babe but most of all life on the road in the States was much as I imagined. How good that some one recreated the Riot House I now think I've been there. We had our top rock venues here in Manchester(and still do) but this film captures the magic of a musical generation that no one appears to be able to compete with anymore. If you want to relive a suerb piece of magic in your life buy this I did and get a bottle of beer a neat girl by yourside and some thing that resembles a ciggerette and dream"},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW - how incredibly mediocre","review":"This movie was obviously put out in a year of some pretty weak movies. The fact that this movie was actually nominated for awards is beyond explanation. Let's talk about Kate Hudson (you know she is Goldie Hawn's daughter - make me puke). I cannot believe she was nominated for an award - for what? She is an empty suit. I've seen better acting from the Olsen twins. I guess it is good to be related to the right people. This movie has one interesting angle, the start of a journalist's career. Other than that, I think everybody should face the fact that this movie was supposed to be a view of the \\"wild and decadent 70's\\" and was nothing more than a poorly acted (Kate Hudson, Jason Lee) hollywood production - nothing decadent about it. The Soundtrack - big deal - listen to any classical rock station for more than an hour and I guarantee you will hear the entire soundtrack - nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost a total loser","review":"This was really a dull film with not much to engage the viewer. I mean, the subtext was original in a way: the pain of being ugly. And that may be why it's dull. When you see a movie you kind of want to spend a couple hours with beautiful people. Dull, dull, dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Entertaining...","review":"The biggest letdown of a movie I have seen in a while. The lead character (ie Cameron Crowe as a boy) is way to perfect to be believeable. The movie was shallow and boring. The only character remotely interesting was \\"Lester Bangs\\". Somehow, I remeber the 70's as being distinctly different."},{"rating":"1","title":"ROCK AND ROLL REVIEW","review":"This is one of those movies you've heard so much about and are thoroughly disappointed by. \\"Almost Famous\\" is almost Gidget in it's simple pansy story about Rolling Stone Magazine's cub reporter Cameron Crowe in the early '70s. The music isn't even relevant of it's day but are even older radio hits. This kid really began to ware on me.

I think a great movie could be made about the rock scene in the 60s and 70s, but this isn't it. I found the characters too stereotypical and the situations absurd. Surely, we weren't that shallow and silly at that time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Okay Film.","review":"Ok this movie didn't make any real impact at the Academy Awards accept for Best Original Screen Play. The story was supposed to be true which would make this film what it is to everyone--GREAT. Without the film being a True-based film then this movie would be nothing more that another That 70's Show episode. The movie dragged on and on but yet the critics still loved this movie. It was nominated for various awards and came up with very little which would explain the films contents.I could only guess why so many people like this movie. Perhaps so many people grew up during those years (early 70s) and are the big movie watchers and critizers of films today."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Certainly one of my all-time favorite movies...Almost Famous single-handedly got my hooked on classic rock music. Besides the great soundtrack, this movie is touching, moving, engaging and amazing in almost every way. So many themes are evident. It's a character study, a comedy, a drama. The actors are sincere. It evokes so many feelings while watching and in the end it is simply heart-warming. Near perfect film-making here."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am a Band-Aid","review":"Over the last few years I have followed a few bands around and do so for the music, and nothing else. This movies spoke to me like none other I have seen before. I have seen the band fights, the drugs, the drinking, and the heartaches. I have also felt the same heartache that Penny Lane felt when she fell for Russell. I even have a tendency to steal things like William does in the movie. Even if you don't hang with bands this movie is a lot of fun. I give this movie 6 out of 5 stars. It's a new look at bands and how they really bond and work with each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, but...","review":"Great movie, but where exactly was the \\"Director's Cut with 30 minutes of never before seen footage\\" that Amazon has been advertising? My guess is that the whore studio will release that version in a few months, the same way they did with \\"Boogie Nights\\" and a host of others.My copy of \\"Alomost Famous\\" has the same exact movie that I saw in the theater. It contains a 30 minute \\"making of\\" feature that I saw on HBO. There are no outtakes or deleted scenes and certainly no extra footage. There isn't even the standard voice-over audio track yet. The buyer needs to beware that this DVD is not coming with everything promised on this site.The movie itself is a classic and worthy of 5 stars, but the DVD is nothing special. I guarantee you the REAL DVD will be released in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going back to '73","review":"Cameron Crowe is such a meticulous director, the detail in this movie is like stepping into a time machine and going back to the year 1973! The movie has a lot of feel to it, you are on this roller-coaster ride right along with the main characters from beginning to end. Jason Lee, as the egotistical but likeable singer, Jeff Bebe, is my favorite. I'll have to search out more movies with Jason Lee. I just love that scene where he's wearing his new Jeff Bebe t-shirt (finally, a t-shirt with a big picture of himself on it!), and he's freaking out over William Miller's portrayal of them in Rolling Stone magazine. This movie goes from hilarious to sad and back again. I love that. For anyone who's curious enough, I recommend reading \\"Let It Blurt: the life of Lester Bangs, America's greatest rock critic\\" (influence and mentor to Cameron Crow), and \\"Rebel Heart\\" by Bebe Buell (one of the girls Crowe met while interviewing bands)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Indispensable","review":"I reluctantly sold my original DVD of Almost Famous and boughtthis Bootleg Cut. Great decision! Thirty of the 35 minutes of newmaterial was great stuff--not cutting room floor sweepings. Thereare lots of new music references for the classic rock fan; and somenew scenes which are terrific, e.g. \\"You've been listening to NightCircus.\\" :: The CD of Stillwater tracks is excellent, much betterthan I expected. Only quibble: the production is so modern itdoesn't really sound like a 1973 recording, but the lead guitarbased rock is in the ballpark. :: The Stairway feature is aboutthe best extra in the history of DVD. A real hoot. :: If youliked AF in the first go-round, you'll really love this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous Movie","review":"Engaging story, great music, and quality acting. Possibly my favorite movie of all time. It captures a time and culture but is made timeless by it's story of adolescence and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost 5 stars","review":"William Miller want to be a rock-and-roll journalist. His mother wants him to be a lawyer. William wins out as he is invited to go on tour with Stillwater, a ficticious R & R band. He is swept into the world of groupies, \\"band aides\\", drugs, bus rides, and all the trappings of show biz. One minute he is treated as one of the boys and the next, he is regarded as \\"the enemy\\". He falls in love with a self-professed band aide who is in pursuit of one of the band members who is already married. The music and the interaction between characters is believable and sometimes touching. Performances by Fugit, Kate Hudson, and Billy Crudup are excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Great Film","review":"The music sets the mood for the entire film, very well acted, written and directed. I don't know how someone can say they didn't add the deleted scenes when it was obvious that they did? Putting them in the movie versus leaving them out to me is better, I know I have several DVD movies that do that and I never end up watch the deleted scenes. Why when you already watched the movie? I especially like the way the played the music as if it was played on a vinyl record versus CD. This is definetly a must buy movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fantastic movie!!

Fantastic! I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! As someone who is both a music nut and a sucker for a real heart-warming story, I found myself smiling throughout the whole movie.

In a word, ABSOLUTELY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic but no available on BR in USA yet","review":"Why is crap like Mall Cop available on BluRay in the USA and classics like this timeless rock epic (based upon the lightly fictionalized escapades of director Cameron Crowe when he wrote for Rolling Stone) are only available as overpriced imports? An amazing score features classic 70's tracks by Elton John and others, with too many classic scenes to mention. If you've not seen this yet do yourself a favor..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie with an ok DVD to accompany","review":"This was easily one of the top 5 movies of the year, however the DVD is not quite what I expected it to be. To start off, the movie is just great, with stelar performances by Kate Hudson and Frances McDormand, as well as newcomer Patrick Fugit. From an audio perspective, the sound quality of the DVD is music to your ears. I personally have a Dolby Digital 5.1 setup, and it is one of the best sounding DVD's in my collection. The music of the film is also great, and very symbolistic of the early 70's rock era. The disappointing part about this DVD is the special features, which were quite (for lack of a better term) bland. **Bottom line: Great movie. O.K. DVD. Wait for the special edition or buy now if you really liked the movie.**"},{"rating":"2","title":"this movie was great.","review":"If you like movies about great 70's rock bands you'll love this. Almost famous is about a seventeen year old boy, who get's a job with rollin stone magazine. They send him to do a story on a band called \\"Still Water\\".

This is a must see if you like movies that are filled with good music and a good story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Famous? Try Almost a Cure for Rampant Insomnia!","review":"This movie was pretty boring. I thought the best scene was during the near plane crash. Jimmy Fallon did a good turn as the supporting character. I could have cared less what happened to the main character as he was way too removed and bit of a [weakling].Kate Hudson's \\"star making perfomance\\" seemed to mainly consist of traipsing around with a knowingly annoying smirk. There were some good bits but they were far and few between. Viewers would be better served by viewing any number of documentaries about the Stones or the Who."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Not All That.....","review":"I'd rather mow the lawn than watch this again!

I was very disappointed; it did not live up to the hype. It was eerily similar to \\"Rock Star\\", which in itself was very disappointing. The characters were dull and predictable; the film had zero energy and no fire. And what was with the scene where Kate Hudson danced alone on the gym(?) floor for 30 seconds? What on earth did that mean?

Don't just rent this movie, BUY IT! ALMOST FAMOUS has it all! Comdey, drama, romance. As well as GREAT MUSIC! Almost famous takes you back to the 70's, a better time if you ask me. I am not going to write about the plot of this movie, just how great it is and how it has inspired me. I have owned a guiter for a couple years now. After seeing this movie I have finally picked it up and learned (learning) how to play. What can I say about Russell Crowe?? but he is a PURE GENUS! This movie is actually about his life story! WOW! I could watch this movie everyday and NEVER get tired of it. So, if you are checking out the reviews to see if you want to watch it.. the answer is YES!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Rock & Roll really this boring?","review":"Cameron Crowe's affectionate autobiography will make anyone who grew up in the 70's feel a tug at their heartstrings as they remember their first Rock Concert. Beyond that this movie never really goes beyond its feel good veneer settling for contrived situations, cliches and familiar manufactured endings - except for its cant miss soundtrack, Cameron's good times dont quite translate to film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drag","review":"What a lousy film. I was looking forward to it. It had an unwelcome \\"the-anger-of-ugly-people\\" plot. Who cares? But the good looking people didn't even have any charisma at all. Billy Crudup is DULL. I was appalled when this script won an Oscar. I thought it was tired and boring and I was wishing the plane would crash in the plane-almost-crashing scene, because at least then the movie would have ENDED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hipper-Than-Thou!","review":"This movie gets one star from me. Heck, it earned it, didn't it? If this wasn't the number one film of the century, it was ay least the number one film of the year. Cameron Crowe's hipper-than-thou opus is one of the greatest pieces of art in the history of American cinema, and with two rising stars in Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson, this is the film that brings generations together. It is a bridge between the 70's and 90's that reminds us that above all, we are all people; living, breathing entities who NEED each other. This could be the glue of humanity, bringing down all racial, generational, and national barriers. What do I love about rock 'n roll? EVERYTHING...and more!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats all the excitement about?","review":"Almost Famous... \\"almost\\" a decent movie, too bad it was so boring and had little excitement.

I almost gave up on this one at least half a dozen times. Absolutely no character development. Kate Hudson was horrible. I laughed maybe twice.

I wish I could have gotten comfortable enough to go to sleep through this, since dreaming would have been far more entertaining....."},{"rating":"1","title":"FLUFF, FLUFF, and more FLUFF","review":"This movie makes the seventies rock scene appear cutsie and innocent. Wrong! I know people who were there, and this is not even close to reality. I thought I was watching an episode of \\"Dawson's Creek\\". If you want a real behind-the-scenes glimpse, try reading Bill Graham's autobiography \\"Bill Graham Presents: My Life Inside Rock and Out\\". Shame on you Cameron and Nancy (I guess it was to be expected from the husband of Nancy Wilson. Nancy and her sister sold out years ago)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lester Bangs was the only good thing...","review":"Judging by what makes it up classic rock radio these days, it's no wonder so many people liked this nostalgia bore fest. Just like the dinosaur music that makes up this self-indulgent Cameron Crowe flick, it's full of itself. if anything this movie explains why punk/new wave jumped up and attempted to erase this acid trip from memory. Crowe continues to push this bloated illusion of what real rock n roll is. The only thing he got right was Lester Bangs sitting around blasting Iggy Pop and the MC5. Note to Kate Hudson: Just becasue you date Chris Robinson doesn't mean you can act in a rock flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Two Stars","review":"This film is totally over rated.

When I learned several years ago that there was an extended version of the film, I could never afford it because it was in some crazy collector's edition. Now, with this version, I have the extra footage, which fits into and accents the movie better than I could have hoped, and it's in pristine 1080P resolution... At times it's like being at a concert! I'm not sure what players this was meant for, but I have a US player and it is perfect!

My review won't go into the movie as many others have already done so, but i'd like to focus on the specs of this amazing set.First off the set is called Almost Famous: Untitled Bootleg Cut theres 3 discs, 2 DVD's and 1 music CD. The CD is a compilation of Stillwater songs, including 6 never before released songs. One of the DVD's contain the original theatrical release of Almost Famous.

Although, when I viewed it, it seemed to be well made and to present an excellent treatment of the subject, I'm still wrestling with my main question/objection: how can a person who describes themselves as a devout Muslim - meaning someone who has read the Koran, understands everything it says and practices everything it teaches, which would, of course, include engaging in violent jihad, be against radical Islam and the stealth jihad in America?

Dr. Jasser should be ashamed of himself for lending his name to this piece of garbage.Note that it is important to decontextualize everything that Muslims do in the world to try and prove that if they are violent, they are following Islam and if they aren't, they aren't good Muslims.

What a letdown. I cant believe the Mountaineer Press would print this book. Being a waterfall lover, I've had Ann Marie Brown's book and Chris Shaffer's book for several years now and find them to be great tools to find waterfalls. Basically, this book is a copy cat. The authors show no sign of actually visiting many of these waterfalls. In fact, their are no directions to many, few photos and the photos that are in the book were borrowed from other hikers. It seems that the authors picked up Brown and Shaffer's guides and used them to write a book on their own. The write ups are small, info is thin, photos are horrible and pretty much every waterfall is already written about in other books. Someone dropped the ball big time letting this book get printed.

They handle the lows pretty well. Mids and highs are extremely clear. I've heard them at a friend's place paired with A PSW-10 Subwoofer from Polk and that combination is pretty good.They are going on clearance as I write this review, but are still worth it if you can buy them anywhere.

Anyone with CNC machining experience and know-how will come away disappointed.CNC Workshop illustrates dozens of factual errors in programming format, it contains some glaring omissions, and spends far too much space promoting its own flawed software. This software has crashed and frozen up in many of my students' computers and fails to accurately portray CNC motion.This is an adequate book for very basic level CNC knowledge or for people with only elementary knowledge of the English language. It does an acceptable job of explaining some basic NC concepts and the multimedia package (NOT the simulator) is fairly helpful for educators. It would be a fine book for $35 in a highschool shop class, but does not deserve to share shelf space with books by Smid, Lynch, Valentino, Krar, or Curran."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, worthless software","review":"The book is an update to the previous edition. Unfortunately, everything you needed to know can be found in the original version for less $$. The software is buggy.

The most serious problem is that if you save a score as a MIDI file, all the repeat & end signs that you may have put in the score disappear. There is another peculiar problem with the program: if you cut & paste notes, chords or dynamic signs too often, they either stop playing or keep playing at places on the score where you removed them from. The \\"manual\\" tells you to keep clicking on a little brush symbol to redraw the score, but that doesn't always solve the problem. One annoying feature of the program is that every time you play your score, the note palette closes. So, if you want to add a few notes, listen to the score & then add a few more notes, you have to keep opening the note palette. After a while this becomes tedious.I suggest you spend your money on something better.Frustrated Musician"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with this software","review":"Granted, I didn't pay a lot for this software, but I have found it very, very time-consuming to use.

The \\"redraw\\" painter button (or F5) are absolutely not help to fixing the repeated crashes I've experience with this program. After putting in just 20 measures of a new score, measure 5 developed some sort of bug that makes the entire program crashes if you attempt to make \\"ANY\\" change to the measure. There are no instructions as to how to fix a corruption in an individual measure and attempting to erase the measure in no good because, once again, anything you do will crash the program.I'm not even certain I want to start over, and I had such great hopes for this program when I started; my advice is to seek out a more reliably stable program!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk ...

But all instruments display starting with drums, piano, guitar, strings, soloist, melody harmony etc. in that order. In other words, you can't just see the melody harmony unless you scroll. When the song goes to a new screen, you have to scroll again.

This book taught me to grab the bull by the horns and show the world what I've got.That was all great, but the true lesson was not something I learned from the book, but what the book reassured me of and demanded that I maintain.Love for music.The consistent undertone was that of a \\"you are a DJ, you have the duty to show the world this music and take them on a journey through it the way you see best\\".If you own a single piece of vinyl or have been collecting for years and stuck in that bedroom, read this.

Also the book features many comments from the originators of our DJ profession to the current artists. I'm 3/4s of the way through and don't want this book to end. I've been DJing for three years. Corp events, Clubs, and Parties. I've always done well. This book is helping me do soooo much better. In fact after using several of the books techniques I was offered three new jobs after a single gig. On the last job a woman told me \\"You are an awesome DJ!

Late in the book, the author admits that he pretended to be sleeping in order to eavesdrop on the conversation between two umpires in a hotel room. He says he threw away drinks and pretended to be drunk so they'd talk openly in front of him.If the ethics don't bother you, consider this: how accurate are the conversations he quotes, considering he had no tape recorder and reconstructed them after the fact?

This movie should not even fall into the horror catagory as it provides us no horror but just boredom. For someone who would like to see the true story of Bianchi, I would suggest viewing Serial Killers... the 3 DVD set.

In the process of trying to get close to the alleged killer, we find out she is quite a free spirit with plenty of sex and drugs with several people one who she does not know. With AIDS now days, you really think a doctor would know better. Towards the end, she hypnotized the alleged killer and finds out that he is lying.

So much of what this book teaches, such as observing Sabbath, I knew in my heart of hearts. But was taught something different in the churches. I have been freed to walk in the TRUTH of G-D's Word and not in mans perversion of it. Profound thanks to D. Thomas Lancaster, author of Restoration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Introductory Read","review":"If you are already convinced Torah-obedience is for all in Messiah, then this book might be a little redundant. I did learn some new \\"proofs\\" and/or ways to understand why Torah obedience is important, but this is a SUPER \\"introductory\\" book to hand to a friend interested in your Torah-obedient lifestyle. Non-confrontational & easy to read... it is not judgmental & discourages judgment towards those who do not agree with Torah-obediency... it is a gently nudging to explain the movement & why it is important. Very good book with clear, easy-to-follow arguments without shoving things down the reader's throat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Restoration: Returning the Torah of God to the Disciples of Jesus","review":"I was disappointed in the truth presented in this book. I perceive it to be an attempt by a Judaizer (Lancaster) to convince Christians (New Covenant) that they need to participate in Judiasm (Old Covenant) in order to fully appreciate their Messiah (Jesus Christ). Nothing could be further from the Truth of the Word of God (Bible)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource","review":"I have read a lot of books about the Hebraic/Jewish roots of Christianity, but this is the best one I have come across so far. It is full of eye-opening information that is concise, clear and very easily understood and absorbed. When used with the companion workbook, it is a great resource for a book study group. Be forewarned that it opens up so many discussions, that even within a very small group it can easily become an extended adventure stretching over many, many weeks.If you are looking for answers to the Torah question, or wanting to learn how to ANSWER questions about it, then this is definitely the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice sound, good \\"Ring\\"","review":"Re-strung my Eko Ranger 12 with these D'Addario EJ-38 light strings and am again getting a nice ringing tone with good sustain. No issues like breaking or dead strings that I had with Elixir's, just good sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"XD45 Holster - Well made & Classy!","review":"Quality holster. Excellent stitching and consistent color throughout. Will hold the pistol inverted. May be a bit tight when new but after it is broken in it conforms to the pistol. The end of the pistol barrel is even with the end of the holster so there is no barrel exposed. The cant is perfect for carrying at the 3 or 4 o'clock position. I really like the color of the holster. In fact, I bought the matching concealed carry belt and it's a great combo. The belt holds the pistol/holster close to the body and supports it very well. The contour of the holster contributes to this. Highly recommended!"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:O},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],N={key:0},B={key:1};function M(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(D,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-8658cd7b"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/14.md","filePath":"quotes/14.md"}'),W={name:"quotes/14.md"},L=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{j as __pageData,L as default};
