Fiction or not, I couldn't buy into Lecter's personna as I did with \\"Silence...\\". You get the impression that Harris got writer's block 3/4 of the way through and that the only purpose of the ending was to lend itself to another sequel. Way too wordy at times. Harris inconsistently goes from third to first person narrative. Interesting but disappointing read. Little if any substance to Starling's character. In fact, there were too many characters, several of whom the story could easily have gone without! Perhaps Hannibal Lecter will go the route of Rocky Balboa. Hannibal IV, Hannibal V....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful what you wish for.","review":"I have to admit that I wanted to like this book. My first reaction after reading it was disbelief. \\"What happened?\\", I thought. Then I realized what this book really was. Thomas Harris obviously disdains the popularity of the first two Hannibal books. It seems that he wanted to make sure that this book was a curveball, from the one-dimensional new villans down to one of the most laughable endings in literary history. He wrote a book that could never, ever be made into a film. Perhaps he felt his characters had been taken away from him. Don't worry Mr. Harris, it won't happen again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm forcing myself to pick up the book and continue on!","review":"Oh, I don't know, maybe I over-anticipated after anxiously waiting all these years. With Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, those books were read in one day and re-read over the years. So far, not the same with Hannibal. Good points to this tale are the obvious research put into the life of Hannibal in Italy, but for the most part, the other characters have yet to make me give a hoot. Reading some of the other reviews here make me wonder if I'll even bother going the distance. (Oh, I will, but will probably regret it.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really WANTED to like this book, but I don't think it lives up to the previous works in this series. What I liked best about Harris' previous work was his cool detachment from the (ghoulish and horrible) characters and events he was describing. This detachment is nowhere in evidence this time around, with the second person intervals and his obvious affection for Hannibal. When Salon Magazine synopsis for 'Hannibal' I thought it was a hoax...surely Thomas Harris wouldn't deliver such a far-fetched mess! Alas, I was wrong. I enjoyed the book, but it feels like it was written by someone trying to mimic Harris' work without possessing his gift for elegant prose and (usually) seamless story lines. A sad disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Dear!What a disaster!","review":"I would like to know who MR HARRIS'S editor is because I can not blame a reclusive autor for believing he has created somthing worthwhile but surely a writer relies on his editor to just tell the truth.So let me do it.MR HARRIS this book is terrible. Your initial opening reads like a bad action movie. Your middle section is reasonable . You should have maybe based the entire book in Europe . But........oh dearie me where did you get your ending from. It is absolute tosh. I found myself laughing through the final 10 chapters and I presume this is not the reaction you were looking for.But hey you're rich and I'm not.You created RED DRAGON . Now that was good.Please buy all the copies of this book back from the general public and have them pulped.Ay Carumba Mr Harris what were you thinking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment!","review":"Afer reading this sequel, I feel that Mr. Harris has stripped his characters of their former selves. I am still left unsatisfied as to what makes Hannibal Lecter 'tick' and Clarice has become nothing but an empty shell. The ending was absolutely horrible and a real sell-out for what I've always thought were really interesting and moving characters. This book lacks the psychological tension and suspense from Harris' previous books. Mason Verger was boring, his sister - the typical sidekick, and throw in a couple of thugs - you have your cast of characters. The only one that added any new insight was Barney.Sorry, Mr. Harris - I think I would of been better off not reading this sequel. Compared to your other novels - this one was like having to eat bad airplane food, when you know you can enjoy an exquisite boxed lunch instead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't worth the decade long wait!","review":"I was very disappointed. The writing, plot development, and especially the charater development, is inferior to Harris's other work. I am glad that I got it at 50% off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcoming the Return of Hannibal","review":"I started Hannibal on a rainy Sunday morning and finished it the same day. Thomas Harris' latest novel is a captivating, imaginative book that is difficult to put down. Its content is often gory and dark but it is all along illuminated by beautiful, poetic language, interesting details, complex characters, and skillful storytelling.Days after finishing this book, the story and its brilliant ending are still giving me food for thought. An interesting, satisfying read that will give both the occasional and the passionate reader an exhilarating literary experience. In this reader's opinion Hannibal's value far exceeds its price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hannibal is Simply Thrilling","review":"I found Hannibal to be well written, captivating and thrillingly lurid. The attention to detail is remarkable and speaks to exhaustive research by the author. I give special credit to Mr. Harris for taking the risk to end the book the way he did: while it seemed plausible, even logical, to me, I can understand how some readers will find it a point of contention. This book is clearly above the average and is well worth reading.Given the above, why not a higher rating? First, Conan Doyle was writing engrossing and highly descriptive tales of crime and detection over a century ago. Second, and more importantly, the story, while undoubtedly suspenseful, offers nothing new. For a truly profound, thought-provoking exploration into what makes a person commit unspeakable criminal acts, one from which insights will continue to be drawn, everything pales by comparison with Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A star for insight into Lector, one for finishing the story.","review":"As a fan of The Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, I dropped everything to read this book. The story of Mason Verger and his pig procurers is so richly detailed and depraved it practically stands on its own, almost overshadowing the main story.I appreciated Hannibal's character more against the backdrop of his childhood. All through \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", I kept wondering how such monsters are made.Clarice Starling was given short shrift in this sequel. Harris writes about her in a flat and one-dminensional way, leaving her uninteresting and weak.I was very disappointed in the ending. I, along with those who will admit to it, was very curious about where the obvious mutual respect and interest would take Hannibal and Clarice, but the ending was totally unbelievable; worse, it tainted my opinion of the rest of the book because it was so outlandish. I was so underwhelmed that if a movie is truly in the works, I won't be seeing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely disappointing","review":"After waiting such a long time to read this book I was very disappointed. Had this book not been written by Thomas Harris I believe it would have gone totally unnoticed and unread. His previous books had you turning the pages as fast as you could to see what was going to happen next. The tone of this book was very weird and I kept wondering: OK, when will this start? There is very little action involving Clarice Starling and all of a sudden we are expected to see Dr. Lechter as a romantic idol? This was totally BIZARRE and just AWFUL. What a waste!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God I got this book from the library!","review":"I am so glad I didn't put one red cent in the hands of Thomas Harris for this piece of drivel he probably wrote in one day. I have never been so disappointed in a book. The novel seemed to have been written by a different author about different characters. Where is the strong Starling we all loved and cheered? Where is the creepy Hannibal? Shacked up in South America? I don't think so!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting & vile - how about ZERO STARS","review":"10 year sabbatical for Harris brings nothing forth here. Can't believe how bad it is - serial killer books now are an effort to make the next book even more \\"over the edge\\" in creative gore. Don't even bother to get this trash at the library (where I did). A waste of time and a crime it was written and published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madness!","review":"What happend? Good God, I've been waiting in eager anticipation for this book ever since finishing Silence ( which I believed to be better than Red Dragon, although many disagree with me). The book was simply ludicrous. The stuff with the killer wild boars was laughable...as was Lector unscrewing a skull and eating from it. His relationship with Starling didn't feel right either. The set-up in Europe was nice though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the formula horror writer fans","review":"I had nearly given up on Harris' return to the crime-horror genre; I'm glad I did not. What superb imagination and craftsmanship! Not since Hemmingway has someone written so ingeniously and so convincingly. \\"Hannibal\\" will certainly be made into a film, just as the highly unlikely and hugely successful, \\"Silence...\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Cold Weather Book!!!","review":"For those nights when the weather keeps you in, when a fire and a good book sound like the best way to spend the evening....use this book to start the fire and then go find a good book to read!! If you do decide to work your way through this one don't finish it....this book has a few pretty intriguing story lines but doesn't deliver. It almost seems as if there were two authors, Harris seems to have started the book, whoever finished it should be just that....finished!! I finished it out of morbid curiosity and then gave the book the burial it deserved....the garbage. Too bad I don't have a fireplace...it would have made great kindling!!! I give it negative five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"breath-taking","review":"This book, put simply, is my favourite book of all time. It is a roller-coaster of psychological suspense and then some. It covers so many topics that it defies description. It is a stroke of literary genius. I would recommend this to anyone, period. Elegent, compelling, original. Hannibal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to expectations!!!","review":"The author had an opportunity to take his character...Hannibal...from his previous SOTLs and write perhaps the novel of the decade. Instead he daudled in the inner-workings of the mind of the killer and lost the plot almost entirely. This book was certainly not up to his previous efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"While Mr. Harris has a great ability to bring to mind very graphic images, often without fully describing those images, it's not enough to write a great book. My expectations were far too high after reading SOTL. The beginning of this latest book was excellent - it captured my interest immediately. The rest of the story went along fairly but began to bog down. My biggest complaint was the end. It seemed as if Mr. Harris had written enough and said to himslf, \\"Okay, time to end this one.\\" The ending is just too far-fetched for for me. The characters seemed way out of place in their roles. I don't wish to give away the ending of the book, but I'll say that it was not worthy of the rest of the story. I was extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lecter, Hannibal Lecter","review":"What starts out as an exciting hunt for a serial killer on the loose ultimately degenerates to James Bond fantasy. Lecter goes from being a really, really ugly human to something akin to SuperHero. Of course, he never runs out of money, or out of luck. He is stronger than almost everyone he meets. He kills people cleanly and neatly in the middle of a crowded street. Why not strap him to a metal plate that is being cut in half by a laser? You know he'll get out of that one. No, no, no! Strap him to a big log that's being cut at a lumber mill. Wait a minute, how about having him blast off into space to hook up with his evil genetics experiments... Obviously, Thomas Harris enjoys doing his research in Buenos Aires and Florence more than rural Ohio and Louisiana. What the heck, who says a serial killer can't be chic?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannibal is no Red Dragon","review":"This book was a big disappointment. When I heard this book was due out I couldn't wait. Now having read it i'm trying to forget it completely. Not only were most of the situations contrived and unrealistic, but to make a mockery of Clarice Starling is a sin in itself. Shock ending, not nearly as shocking as the boredom that leads up to it. It's almost predictable. Harris wrote this book for Hollywood and it shows. The ruination of such great characters is unforgiving, but someone out there likes it ... I've already returned my copy due to pure disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely unbelievable, almost entirely disgusting","review":"Mr. Harris has managed to foist upon his readers a work that, while taking place in what must be a parallel universe, manages to have no, absolutely no, characters with any redeeming qualities. His characters are distinguished only by their monstronsity and the degree of their veniality. I suppose this sort of thing appeals to those who enjoy cheap horror films but I feel cheated out of the price that I paid. A shame, I enjoyed \\"The Silence Of The Lambs\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I got bored...","review":"After \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", I expected something dark, gritty and maybe a little gory. What happened was a lot of \\"brainless\\" violence, a strange story and an ending that is too screwed up for words.I'd say pass..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best from Thomis Harris scince \\"Slilence of the Lambs\\"","review":"I tought that Hannibal was a thriller and a great book to read. Plenty of gore and it kept me on the edge of my seat the hole time I was reading it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I had waited with baited breath for the sequel of \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\", Hannibal. After I read it, all I felt was an intense amount of disappointment. What happened? The book had a alot of promise, but that promise went unfulfilled when the book became very sappy and the ending felt contrived and hard to stomach. Great potential, that somehow got lost in the shuffle to get the book on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prepare to have your high hopes shot down","review":"The last 40-50 pages ruined this book. While 'Hannibal' did not have the magic of the previous two books, it was entertaining...until the ending. Harris destroyed two wonderful characters by having them become something they are not. I was so furious after reading the ending that I threw the book across the room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great? No. But still very good!","review":"While it doesn't live up to Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal is a very good novel for those of us who like reading about demented serial killers. In fact, one could argue that Hannibal would work better as a stand-alone piece than the third installment behind RD and SOL. Mr. Harris, another commercially successful Mississippi born writer, raised the bar impossibly high with his first two efforts. Anything less than brilliant and starkly terrifying, alas, Hannibal is neither, would be a disappointment. Not only was it merely very good, versus great, real Lector fans, like me, will object to the direction he takes as a highly cultured fugitive after all these years as a psychopathic cannibal. Despite the negative reviews, I enjoyed Hannibal and would recommend it to readers of this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big joke","review":"It's no wonder why everyone who was involved in the movie Silence of the Lambs is passing this on (Jonathan Demme, Ted Tally, Tak Fujimoto, and even Jodie Foster). Let's face it. This book stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I realize this is fiction, but even so the story is unbelievable - and unbelievably awful in content. I found myself grimacing through much of it - not a pleasant way to spend an afternoon reading. Red Dragon and Silence were fine reads. This is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gruesome is right..the writing, that is!","review":"What a disappointment! I, along with so many others, anxiously waited for this book (pre-ordered on Amazon.com, of course). What a waste! I am no stranger to thrillers, but the gory detail was so intense it was difficult to slog through. The worst part was the ending; the Clarice Starling we respected from the first book never would have done what she was written into at the end of this book. Not only an absolute waste of the reader's time and money, but an insult to the quality of \\"Silence of the Lambs\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"It's NOT Red Dragon","review":"I originally stumbled across Red Dragon in 1982 when I moved to St. Charles, MO about 1 mile from Highway 94 as described in Harris's original novel with Lector. The book was mesmerizing. Silence of the Lambs, though not as taut, still provided a good read. Hannibal was a fast but less than satisfying read. The characters were shallow, the story not believable, and the ending .... give me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harris lets go a Hannibal ham","review":"This book is so bad it makes me never want to read anything ever again. The writing is at the level of an only mildly witty third grader, the plot is clunky, to say the least, the jokes unfunny, the horror un-horrendous, and the end feeling is one of distance, complacency. If Harris's taste for olla podria really had kicked in, we might have a cultural curio on our hands. Instead what we have is a mean, insulting, biggoted, racist, homophobic book that might as well have been written by a computer. Word is that Harris has been writing HANNIBAL for the last ten years. Hey, come on, Tommy, more like TEN DAYS! The best thing about this book is the acknowledgements page, which reads like Nancy Drew on acid. Next time, Tommy Harris, maybe you can write your own book, do your own research, your own cooking. Oh, and the second best thing about this book is that, at least for now, it won't be made into a movie. But then again, if it is, the movie will be infinitely better."},{"rating":"1","title":"** A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT! **","review":"I can't believe I waited so many years for this half-assed lamely plotted book. I reject its existence and revert my Mind Palace to Clarice Starling's graduation from the FBI Academy. I end the story there, as if \\"Hannibal\\" never existed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"I'm not going to wreck the plot for others, but I now have strong suspicions that Harris may have ransomed his soul to write =Silence of the Lambs=. This book is THAT ridiculous. The ending alone is reason enough to save your money and buy something worthwhile, like the Star Wars novelization.Seriously...I cannot believe that Harris actually wrote this and expected it to be taken as the legitimate sequel to =Red Dragon= and =Silence of the Lambs=. It's nearly as gory in spots as =American Psycho,= features perhaps the most ludicrous \\"romantic\\" couple of the decade, and has an ending so stupefyingly bad as to leave me shaking my head.I can't go on. I just can't. My one hope is that five months from now Harris will publish the *real* sequel, the way that Coca-Cola withdrew New Coke in favor of the real thing. What a waste of time and paper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I can't believe I waited 10 years for this crap. T. Harris should have is liver eaten with some fava beans and a bottle of warm genaric beer. A waste of time. Reread Silence or Red Dragon, both much, much better. Supposedly T. Harris got 9 million for the film rights. He is stealing money. If a movie is made that sticks to the storyline of this book, it will not make a dime. I would much rather see The Red Dragon remade into a movie that is faithful to the book. Too bad J. Demme did not do this one too. Micheal Mann's Manhunter(Red Dragon) was just an OK cop movie. I am not surprised that J. Demme dropped out directing the Silence sequel. A long wait for almost nothing!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This book was a huge disappointment. I've been a fan of this series since Red Dragon, and was excited to read this novel. But it seemed like little effort was made to stay true to the characters. Clarice's character seems to be acting younger than when she was a student, and at the end of this book I thought she was a joke. I'm still angry that I spent so much money buying the hardcover version when it was first published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give very serious thought to reading this book...","review":"Many readers hated this book, Stephen King felt it was the best of the series, my opinion comes closer to King's. This story is less sensational than Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs. Those are great books each but they essentially tell the same story--unique FBI agent needs Hannibal Lecter's iside info to catch a serial killer on the loose before he kills again. The purpose of this story is to let us into Hannibal's mind--literally. Harris is able to make Lecter's flawless memory, super-developed sense of smell, and his love of cooking both fascinating and chilling. The ending (changed for the movie) is much better in the book. It offends many people but, after Lecter's escape at the end of Silence, this ending takes his success to the ultimate degree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful (not because of the gore and violence)","review":"First of all, let me say that if it were possible, I would have given this book no stars. Maybe I was influenced by the Silence of the Lambs movie,but I just can't believe that the characters in this book would do the things they did. I can understand Starling having some sympathy for Dr. Lecter, however, what she did at the end of the book was absolutely out of character for her in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"We would have been better off if Thomas Harris had never written this book. He has taken two exceptional characters and completely ruined them. I guess Harris just ran our of ideas for this one. If you liked \\"Red Dragon\\" and \\"Silence of The Lambs\\", do yourself a favor and don't read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harris prostituted his talent in his latest book","review":"Rarely have I been so disappointed in a book. While Harris has considerable writing skill, this book seemed to be more about his ego than the characters he had developed earlier. It was a \\"hey, I can speak Italian,\\" and \\"hey, I know about fine wines\\" name-dropping kind of book. The finale was unlikely, unbelievable, and entirely unsatisfactory. Harris rode his reputation to the bank and delivered a shallow effort to his readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Novel","review":"I have read this book three times in two years. Out of the Hannibal Lecter novels it is my favorite. I love seeing different sides of Clarice and Hannibal. This is Thomas Harris at his best! I love this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"should have stopped at the last hannal novel.","review":"i was not too satisfied with this one. i think they should have left well enough alone with the last novel,The Silence of the Lambs. one Hannibal is enough. a little boring and out landish in parts, especially the brain part."},{"rating":"1","title":"An author shouldn't fall in love with his characters.","review":"Uh oh! Maybe it hasn't been success, but something's spoiled Mr. Harris, who now wants us to understand Hannibal's inner child. Mushy as an antebellum romance and with Clarice Starling merely a cipher, this book is redeemed mainly by its early sections. Set in Florence, they are alive in a way which contrasts sharply with the cringingly predictible rest of the book. harris's new face expression: \\"bleed out.\\" Whenever someone dies, he uses the phrase, resulting in the marriage of slopped editing with disappointing writing and a mystery more tantalizing than the novel's.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing sequel","review":"Thomas Harris seems more interested in giving geographical and historical lessons in his latest book than any real story developments. Having thoroughly enjoyed \\"Silence Of The Lambs\\", I was anxious to read \\"Hannibal\\" but came away feeling very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outrageous, audacious ending saves Hannibal from mediocrity","review":"I must admit, as many readers of this book were, I was a bit disappointed with the second tale of Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling. Far too much time is spent on lesser, newer characters, and the subplots are just not that interesting. But the ending--WHOA! You can't possibly predict it. It's bold and outrageous. You have to read it over to make sure you really indeed read what you read. It's an easy and mostly satisfying read with a terrific ending. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending Empty","review":"I can certainly understand the length of time Harris took to produce this sequel. Obviously the section on Italy took time to research correctly, and his integration of the inner-workings of the FBI and the Justice Department also required in-depth research as well. The question is, why the ending? I am a psychiatrist by training, and, after finishing the book, for the first time, I had to use my training to understand why an author would try to fit his characters into such a preposterous, unstatisfying conclusion. I still don't understand. This novel was a complete let-down. I would not recommend this work to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im with Jodie on this one","review":"Although the setting of this book was much more appealing than either Silence or Red Dragon, it cant compete on all other counts. Even Rome and its museums cant save this book from mediocrity.The best thing about Harris' previous books were the absolutely loathsome villans, Dolarhyde and Lecter. Here I get the feeling that we are supposed to hope that Lecter will eventually prevail. A bit much to ask considering the man is a psychotic cannibal!! Mason Verger is the best character in the book and Gary Oldman played him perfectly in the film. In fact this entire book seems to have been written solely for the big screen. Man eating pigs may make great cinema but they are totally out of place here. And poor Barney, reduced to selling Lecter memorabilia! Im with Jodie on this one. One of the most anticipated books in years, its just plain disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Silence of the Lambs","review":"I was so disappointed by this book, maybe because my expectations were too high, but it certainly is no comparison to Silence of the Lambs. This book was way over the top it was borderline disgusting. While I was reading the first few pages in this book, I was thinking to myself what kind of person could have wrote such a book. I found myself disliking every character in this book, and had great difficulties finishing the gruesome story. If you liked the first 2 books by Thomas Harris skip Hannibal, you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bold in attempt but shallow in delivery.","review":"While the plot of Hannibal proved both searing and intriguing, the writing was script-like in nature and, thus devoid of feeling. Climactic scenes and tense moments were left empty without the exploration of the human mind and heart. Though much of the writing was masterful, there was no depth or probing into the characters. Quite a disappointment. Buy this one only if you're mind thirsts for the answers to the questions left from SOTL. I can think of no other reason to spend the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing in its depiction of evil as something pure","review":"Certainly the ending of this book was a great disappointment but not because the writing was poor or the ball was dropped with the plot. Those attributes are coincidental. The real disturbing element in this book was that evil triumphs over good. And I mean -- real evil. The descriptions of death and cannibalism border on the pornographic particularly when the main character is given elegance and grace to a level that approaches attractiveness. I wonder when the next serial killer will emulate what he or she learns from this book about eating people. Don't read this abomination on a full stomach and don't be taken in (as I was) by a fascination for the macabre. The plot is predictable and there is little mystery here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harris went one book too far with Hannibal","review":"Harris should have stopped at Silence of the Lambs. This book was a major disappointment to me. No real suspense, no real excitement. Disappointing ending. They will make a movie and at least the movie writers will be able to clean it up, show some good Florence scenes and make it a fun show. They sure will throw out a lot of the book and just use the name. One star is too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good,disturbing","review":"I can not believe the ending.The book was well written,but the ending was unbelievable.Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter trash...","review":"This book is utter trash, a huge disappointment, and borders on psycho-pornography. Harris must of had a screw loose when he penned this poor excuse for a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need a rating of \\"0 Star\\"","review":"Terrible book. Terrible ending. Lame scenes such as Hannibal's so called lecture on Rennaisance Art in Florence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping for...","review":"Thomas Harris lets his fans down with\\"Hannibal\\". Where is the thrill of the hunt from \\"Red Dragon\\" and \\"Silence of the Lambs\\"? Particularly annoying is Krendler, Starling's enemy in the Department of Justice. He is a total caricature, a figure too simplistic to be believable. There is almost no reference to Will Graham, who I hoped would make a return, as he is the most interesting character in the series besides Lecter. The ending is totally ludicrous; All in all, I'd recommend rereading \\"Dragon\\" and \\"Silence\\", and leaving this one on the shelves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not Great","review":"I tremendously enjoyed this novel, even in spite of the shocking ending. It seems that those readers who gave this book a bad review didn't understand the author's intent. According to him, it's not Hannibal who is truely teffifying, but the politicians, bureaucrats, lawyers, et al, who sell us all out on a daily basis who are truely horrifying. Hannibal represents the wolf who only prays upon the weak and sick of the herd. If you didn't like this book, may I suggest that you go stick to the safety of your T.V. Guides and crossward puzzles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Masterfully written....absurd ending.","review":"Thank goodness Thomas ended the story when he did.It had been years since I read TSOTL, and his writing style is so deliciously unique and HANNIBAL was so engaging that I fully enjoyed the first 90% of the novel. Needless to say, I, too, have a few bones to pick about the ending.Was he stumped? Was the deadline near? Editors breathing down his back? But there's no excuse for nearly ruining (yes, ruining) a good story with such a preposterous ending. To shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damm best book I've ever read !","review":"Contrary to what others say, I found this book to be engrossing and re-readable. I also think that Harris has done a good job of potraying Krendler as a son of a bitch. My heart goes out to Hannibal. Tell u guys what, go borrow the book to judge for yourself.Those who gave this book a <4 stars rating sure has no literal taste ."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE PLOT SICKENS...","review":"If stars were awarded for grossness then \\"Hannibal\\" would be a five star winner. With the prominent role of pigs in the \\"story\\", the book would have been better titled \\"Silence of the Hams\\". No plot, cartoon characters and the only thrill in this \\"thriller\\" for me was getting to the end... and these are the good points. If you insist on reading this trash wait til it's out in paperback and pick it up at your neighborhood used book store for half price. Even then you'll still feel cheated. No question that we will be seeing a movie soon but I hope that Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster don't demean themselves by having anything to do with this nonsense. Note to Mr Harris: You could have mailed this one in. If this is the best that you can do then 15 years may not be long enough to wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally out of character...","review":"This book is slow, the people we know from the previous book are a bit out of character from the previous story, and 1/2 way through the book your still waiting to be unerved! What can you expect when the movie rights are bought before the book was written. Someone's laughing all the way to the bank. Borrow this from someone if you must read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read in one day, no trouble sleeping.","review":"I read the reviews and thought it must be fabulous. I love a good scare. Stephen King read it, gave it a good review. How could it be a loser. Please. Totally disappointing. Ending was unbelievable. Somehow didn't understand why Barney gave Margot the rape kit and don't care enough now that I've completed the book to go back and re-read that chapter. Terribly disappointing ending. Had it figured out pretty soon after the final scene at the farm. I spent the entire day reading it on Saturday, finished 3 am. I should have done housework and gone to bed early. OH, as for needing a nightlight to be able to overcome the terror. Gee... If this book is considered scarey, then Godzilla movies must be terrifying...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puh-leeze","review":"No doubt Jodie Foster passed on the role when she got to the end of the book and it described Clarice's hairdo as a \\"platinum helmut.\\" What drug was Harris on when he wrote the ending? No way can you change a belief and value system by dangling a few baubles and a plate of foie gras under their nose as Harris implies in the book. This one was a real yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was like a car wreck...","review":"I knew it would be bad and I would be thoroughly disgusted with myself for bothering to look, but I couldn't resist. Everything I'd heard about how bad it was *made* me want to read it, just so I could see for myself how bad it really was.I won't bother to give away the ending, but suffice it to say that if it were mentioned here, you might feel the need to read it yourself just to see for yourself that he really had the audacity. I think Harris' secret plot here was to thoroughly disgust the reader with the characters so that he never has to write them again. After all, he's a made man now, no need to visit with ghosts of the past, especially if nobody wants to see or hear or read them ever again after this ten-car-pile-up of a travesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Reading, exciting and beautiful.","review":"I've read several of these reviews and am sitting here in shock at some of the comments. Rather than moralizing, sit back and enjoy the ride!"},{"rating":"1","title":"[poor book]","review":"...Starling and HL are so ludicrously different from their former incarnations they might as well be totally new characters, and the writing is so bad it's actually in bad ENGLISH, with the \\"author\\" often using non-sentences to set up \\"scenes\\" like a screenplay. You forgot the VERBS, Tom! How appropriate that Shlockmeister Stephen King gave \\"Hannibal\\" such a glorious write-up in the NY Times Book Review. Only somebody who can't figure out why Jodie Foster took a powder on the film sequel should read this book. Smart girl, that Jodie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't eat before you read!","review":"One of the most psychologically disturbing books I've ever read. This was one of only two books that kept me under the covers at night, sleeping with the lights on.In the first few pages I didn't think I was going to enjoy this book at all, but within minutes I was overjoyed that I continued with it.Harris captures the darkest side of humanity with this book and it's not all from the person you would suspect. This book goes a long way towards showing that there is too much evil in the world to let it set itself down on the shoulders of just one man.I know I'll read this one again, something I don't often do. Don't purchase this if you're weak of heart or stomach. But if you want to be tuned in and tuned up until the very last page it's a must buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"outragest in the wrong way","review":"My honest opinion on this book is that it was too lengthy on the subject of Italy. Middle chapters devoted to this section were wasted and time that should clearly have been spent on Clarice, wasn't. Another disappointment was the ending. I suggest sticking with \\" The Silence...\\" as the last book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exciting right up to the final fizzle.","review":"I enjoyed Red Dragon & Silence of the Lambs, which stand as classics of the genre. This one starts off about how and where you'd expect, with Hannibal on the run and Clarisse in some career difficulty. The book reads well, with plot twists and character development in the B+ range. HOWEVER: BEWARE OF THE ENDING. Shockingly out of character, jarringly out of context, it could enrage you as it did yours truly. The last 20 or so pages made me ask myself: \\"For *THIS* I spent money !?!!!?\\" Caveat Emptor, folks, this one turns into a huge dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"HANNIBAL! is HORRIBAL!","review":"The only thing scary about this book is the fact that some people have given it more than one star. Not only was there no action or suspense, the characters were flat and unemotional. Who really felt bad about the demise of any of them? And the ending ... HUH? Harris builds some terrific characters in his earlier books only to wind them up like this? It makes no sense. Better luck next time (in the year 2010 probably)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damn you, Fame!","review":"I had high hopes for this book. I still had those hopes and felt a bit giddy as I started the book and actually liked it. But I thought the character development of everyone but Lecter and Mason was pathetic. Even Starling was not given enough attention. Everyone just seemed to get skipped over so more creepy, whacked out stuff could be divulged about Lecter and Mason. And the ending! What the heck happened? It's like Harris just decided to end the book um ..........let's see...........um..........this way, yeah! I felt like I should check myself into the sanitarium after I finished this book. I could only shake my head in total confusion. And trust me, the eventual movie with this ending will disappoint all but the truly mentally ill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of $$$$","review":"Like \\"The Phantom Menace\\", this book may be a victim of over-hype. On its merits, however, this book is still one of the worst disappointments I've ever had. The stage was set for a great sequel. Clarice Starling hunting Hannibal Lector, a monsterous villian. Maybe assisted by Will Graham or Jack Crawford. . . Nope. . didnt happen. . Instead we get a cast of characters that are more evil and sadistic than Lector, and what's worse is, they are unlikable and unsympathetic. The book is gross, and Harris seems determined to shock the reader with his prose. Not because it fit into the sotryline, but because he wanted a reaction from the reader. Additionally, if anyone has any other reaction than total disbelief at the ending, they should have their head examined.. like Paul Krendler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I am so disappointed by the direction that this story went. The book disgusted me and showed very little of the skill and craftmenship that Harris had in the past 2 Lecter novels. I hope that Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins stay miles away from this one. This book is not worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment!","review":"What a bummer!! I awaited this book for ten years. Red Dragon is by far Harris' best book but Silence was good too. That's why this book was such a disappointment. If Harris had become a hack, putting out a book a year, I could understand the loss of quality. But it took him ten years to write this. I found the characters and the plot unbelieveable. But the worst offense was the complete negation of Clarice Starling's character that had been so carefully crafted by Harris. The ending was about as realistic as Hannibal being awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sloppy effort by an otherwise great storyteller...","review":"I was disappointed with this book not because it didn't meet expectations, but because there was such a major fall-down in the style. Harris' past books have been characterized by both enormous restraint in graphic detail and consistency of character; this book had neither. At the end, he completely discards everything about Clarice Starling's character that he has carefully developed over two books just to pair her (absurdly) with Dr. Lecter. The graphic details in the book, while not approaching the level of say Stephen King, were disappointing because Harris had shown himself in the past so willing to leave these things up to the imagination of the reader. I had the feeling the whole time that the book was written to be transformed into a screenplay, and not as novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother making the move.","review":"I was looking forward to meeting Clarice and Hannibal again. Nobody in this book seemed real. I believe Harris was merely writing for gruesome shock value. Don't bother making the movie. Even Anthony Hopkins couldn't save this script. A former Harris fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"It simply is 'not' believable.","review":"Unfortunately, for the readers who have waited years for a second look at the infamous Dr. Lecter, there is only a glimpse in 'HANNIBAL'. The book is well written and keeps your interest, but not with the flare of its predecessor. What was good in 'SILENCE OF THE LAMBS', is now evil, and what was evil, is so still."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dud!","review":"Very disappointing sequal to The Silence of the Lambs. Paper cutout characters. No suspense. A totally ridiculous ending. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. Gimmie a break.","review":"Ugh. I won't spoil it for everyone but if this book ended by aliens came down and sucked Hannibal Lecter up to their spaceship for mating rituals, THAT would have been a move believable ending. Hannibal? No, Horribal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"What a disappointment. I loved Harris' earlier books and was very much looking forward to this one. I read half the book and couldn't make myself keep picking it up.Harris had two fascinating characters to work with and blew it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is an insult!","review":"I have never been so insulted! Harris must think his readers are idiots if he dares to end this book the way he did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who really wrote this book!?!","review":"Incredibly dissapointed. I loved the book Silence of the Lambs. Remember when they hired another writer to do a sequel for Gone With the Wind - this had the same feel - that someone else was tinkering with my favorite charachters. Clarice is a totally different person in this book, and the back story on Hannibal was not only LAME but it ruined him for me. Why give away the goods - Hannibal is much better as an enigma.Wouldn't reccomend it to anyone - especially Jodi Foster!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Um - what the hell was THAT?","review":"It's actually kinda funny. If I'm anywhere NEAR the end of a book, I usually finish it - so it was odd to me that the book sat on my shelf, unfinished, for over two days with only around 30 pages to go, and I had no real desire to finish it.I SHOULD HAVE JUST LEFT IT ALONE!That a book with the potential that this one had - before even being written! - ended the way it did is beyond pathetic. I tend to feel guilty for not liking a book - I try to like everything. But not Hannibal. I'm just not sure what Mr. Harris was thinking. Some have said it was \\"bravery\\" and \\"guts\\" that he dsiplyed by ending this book the way he did. I'll call it laziness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like liver and fava beans with Ripple - not a fine Chianti","review":"Having anticipated another chapter in the Lector story for years, and having re-read SOtL and Red Dragon, I was thrilled to see \\"Hannibal\\" on the bookstands. I was ready to be equally thrilled by the book. Wrong! Parts of the book were masterfully written, but the last chapter was disappointment writ large. In the name of character development, Dr. Lecter was raised to the level of superman. Krendler was a cartoon, as were most of the other characters. I don't need a happy ending, but I do need one that is plausible and fits the sense of the story. Wrong again! Compared to the previous two books in the series, this is tabloid journalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment after the first two Lector books.","review":"There is no suspense, just insipid characters and vivid gory descriptions that somehow don't even arouse horror--they're simply too unbelievable. What a shame the character development didn't continue after such a brilliant start(s)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute romance, but not credible","review":"I was very much expecting this novel to be a suspenseful thriller...but the more I read, the less credible it became. From Hannibal to Starling, the characters were so grotesquely unrealistic that I kept wondering how this got published.The ending left me incredulous...simply because it was so farfetched not even my vivid imagination could conjure how a serial killer would act like a male character in the worst romance novel.Let's label this one FANTASY. And HOPE it is NEVER made into a movie -- at least not the novel version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannibal the horrible","review":"What an ending! Before I read the book, I was aware that there is a twist at the end. That was the only reason that I endured the slow pace and boring side plots. As I was nearing the end, I thought, \\"No, this could not be the ending, the twist is coming up.\\" I was totally disappointed. That IS the ending. If you are looking for \\"and they live happily everafter\\" kind of ending, read Beauty and the Beast."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Thomas Harris were here, I would kick him in the...","review":"That's how much I hated this book. The majority of the book paled in comparison to Silence of the Lambs, but the ending was just absurd. It actually made me angry it was so bad. If I thought it would work, I would go to a hypnotist to get all recollection of this book removed from my head. In short, if you loved Silence of the Lambs, for god's sake DON'T READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"I agree with the earlier reviewer that Hannibal is a tangled mess of pretentious garbage. If you want to read about psychological disorders on a global scale, read the great new novel, \\"The Triumph and the Glory\\". That fine novel won't insult your intelligence like Hannibal, it even has a REAL ending, one you won't soon forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously flawed!!","review":"I'll save more space for all of the other reviewers and just say read something else instead of a spectacular loser like Hannibal. It was atrocious. Do yourself a favor and read something great this weekend like THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, or ALLEYS OF EDEN, or WHITE OLEANDER, or THE READER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly disappointing, Mr. Harris how about a refund?","review":"Couldn't have been more disappointed with a book if I purposely tried. Incredibly tedious, boring, and without direction. You would think that after waiting years Mr. Harris would have come up with a book worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Horrible Horrible","review":"Up until about the last 5 chapters, I was lovong this book. Man, it was better than Silence. And then all of a sudden...it was like Harris was hit overthe head with an idiot stick and his editor just squashed together some jackass ideas and slapped a cover on it! I bet the sequel to Gone with the Wind is better than this load of trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Reading \\"Hannibal\\" I felt the same sensation I did watching the new Star Wars. Harris concentrates too much on details and forgets to tell an interesting story. We get a load of useless facts and trivia about Lecter and other peripheral characters. What we don't get is the engaging exchange between the Cannibal and Clarice that was present in the previous book. Director Demme claims he doesn't want to film \\"Hannibal\\" because it's too violent. I think it's just too thin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this what I was waiting for?","review":"I cannot tell you what a disappointment this book is. Thomas Harris has created a violent, sadistic novel with no concrete lines distinguishing good from evil. Are we supposed to feel sympathy for any of these characters, or are we supposed to celebrate the ultimate snuff novel and its creative methods of murder ? If this is what is scintillating to the people of America, we are in a lot of trouble.Please know that I am disappointed that this book is as lousy as it is. I've read all of Thomas Harris' other novels and found them well-written and enjoyable.It's too bad he had to write this one.I felt dirty reading it, and I may never think of Florence, Italy - my favorite city in the world - in the same way again. If you have to read this book, order it through the Internet, and at least pay a low price for it. And pray to God that Hollywood will not make this novel into a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh...","review":"Enough said by other Amazon reviewers. Just wanted to make sure other people save time and $."},{"rating":"1","title":"Famished","review":"Whereas \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" gave me that comfortably, but not too, full feeling, Harris' latest leaves me hungry. Pass the Chianti!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break!","review":"All I can say is this book was a bitter disappointment. The villian (no, not Lecter but Mason Verger) was straight out of a DC comic book, our heroin Clarice Starling (which the average American equates with Jody Foster, whether they want to or not) turns out to be a total flake. And, poor Jack Crawford is dismissed with quite the whimper. After about chapter 65, I actually grew weary with Hannibal Lecter and really didn't care what was on his mind anymore. When I put this book down, I sat for a minute wondering what was Harris thinking. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this book. I suggest you don't either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Essentially Flawed Book","review":"My main problem with the story is that the characters here bear little resemblance to the characters in the previous book in the beginning, and become even more strange as the book progresses. The ending is just bizarre. Had I not read The Silence of the Lambs, I may have enjoyed this book for what it is, a simple, though grotesque, description of one psychopath and the people he's contacted. However, in the framework of the previous book, this story becomes stupid, contrived, and disappointing. Anyone who'd read the Silence of the Lambs will probably feel the need to read this book; just be prepared for disappointment, and the urge to say \\"WHAT??\\" at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very sloppy ending...","review":"I admit the major portion of this book was engaging and extremely well written. I felt the last three or four chapters were thrown together and felt very cheated in the ending of this book. If you have not read it yet, my advice is to pick another book and save your memories of Hannibal and Clarice. I wish now I had not read it and I agree with the others who say if this is the way the screen-play ends, the movie should never be made and I will be very surprised if Sir Anthony Hopkins or Jodie Foster either one sign on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing.","review":"Initially, this is pretty scary stuff, but the ending is a complete cop-out and very dissappointing. There were so many ways to go that would have been better. There's no way that Starling and Lechter could come to this end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely a waste of time.","review":"What a serious letdown! This book read like a parody of Harris' earlier work. I expected the last page to read \\"Gotcha - the joke's on you!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A Made For The Big Screen Novel.","review":"Like Michael Crichton, Harris has let the screen potential of his amazing (overall) chronicle overshadow where this story should have gone. And this, the third Lechter installment, suffers mightily. Like he's more worried about how the movie will turn out rather than does the story, very simply, work. In this case, Harris' asking for me to suspend my disbelief is just too great a request, and he simply does not deliver. With Lechter, the story doesn't need the inclusion of another monster (Mason Verger). It needs more cat and mouse between Starling and Lechter, more of the claustrophobia that makes silence (the book, hated the movie) what it was. Needs more \\"Hannibal\\" and less (a lot less) contrivance. And the ending...please.....trying to hard to make a movie, Mr.Harris. Write a novel instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful, wonderful, perfect! What a movie it will make.","review":"Harris a genius, gutsy, bonechilling, gutwrenching writer...if you only read one book this year, read this, you won't be sorry. Loved the ending, never would have guessed the writer would do it. What nerve, what wonderment of mind, what a reward for followers of Clarice and Hannibal. Speaking of which, where is the sequal to Hannibal? Had to read and stop, read and stop, did not want the story to end. Harris, we salute you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget this sequelnonsense and reckognize this book's theme","review":"This book is called \\"Hannibal\\". Surely everybody expected the book to be an insight into the realm of Dr. Lecter. And isnt that exactly what we got? A vivid look into his mind, and an understanding of his dimensions, and explanation to what he seeks. A truly terrifying and absolutly fascinating invitation in to the imagination of a monster. This memorypalace is a place where innovation, beauty, nightmares and absolute terror goes hand in hand. Its roofs harbours more than just good and evil. It is frightening and wonderfull at the same time. It is the single most incredible description of a genious mind that i have ever read. Who cares about the rest?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"Having read Black Sunday, Red Dragon, and Silence of the Lambs, I was very psyched to read this novel. Unfortunately, the feeling soon passed as I got further into the novel. Weak character development and a meandering plot transformed this into a novel that is revolting rather than terrifying. The ending is the worst of all. Unbelievable and saddening at the same time. Ugh, I don't believe I've been as disappointed in a novel in a very long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth listening to","review":"Frankly I found the audio cassette version fairly impossible to listen to and stopped. One's time could be definitely better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, disappointing.","review":"Worth a read for fans, but wait for the paperback or get it at the library. Clarice is a wimp, and for that matter, so is Dr Lecter - he's not really evil, just had a bad experience with his sister (Typical '90s - there's an excuse for everything). Not in the same league as Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs, hard to believe Thomas Harris wrote this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending ruined it for me...","review":"This is not a book that did much for me. I loved Silence of the Lambs. It kept me on the edge of my seat. This book, however, just left me wondering what the author was thinking once I reached the end! I had high expectations, but they were quickly deflated. Although there were some aspects of the book that I liked, its conclusion really just cancelled those out for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I want a comic book story, I'll read a comic book","review":"I read the entire book over the course of this afternoon. It was fun, and had one truly great moment in my opinion. But the rest seemed like the plot of a comic book. Not a well-written comic, but a cheesy Preacher rip-off. Harris created great characters like Clarice and Hannibal in the last book and ruined them in this one. It seemed like he was writing the book as if it was a movie, yet if they made a movie from this book, I don't think anyone would watch it, even if Hopkins, Foster, and Demme were involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sir Anthony Hopkins, PLEASE don't sign that contract!","review":"Harris' other books featuring Lecter, Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, were pretty good reads. Hannibal, however, is as poorly crafted a book as I've read in a while. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! I am not eager to read his next book, which will appear sometime in 2008, no doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"An ending that was an utter disappointment","review":"If I could, I'd give this book no stars in the ranking. I definately do not recommend reading this book. Hopefully the movie will be better. It can't be worse. I loved Red Dragon and Silence of The Lambs. The respective movies were also very entertaining. I could not wait to get my hands on the latest novel, Hannibal. Thanks to the strength of the first two novels and Hannibal's character, this book was captivating. That is, until the ending. I had a hard time finishing the book. The ending diverged so much from the story and from the characters Harris spent so much time developing. Nonetheless, I held out hope for an exciting ending. What a let down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The audio version I listened to ehthralled and entertained.","review":"\\"Hannibal\\" carried the torch of \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" high and bright. It was a great continuation of the saga of evil. Hannibal Lector is the metaphor for the elite percentage of the population that controls all the wealth and feeds off the rest of us like a killer whale through a school of herring. Clarice is the seduced or corrupted \\"average\\" with a gift who buys into the glitter after defeat at the hands of the mediocre. Paced just right with the off balancing twist of too many bad guys. There are no innocents in this story only various degrees of corruption. All in all paced well, told well and somewhere between Anne Rice and Patricia Cornwell in believability. I loved it and was lost in the descriptions and diversions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good beginning, horrible ending","review":"I just finished reading Hannibal today, and I am very dissapointed. After reading and watching Silence of the Lambs, I expected that Hannibal would be a very enjoyable book. I was certainly wrong. First, the deaths of characters from the original books ruined the story in itself. It would have been a much better book if the ending had been different. If Harris write another sequel, it better start out with Clarice waking up, and saying the words \\"Wow, It was all a dream\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A wasted read.","review":"The sensationalism competed to strongly with the plot. So much of it was distracting and unnecessary. The end was tatally unbelievable and I never did find out what \\"chocalate\\" had to do with anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted more, but got less.","review":"After reading Silence and Red Dragon I had expected a thrilling, insightful read. Unfortunately, this is not how I would describe Hannibal. I couldn't wait to be done with this book so I could read something else! The entire book feels forced--Hannibal is stripped of his mystery and nothing very interesting remains. I did enjoy the ending--but it could not make up for the other 200 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why didn't he just write a screenplay?","review":"After more than 9 years waiting to find out what happened to the horrible Hannibal Lecter, I was put off and disappointed with the writing which is so obviously the basis for a screenplay (description of the entrance scenes into Hannibal's rooms is all stage direction and direction for painters and lighting folks!I have not gotten past the first 150 pages and find it hard to drive myself forward. Unfortunately having peeked at disappointing ending in others comments, I am not sure I would want to continue.He'll be lucky to get a maximum caliber actor like Anthony Hopkins to reprise the role!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-hyped crap!","review":"I really can't believe I was roped in by the hype. It seems as though Hollywood was calling the shots on this movie as opposed to an accomplished writer!The beginning was slow boring. You may give him the excuse that he is building charater and atmosphere but for how long!; The middle: Well he just keeps building - you start wondering whether the story will actually get anywhere. And the ending! My god! What a pathetic cop-out! Everyone lives happily ever after!I've never subected myself to the ordeal of reading anything as bad as this in my whole life. Don't buy this book unless you're interested in insulting your own intelligence!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad dumbing down of intelligent, diabolical Dr. Lecter","review":"This book was a tremendous disappointment. The intelligence of Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs is no where to be found in this tepid, stupid, gory for no reason sequel. Life's too short to waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible stuff","review":"This is a completely unworthy sequel, and I can't imagine seeing it come to film. Which, in the end, is a good thing. Harris seems fixated on being as repulsive as possible, and frankly, there's very little value to a work of literature when all it can boast is SHOCK value. Terrible, and disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing... but an ok ride...","review":"As a huge fan of Harris, I ran to the nearest bookstore last Tuesday morning... I could have walked... and had breakfast along the way... 1. The plot feels forced, like Harris was writing off other people's suggestions. 2. Characters such as Barney, Clarice, and Dr. Lecter seem to have changed in personality in ways that don't fit their character... but have to, to fit the book. 3. The ending is silly. 4. Parts of the major plot are silly. 5. Too much detail in areas that don't matter and not enough in places that would have been interesting.As a book on it's own it's OK. As a book by Thomas Harris and a follow-up to Silence of the Lambs -- Dissapointing. Read Red Dragon.With all of that I still read it in a few hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pigs? Wait, let me read that again...Pigs?!","review":"People read (or saw) SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and came to associate Hannibal Lecter with the embodiemnt of evil. For Harris to turn him to the book's central focus and something of a sympathetic character is fine; a very interesting twist. However, the rest of the characters here are boring and one-dimensional. Mason Verger? Please! His huge revenge plot is almost laughable. The scenes in Italy read like a phone book. Overall, a waste of $25.00. James Ellroy once wrote that he wanted to be as good a writer as Harris. If this is Harris' new standard, Ellroy will have no problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title should be HORRIBLE not Hannibal!","review":"A poorly written, (passages are actually repeated word for word) underimagined and subpar effort. Like much of modern cinema, this novel substitutes excess for inspiration. And, I'm sure this was written with 'screenplay' in mind. I was very, very disappointed. Save your bucks for the film, which , and I don't say this often, has to be better than the book. Instead read: Dan Simmons or Robert McCammon for an adventure, horror, fantasy ride that never dips."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the beef?","review":"This is one of the worst books I've ever read....second only to the one I haven't read yet. Given that Mr. Harris had a decade to cook up this mess, he should be ashamed of himself. It took Joyce a decade to write \\"Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man\\". It took Harris that long to write an incoherant book with incomplete sentences, thoughts, and an ending that makes no sense at all!!! Where on earth is the editor who let this stuff pass??? And did Stephen King read the same book I did? Kathy Bates should make Harris rewrite this mess. After forcing myself to read \\"Hannibal\\", I was the one in Misery!!! Save your money and save a tree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man-Eating Pigs? Need I say more?","review":"Tsk, Tsk, Tsk! What a sad waste of an audience's attention; and a poor ending to interesting characters. The story line was so rediculous as to actually have succeeded in making me angry! Heaven forbid this should be made into a movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Thomas Wolfe have a STROKE?","review":"Harris attempts Wolfe-esque description of Florence, Dante, and Renaissance art... and falls completely flat. And I wasn't aware that Hannibal was the evil version of superman: faster than a speeding bullet, able to kill massive quantities of highly-trained professionals in a single swoop. Nor was I aware that Hannibal was the genetic recombination of James Bond and Dante. THIS BOOK IS COMPLETELY REDICULOUS AND WORTHLESS. Pull $20 our of your wallet and burn it... at least that way you will get your money's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I could not wait to read this book and now I wish I hadn't. It was a bad book. It is as simple as that - one bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starling Deserved Better!","review":"I'd like to give it minus stars, but I don't have a choice it seems. I too looked forward to this book and put everything down to begin reading it. I started it on a cross country plane trip -- not too bad. The middle was in the hotel the next night -- boring and pretty stupid. The end was the next night and I forced myself to stay awake to finish it -- I didn't believe it could end on such a disappointing note. And I wasn't wrong! It was worse! It was stupid and gratuitous. Harris was disrespectful of not only his readers who have been awaiting this sequel, but to Clarice and even Hannibal. They both deserved better than this foolish ending. I hope Harris doesn't plan another sequel -- and pray that Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins stay far far away from this bomb and embarrasment. I warned readers of the book I saw on the plane home not to waste their time."},{"rating":"1","title":"actually, ZERO stars","review":"As a huge fan of The Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, I felt guilty for hating this sequal as much as I do. I was sadly relieved that I was not alone in my disappointment. I'll try not to repeat the other reviewers' complaints except to stress how utterly stupid the ending was. The rest of the book was okay, tolerable, but definitely not up to the author's previous work. I hope that when the movie is made, Hollywood had the good sense to change the insulting and ridiculous ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Met MY standards...","review":"I thought the book was excellent, except for in some parts when some lines read like a play and the fact that Clarice Starling seemed a little to \\"brute-ish\\" and not as quiet and \\"nice\\" as she was in the original. I felt the ending was a nice shock, the scenes were good and vivid (yes, and quite sickening), and the characters were drawn nicely. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"enthralling","review":"i thought it was just wonderful. lecter is up to his old tricks and even a few new curves were thrown in. a definate read for those who enjoy this type of book"},{"rating":"2","title":"review reconsidered","review":"I read the book again and read the reader reviews, and there seems to be great controversy about Clarisse's character. The ending is still disturbing and hard to take, but readers who think Clarisse is a cardboard cutout at the end should reread those chapters again. It throws Lecter's villainy into higher relief, shows Clarisse can still match wits with Lecter, and sets up some very interesting possiblities for a sequel, if there is one. I agree, though, that it will be tough to bring this to the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"As a fan of Thomas Harris' previous books, I was excited to read his newest offering. I was very disappointed with this book, because it seemed like he was forced to write it. He introduces new characters in every chapter, but as a reader you never quite care for them. We know that they will eventually be Hannibal's victims. I was most disappointed with the ending and understand why Jodie Foster would not want to do the sequel. It is against her character and it seems that Harris didn't know how to end the book. It was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant, stylish, powerful.","review":"I must wonder what this book would seem like without having seen Silence of the lambs as a movie. The first chapter unfolds like a movie script, and images of Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster fill the places of Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling as the story progresses. So be it.I am not about to spoil your reading experience by revealing crucial plot details, but can (and will) say that this is a masterpiece of modern suspense writing. The gripping plot, the wonderfully elaborate characters, and the chance to look inside Hannibal Lecter's twisted genius mind are treats not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five stars, you got to be kidding me!","review":"I bought this book because I had read Black Sunday and wanted to experience the same feeling of suspence. No comparisons. Story apart, \\"Hannibal\\" is just poorly written. This book is simply terrible. Harris has no sense of pause or suspense; most chapters cut off at the wrong time. In addition, the dialogues are extremely poor, and the characters are shallow as shallow is the book. I love to read, so long as the material is readable. My advice? Do not waste your precious time and money to buy and read Hannibal."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow moving, with nonsensical violence","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. It drags on and on, with a hard-to-believe ending.Violence is used as a substitute for plot, and at times is so far out, that it's like watching professional wrestling.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it should be","review":"I found the bizarre violence to be an attempt by Harris to outdo his previous novels. He may have suceeded but it is not nearly as good as Red Dragon. The ending is disappointing and totally out of character for Clarice."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!! I'm sorry to say.....","review":"The book started off with good intentions with the drug bust and Ms. Starling being in the picture. I got totally confused ( and still do not understand ) what the storyline in Italy had to do with the rest of the book. The ending got better when we got back to the Starling and Hannibal interactions. The ending was an interesting twist that I don't think most readers were expecting. Overall, my long wait for Hannibal, and the time it took to get throught it, was a waste of time. I'll cross my fingers that maybe the movie will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harris Does Something Different","review":"I applaud Harris for resisting the temptation to rewrite Silence of the Lambs. The ending worked for me, in an appropriately creepy way."},{"rating":"1","title":"utterly disappointing","review":"I must say, considering the circumstances, this is the most utterly disappointing novel of the decade. Harris wrote one of the most interesting suspense novels ever with \\"The Silence of the Lambs,\\" which was turned into an equally compelling movie. He has worked on \\"Hannibal\\" for 11 years and this is what he has come up with? \\"Hannibal\\" starts off as an average book and ends up terrible. By the end, Harris ruins everything he has built up. Even Lecter, one of the most evil villains of our time, ends up degraded beyond repair, as he is given a history and morals. He is best suited as a minot character; his presence wears thin as he is in the spotlight. Need I mention how ludicrous the plot is? I pray that Harris brings his next novel out much faster and that he sticks to what he does best, creating a compelling serial killer and having Lecter help track him down. This will be a bestseller, but Harris may not be so fortunate next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prediction: It'll never be a film without huge revisions","review":"Tom, Tom, Tom, you've been grotesque before, but there was always something stimulating about the resolution of your tales. Not this time. We liked and rooted for the tortured Jack Crawford in \\"The Red Dragon,\\" and we loved and cheered on the vulnerable Clarice Starling in \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\" But there is nothing to like in this book. It's almost as if you decided to write something so throughly grotestque and depressing that Hollywood wouldn't dare touch your book. Hannibal Lecter was only interesting because he inspired the best from Jack and Clarice in their effort to outsmart him. Watching Lecter gobble up his adversaries is about as exciting as watching fishing - no matter how beautiful the setting and how exquisitely you describe the taste of the bait, it's still fishing. I am a huge fan of your other books, but this one fails so miserably, I was compelled to write."},{"rating":"1","title":"This took 11 years?","review":"As a big fan of Harris, I bought this the first day it came out. It kept me interested, though it also kept me confused, with the jumping between continents. I was looking for the solidarity of writing that he gave us in \\"Silence\\". My first impression upon finishing was that he had secretly finished this a year after the movie to \\"Silence\\" came out and kept it, because it felt rushed. Clarice isn't really developed, Crawford is thrown away, etc..It seems like he tries to shock us on every page, and it doesn't work. For me, \\"Silence\\" worked because it was a quiet book. This book practically screams at you. The writing is different, a different style that seems to work here, though the narrator pops in and out and makes it rather annoying since we don't know who it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the silliest endings I've ever read","review":"With his three previous novels, Harris had impressed me with his intelligent and genuinely scary stories. This one, however, disappointed me greatly. I won't give away the ending, but I have to say it was completely unbelievable, disappointing, and--I thought--insulting to readers who have been following some of these characters since Red Dragon. Maybe, it wasn't possible to out do Silence of the Lambs and remain plausible. Then why bother? The book starts and develops well, but fans of intelligent plotting and character development will feel cheated by the time they finish the book. I was also put off by Harris's playing with second person passages, which were too cute for a thriller. I regret the money I spent on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raises some interesting questions.","review":"I think people in general are accustomed to thinking of morality in \\"purely good versus purely evil\\" terms. Whether he intended to or not, Harris totally skewers this worldview. Dr. Lecter is a monster, yes, but he's a monster for a reason. And in Hannibal you'll find out what that reason is.\\"Anger presents as lust, lupus presents as hives,\\" said Dr. Lecter in Silence, and grief and horror present as murderous behavior. And can it be, at the end of Hannibal, that such a simple cure is possible for such a longtime affliction? Some of you might not think so. Perhaps even Harris was amazed at himself for writing such a thing. But as he said, sometimes you just have to let your characters go and do what they will, according to their own natures.Moral absolutists, people lacking imagination, and those of simple mind will not \\"get\\" or enjoy Hannibal. As for the rest of you, if you haven't already, I'd skip the movie and get the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"So twisted","review":"I like twisted love stories. This book was that and much more. I loved the first movie and didn't like the book, so I was kind of wondering about reading Hannibal.When I did I was glad. It took me about 3 hours to read it in. The ending was great....The movie, however, has a different ending.... The producers didn't buy the rights to the book, they just used the namses of the characters. I would say if you liked the book, don't go to the movie, but you will have to see it for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-Hit Wonder","review":"Thomas Harris definately had a \\"one hit wonder\\" with Silence of the Lambs. Hannibal has no suspense, is completely lacking in characters, and is basically a really bad story. If this actually does hit the big screen it will only be good if it is an entirely different story. I am amazed I actually finished the book, it was a complete disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"10 for artistic impression; 6 for technical merit","review":"This book definitely had a \\"first-draft\\" quality. However, I really liked the ending. Honestly, what was he to do with her once they left the barn? Drop her off at home and say \\"keep in touch\\"? I read the \\"Salon\\" synopsis before starting the book and predicted that Harris would take what sounded like a ludicrous plot and manage to pull it off--because he can write. I wasn't disappointed. Harris enjoyed writing this; it shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I read it.","review":"I read both \\"Red Dragon\\" and \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and very much enjoyed them. This book I thought about putting down half-way through and once I finished it, I wished I had. The writing isn't bad, it is the story line. I found nothing redeeming about it. It wasn't enjoyable, didn't end well, and just left me with a sick feeling in my stomach."},{"rating":"2","title":"great plot but lacks scientific background of previous books","review":"Hannibal is a quick read. It has a great plot and new interesting characters. It however lacks the scientific details that made Silence of the Lambs a great story and novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book read like one big book of cool cop terms.","review":"After almost 10 years since his last book, I sure expected alot more. More to the point, If an author is going to write about \\"cops\\" or law enforcement he should have one proof read it to see if cops really talk like that. He also needed better research, nobody referes to ATF as BATF, U.S. Marshals do not wear uniforms and unless you are a member of the FBI HRT team you do not carry a colt \\"cocked and locked\\" 45. After about three chapters of these inaccuracies and all the cop jargon one can handle I had to put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exceptional read...but not without flaws","review":"I loved this book! In a world so concerned with making sure that all stories have clearly delineated \\"good\\" and \\"evil,\\" it is so refreshing to find a book that operates above these limiting options. It seems to me that the point is not that Lecter is evil and Clarice is good, but rather that Lecter represents a force that stands outside our limited vision and notions of morality. Watching Clarice's (unfortunately too-quick and not-entirely-believable) transformation is thrilling precisely because we get to watch her emerge from the cocoon of her \\"traditionally moral\\" world and enter a world whose moral absolutes are not yet ours to understand (nor, for that matter, are they likely \\"absolute\\"). May her tastes (and her mentor's) continue to expand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stink, stank, stunk","review":"I guess I'm still trying to figure out the ridiculous ending to the book. Maybe I just don't get how this would ever happen. The story line up till the end was somewhat believable and at points graphically gory and morose, but I think Harris has been reading too many long-winded Steven King novels. There are a couple of parts of the book that were intense and worth reading a couple times over, but too many pages in between them.Although, Harris' the \\"Red Dragon\\" is still one of the best and most horrifying books I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"What does it take to be truly evil?","review":"Those expecting Dr. Lecter to be brought to justice get what they expect--but not in a form they're comfortable with. Harris asks us, \\"What is evil?\\" and the answers he comes up with have already made lots of people uncomfortable. There have already been more than 1,500 reviews at this site--just buy the damned book and know that whether you love it or hate it you've been witness to a cultural phenomenon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harris sells out...","review":"Let's face it...this novel is abominable. Lackluster plotting, half-baked characters, pathetic pacing, sophomoric narrative--this is a BAD novel. Harris' other novels were far better than this tripe. I only dread the upcoming hack-and-slash Hollywood film. Avoid this garbage; reread Harris' Red Dragon instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A beautifully written fizzer","review":"I have mixed emotions about this book. The fact I couldn't put it down meant it must have had some sort of resonant effect on me. However, the ending left me feeling completely deflated. It was as if the tight storyline had been torn apart like a rope suddenly breaking at its weakest point. All that was left were frayed edges and limp threads. Oh yes, in Australia we do not have quarters, the nearest value currency being twenty cents. I found that particularly disappointing as I took all of the Florentine detail on face value."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sad destruction of two great Characters","review":"What a dissapointment. After reading Harris's brilliant sirst two works, I expected a work at least on par with Red Dragon. While the first half of the book is a worthy attempt at plot, in the second half we witness the total destruction of both characters. While not spoiling the ending, it will surely leave fans of the series screaming \\"WHAT?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"swing and a miss","review":"Admire Mr. Harris for trying a twist ending- clearly not at all what was expected by fans of his earlier work. Unfortunately, the twist requires us to erase everything we know about HL and Starling. Starling, whose poor Appalachian background has been, shall we say, rather heavily emphasized in previous novels, suddenly, thanks to some hypnotic drugs, develops wealthy-snobbish affectations. Mastermind HL collapses, thanks to a narcotic dart, into a sappy sad-sack.All this is the disappointing conclusion of a rather tedious (although airplane-readable) ride through a crime potboiler.Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Another Silence of the Lambs","review":"Harris invited all of us who couldn't put down Silence to another Lecter story, but Hannibal isn't the bad guy this time. He is presented as charming, educated, and affluent. He is made out to be a victim. Harris wants you to like Hannibal, and after pages and pages of Lecter stroking you sort of can't help it. Herein lies the twisted irony of the work. Don't expect another Silence of the Lambs or Red Dragon. This one is out there, and definitely worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I suppose I should have expected the sick images; I knew who the book was about. But what I didn't expect was the ridiculous departure in character by Clarice. Chalking it up to being drugged and hypnotized was weak. Her end was totally out of character and unbelievable. The only reason I didn't give the book only one star is that it fully kept my attention throughout. The suspense was good. But as I finished it, I almost regretted wasting my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beauty and the Beast?","review":"Promising beginning. Harris fleshes out Lecter's character (no pun intended) and gives the reader details about the thorns in Lecter's paws. As the book moves along, Harris slowly diminishes Starling and turns this formerly by-the-rules FBI agent into a renegade who gives up everything for her monster. Near the end of the book, Harris switches genres and begins to write fantasy..and poor fantasy at that because there appear to be no rules. The ending of this book is incredibly disappointing. One can find absolutely no basis for it anywhere in the tale of the relationship between Lecter and Starling. Lecter and Starling are totally unrecognizable characters as the book winds down. Harris has the talent and imagination to have written an ending worthy of his readers and of his two main characters...sadly, he chose to turn the strong and intelligent Starling into a simpering fool and to end a fairly interesting novel with a cheap trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jodi, you were right.","review":"I understand that Jodi Foster turned down a mega bucks offer to play Clarice Starling again for the movie version of this book. What a smart lady!I had a really hard time getting through this trash unlike my daughter who was smart enough to just not finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Disappointing Effort for 10 Long Years of Writing!","review":"Don't bother buying this book if you liked the other Thomas Harris books. It is not even remotely like his others. The creative juices must have dried up! It has a few moments of clarity, but was largely muddled and confused! The ending is the absolute worst I have ever read. It will need a lot of work to make it on the big screen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No value here -","review":"This is a sick stupid souless piece of garbage. When I finished it I threw it in the garbage can. God help the fools who find anything redeeming in this evil, meaningless, trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Harris should be ashamed of himself","review":"This is not a sequel to \\"Silence,\\" it is a crude joke. He's taken Starling and regressed her instead of building on her character. She speaks in Catskill twang through most of the book. Lecter is now one of these bad guys who only kills really bad people, or people trying to steal his wallet. Or people trying to catch him. Whatever happened to devouring census takers? He's not truly bad, now, in fact, the reader gets a cuddly personal history of Lecter which explains why he became so bad, darnit! It wasn't his fault! Some bad guys did bad things, and made Lecter bad! Mommy! I'm bad now! A misfire on every conceivable level, staring with the first chapter. So disappointing...so sad. Lecter is almost superhuman, does this guy work out or what? The ending will leave your mouth agape. Agape at the horror of what Harris could have been possibly thinking when he scribbled this missive on paper. Abominable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending is the only good part!!!!","review":"I think Harris was trying to go against everybodys expectations w/ the ending and hey I was really bored until the last 3 chapters.

If anyone can explain the last 30 pages I would be greatful...."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's gone overboard with descriptive horror.","review":"In his previous novels, it was just horrific enough to keep you turning the pages to see what could possibly happen next, but this book just goes over the edge. You don't have the chance to use your imagination because it's all written out for you. After waiting so long for this book, I am sorry to say that I am disappointed, and a bit sick to my stomach. Mr. Harris gives out \\"too much\\" information this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have just re-read is other books.","review":"Hannibal was probably the most awaited book sequel that I couldn't miss. However, it was also my biggest disapointment...re-read \\"Silence\\" for the thrill and skip this one altogether...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have done without Italy","review":"Very disappointed. The Red Dragon was 100% better. The parts in Italy were just much to long and detailed. Hope the movie is more moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Ending!!!","review":"I thought the book was very good until the last 50 pages. If the book would have ended with a climax at the Muskrat Farm, I would have been very satisfied. As it is, i was very disappointed in the ending...very dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOOK OF THE YEAR !!!","review":"It amazes me how totally divided readers' opinions are when it comes to HANNIBAL, but people just won't stop talking about it.

This book will be almost impossible to film, Mamet or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"It lives up to the expectations.","review":"Although not as good as \\"Silence of the Lambs,\\" \\"Hannibal\\" is an incredibly thoughtful and interesting story. It is fast paced and unpredictable right down to the shocking yet believable ending. To all those who complain about the gore, what else would you expect from a novel about a cannibal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deliciously Written right down to the end!","review":"I am very pleased with Harris' Hannibal. As the book is based on the desires of a human cannibal, Harris managed to take the most believable route. It can be taken for the obvious that a book about a cannibal is going to be bloody and gory, i don't understand why eveyone is so surprised. For once though, I do think the movie may be more satisfying than the book. So many times while i was reading i pictured this on the big screen and i got the chills. iIt was hard to get the full effect of the last chapter without seeing the phsical setting Harris had pictured. Overall i am impressed with both the plot and outcome of this book. Each time i read it i couldn't wait to come back for seconds!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissappointing","review":"Mr Harris, Jonathan Demme is right. Do yourself a favor and let him make the necessary changes if you want the film of this dissappointing book to be successful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Controversial !!","review":"Why write a thousand word essay when a few simple words will suffice ? This book is self-indulgent drooling hardly worthy of a writer of Robert Harris' stature. Do yourself a BIG favor and avoid Hannibal. Read something just as riveting but not as stupid, like one of the fine new Stephen King books, or that towering Second World War novel, THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY. Or if you absolutely insist upon reading Harris, read SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, not this sewage called Hannibal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Slow and Predictable","review":"Unfortunately, Mr. Harris has elected to demystify Hannibal Lecter by completely changing his behavior and offering a childhood trauma to explain his psyche. It's quite disappointing and removes the fantastical horror of his previous books. However, it seems to be the fashionable thing to do because Starling also completely changes character, enabling a most predictable and entirely uncompelling ending. Other characters are poorly developed and make obviously foolish decisions which only serve the purpose of positioning them to be dispatched in a gory fashion. Darwinism, I suppose, but it makes for a tedious and uninteresting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nasty joke - and it's on us","review":"Unfortunately, those before me have pretty much summed up all that is wrong with this thing, from cardboard characters, to rambling plot lines, to some seriously questionable editing. But enough about this book; now we have to fret about the film! What amazes me is that 'Hollywood' has already paid millions for the film rights, but I understand Mr. Demme has already passed on this impossible directing job. Let's just hope the actors who gave us such a sublime thriller in 'Silence' will take flight from whatever one could possibly conjure in trying to transfer this to celluloid. And by the way: have you noticed how most of the critics have bought this Emperor's 'new clothes'?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Course of a Three Course Meal!","review":"Just like a gourmet dinner, Harris has prepared a three course meal, saving the best for dessert. Hannibal, the book, is immensely satisfying because it ends the only way it should. A reading of the first two installments leads you to question exactly who is the monster here. Harris answers it beautifully in this very good read. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get what I expected!","review":"I'm truly dissapointed with the change in Clarice Starling. It is not believable, and it leaves me unsatisfied, as thought the last hundred pages were written under pressure of a deadline, or the author just got tired of the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on you, Thomas Harris","review":"You took a complex and courageous female protagonist and reduced her to the kind of vacuous heroine normally found in supermarket romance novels. This was still a great read, and I appreciate the attempt to explore the dynamics of the intimacy between Lecter and Starling, but the outcome was very disappointing. Maybe you were shooting for \\"Heart of Darkness\\" but this ending is more like depraved Danielle Steele.I, too, have been a fan of yours for over 20 years, and pre-ordered this book. I will not make the same mistake on your next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grade: F","review":"I haven't even quite finished this novel and I am so disappointed. Besides the graphic grammatical errors and shifts from past to present tense (and the sudden intrusion of the \\"You\\" voice every couple chapters) he has Clarice Starling wondering if her black roommate will be mad because she shot a black woman who was trying to kill her. Wow, there's a man with a firm grasp of complex psychology. What would have been interesting was if there was some REASON she would feel that way. As it stands, it just makes her look like a fool. Which is how I felt spending money on this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"A warning to the open-minded","review":"Even if you are a fan, as I am, of Harris' previous two books, recognize that this is a NEW book. Time has passed since SOTL; characters evolve (sometimes not in ways we think they should or would -- life is like that). And they have done so absent our scrutiny and consent.Harris has written a flawed book (damn, a bit like life again). It has some characters that are the equivalent in irritation to Jar-Jar Binks. It has an ending that will polarize his fans.But, this book is the real deal. Read it in one sitting, at most two. Start early in the evening. If you can, have someone nearby who can help you decompress. This book is disturbing -- not necessarily because it is gruesome, though it surely is, but because, in its dark caves and cloisters, it is uncannily like life."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Extraordinary Novel","review":"This is an amazing novel. It is certainly not a typical thriller, nor a typical anything else, for that matter. It is an extraordinary look into, second, the brilliant-but-awesomely-warped mind of Hannibal Lecter, and, first, some of the lives he changed.Don't allow yourself to be put off by these 'one star' reviewers. This book is not a 'mess.' The characters are always at least interesting, and many of them are fascinating. One or two are even likable. They don't always behave in an obvious manner, but neither do they act 'out of character.'This book more than most \\"thrillers\\" requires of its readers imagination and intelligence. As the author says, \\"This is not a reflective age.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Why the disappointment???","review":"It is hard to understand why so many have found the ending to be a disappointment. The ending was shocking and certainly unexpected, which in my opinion makes the book that much better. Wouldn't things get boring if every book ended the way we \\"expected\\" it to end? I am glad Mr. Harris chose to throw us a huge curve ball. Although the descriptions of Florence slow the story down at times, Hannibal is a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed emotions","review":"My feelings are mixed. At times I was disturbed and wondered what the point was. Then as Hannibal himself began to unfold, I began to see what the draw was between him and Starling. I fully expected her to save him and I figured he'd take her but I never guessed the ending !! And yet it was somehow correct ! I admit to being disappointed that it did not have the thrill of the first two reads. But I accept it for what it is and the role it plays in the story of Hannibal Lecter. My question is where do they go from here ? Or is it impossible to move forward now ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could rate it in the negatives I would!","review":"I have read a lot of books in my time and I can say without hesitation that Hannibal likely ranks as one of the worst ever. Non-existant editing and totally ridiculous from start to finish. This is the only book in memory that I actually wanted to either throw out or burn! If you have not read anything by Thomas Harris forget this one and read Red Dragon or SOL.

Yet, quickly into Hannibal, I found myself turning pages without even having read them. One gets the true feeling that this is not a novel, but a Hollywood screenplay going for the big bucks of mainstream blood and guts with little or no imagination. It was painful to watch two such intricate characters become so predictible. Even I with little or no creativity, could figure out many of the plot lines in this \\"L\\"oser. Though I loved revisiting the beautiful Florence, and still found Lecter's mind to be interesting, the hypnotic, frightening edge is gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I get an ending, please?","review":"Harris falls prey to the Grisham school of writing: compile 500 pages of build up and then just throw in an ending, knowing all the while that a screenplay writer will put more effort towards creating a palatable ending.As evidenced by this very disapointing work, Harris just took the money and ran. The only good news, paperbacks are cheap..."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like the genre of Stephen King, read Stephen King","review":"...Gone are the beautiful metaphors that littered his previous works... In the whole book of 'Hannibal' I found only one phrase that was worth noting...I will think very seriously before I read anything of his again...If I'd wanted to be grossed out by banal horror I'd have read a Stephen King. He has made that genre his own and has a particular genius for it. 'Hannible' was a pale, shadowy copy and nothing more. There were some great ideas there waiting to be developed but he chose to...go for the cheap thrill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer of a book, Hal.","review":"This book had me as its captive audience on a trans-Atlantic plane flight.

Oh God... this is a blatant romance and melodrama, served as a splatterpunk dish with a glass of gore. It does not approach the mastery of Red Dragon. It is not even as good as Silence of the Lambs - it is simply a bad novel. Eleven years of waiting for THIS?????"},{"rating":"1","title":"STUPID. REALLY, REALLY STUPID.","review":"Anyone who has somehow convinced themselves that this is a brilliant novel need to get some rest and really expensive therapy, because Hannibal reeks. \\"Stones From the River\\" is a great novel. \\"The Triumph and the Glory\\" is a great novel. Out of the approximately 1,300 novels released in the last month or so, EVERY LAST ONE of them is better than Hannibal. It has nothing one could remotely define as a plot. It glorifies depravity and mocks the greatness of its progenitor, Silence of the Lambs. Robert Harris should be ashamed to have his name on the cover of this sorry collection of incoherent paragraphs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book ever Written by A former great Author","review":"Thomas Harris sighted the ball, dropped it, and punted. This book is so poorly constructed it read like it was written in a week. Unlike his other books, Hannibal is totaly predicatible, totally overblown, and without any redeeming value whatsoever. This may be the low point of American publishing. Where was the editor? Where was the author. Thomas Harris had no desire to write, and this book shows how deep that antipathy went. He ought to have spent his time reviewing Italian hi-end consumer products for magazines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about dropping the ball.....","review":"I am sure by the time you see this review you vill be very aware that something is terrible amiss with Mr. Harris. The pressure to produce must have been enormous. This was the most unsatisfactory ending I can remember ever reading. Poor Agent Starling!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully and genuinely disturbing","review":"Well, what can I say? I bought it on the way home from work June 8 and finished it by eleven that night. I could do without the Florentine travelogue section, but by and large I felt replete. The prose has taken on a new looseness and sinuosity. The ending is a shocker with psychological infrastructure to legitimize it. It is genuinely, deliciously disturbing. Reading the bad reviews of this book make me aware of how we have changed since the 1970s, the decade from which I get my basic mindset -- there are a bunch of squeamish, political-correctness-shackled souls out there. This book may not be for them, but I am sent by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"won't keep you up at night, that's for sure","review":"Finished this book last night, and it was a real disappointment. If only one hadn't had to wait 11 years for the follow up to Silence. If Harris would have been pumping out a book every two years, one could forgive him this yawn-fest. Implausable and suspenseless. Sure, some exquisite gastro-intestinal touches. But I was hoping I'd be really doing some stomach-lurching and squirming reading this novel - as it was it was a real let down.As for Stephen King's review in the NYT Book Review (whose reviews are usually very kind to begin with): don't believe the hype. King's review is way too kind and he should know better."},{"rating":"1","title":"a massive disappointment","review":"Thomas Harris may perhaps be forgiven for falling in love with Hannibal Lecter, the character who made him a multi-millionaire. But the rest of us have no such excuse. Feeding someone his own brains is merely disgusting; it does not constitute true horror fiction. Harris falls into the trap of allowing his readers too much access to the mind of Hannibal Lecter, a narratological strategy that inevitably brings understanding and elicits a certain amount of sympathy for the \\"good\\" doctor. But such understanding and sympathy are totally misplaced here. Red Dragon remains harris' masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"In love!","review":"I was very pleased with the book! I have read all the other Hannibal books. I love the way this one ended! By far one of the best reads I've had in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible disappointment","review":"I waited with bated breath for this book to show up. I was ready to have my nerves tingle as with _The Silence of the Lambs_. And it did, for the first 3/4 of the book. And the last part of the book ruined the whole durn thing. I can't even go back and read _Silence..._ again because of it.I applaud Jodie Foster for her integrity in not repeating her role as Clarice because of what Harris did with her in this novel. I'm sorry I paid the cover price for it, it was such a disappointment. Shame on you, Mr. Harris."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grimmest, most depressing ending I have ever read","review":"I will not upset the one or two people who haven't read this book but still want to by giving it away. Suffice that I understand entirely why the film ending is different, that I threw it out after finishing it and advised friends and acquaintances not to read it, and think Mr Harris needs help if he thinks this was an appropriate ending for a lead like Clarice Starling. If we want to see evil win we have only to look out the window; in fiction I prefer to have some hope left to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannibal is Horrible","review":"This book has no redeeming qualities. It is grotesque, stomach-turning, and obscenely graphic. I liked \\"Silence of the Lambs,\\" but Harris should have stopped there and spared us all the misery of Hannibal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will haunt you and disturb your dreams for years to come","review":"If you found \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" disturbing, gruesome and horrifying, you haven't read anything yet. Steel yourself for this one. \\"Hannibal\\" has all the horror elements of its predecessor but this time dips even more deeply into the psyche of the good Dr. Lecter, which of course is not the most pleasant place to visit in the first place. We also discover that the valiant Clarice Starling has a darker side than previously shown, and the cruel and brutal forces which push her there create some of the more tense and anxiety-ridden sections of the book. The most fearsome horrors of the novel (and there are plenty) pale in comparison to the shock of the ending, which will probably cause fierce debates among Thomas Harris' readers and create more than a few problems when it's time for \\"Hannibal\\" to go to Hollywood. Well worth the read (I polished it off in one day, I couldn't help it) but be prepared."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Strange","review":"This book is very strange. It is nothing like \\"Red Dragon\\" or \\"Silence of the Lambs\\". The ending is very strange. I wont give it away here. It also gives insights into Lecter's past. The tension of his other novels are absent from this one but what this book lacks in suspense it makes up for in wierdness. The only part I didn't like was when Harris talked for several pages about some painting or something. But this is a very good that horror fans should read."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"After reading the glowing King review in the Times, I was expecting a harrowing and wonderful ride. Instead I was bored. Most of the characters were 2 dimensional caricatures -- cartoon villains. Lecter and Starling had a bit more depth, but the story around them was so weak that I felt sorry they were trapped in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got my money's worth despite the ending.","review":"The story line and detail kept me reading past my bedtime more than once. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book. However, I had to backtrack several times to be sure that \\"last meal\\" was not some sort of hallucination or dream sequence. I can't say that I \\"believed\\" or agreed with much of the last chapters. However it WAS a different and gutsy ending, and I'm NOT sorry I bought the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good read, but not worth the wait.","review":"Although Hannibal is an interesting book, it seems Harris made a conscious effort to put forth a book that will be next to impossible to make into a movie. Harris should have used an editor on this one as his ramblings about Lecter's shopping are just too monotonous. Starling grows from the assertive, strong female lead to a weak doll, easily manipulated by Lecter. Women should be furious that Harris has turned her into a sap! I dare someone to make this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment...","review":"... and what an illiterate piece over-hyped trash. To fans of Harris' previous novels (as I am), you'd be wise to skip this one. It's dull, inexplicably gruesome, poorly edited (there's a mistake on practically every page), and betrays us (and our beloved heroine) with a scene so outlandish and out-of-place at the very end that the book borders on the unforgivable. Eleven years for this? For shame, Mr. Harris... for shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a spoof on silence of the lambs, right?","review":"I wouldn't give away this book. Literally. I wouldn't want the receiver of my gift to think I would condone such a horrible display of literary talent. Gang members? Inplausible media reactions? Man hungry farm animals? Is this guy kidding? The same plot, different parchment. It was obvious that Harris rushed to get \\"Hannibal\\" published. I think maybe he should have stopped on \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" instead of trying to write a trilogy. Some moments of the book were dull and exhaustive. I skimmed atleast 2 entire chapters in the book and did not miss a single arm movement in the plot. Harris made it all to obvious that he was trying to \\"shock\\" the reader. Without sounding completely cruel and mean, I will end on this note. I want my money back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunted by wondering","review":"I just finished listening to the unabridged audio version of HANNIBAL, and have been haunted for 2 days now. The story was not so much a sequel, but an explanation of all you wondered and supsected about Hannibal since he was first introduced in THE RED DRAGON. You finally begin to understand what makes him tick, and by this understanding, you become frightened at how much you can respect and relate to this monster. Many friends have told me that they hated the conclusion/ending of this book, but I believe Thomas Harris had it just right. It absolutley had to result in the path he chose for Clarice and Hannibal.. We all had to see it coming, and frightening thought it was, it was perfect. I highly recommend the unabridged audio version to all who cannot wait to see the movie.. The narrator will send chills down your spine , and the supsense is unbelievable.. Good work Thomas.. I look forward to hearing what may come next...."},{"rating":"1","title":"10 yrs in the making and needs another 10","review":"Harris takes his time in a novel to get it write. Deep, dark, strange, his previous novels were \\"all nighters\\", difficult to put down. On Hannibal, the money got to him. Pressure from editors and big money from movie producers. He has his price. The 1st half is absorbing. The 2nd half was a quick write. Logically not connected. Characters manipulated for a screen play versus a good novel. The money got impatient and Harris got sloppy and pleasing. The result, a unbelievable, illogical mess that could use a good rewrite before the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"hollywood better change the ending","review":"enjoyed most of the book (+ 4 stars), until the last 40 pages (- 3 stars). i'll pass the book along, after i rip those pages out. otherwise, forget about it. i heard jodie won't play the part, now i understand why."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've never been so disappointed...","review":"As I read the book I was constantly plagued by the weak writing and unbelievable events that happened in the story. There were many occasions that I had to read and re-read sentences or whole paragraphs to decypher the words, there were several times when I was unsuccessful.It was only by sheer force of will that I was able to finish the book. Once I had swallowed my disbelief and realized how Harris was going to end this waste of time I had to force myself to keep reading. I now look back at those 15 minutes as 15 minutes that I will never get back. When I consider the other ways I could have spent that time I am saddened. I could have used that time to clean a cats litter box and encounter better literature.If you feel you truly MUST read about Hannibal make sure it's the one with the elephants and not the unbelievable wet literary noodle in this collection of words. (I can't bring myself to call it a novel.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well done","review":"Overall, this book was rather disappointing. The story has a very disjointed kind of feel to it. I suspect that the author wrote the middle section first and then tried to build the story around it. While the structure is lacking, the actual writing is pretty good. I agree with the other reviewer who said: \\"good storyteller; bad story.\\" I was also disappointed by the lame attempt to try and soften Hannibal's psychopathy by providing a \\"reason\\"--childhood trauma, of course. I thought this weakened the character instead of giving him depth (as, I suspect, was the intention). Despite these flaws, the writing was good enough to keep me reading. The ending, however, was utterly stupid. I won't spoil it but you'll see what I mean if you get there.I say \\"if\\" because I wouldn't recommend this book.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Disappointment","review":"This book didn't even come close to anything near my expectations. I saw the movie when it first came out and when taken independently, the movie was mediocre at best. When it's pointed out that this is remotely related to Silence of the Lambs, the movie was a complete waste of time. The book is completely different, at the end I was shaking my head in total disbelief. Not like \\"I can't believe it.\\" but more like \\"Completely implausible, yeah, right.\\"I didn't think the characters were fully rounded and there was no depth in Hannibal this time.Not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book ever?","review":"I think this 'book' can be considered the worst ever written. How does one explain this? Thomas Harris' previous novels are as good as the genre has to offer (particularly 'Silence of the Lambs'). But I am convinced that Harris was kidnapped while writing 'Hannibal'. Those who read the first two books cannot recognize the same author here. 'Hanibal' is vulgar and not just because of the content. Whereas 'Silence' had layers of suspense, there is none here. 'Silence' had some psychological and philosophical things to offer but 'Hannibal' doesn't pretend to do anything of the kind. The book is creepy instead of scary, nauseating instead of thrilling. No wonder most of the cast and crew of 'Silence' didn't want to be a part of 'Hannibal' as a movie. Just an awful, awful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please recycle","review":"Throwing a book away, literally putting it in the trash along with the cat food cans and rotten tomatoes, is taboo. If a small but imperious voice in my head had not kept repeating \\"you don't throw books away\\", that is where my copy of Hannibal would be. Buried in some gigantic rubbish heap, or at the most, shredded for pulp. It may still get there - selling it back to my favourite used book store would be contributing to the spread of garbage in the world. Most thrillers have some redeeming value in their versions of the modern-day fight between Good and Evil. Not this one. Rich faceless sadistic paralysed child-abusing animal-abusing ex-torturer pursues Hannibal the cannibal, aided and abetted by various sickos armed with experienced man-eating pigs. People end up gutted and brains get eaten. This is the kind of read that makes you feel dirty. I'm not proud of having finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"EWWWWW!","review":"This book got increasingly repulsive, both in terms of content and of style. Harris's skills have become a parody of themselves as he indulges in every kind of flowery speech. And there's not one likeable character here, especially poor Clarice Starling. The ending of the book is thoroughly disgusting and almost painful.Do not read this. Wait for the movie, as a lot of what happens, like the first time around, will be cut out."},{"rating":"1","title":"what was harris smoking?","review":"Harris did not write this book. If he did he had better hang it up. this was one of the worst I have ever read. the only reason I gave it one star is because you would not except a Zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally ruins the great characters created in Silence...","review":"I was very excited to read this book, since I enjoyed Silence of the Lambs so much. The book starts out well, has some luls, but ultimately kept my attention in what would happen next. However, Harris must have given up at the end, writers block maybe? It was sick, twisted, and demented so much so it made me sick to my stomach. In Silence, the dementia was at least believable. In Hannibal, it went off the deep end and instantly turned all the books to garbage. I truly don't believe Foster and Hopkins will sink to the level Harris has given what was a fascinating story by making the movie. There's something to be said for \\"quitting while you are ahead\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most vile book I've ever read.","review":"I had been eagerly awaiting the sequel to Harris' Silence of the Lambs. Unfortunately, magic doesn't strike twice. Hannibal is a vile, disturbing sequel with gruesome plots of revenge at the heart of the plot. I also had trouble with the depiction of several characters, who were extremely over the top in their characterizations. Finally, without revealing the ending, it simply did not ring true in any way, shape or form. Clarice becomes unrecognizable, and thus unbelievable. Boo hiss to the author for letting us down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading.","review":"Harris should have quit with Silence Of The Lambs. Hannibal is very poorly done, the writing of substandard quality, the characters just not credible. Starling comes off as an incompetent nitwit, Lecter is not credible in any sense of the word, the plodding quality of the book is unbearable. The ending is just juvenile, in fact, the whole book seems like one that would cater to a juvenile audience. After reading 100 pages I skipped to the last chapter to end the agony, but it didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep The Lights On!!!","review":"Don't read this book at night or you may want to leave a light on! Thomas Harris has written a third book about Dr. Hannibal Lecter and this one is the most intriguing. I found it hard to believe that there was someone creepier than Hannibal Lecter but Mason Verger is worse. Clarice Starling has more depth in this book and the plot twists around her and several new characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame!","review":"I saw the movie and I read the book. I preferred the movie's ending because it kept the integrity of Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling intact. I appreciated that. Something was lost in 'Hannibal'. Nothing seemed to hold together. It was too surreal; too vague."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh So JUICY!","review":"Hannibal is just what it should be -- a very entertaining thriller. Yet there is such depth of character in these books, this is not your average paperback. The sick and twisted eating habits of Dr.Lecter just make the interaction between him and Agent Starling a little more interesting and complex. Dr. Lecter has some issues, but don't we all? He is a great \\"antihero\\" and I wish there was another book to read about him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannibal","review":"I am an avid crime/mystery reader and thought that since I enjoyed the movie Silence of the Lambs that I would enjoy this new book. This book could barely hold my attention! It read like a movie script - I am sure that the author thought he could save some time in doing both a novel and a screen play at the same time! What a disappointment - I now have no desire to see the movie as the book failed to \\"capture\\" me. Such a dissappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gruesome","review":"I like a gory book for the sake of scariness; however, this book was just silly and gross. I was so disappointed. My advice - skip this, and read Red Dragon if you haven't already."},{"rating":"1","title":"The true horror came in the time I wasted reading it","review":"This book starts off strong, like a fine bottle of Dr Lecter's best Chianti. As I closed the first chapter, I felt for sure I was in for a breath-taking ride. But as the pages peeled by, and I descended further into the mind of Hannibal and Starling - and their morally bankrupt support characters - the book became a progressively bigger disappointment. The last 50 pages left me annoyed that such great characters as Hannibal and Starling could be dealt with so ludicrously by their creator. My advice? Read the first chapter over and over again, and feed the rest to the pigs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes","review":"Don't waste your time. If you are looking for suspence, character integrity, and entertainment, you shouldn't look to Hannibal. The narratives are long winded, the characters are flat, and the plot unbelievable.

I was so sorry to have wasted the money on a hardcover book. Chapters 86-94 were somewhat reminiscent of the suspense of Silence. In my opinion, the rest of the book was very boring, and the ending was simply silly. It felt like most of the book was a way for Harris to show off his knowledge of expensive things and arcane trivia. BORING!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It took 10 years to come up with THIS?","review":"After finishing the book, I thought about throwing it against the wall I was so mad. The ending seems thrown together at the last minute, which, considering the fact Harris took 10 years between books, is ridiculous. The action was not as violent as I had expected it to be, but is still pretty graphic. The details of Italian history were both entertaining and educational. Overall, not a horrible read but likely a disappointment to Harris fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minimally interesting but flawed","review":"Without a doubt, the action scenes in Florence were the best parts of the book. The BIGGEST FLAW in the plot was that the author never gave a reason why Clarice and the FBI KNEW that Hannibal Lecter was coming to the U.S. after he had to leave Florence! After all, he could have gone to Brazil, Asia, Europe other, etc. There was never a reason given for him to come to the U.S."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he thinking?","review":"I read this book to the very end looking for a good plot, a hero I could relate to, or a victim I could pull for. How dissapointing! Did Mr. Harris think it was the gore and evil characters that made Silence of the Lambs a great story? I was totally insulted by the ending. I've never thrown away a book but I can't even give this one a place on my book shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give this one a pass","review":"It's a shame that a man as obviously talented as Thomas Harris would waste his time writing a piece of filth like this. This is a corner of the soul that no one needs to view. His characters and dialogue are well drawn, but his subject matter is depraved, to say the least. There is nothing redeeming about this book. And there is certainly nothing entertaining. Don't waste your money. I threw my copy in the trash after about 60 pages. I doubt that any intelligent person would want to pollute their mind with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a disturbing and sensual ride...","review":"Most everyone who liked this book summed up my feelings, except for the ending. I loved the ending and don't want to see anyone BUT Hopkins and Foster reprise their rolls. Hopkins is the PERFECT Hannibal Lecter...his blending of grace and madness...just perfect!! And Foster's Starling would be interesting to see...the strong but fragile woman turning to this \\"monster\\" for companionship! I just love it! But alas, I don't think the movie-going public is ready to actually \\"see\\" this ending. We're too immature to appreciate it's beauty. But I can dream...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, Except for the Ending","review":"I enjoyed Hannibal, until the ending, which I found preposterous. The ending is nonsense, and ruined a great book. I described to a friend, who found it so ludicrous he immediately accused me of making it up.

I enjoyed \\"Silence of the Lambs,\\" but have found numerous problems with the (money-inspired) sequel.The unending violence which Harris throws at the reader quickly becomes numbing. Dr. Lecter could take America out to dinner, but leave the reader a disinterested specator.Also, his prose approaches the atrocious.

Let Me Count the Ways.","review":"This long-swaited sequel to the masterful book and movie \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" is even better than the original. His creation of Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling has become a category all its own; this book moves way beyond the horror/suspense genre and into the realm of literature.Readers who love wording will savor this book. More than any popular author, Thomas Harris creates scenes and moods with an economy of words that is mesmerizing. There are passages in this book that are like poetry in their rhythym and cadence.You can predict what the book is about. Without giving anything away, I can say that the hunt for Hannibal Lecter continues. What you can't predict is the bizarre and surreal ending. You will emerge from the last 30 pages as if from a dream. It's a shame that we may have to wait another 10 years for a sequel.This is a masterpiece. BUY IT and keep it. People will still be reading this book 50 years from now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get thee to thine bookstore","review":"Left wanting more from The Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal arrives complete with a quasi-fleshing out of Doctor Lecter. The reader descends into the depths of Harris' mind, and there finds an even more vile creature than Lecter, namely Mason Verger. Complete with the requisite scars from his prior meeting with the good doctor, Harris creates Verger as the perfect antagonist. This novel escapes from the pedestal of five stars only because we are left wanting to know more about Lecter. Harris has an exquisite talent for creating ambiance and his knowledge of Florence, Italy adds accurate detail to the reader familiar with this region. Enough said.

Boy, was I fooled! Harris has the disease of all researchers: I must write and publish every little thing I learned while researching and writing this book. Way too long in places but that's not the worst of it. The ending abandoned the characterizations of Starling and Hannibal set forth from \\"Silence.\\" It's no wonder Jodie Foster does not want to play the part: I would not either and I don't blame her. If you still want to read this book, get the abridged tape. It'll save you some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even fans should be disgusted by his laziness","review":"The only thing I'm disappointed with is that I couldn't give this book a negative rating; this has got to be the WORST book I've ever read. Skip any superficial observation about the material - Harris was plainly writing a treatment for a screenplay, and fell prey to narcolepsy after the introduction. The reader should be so lucky - gone are little bonuses like internal dialog, character development or believable plot, and left in place is the most juvenile, amateurish parody of Harris' own writing.Read Red Dragon again, and steal a copy of the movie when it comes out on video cassette - don't waste any money encouraging this type of Hollywood-fueled minimal effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable!","review":"I still find it hard to believe this was written by the sameauthor as purportedly it was. The characters have not evolved... aucontraire, they are cardboard and boring. Hannibal Lecter gets a pastthat justifies his brilliant evil mind and automatically negates everything that he [T. Harris] painstakingly set up on \\"Silence...\\" and \\"Red Dragon\\".Never had I witnessed such a painful and degrading change in a loved Character as Clarice M Starling.An unbelievable disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This book was a disappointment. The author treated Starling's character badly. I kept slogging through it, hoping it would get better, but it did not. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly Disappointed","review":"I consider this book to be confusing. Too many new characters I can't relate with, maybe because I did not read Silence of the Lambs, I saw the movie. I have had to go back to re-read chapters because I am lost. The book has gore it's just not what I expected. I am very diappointed. I was expecting more. I would not recommend this read to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointed!","review":"I really was disappointed with this book. I found it lesssuspenseful and just more shocking than Silence of the Lambs. And theending was absolutely ludicrous. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"About as bad as it gets!","review":"I hadn't read a piece of fiction in several years. Because most novels are so weak. When I read that the third installment of the Hannibal Lecter trilogy was coming out this summer I got really excited. Since I had enjoyed both Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs in my fiction reading days. After reading Hannibal I'm going back to fiction. I don't have time to waste on this c**p!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Bruce Willis?","review":"This book is a big disappointment. The Silence of the Lambs was not great art, but it was a good beach read. Hannibal is neither. The plot has predictable action-movie sequences, and the prose reads like a script treatment for a film. Honestly, I'm surprised Harris just didn't admit that he wrote this for the big Hollywood bucks, and stick in \\"camera pans left,\\" \\"fade in to cheesy overhead shot of Rome, with tourists,\\" etc. That would have been a lot more honest of him. Skip the book and wait for the Bruce Willis blockbuster. Also, I just read in the paper that this book is going be made into a film starring Jodie Foster and Sarah Michelle Gellar. So there you go. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harris, DO NOT ever read your own books, PLEASE!","review":"Big Disappointment. Unless a Mississippi native trains extensively with a phoneticist in acting class, he has no business reading this kind of writing. Sure, your Italian is passable, nothing out of the common way; but how can you disappoint us after the brilliance of Kathy Bates's reading Silence? You are a great writer, but not a good reader. All of the suspense is lost on your provincial, run-of-the-mill, southern accent. You should have asked John Lithgow, or Ed Bagley, Jr, or Ms. Bates again."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty disappointing","review":"I approached this book with an open mind but came away thoroughly disappointed. It started when the author used gratuitous sexual references for no point at all. I expected the bloodiness, and was intrigued by getting behind Clarice and Hannibal's thoughts, but basically, the plot never seized me like Red Dragon (which I read in one day) or Silence. There are many other ways this could have played out, but the ghastly gruesome ending made it seem like the author had no other plot in mind, so he tried to gross us all out. And Starling's sinking to such levels, I am sorry, was just not believable, not at all. Unfortunately, the author has left us the possibility of yet another sequel. I wish he had stopped after Silence if this is the best he could offer. Thoroughly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second time lucky","review":"I only enjoyed Hannibal on the second read. After loving Silence of the Lambs and red Drago, I found the first reading quite disturbing. One imagines that Mr Harris is quite a troubled person. I basically had to skim through to miss out the truely horrible sections. Once I'd finished and knew there were no surprises,I was able to read it again, and although it still makes me squirm, it does display the genius of RD & SOTL. I was completely blind-sided by the outcome! A couple of the characters were a little 2 dimensional. Krendler, like Dr Chilton in SOTL was too much of a bastard to be beleivable fully."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow, unlike Harris writing, not a Silence.","review":"First half was very slow, wordy, strange words that were not explained. Not connected. Unrealistic. Not a silence of the lambs, not even close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thomas Harris let us down...","review":"After reading his previous books, I can say that I'm very disappointed. The shocking and gruesome parts of the book are not enough to keep the reader interested. After a while it gets boring and tiresome. The funky ending really sucks!!!. I'm glad that I took this book from my local library instead of wasting my money on this aberration. It is to be hoped that his next book will return faith to his followers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Scarf","review":"I got it in a few days and I LOVE IT! I have worn it a few times already.

Before ordering I was expecting that this would be one of those cheap scarves that were just a piece of fabric with the image printed onto it that you could get at any party shop, but after reading the other reviews here, I was quite convinced it wasn't, ordered it, and received it with much joy and satisfaction. The wool seems to be quite durable, and mine did not come with any weird stench like others have said. Great item for your Hufflepuff-enthusiast friend/family member."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to a Hogwarts costume","review":"I bought both this scarf and tie made by Elope for a Halloween costume. My main objectives were that it had to be adult-size and some of the reviews had mentioned that it smelled a bit weird but I found these comments to be unfounded. I think it's hard to find the right Hogwarts house scarf because several sellers use the same product images, but then the stated dimensions of the product are different, sometimes by quite a lot. I can confirm that this is the right size for a grown-up. It isn't massive but it's a much nicer, more realistic colour than the scarves I saw on the official theme park website, plus the shipping charges to the UK are much more affordable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but smelly.","review":"Scarf looks and feels great.

It would have been nice if the scarf was in storage that the scarf was washed before hand.Other wise it's nice and I do enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I just received this scarf and the Ravenclaw one made by the same company. I'm impressed! It's very long, longer than the description says, and the emblem is great size.

He has songs with everyone from Missy, to Justin, to Elton John, and Fallout Boy. This CD really shows his skills to work with any and all kinds of music and with any and all types of groups."},{"rating":"2","title":"shock value a great surprise","review":"to all u haters of this album--- sit down.This album is a great contribution to many versatile styles of timbaland.I have been a huge fan of his since him and missy started.Any good artist knows that if u want a great or half descent album, see timbaland. His beats are always hot!! And this album, at first listen, u might not like it,but try to listen again, and you will see where his head is.This album makes u wanna be in da club movin summtin,for real.Trust, this is his best album yet.The other ones where not that bad.This album u can tell he put a lot of work into it.And i give him mad kudos for it. So if u like dancing, get this album, because u will move!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok","review":"Timbaland has bounced back and in a big way over the past year. so he put out this Album which while showcases his tendencys towards beats and grooves, it also shows off the fact he has never really written a memorable song. he is more known for Grooves and beats. this album also shows that he is better suited behind the scenes for other acts as to doing his own thing because his limitations as a artist in his own right are there for the hearing. a few interesting things here and there,but nothing memorable. Timbaland does have some good ideas,but he doesn't get the most out of his own self as he seems to get out of other artists he works with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its not bad but its lacking....a lot","review":"Im wondering if Timbaland just went into the vault and pulled stuff out that he never used and never bothered to better himself. Its an OK album but thats it. The insulting part about the album is the heavy gloating on track one which is followed by MOSTLY tracks that are less than what you would expect after being gone a while....There is absolutely nothing groundbreaking on this album..which is sad and strange. the phrase \\" one trick pony \\" comes to mind with this album. Like other reviewers you will think its the same song over and over again....If your a Timbaland fan this one will leave you with an empty feeling....I just hope its a lot better next time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing two songs","review":"Other people have touched on the artistic merits of this album, so I want to touch on the censorship.If you buy this from amazon in the UK it has 19 songs on it. This version sold in America only has 17."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet!!!!!","review":"I just got this album today after finally finding out that \\"The Way I Are\\" was done by Timbaland. I usually stay on top of what is coming out but I slacked a bit on this one. Most of the songs on this album have featured guests, which is always cool. Keri Hilson's voice is hauntingly beautiful! Everyone involved in the production gave their best, but she put the finishing touches on it. There isn't one bad song on here. Give it a listen, you won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very strong album!","review":"This is the best of Timbaland's three albums. Everything all clicks, especially The Way I Are and songs with Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent,Dr. Dre, Justin Timberlake, Nelly Furtado and others. Timbaland's always challenging himself with funky numbers here. Even his own label's artists have cool flows and rap styles. The one song he did with Elton John is remarkable. He went all over the map with artists on this album and it all fits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop Tim","review":"This album rocks. I love that Timberland teamed up with all different types of artists. Rock this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timbaland at his best.","review":"I've been upset by my recent purchases of my favorite artists, but Timbaland definitely delivers. Being a long time fan, I give it up to him for throwing in a diverse set of fresh beats and lyrics. From the original rappers like Dr.Dre to the legendary pianist Elton John, Timbaland doesn't cease to spark every bit of musical genre in \\"Shock Value\\". Well worth 10 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Timbo is in the party, put up your hands!","review":"What can I say, except that Timbaland is the best? While his genius has been proven in the past, this collection best showcases his versatility. Timbaland gathers here a wide range of artists and showcases them to their best. The future of hip-hop lies with Timabaland and we should be grateful for that. He has diversified the genre with \\"Apologize\\", a remixing of the One Republic song the best example. In fact, it was Timbaland that brought that song to popularity. Best of all, Timbaland is saving the reputation of hip-hop. There is no disrespecting of women here. On the contrary, he is an exemplary gentleman as proven in \\"The Way I Are\\". Another gem in the album is \\"Give it to Me\\", in which he comes down on Scott Storch and his merry men for \\"talking greasy\\". All in all, a masterpiece of an album by one of music's greatest giants. A must have CD. I hope they soon release a DVD of this, with all the music videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more...","review":"Now, for the past year I've heard nothing but excellence from Timbaland...With Nelly Furtado's and Justin Timberlake's album it was just all so fresh and new. I still listen to his stuff with Alliyah and love it...The point is, I can listen to those albums over and over and every time I hear them on the radio, I turn them up...with this album...the only song like that is \\"give it to me\\" I'm not saying I didn't like any other songs...I did...like his collaberations with Elton John and She wants Revenge are pretty GREAT...I suppose I was expecting something different which led me to be let down. I love timbaland's beats though...always will...;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"No shock in this Value","review":"This cd is a straight joke, Tim makes good beats when the beats are for someone else, but as for himself, forget it. This cd was trash right when i put it in the CD player, People who like this kind of wierdness should go to the doctor and get checked. I have never heard such horrible music in all my life, this was so bad and crappy. whats this a mix between house and hip hop, ....?? trash this cd and all th esongs on it are trash Tim should think about NOT making anymore cds just stick to the beats. JUST PLAIN HORRIBLE !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid, horrid, horrid","review":"I was excited when I heard that this album was coming out because Timbaland has been magic this year: Every artist he works with has a huge hit. I was positive this CD would be incredible. I was very disappointed. I listened through the entire CD once and have not listened to it again. It's not catchy like any of the other recent songs he's worked on, the beats aren't good, the lyrics aren't good, all together it's just really horrible. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked","review":"I am shocked. I would have at least thought that the beats on Shock Value were going to be good (to make up for the fact that Timbaland can't rap to save his life). Even Timbaland talks about how much money he makes for beats in his \\"hit track\\" with Nelly Furtado and JT. It's too bad that he sold all his hot beats to other artists and didn't keep any for himself. One thing that he isn't is better than Scott Storch. Keep dreaming Timbaland. You are nothing more than a wanna-be Lil' John looping your 'yeah's and 'oooooh's in every track that sounds the same as the one before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timbaland Is The One Man Band Man!!!

For instance, it doesn't have any vast caves to explore for ores nor does it have any village interaction for festivities. You only get to choose from 3 bachelors. And most of all you have to continuously fertilize and water more than once a day to have a crop grow. Besides these aspects the rest can be fun like taking care of your animals. Riding your horse. Wearing different outfits. Playing records. Most fun is the cooking. I also especially like the mirror mirror on the wall. Hope this helps someone out on buying this. If you like Harvest Moon games then you will want this as a must have to your collection. If you like fishing then you most definitely need to get River King from these creators. I really love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the original","review":"Please save your money by buying the original Harvest Moon at half price. It is very nearly the same game--same townspeople, same conversations, same animals, same farm. If you remember the original, the girl has to choose from a few of the eligible batchelors (Gustafa, Marlin, or Rocky)--they didn't even add potential mates for her!I don't know why Another Wonderful Life came out so long after the original because they basically kept the format, changed the boy to a girl, made a few subtle changes, and marked it for sale.If you're a huge fan and want to check out the new version--rent it. Keep the old one and start over if you feel like playing the game again. Hopefully, I save you the $30 I wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"just a fun game","review":"it doesn't matter how old you are or how young it just matters of how this game will elolve over time also again with the 2 controller in the third slot press z for 99 of every time in the game even hybrid seeds and fruit some items come under 99 though like milk but the game is fun and if you need any help with the game email me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it!","review":"I hate the other Harvest Moon games!

It contains basically demos for the band Argent and Out Of Print singles released by Colin Blunstone as Neil MacArthur. But if you're just a casual fan, I would skip this collection. It doesn't showcase the band (The Zombies) at all. But it's so awesome to finally have that Neil MacArthur version of \\"She's Not There\\" in english and italian to boot on CD! I'm really glad as a \\"hardcore\\" fan of the zombies to have this collection, but again, if you're a casual fan. Skip this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There's Never Enough Zombies-Related Material Around","review":"\\"Into The Afterlife\\" provides a further glimpse into the transitional period between the Zombies aborted \\"R.I.P.\\" album and Argent, as well as Colin Blunstone's \\"pre-solo\\" career. Although some of the tracks are demos, a recording of a Rod Argent belch can be a breath of fresh air these days. The tracks that represent Colin's \\"Neil MacArthur\\" persona are interesting, particularly his reading of \\"She's Not There\\". Overall, I wouldn't say that the contents of the CD are all that mindblowing, but the Zombies alumni have always been capable of transcendent moments in pop music. This product is recommended for fans of the Zombies, Argent and Colin Blunstone, if only to complete your collection. It is also a worthy purchase for fans of so-called \\"chamber pop\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me.","review":"I had read rave reviews of this product on other sites. It was also recommended by my hair stylist, who really knows his products. Unfortunately it just didn't work for me.

It was worth trying ... definitely a good alternative to expensive salon processes."},{"rating":"2","title":"This kid will be a star","review":"I received this album as a gift from a friend who knows I love pop music, especially Christian pop. Robert Pierre is the real deal. He's a 14 year old doing inspirational music for other kids. This music appeals to kids in a way that other secular artists never could. It's a positive album that parents won't want to throw out the car window on a road trip- it's seriously very good music and sooooo catchy. I also think this is something parents (mom's especially) can use to talk to their kids about the Lord and that they can share together. I highly suggest this album- especially for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the best music there is!","review":"Jeff Victor's talent has largely gone unnoticed. In this age of \\"kitchen sink\\" Celtic albums, out this one is so original, so beautiful.

I was buying it just to hear the rest of the one song that was sampled. I soon came to appreciate ALL of the CD, my favorite piece being \\"The Rowan Tree Trilogy\\". Its simple beauty, then the lush embellishment to its foundational tune never fails to get me wanting to learn the piano. If I could master just that ONE piece, I could impress family and friends, and win lovers by the score (pardon the pun).\\"Emerald Isle\\" is another wonderful collection from Jeff Victor. His piano work does for me what William Ellwood's guitar playing does; relaxation and the appreciation of sweet sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"echoing","review":"I can only echo the other reviewers, but I bought this due to them and was not led astray.

The strange characters who all seem to control something uncontrollable (sound, color, and so on) stayed with me for years afterwards, so that when I saw it on the bargain table in the book store I decided to pick it up again.It was only on re-reading it as an adult that the message of the book jumped out at me for the first time. Milo is a kid who doesn't think anything is interesting, and the lands beyond the Phantom Tollbooth teach him, bit by bit, how the world is full of fantastic things, and how knowledge is always worth pursuing. But finally seeing the metaphor behind such characters as the Awful Dinn or Canby (who is as brave as can be and as cowardly as can be) didn't make them any less entertaining. I suppose that's the exact test that a book has to pass to be fun for all ages- and this one is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"One of only two books I've ever read more than once.

It all starts out when Milo, a boy who doesn't know what to do with himself -not just sometimes, always!- comes home from school to find a box with a cardboard tollbooth in it.When he drives through the tollbooth in his electric toy car, he finds himself in the Kingdom of Wisdom, a place where everything is a play on words! For example, Tock, the watchdog, actually has a watch on his chest! In their ultimate quest to find Rhyme and Reason, Milo, Tock, and the Humbug have many queer adventures.I would reccomend this book, but it is not one of my five top favorite. \\"The Phantom Tollboth\\" uses a lot of great descriptions, but yet, sometimes you might wish the book had a little more of something. This is definately not a book to miss, even though it's personally not my favorite one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for all ages","review":"As a young person making my way through the elementary school years, I encountered a plethora of wonderful, imaginative books. From Stine's \\"Goosebumps\\" series to Cooper's \\"The Dark is Rising\\" sequence, I was lucky enough to never be in short of good literature. However, there was one book that I seemed to return to time and time again. One book that seemed the epitome of creativity and whit. One book that perfectly combined lovable characters with a wild, unpredictable story line. One book that, in time, would become my hands-down favorite in the young reader category.The first time I encountered Juster's \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" was through my mother's voice, my innocent youth making way for a lifetime of reading; my last encounter will likely be as I am in my rocking chair, with old age slowly creeping.

I first read it at around age 7 or so. I am now sixteen and I have read this about 5 times, and get a new joy with each time I read it! The fantasy, creativness and outside viewpoint of life make this work so wonderful. There is so much meaning underneath it that I didn't really uncover until I reread it when I was older. My best advice-Read this book! And if you already read ir-read it again! I will always be waiting for that phantom tollbooth to show up in my room one day.... NIKKI P.S. Does anybody know any works Norton Juster has created?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A tour of the mind !","review":"This book \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\" is a childhood must read. The book leads you on a tour of the imagantion. It's easy to read and can give you the best mind tour. Even for a yonger person. I personally have read this book in a standard English class in 6 th grade and it even today remains on my \\"Best Book\\" list. presently, I am in 10th grade and in honors classes, oddly enough,I GREATLY enjoy this book. It'll bring you on the tour of your life time. I plain to read \\"The Phantom Tollbooth\\", a creative book when my lovely children arrive. A comparative author to this sort of book would be C.S Louis. They are both great authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still my favorite after all these years!","review":"The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster is a classic! I read it for the first time when I was in fifth or sixth grade. I remember thinking it was amazing then, although I didn't get all of the inside jokes (Canby, jumping to Conclusions, etc.). I re-read the book every few years, enjoying it more and more each time. Now, as an adult, I understand all the jokes and the whole story just seems to get better over time. I teach elementary school and I always find time to read this book to my class. Children from all walks of life can relate to the story and its hero. What child has never been bored with life, with school, with everything? Milo is every child. We can only hope that every child is fortunate enough to take a journey such as Milo's through the Phantom Tollbooth."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Adventure","review":"The Phantom Tollbooth was very interesting it wasn't how I thought it would be it was much more exciting their is no words to put it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"The phantom tollboth","review":"I think that it was very adventures and the end was very sadfuly oh Milo feel better I'm there for you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably tedious","review":"I can see where this book could be a good classroom tool, because it teaches the reader a lot about words. But I found it unbelievably tedious and we finally stopped reading it. I was reading it to my son, who is only 8, but very bright. Neither of us could stand it.My older son, who is 11, seemed to like it better, but he's very pedantic, which seems to the kind of person this book is geared toward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phantom Tollbooth","review":"The book is great.

Unfortunately the opposite is true; it is a paperback bound in a hard cover, and the way it is bound cuts off parts of the pages near the spine of the book. In most cases that's not an issue but since there is a full two-page map included, it is partially cut off. Also the paper is very cheap, low density paperback stuff. I haven't read the actual book yet but if I (and my kids) like it I'll probably have to buy a better edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a critique of the book, but shoddy printing and binding","review":"The \\"School and Library Binding\\" is a binding intended to be very durable and long-lasting. You've seen these very sturdily bound books at your local library. However, this so-called \\"School and Library Binding\\" is a cheap, pulp-paper softcover glued into very flimsy and shoddy hardcover binding. Even opening the book damages the binding and actually reading it would likely cause it to disintegrate completely.This \\"School and Library Binding\\" should be labeled as \\"Shoddy Binding\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to under stand for a youger reader","review":"I read it a few years ago in class and it was hard to grasp.

Milo, Tock, and Humbug made me laugh and cry and laugh more. My friend read it and we argued for a long time about if Milo really took the journey or not. Kids should read this book because it is so good you can't put it down. The author has a really good imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for kids who like to use their imaginations.","review":"The book is about a young boy who is always bored.

A must read for children and adults alike!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE PHANTOM TOLLBOOTH","review":"The phantom tollbooth is a fantasy filled book that includes many life lessons everywhere Milo goes. It shows courage and bravery. Milo learns you should never say life has no meaning. This book is a wonderful book for all children, if able to understand. It has illustrations that help describe the book even more. This book may be harder for younger children, if they read it by them selves. If you read aloud and explain the harder words, then they will love the book. We recommend this book to adults and children. It is a wonderful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This entire book is a hilarious play on words, from Tock the watchdog to the Doldrums, yet behind the clever wit, wording, and humor, there is a far more serious story with a complex plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Phantom Tollbooth","review":"This book is about a boy named Milo who thought there was never any thing to do.

This is the book of boredom both ways - he's bored and so was I."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing quality","review":"This 'library' quality binding has thin dingy newspaper type paper that you would find in a second rate rip-off version published in Asia. I wouldn't recommend this version of this book at all. I'd return it, but it would take more effort than it's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst book ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This was the worst book I have ever read. I read it last year in fifth grade and I am 11 now. DO NOT THINK OF ME AS A SMALL CHILD!!!!!!!!!I am extremely mature (I am not bragging)and usually enjoy childish books with more to them than meets the eye, but this book was just plain stupid. It was full of mathematical errors and it seemed like the author wrote some of the events just to fill up space. Those events had absolutely nothing to do with the plot and had practically no effect on the ending. I should have read this when I was 4 or 5 and actually liked this type of literature. Yes there was interesting word play, but it was not enough to make up for the total idiocy of the storyline. I simply CANNOT understand the people who like this book as it is boring and immature. I liked Norton Juster's The Dot and the Line(which is a PICTURE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!), but was sorely disappointed with the results of this waste of paper, money, ink, and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors in mathmatics (throughly disgusted)","review":"In Digitopolis on page 188 the equation does not equal 0 (if the stantard mathematical precedence is observed)!!!!!

I ,for one, am throughly disgusted that the author would teach young readers, like myself, inaccurate mathematical precedence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever","review":"It repeated itself over and over. I read this book as a book club book and everybody else loved it. I thought it was very annoying with the tallest midget and the shortest giant and also the fattest thin guy and the thinnest fat guy etc. etc. I was forced to finish it but if i wasnt after the first page i would have stopped.

First milo goes through a tollbooth that he has just found in his room one day. Now it's the 90's and if you simply find something in your room some day you call the police. you do not decide to get in a toy car and drive through it. It gets worse after that. no offence to the writer but I would not waste my time reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST BOOK EVER","review":"This is absolutely the most horrendous book I have ever read. I would never recommend this book to anyone, EVER! Reading about a kid who thinks every one is abore is boring its self. Who would be dumb enough to go through a tollbooth that appears in your room after school? So, whoever reads this should never read \\"The Phantom Tollbooth.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't recemend this to anyone of good taste!","review":"The following review is from my young son, who was forced to read this book at school: \\"The worst book I have ever read. I had to read it for school which made it even worse! The only person I would recemend this book to would be a 3 year old kid who would think that the pictures were cool. In fact, I don't even think that the 3 year old kid would enjoy this book. The only thing good about this book are the characters.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book of all time.","review":"Ok, I HATE nonsense novels so you'd think that I'd hate the phantom tollbooth ,right? Wrong! This book is not like other nonsense novels; it's special. With lovable characters such as: Tock the Watchdog, Humbug, Rhyme, Reason, King Azaz, The Mathamagician, and of course the star of this, Milo. I love every single story in this book and laughed aloud at them each-except the first one about numbers, which made my head hurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for kids & adults of all ages!","review":"My father gave this book to me when I was a little girl, and I immediately fell in love with it. I was inspired and amazed by Milo and his adventures. Now in my early thirties, I recently re-discovered this book and find it more enchanting than ever. The Phantom Tollbooth manages to illustrate life's important truths without being preachy or one-sided. We can all relate to Milo and the other characters, and their journeys and transitions. My husband and I are planning to have children soon, and I will definitely share this book with them. I highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am almost 40 years old and I still reread this book.","review":"I found this one of the most thought provoking books I had ever read as a child. I can still recall the sensation of reading it. I reread this book at least once a year and I continue to find it entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"No need to speak my praise, it \\"goes without saying\\" !","review":"Having never read this book as a child, I picked it up after graduating from college and found wisdom there beyond its years. Looking for inspiration in your life? A carpe diem message? Hope? Lost dreams? Then this is the book for you. I especially appreciated Juster's fabulous play on language, and the awesome sense of adventure. My only gripe is that I wish the supporting characters of Tock and especially the Humbug had been developed more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal for ALL ages!!","review":"This book deserves 10 stars! It encourages reading, the use of your imagination, and it can help make you more open-minded. When my mom made me read the book in second grade, all I could think was, \\"What a dumb-looking book!\\". Now, as a freshman, I STILL read it, when I don't have an assigned book. I reccomended it to my cousin, and she, too, thought it would be boring. Now she wants my copy! To anyone who is the least bit apprehensive about the book, here's my advice: Buy it and read it. You'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So clever","review":"Since reading this, I've seen other books with a similar habit of taking language and idioms literally, to hilarious result, but this was the first I read, and to me it will always be the best. Whenever I'm doing stats and averages, I still remember the .3 kid who felt lucky because he was the only one who fit in the .6 car that every family has. It's been several years, but I bet I'd enjoy it just as much a third (or would it be fourth) time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Word Play","review":"My son is 12 and loved this book. He especially liked the word play. Very clever. I really enjoyed too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for Both Adults and Children Alike","review":"If you are a lover of a play on words, a mind teaser and a great fairy tale, you will love this book. But, don't jump to conclusions or you may find yourself suddenly standing on the \\"Island of Conclusions\\"! What a fun read and thoroughly enjoyable. It now has a fond place in my collection of Fairy Tales."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST-read for children and adults alike!!","review":"I first read this book in school in the fourth grade and I was always wonderfully surprised and delighted at the variety of characters and the turn of events in the story. Even though I was young, I knew there was a lot of plays on words throughout the book. I just recently bought the book again and at 19 years old, I am STILL impressed with this story. It's fun, interesting, and really makes one think about life and what it's worth. It's a great story to share with others and hopefully one day I will get the chance to read it to a child and share with them this story that combines a child's imagination and an adult's artful mind. Whether 10 or 90, buy this book. I will always treasure MY copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"favorite book from my childhood","review":"This is a great book for an adult who likes the idea of reading to kids, but finds the average kids' book vapid or badly written. As morals go,it's hard to object to the ones here: Wisdom requires Rhyme and Reason, as well as words and numbers. Words and numbers are both valuable. Life is full of interesting things if you keep your eyes open. There are a lot of ways to get sidetracked into a life that is neither useful nor rewarding. Even bright people can be small-minded. You can sometimes do the impossible, if you don't know that it is impossible beforehand.The amazing thing is that the book is light and sparklingly verbally and conceptually playful, despite having these lessons tucked into it. I read it again last night, and chuckled aloud, yet again.If you don't have a kid, buy a copy for yourself. Or for someone else's kid. The illustrations by Jules Feiffer add the perfect touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantom Tollbooth is the best book ever!","review":"The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster, is an excellent book for any age. It is about a boy, who is about 10-years-old, named Milo. He is bored with his life and one day when he comes home from school there is a rather humungous package in his room. When he opens it, he finds a tollbooth. Milo assembles the tollbooth and decides to give it a try. By pressing the \\"go\\" button, it sends him off into a wonderful land of words, numbers, other odds and ends, and the castle in the air. It exquisite details and a daring adventure into the unknown. I rated this book a 5 star for those reasons. By coincidence, I am reading this book in school for the 2nd time! Norton Juster is a great writer and I'm eager to read his other books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"My 10 yr old needed a book for an upcoming book report, so I purchased this book for him.

If 2 out 2 kids enjoyed this book it means its worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Phantom Toll Both","review":"The Phantom Toll both is an interesting book that would delight anyone who loves learning and adventures. The author is the fun loving Norton Juster. This book is a fiction book that everyone will love.This story is about Milo a bored child that has nothing to do except complain that he is bored. But one day there was a strange package for him that contained a toll both. This toll both had taken him into another world where he had made good friends and learned life lessons on a journey that is unforgettable.I liked the book because you would never know whom they would run into next. This is a great book to read I think you should not miss this chance!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored and Confused","review":"It was my Mom's favorite book when she was a kid so I was almost afraid to tell her how much I disliked it.

Its magic cannot be conveyed once your mind reaches a certain level of sophistication.Count this book as being on this list.. . . at least I guess so. I read it in middle age: apparently way too late. I found it pretentious, silly, unfocused, and uninspiring.In fact, I suspect I would have felt that way about this when I was eleven or so: I fail to see how I could have found the book's hamfisted punning very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"well written","review":"the book was intresting.It was very exciting at the begining but toward the end of the book the story got kinda dull.It's a great quick read with lots of pictures"},{"rating":"1","title":"endless nonsense and drivel","review":"Bored and Boring boy with no interest in anything finds a tollbooth in his room. He drives his toy car thru and finds himself in a strange new place where there are lots of puns and clever play on words. It's like Alice thru the looking glass and the Mad Hatter. Sure there are some clever bits but it is tedious having so much nonsense. The kid is not an active part of the story. He doesn't accomplish anything. He isn't clever or thoughtful. Turns out the twin princesses of Rhyme and Reason were banished (hey that makes sense). But when they are rescued there is no change in the nonsense, I believe there are more stories in this series but we won't be buying them. I wouldn't even take them if they were free. We listened to this one to the bitter end just to see if anything useful did happen. It didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rightly called a classic","review":"I wasn't sure if I'd like this book or not. Frankly, such metaphoric and nonsensical journeys tend to be . . . well, just too metaphoric and nonsensical for me. Alice in Wonderland has always been overrated if you ask me. But I decided to keep an open mind and give this novel a shot. I'm glad I did.This is a wonderful story, full of creative wordplay. Juster makes you believe in this world where people eat words and numbers are dug out of mines, where color is played by a symphony and sounds are collected and hoarded. There's so much more, but I don't want to give anything else away.Just read it. Enjoy its charming narrative thrust, its imaginative way of making points without ever being heavy handed. This is just a damn fine novel.And, if you're not careful, you might even learn a thing or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best book I ever read.","review":"This book is extremly well written.

I don't care what anyone says, this book definately holds up. In fact, I get so many more of the jokes and puns now than I did when I was a child. Like Bugs Bunny, this book isn't only for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not only for children","review":"This book, with it's subtle wit and excellent vocabulary, is an excellent read for young & old alike.

One of my all-time favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantom toll booth","review":"I loved this book and bought it for all my grandchildren. Even bought it for my Kindle so I was able to read it too. It's great for adults because of all the plays on words, and great for kids because of the fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you have change?","review":"The Phantom Tollbooth's theme is for kids to get out of the house and explore the landscape, to examine the road, to question the point, to think on your path, to poke the matter, to probe the issue, to ask the meaning, to open the book, to unfold the map, and to turn over all stones. While that may sound boring the book does it in such a way to bring a chuckle to your lips and a smile to your eyes. Was this you as a kid? Is this you as an adult now?Tons of imagery, language twists, and adventure with just a slight touch of danger make this a book for both young and old. I strongly suggest this book for anybody, new or used, for reading at anytime."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"I can't remember the first I read this book. I can't remember how many times I have read this book. I can't remember the number of times I have given this book as a gift. I can't remember the number of people I have told about this book. But I can remember what it really means to be a child whenever I read this book & it has never failed to do so. If you haven't read it, do so immediately so you won't miss out on a simply wonderful experience that you will regret not having, but be prepared to feel even more regret when the book ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Phantom Toolbooth","review":"Thought-provoking, well-written story with allusions from many aspects of life. Adult themes approached from the viewpoint of a child. Some will see aspects of the book as dated. High-school-aged youngsters to mature adults will get more from the book than children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"My 8-yr old son and I happened upon this book and could not stop laughing.

I can not say enough about the importance this book has had in my life and I can say with all honesty and sincerity that this book changed my life and helped to develop the man I am today.

Milo, a kid with nothing to do, discovers a strange cardboared tollbooth leading to a magnificient world. In this strange world, he encounters many queer allies. Milo can easily be related to because before he discovers the tollbooth, he is bored and has nothing to do. My favorite part of the book is the end, which I won't give away.

I think of some of the humor in it as being too sophisticated for them. But I enjoyed it. I like the playing with mathematical concepts, the puns, the droll dream-like characteristics of some of the situations.There is also a movie of the same name, which I enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Phantom Tollbooth","review":"The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster is a hilarious and exciting book.

I like this book very much, and you will too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn&#65533;t hold up","review":"I forget how old I was when I first read this book, but I was (I hope) very young. It was a great favourite of mine. On a recent re-reading it was a correspondingly great disappointment. The land Milo travels to would have been no worse as allegory if it had had depth or flavour in its own right; but it didn't. Nor did Juster employ the wit needed to make the dialogue and the puns carry the story by themselves. Worst of all, it's allegory with no real point. What is the author saying? \\"Mathematics isn't so dull as all that, kids; and look: here's a funny drawing!\\" The fact that children can't detect the condescension (I couldn't) doesn't mean it isn't there.Sigh. Another illusion shattered. Years ago I would have given this a rave review - but I would have been wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delivery and product received are just fine...The joke is this edition!","review":"So just to be clear...delivery was great, it was a new item in perfect condition, that's not the problem. This product was/is marketed as a 50th Anniversary Edition so, if you're like me, you kind of expect something more than a clear plastic cover over the book with a couple of pictures of the author and the illustrator...so stupid...the book itself though, for anyone who does not know is fabulous, just don't waste your money on this edition. Get the paperback for $6 instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book","review":"I had to read this book for school, it was horrible! Who cares about a boy who goes to a fantasy world?

It contains what I believe to be the greatest sentence in American literature: \\"If you want sense, you'll have to make it yourself.\\" How much more truth do you want?

Milo, who thinks there is no point in life, travels through Dictionopalis, the Doldrums, Math Mines, and many more places. when he travels in tis enchanting and fun land, he realizes there is more in life than bad math grades. This is exciting when Milo meets demons and rescues a princess. Also it is funny in the town of Reality.

Wish I'd discovered it @ age 12, not 40 yrs later","review":"Tock (the watch dog on the cover illustration) is my new favorite literary character -- although I'm a fan of the Humbug, too. The description of how Tock was named and the trauma to his parents and their fate left me laughing out loud. (Really. I was laughing out loud -- it's a sparkling passage). While I was delighted with the book as an adult, for a bright, inquisitive, interested kid, the book should take him or her on a marvelous journey, providing plenty to think and talk about at the end. If you were to give this to a kid, please consider reading it ahead of time so you can talk with the child after he or she has finished it. There's a lot of angles to go with it.When I finished my copy, I sent it to my Godson. He's a little young for it now, but I hope the note I sent along with it will whet his appetite for it when the time is right.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic for everyone!","review":"Tremendous audio book!

The music is wonderfully refreshing and there are nice surprises. Songs like \\"If he don't love her soon\\" and \\"Diana's Song\\" really hit some sensitive areas, but with an encouraging purpose to show the need to love deeper than we do. I especially like \\"The Cross of Grace\\" because of its 19th century hymn-like quality. This CD will definitely \\"grow on you\\" if you let it sink in a few times. Great effort Naphtali!"},{"rating":"2","title":"10 easy ways to take advice here nad blow up UPS","review":"First Id like to say the product and delivery were fine. I followed all the instructions provided by Mike Murphy. They were accurate. Please add two.1) As you remove the cover to the ups back it up a few inches and remove at least one of the battery leads. This insures there is no current on the circuit board. Then continue.2) On re-assembly slide the cover almost all the way into place then attach the last lead before making that last inch of push on the cover.If you don't, you stand a chance of the cover touching the back of the circuit board and cooking the whole UPS. Then you are out the cost of the batteries and you still have to replace the UPS. By the way I should know better. So those of you who don't know better you stand a chance of cooking yourself. When these batteries are live you have high curent and possible high voltage in there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great in the beginning....then","review":"I've had several of these UPS systems for almost a year. In the beginning, the units did a good job of keeping my systems running for 10 - 15 minutes if the power went out. After a year, the batteries can't even keep the systems up for 5 seconds. BUT, I think Belkin or APC will be happy to sell you more batteries for about $80 per unit. I am disappointed at how fast these batteries lost their ability to hold a charge, basically, I'm going to just throw them all away, they don't help me anymore. I think the APC UPS systems are the same way, I don't recommend the Belkin or APC UPS systems because of their poor batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inflated Shipping makes this not such a great deal.","review":"Good forks, a good product.

The changes that these 2 brothers undergo show how circumstances can drastically change people's lives in unforeseeable ways.

Clever songwriter, accomplished musician, raconteur. As such he has hoodwinked Little Brown into publishing a disaster that you're likely to buy because he's Jimmy Buffett. Please don't. I've been a Parrothead since 1985 and, frankly, I'm just embarrassed for Jimmy by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful Read","review":"I was happy to get the book as a gift but was disappointed soon into the story. It is a rambling tale filled with a solid load of cheap shots at Catholics, conservatives and anything remotely American. This probably plays well with his friends in Hollywood and Long Island but gets tedious to a reader trying to follow the plot. An example of the authors weak attempt at political commentary was to kill off the antagonist, who was a poodle rancher in Wyoming, in an avalanche after she unnsuccessfully ran for Congress as a born-again, conservative Republican but lost because she was found to be into S&M with some dude in Miami."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffett does it better","review":"Jimmy Buffett's unique outlook on life and Americana aren't missing anything in this novel that, like his music, paints a colorful picture of Carribbean fun.

Fruit Loop says five stars, and THANKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I have been a Buffett fan my entire adult life and my iPod is filled with all of his music. If yours is too, you'll be sorely disappointed with this book. It has no plot, no real story, it's just a run-on series of rambling nonsense. I had to force myself to finish it. If you're looking for some of Jimmy's truly unique blend of tropical country escapism, read Where is Joe Merchant or Tales From Margaritaville--again. Think I will, perhaps just for some redemption. p.s. The song of the same title (CD comes with the hardcover) is equally disappointing...a throwaway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"This was a fun and relaxing read. I loved it.

It's adventurous, descriptive, and make you wish you could do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"book in perfect condition, book sucked","review":"Mr. Buffet should stick to biographies and songs. This book was awful.

I like Buffett's music, sure, who doesn't? But I've never seen him in concert or anything. So it can't be that.And I didn't know (from reading these other reviews) that the story is somehow loosely based on things that have happened to the singer/author.I just found the story, wacky, unstructured, goofy, implausibly coincidental as it was, to be somehow delightfully entertaining. A present-day cowboy on the run somehow finds himself as a fishing guide in a Caribbean resort. And THEN the weird stuff starts happening. The story ambles along at its own pace and invites you along on this serendipitous journey to - what? Salvation? Peace? Just call it a happy ending, no apologies and no excuses. You're invited to take it or leave it as you like.I found myself enchanted and read along with delight all the way to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling and Ridiculous","review":"This book is a melange of contrived characters and ridiculous situations that did not add up to entertaining reading for me.Sorry to \\"dis\\" a fellow Mobilian who is truly talented, but I cain't refrain.

This is very dull stuff. Tully Mars, an affable cowboy, who throws a table through a plate glass window on his lady bosses ranch, hi tails it down south of the border before the police catch up with him. There he encounters a series of supposedly interesting adventures piloting a boat, teaching fly fishing, helping the 102 year old Cleopatra steer a schooner and tend a lighthouse. Every encounter with another person along the way is an excuse for a meandering detour of a tall tale. There is in essence no plot, and no character development I couldn't wait to finish this book. No more Buffet for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A rambling tale that fails to hold one's interest. It's seems highly improbable that our hero is on the run for throwing a piece of furniture through his employer's window.And unfortunately, the \\"adventures\\" that follow evoke little excitement.

Your place in the Hall of Fame is already assured!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"This is the first of Jimmy's books that I have purchased and tried to read.

For me it was a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better left unread","review":"The Buffett money machine keeps on printing......A Salty Piece of Land should have remained a short story.

Alas, it suffers the same fate as his previous book(Pirate Looks at 50), endless rambling that does nothing to advance the plot. Also, like Pirate, I'll not finish this book either.Buffett is a master songwriter, no question. As far as novels, the man definitely needs an editor to focus, streamline, and bring cohesion to a maelstrom of imagery."},{"rating":"2","title":"PH in San Diego","review":"I couldn't put the book down.

This book angered me, it was just crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me wanting less","review":"Sorry Jimmy, this Parrothead needs more than disjointed story bites. Characters flying in and out of the story without rhyme or reason didn't do it for me. Tales From margaritaville and Joe Merchant left me wanting more Buffett tales. This one left me wanting less.

Jimmy Buffet is a good writer. But a \\"novel\\" needs more than just a good writer and this one doesn't deliver. \\"A Salty Piece of Land\\" is neither a novel nor as good as his previous efforts. There is no real story line and few of the characters are very well developed. It's like a collection of book proposals strung together.You'd be better off to read Joe Merchant again.

There was a lot of hype surrounding the release of the book, including a simulcast concert/book kickoff from New Orleans. We saw it in a theater in California and thoroughly enjoyed it. The book started out OK, but began to drag and ramble with the whole foam party thing, lengthy letters from Willie Singer with more detail than needed and making you wish he'd get to the point.

I was not very up on Sub-Saharan African history and the book was a huge wake up call.

I had anticipated a more text book style approach and was plesantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"informative AND easy to read","review":"I read a lot of history books and too many of them are extremely dry. This book is what a history book SHOULD be like. It covers the history of many African countries but reads like a novel and avoids the usual slant that other history books have: the blame for all the problems in Africa is shared among several camps, not just the colonialists OR the Africans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Overviw of African History From Late 50'5 -80's","review":"I picked this book up after finishing \\"The Arabs\\" by the same author. Like the prior book, Lamb gives a nice description of each African country, warts and all. I had read \\"The Scramble for Africa: White Man's Conquest of the Dark Continent from 1876-1912\\" in the past so this was a nice overview of what happened after the Europeans left. For the most part, Africa is a mess but it is nice to know why that is the case and Lamb explains this. The book is getting a little dated (last entry was 1984 and South Africa was still under aparthied) but it works great as a history of that time period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Icky-poo","review":"Sigh, Lamb is a fine example of how you cannot understand Africa if you don't have at least some inkling of its history -- something journalists of his ilk don't often bother to garner.

Try Davidson's _Black Man's Burden_ for example."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reliable glimpse into the future?","review":"Fast-forward ten years....what will the Middle East look like? Richard Clarke presents here a possible (likely?) scenario, albeit in fictional form. Upfront I'll admit that this reviewer considers Clarke a true American patriot and, yes, indeed, perhaps also a hero. (History will be the ultimate judge, of course.) But, even if you disagree, you must admit that Richard Clarke certainly has the street cred to write such a book, which, by the way, not only presents plausible scenarios, but also rewards the reader with an engrossing story. The story line is nimbly paced, yet sure in its footing, and it engaged this reader from page one continually until the end. Treat yourself to a gripping read, and maybe get a view of the future, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking Story","review":"If you are big into Middle East troubles you will not be able to put this book down.

It is difficult to follow, sometimes just spiteful (eg. taking a brief dig at opponents of Global Warming) and eventually boring. However it does raise some alarming plausible future scenaries.These include a coup-d-tat in Saudi Arabia, top American political leaders under Saudi financial influence, strong Chinese interest in the middle-East (as well as their becoming a strong naval power, and moving to establish a nuclear force in the former Saudi territory), Iran getting \\"the bomb\\" and striving to become a controlling factor throughout the region, Iraq largely following Iran's lead, and terrorism (sponsored by Iran or disgruntled Iraqis) against the U.S. Navy using a very large pirated CNG tanker.Please, Mr. Clarke - go back to non-fiction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrring","review":"So much detail, so many acronyms, too much technical detail and rhetoric, not much action.Bill Kurry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and boring","review":"While the overall scenario could be imagined, Mr Clark fails at plotting either the characters nor the story the way a Clancy or a Forsyth would, the only purpose it serves is to become more afraid of American politics"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This is truly an exceptional book.

The only people who would like this book are those who would like it's anti-American political statements. There is NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT whatsoever, there are too many characters to keep them straight, and the prose is about third-grade level. I didn't care about any of the characters. This book isn't even close to the quality of a Clancy novel. The plotting is so dull, it is difficult to sustain one's attention on the story (you'll find yourself thinking about tomorrow's tasks, today's problems . . . anything but the story).

He paints a grim picture in this book, but I guess that is the mood of our culture. We keep trying to blame ourselves for everything when things go wrong.

Here the US is the bad guy, and the Arabs are the good guys who only want democracy. Clarke conveniently forgets that every terrorist on 9-11 was Arab. He also ignores the basic structure of US government in composing this fantasy.Clarke must be very bitter after losing his position in the US government where he was the failed National Coordinator for Security and Counter-terrorism.

I particularly like how each of these categories are quick to find because they are sub-titled with easily identifiable icons.

EXPLORERS starts out interestingly enough with a great premise, decent special effects, scientific jargon, and a likeable cast of young stars, but then it falls flat. Three pre-teen guys (two geeks and a freak) build a spaceship (a very inventive and high concept idea by the screenwriters). Then, they go off to find aliens. Once the young \\"explorers\\" meet up with an alien race who speak \\"American television\\",because the aliens have been receiving the televison signals to their planet, the story becomes vague, muddled and somewhat of a letdown. Also, the alien(s) repeating quotes from film and television programs becomes irritating and old right away. Overall, there are high production values to the film, interesting script ideas, and a likeable youg cast, but ultimately falls short.

They were replaced by Kidde support (who are quite easy to work with), but the replacment units are beginning to fail. Time to failure seems to be about a year. Failure mode is false alarms. Fresh batteries, etc. do not address the issue.As a safety item in the house, I have no confidence in these items anylonger, and have replaced them with a competing brand, which I also purchased six of for another house, and have never had any failed units."},{"rating":"1","title":"Initially a little disappointed.","review":"I purchased and just received two of the Kidde smoke alarms. It's too early to give a full evaluation of these alarms but I was very disappointed to find that one of the alarms was dated July 27, 2011. That makes that alarm 1 1/2 years old upon delivery. I'm willing to consede 6 months but 1 1/2 years. The units have a 10 year life from the date labeled on the back of the unit. Beside this issue, the units appear to work very nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice combo","review":"It has been in for over an month and it went off when a pot boiled over, lots of smoke and fast moving ions, so it did its job in general.

I bought this detector at Home Depot. Got it home and noticed it was cheap plastic, lightweight, bad instruction manual. Put batteries in and they heated up very hot. Tried putting them in backwards and forwards and nothing changed. It's obvious to me that Kidde has a monopoly on this product niche and they don't care about quality control. Some other companies need to get into this market and make products that work. It's our safety that's at stake. Avoid Kidde. They suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful !!","review":"I bought 2 of these Smoke detectors.

Consumer Reports recommends both types for detecting different fire signatures. They also recommend changing a smoke detector every 10 years and a CO2 detector every 5 years. So, buying one of the more popular combination smoke and CO2 units and replacing it after 5 years is wasteful and more expensive. This combination smoke detector unit should be good for 10 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 of 6 failed within two years","review":"I purchased 4 Kidde PI9000 Dual mode detectors to replace working, but old detectors in our home.

This happened once before, and was easily resolved by cleaning the unit with compressed air. This time, however, compressed air was not able to help, so I'm not sure if it's a dust issue, or something else.

However, the mounting hardware is incompatible with those alarms, so I have to take down the old mounts in order to use my new alarms. This is frankly an enormous pain and makes me think I was a chump to go with Kidde again. I would have picked another, better brand if I hadn't thought I could use the old mounting hardware with the new alarms.I'm still not sure whether I want to return these or not - still deciding - but in any case don't buy these if you already have Kidde detectors in your house and you think sticking with the same brand will make things easier.

Deciding where to mount the units on the ceiling was the hardest part of installation. No false alarms yet - the units have been in service about a month so far.The only feature that is lacking is the ability to network multiple units together.

In addition, check out the 10 year warranty: Kiddle expects YOU to pay shipping BOTH ways to replace THEIR defective product.

Such a person makes an excellent subject of a biography. Smith was definitely a major player during memorable times in Mississippi.I didn't finish the book. At about the half way point I became overwhelmed with the author's unstinting effort to compile in excruciating chronological order everything and everybody who entered into Smith's carrer. The book is excellent as a kind of \\"book of record\\" of what was happenning in Mississippi at the time, both the good things and the many bad things. However, it isn't a very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"The book is great. It covers everything you need for the MCAT without giving to much detail.

Less technological than most of Heinlein's novels, it's set in a distant, vaguely medieval future of empires, aristocrats, and slaves.

In fact, I have about 30 Heinlein books, and only one in hardback (well, 2 now). BUT, this edition is essentially the normal paperback with a different cover; it's the same size as the paperback and the same pulpy paper (and the type goes too close to the binding).

And another thing...this is one of the most \\"realistic\\" sci-fi books I've ever read. Although I haven't read nearly half of it,I can see from all the other reviews that there're some interesting plot-twists. And isn't that what life is all about?

This is one of my top three favorites (along with \\"Podkayne of Mars\\" and \\"Tunnel in the Sky\\"). When I saw the larger paperback recently I was very excited, till I read into it a few pages. This edition has not only horrible typographic errors, but whole paragraphs are placed where they do not belong. If you are reading this for the first time, I would suggest you find an older edition on Amazon, via an independent seller. I've been reading this book for many years, since a young teen, and I don't recall ever seeing a single typo let alone one in almost every paragraph. I'm a grammar and spelling geek, I notice these things. The story itself is wonderful and well thought-out, moves along quickly and has some great surprises toward the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite of all","review":"Heinlein is one of my favourite authors, and I would certainly recommend this book to any one first reading him. It was a book I read as a teen-ager, re-read as a young adult and read again as I got older. It does what many of Heinlein's books do for you - they tansfer you to another place full of rich tapestries, worlds and people. You root for the character, feel sad for him and wish the best for him. After you read enough of his works, you see and hear many things that come from other books. Can be read alone, but serves as treats for loyal readers. Gret book by a great author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Nearly as Good as Heinlein's Others","review":"I'm a HUGE fan of Heinlein. Despite my love for the author's writing, this book was not anything special. There are SO many clichés that made me cringe and say \\"Oh, GOD...

The units work fine and they are high quality devices (software issues aside).As with any UPS device, the wet-cell batteries wear out. That's usually not a big deal - you can buy replacement batteries (this unit takes two) for about $16. However, this unit is poorly designed and it is difficult to replace the batteries. It's doable, but if you compare the ease of replacement to an equivalent APC unit or OptiUPS unit you won't buy one of these. I also own 2 OptiUPS units and an APC unit and they are very servicable. I would recommend going with either of those."},{"rating":"2","title":"short and good sci-fi","review":"This is not a character driven story so if that's what you're into, look elsewhere.

I'm not too sure..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. What a terrible book.","review":"Not only was this book slow moving and uninteresting, but the plot was virtually non-existant. More tiring than \\"Wuthering Heights\\" by Emily Bronte, and more long-winded than Hawthorne's \\"The Scarlet Letter\\", this book had little to please. The characters were shallow and undeveloped, and the storyline jumped erratically from one situation to another, without giving any explanation. Futhermore, the actual settings were undeveloped and lacking.If you are looking for entertaining, well-written or profound literature, look elsewhere. This material simply does not live up to timeless Sci-Fi classics such as Orwell's \\"1984\\", or Heinlein's \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\"... stay away from this unless you are some kind of boredom masochist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Does Everyone Love this Book??","review":"I must say I was excited to read this book seeing all the awards and praise it has received. However, I found this to be the most boring, uneventful book I have read in years. I kept thinking it HAS to get better, something HAS to happen, but it just doesn't... It's like a 300 page description of paint drying - only \\"in threes.\\" Even the ending was basically another big non-event. NOTHING!! I can't possibly recommend this book. The premise was great, and offered limitless possibilities. Unfortunately, NOTHING happens... Very sorry to have wasted my time with this book. I don't understand why it is so highly praised...."},{"rating":"1","title":"You won't need your brain for this one.","review":"not that the book is badly written, but things kinda just happen one after the other. the perfect crew is available for the perfect mission and as and when problems happen you can be sure there will be a crazy solution in the next page. Clarke basically spoon-feeds you the story and even wipes your lips for you at the end.Skip it. It's not worth the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"So why isn't this on Kindle?","review":"This story is supposed to be one of Arthur C. Clarke's grandest work..so why isn't it available on Kindle? What a shame that it isn't. There's no option to request this be done in kindle form, either..as though Kindle isn't good enough.I'd like to comment on the actual story, but I suppose I'll have to wait till the powers to be decide to allow it. Yes, I'll rate it...with one star.. to bring this shameful oversight to the attention of the publishers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, very interesting world......","review":"I like most of Clark's other work and gave this a try. It was a solid choice and I finished it pretty quickly which indicates that I really liked it. The characters are not the most interesting people in the universe, but the Rama object and mystery surrounding it were very gripping and had me anticipating each new adventure with plenty of enthusiasm. Clark describes Rama perfectly and I could actually see the images he was describing.

Rama II in 1992 and I've just read the 3rd & 4th books in the series. The one thing I was continually confused about was the topography of the Interior of the Rama craft. Was any one else or am I the only one continually getting lost in the Octospiders lair and trying to puzzle out the Avians domain?Is Dr Tagashaki's book of Maps on the interior coming out before 2130 ?And DID Nicole really have to die ? I get her point though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is definately a sci fi novel that encourages one to think \\"outside of the box\\". The usual bombardment that we recieve from movies and TV showcasing aliens with all-too-human emotions has become tiresome. I encourage any book to show aliens as what they are - aliens. Why would they be pre-disposed to have emotions such as anger, hate, love, fear, etc...? Would it not be possible for a race to evolve with a different set of emotions?Anyhow, this book is just one more step towards really understanding the random possibilities that alien life would offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cant wait to see the movie!!!","review":"I just finished reading this sci-fi classic and it was one of the best books I have ever read. I usually take my time reading books but I finshed this one in four days. From the discussions of world leaders to the discovery sequences inside the gigantic Rama space ship, the book had me hooked. I also found out recently that this book is going to be made into a movie starring Morgan Freeman and directed by David Fincher. If it is anything close to the book, its gonna be one awesome film!!

I've read this book a number of times since it first came out. Tragically, the sequels fell flat on their face and were nothing more than parts of a poorly conceived soap opera. I've seen enough tragedy in real life. SF should be an escape from that, not a slide into the depths of it. Besides, I find it inconceivable that the creator of the universe would have to infest his creation with nodes and prime monitors in order to keep track of what is going on. If God can create the universe, he surely knows how to create one that is in Harmony with itself, if he/she so chose to."},{"rating":"1","title":"The slightly unimpressive start of a reborn series.","review":"RAMA was not as impressive as some of Clarke's other works. Yet, it has been used as the basis for another series of sequels.

Instead I eagerly flipped page after page to find out in the end I was very dissapointed with the book.

The characters are rather two dimensional, and not once during the entire story could I bring myself to care about what happened to any of the characters. I've heard a lot of praise for books written by Arthur C. Clarke, so I tried to like \\"Rendezvous With Rama\\".

A must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short of its promise","review":"While I did eventually read the entire book, it took me a long while to get to the end. The story itself was a good premise, but I found that the writing was rather dull and uninspiring. The story of mankind's first encounter with extra-terrestrials should be an exciting and gripping story. Unfortunately... this book falls short of that. \`Rendezvous With Rama' does start with some promise, but it ends with a barely audible whimper. I wish there was something positive I could say about this book, but to be honest, I cannot think of any positive points. Many people seem to like Arthur C. Clarke's writing, but based on this book, I doubt if I will pick up another one of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book must read rest of the series.","review":"Rondezvous with RAMA is a good book. It's about a group of people who live in 2100. They discover a spacecraft coming into view. They set out a team of perfesdsional crew to explore the cylindrical craft.

I am sure these thoughts will remain in the back of my mind for quite some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straightforward and Fascinating","review":"This was my first experience with the work of Arthur C. Clarke. I was not disappointed. This book is simple, straightforward science fiction. The prose is clear and engaging, but not especially artistic. The pace of the novel is excellent; the book pulls a reader along effortlessly. The characters, as noted elsewhere, are fairly one-dimensional. The strength of this novel is its fascinating premise, and the skill with which Clarke brings you into the world of Rama. Clarke is especially adept at describing this world. He does it so well that one could draw a map of it after reading the book. Still, attempting to visualize its wonders strains the imagination to its limit.All in all, an extremely interesting take on first contact, and a novel that can be easily understood by a middle schooler, but enjoyed by a reader of any age.

Some reviewers think this novel evokes an awesome sense of wonder, but all the characters are cardboard-cutouts, & if all they can do is gaze with awe & bow down 2 all the alien technology, what's the point? If the alien goodies evoke no emotional response in the human characters, why bother? Bsides, nothing is ever Xplained. Go read 2001 or CHILDHOOD'S END instead, they're both pretty great.

Today, I am buying the audio version (I've read the book a few times but not for along time) and although I was ultimately disappointed by the sequels (kind of like jaws2-?? versus Jaws 1) this book still sticks in my mind. And I don't have very many books that do (Princess of Mars, Tunnel in the Sky, The Hobbit, Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell, War of the Worlds, ect) and even though I used to say Arthur C Clarke was my favorite there were quite a few of his books I just couldn't get into.But this book is unique.

Although I felt that the \\"oh no heroine might be compromised marry her off quickly\\" story line was somewhat repetitive between this installment and Emerald Ring, the stories of Henrietta and Miles vs. Letty and Geoff were different enough to keep me intrigued.

As with any \\"chick lit\\" book, you know you're not in for a novel worthy of a Nobel Prize in literature. I don't know that I would call it clever, like I saw in another review. Novel idea, maybe. But, I still found the book entertaining.In this second book of the series, I related a lot more to the historical heroine, Henrietta. A lot of Willig's female characters seem to be ditzes seriously lacking any independent spirit, including the modern grad student, Eloise. Kind of surprising from an author who graduated from an Ivy League school. Speaking of which, I like the idea of the dual plot line with Eloise, but it's slow sometimes & kind of like watching paint dry. And she is seriously neurotic - I'm embarrassed for her sometimes.All in all, still worth a read if you're a follower of Willig's series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Parody!","review":"I seem to have a knack for starting a series with the second book instead of the first,and then hopping back and forth through the run, so I appreciate a series that allows me to do that. I had no problem picking this one up and going with it, so that's a big point in its favor.What I ended up loving about it more than anything else was it's sense of fun and its willingness to skewer just about everything in its path: modern romance novels, chick lit, modern historical fiction, bodice-rippers, academia, and eighteenth century adventure and romance novels among them. It's a big leap to make your leads so clueless that they can't see that the passion they have for each other is mutual, but it pays off. I haven't laughed so much in ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously lacking","review":"I avoided the Pink Carnation for a long time because it was a \\"popular\\" book, and my preferences rarely run with the crowd. Still, people assure me that popular books are popular for a reason, and so I picked it up and mostly enjoyed it.This book was a watered down version of the Pink Carnation story, and I regret that I wasted my time actually finishing it. The main characters are both cartoonish and ridiculous, and I felt as if I were being dragged through a fluffy romance novel with no semblance of a plot whatsoever. By the end of the book I was sticking with it just for the hope of a decent sex scene, but even that was ruined by the totally out of character behavior of our proper English girl, who brazenly encouraged behavior that, while normal in our times, would have been somewhat deviant back then.The book was fluffy, the spy intrigue was an afterthought, and the sex was out of character and boring to boot.

I used 1/4 tsp in a gallon of water and give them all a good drink each time I water. I added plant food at the same time, since this doesn't feed them. I've fed my plants every 2-4 weeks for years, so the difference this time is the Superthrive vitamin and hormone I added. I'm really happy with it, and plan to use it when we start our garden plants in the house next March. I'm also going to try it when rooting a cutting in a glass of water.

The story is elegant in setting and prose, and the characters are ghostly and enchanting as the story unfolds. What I love so much about this book is the beauty it projects that degrades into shocking horror. It's beautifully done and you find yourself enchanted and then shocked to the core as the story is unveiled.James Herbert at his very best, a must read if you like horror, thrillers or haunting ghost stories!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy haunted house story","review":"Haunted is a different type of James Herbert book as there is no violence and very little gore. Although I did not enjoy it as much as I enjoyed some of his other books such as \\"Rats\\" or \\"The Fog\\" I still thought this book was enjoyable as it built up a lot of mystery and suspense and parts of it had me gripped.Because the book is only 240 pages it is a quite read and so Herbert successfully manages to keep the suspence through the story and althought I thought some of the plot twists were a little predictable, this is still a good book which i enjoyed.I would recomend this book to anyone who is a fan of James Herbert or of haunted house stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Rubbish!","review":"Please don't waste your time and/or money on this truly awful book. It's plagiarism at it's worst. Think for a moment to every mystery/horror story you have ever read and enjoyed. Now imagine the dung heap that could be created if someone took bits and pieces of those stories and cobbled them all together - Badly!The writing is poor and the cohesiveness is non-existent, in fact it distinctly feels like the author changed his mind several times throughout the story before he gave up and just ended it. And then it somehow got published without the services of an editor.If you are like me and you like your storylines to make sense, pass on this one. In fact maybe pass on this author all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is the last time I am going to read a book with a Stephen King reccomendation on the cover. After the tedious The Ruins, I thought I'd give Haunted a try. I more or less enjoyed Herbert's Sepulchre, though the twist ending was apparent about half way through the story. It didn't take nearly that long to figure this one out. There are so many things that don't work in this book it's hard to know where to start, but probably the most egregious is the pointless b-plotline that is too obviously padding inserted into a too short book. The attempted twists and turns, the cliche characterization, the back story, are all laid on so thick that this reads more like a story from the pulps of the 1930s rather than a modern novel. The main character stumbles about, noting all kinds of strange phenomena and clues without ever getting a hint of what is obvious from the first moment he steps into Edbrook. I'll give Herbert another chance or two, but I am not optimistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand all the 5 star reviews....","review":"I hate being the lone disenter, but while this book had some good points, it certainly wasn't great. The main character wasn't very sympathetic, the premise struck me as odd (a para-normal investigator who doesn't believe in \\"ghosts\\" but does believe in appartitions....what?), the relationships were underdeveloped, and the conclusion was so heavily hinted at I figured most of it out shortly after the arrival to the haunted house. I won't discuss the ending, but it also left me puzzeled, as no reason was given as to why a specific character hated the main character SO much.All in all, good atmosphere, some spooky situations, but disjointed story."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective, cheaply made Real Cooking Time Kiddie Kitchen","review":"I recieved this product and was very disapointed in the quality of it.

Many years after the last kinks album, ray davies returns with his first ever solo album and its a winner. His writing is still very sharp and his vocals are right on, his band is good, never overwhelms the material. It would be nice once in a while on a song to hear the dave davies guitar bust and the interplay between them, but lo and behold this isnt a kinks record.As soon as I put the cd on, there was a big smile on my face and it didnt waver thru the cd.

Heru Ptah has not only captured the true nitty gritty essence of the \\"hip hop industry\\", but created memborable/complex characters in the storyline. This book will definitely be a classic, it's the first real novel about hip hop and mc battles.

I was very sad when my most favourable character left the scene. I felt that the book showed me a different side to love, the fact of being in love and being loved. I felt that I learnt a lot from reading this book.The book is remarkable, reading the book helped me identify with the characters and i felt that the book dealt with a lot of issues which were important to todays society. The issues are important to explore, to give an insight to the readers. After reading the book I feel like i needed another book to fill the void of this book.This has been my best buy to date.

Henry's books are not only informative to anyone interested in horsemanship, but they comprise a trilogy which chronicles his adventures as a horse trainer in England. Henry's accounts are adventurous with generous doses of wisdom and wit throughout.I strongly suggest the reader progress through Henry's work in sequential order; Talking With Horses, Thinking With Horses and Horse Sense. By doing so the reader can enjoy the greater adventure in chronological sequence and fully enjoy the colorful characters, both human and equine, that Henry brings to life in his work.Henry Blake is probably my most recommended author for horse enthusiasts and home horse trainers to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riding horses?","review":"Riding horses?

The reality here is do these specific essences work? We have seen no evidence that they do.

I am going to take it to a bike shop to see if they can fix the issue. I ranked it two stars because the style and size is great and the training wheels are far superior to those on my son's wal-mart Hot wheels bike. The price was competitive and we wanted something that we could pass on to others or keep for grandkids...we'll see if we can fix it.

Now that it is winter - she won't be using it all that much, but she loves to get on it.

Thirdly, the tires are solid, not air filled. The ride is harsh and the tires don't grip like real rubber tires do, so starting and stopping are more frustrating than they need to be.

Also, the front headset is only a piece of nylon plastic. There are no ball bearings. This bike will last one kid, but won't make it to any antique markets. You get what you pay for.

These stories demonstrate the internal collapse of a great mind; a mind great enough to observe its own maker. Yet for the reader who has been through such a sensation Kafka is supreme. He offers easy to read stories with almost unmatched complexities. I guess in many ways he represents what is buetiful about our deaths; a buety I must admit my daily life does not always allow me to appreciate and corraspond with. Never the less I must praise him in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review of the book, not the author.","review":"Let me preface this very negative review with this: I love Kafka. He's a great author and the shortcomings of this book, this book in particular, are not his.That said, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! Whatever archaic methods the publisher, Schocken, uses to bind its books is in desperate need of revitalization. Within 1 week of purchasing this book it was threatening to fall to pieces. Within 2 weeks it became 4 volumes--it yet threatens to break into a weekly series.If you enjoy breaking the binding on your paperbacks for easy reading beware, this book is poorly bound and breaking the binding, or even opening it much past 180 degrees, will cause the book to break asunder.Buy these stories, just don't buy them in this book.

In particular, the ultra-short ones, \\"A Message From the Emperor\\" and \\"Before the Law\\" made me realize the way in which a writer can create. I read them and imagine a blank page before him. Within the page, or two, he created something which has been burnt into the minds of those who have read it. Oddly enough, these stories have led me to consider extremely long works (such as Anna Karenina or Crime and Punishment) as, quite possibly, not worth the time. I only think that way every other day though.Besides the fabulous ultra-shorts, the just-plain-regularly-short length stories are brilliant. (please don't use that term incorrectly. I'm trying to introduce it worldwide. Just kidding.) \\"Josephine the Singer\\" is my favorite short story and my favorite work of Kafka's. I believe it was his final work as well. It is absolutely bizarre, but powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive buy","review":"This is the best book of Kafka's works for any true reader of Kafka's works.

First, the battery-powered sprayer arrived with dead batteries and once I installed new ones the spray was a bit less powerful than needed. I used it on a badly oxidized Toyota 4-Runner. Using it straight without any prep to the surface produced an expected dull but smooth finish. Then I used a rubbing compound and applied the liquid diamond finish and it brought it back to near new condition. My overall impression is that this is a great product if used as a finishing glaze. It is easy to apply with the somewhat gimmicky applicator and requires little, if any, buffing. I don't know how well it holds up over time but the Zymol I was using only held up for about 3 months and required some work to apply and buff off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"I used this on my very faded Corolla, and it had water beads the next rain!

I went to Panama, to Barro Colorado Island where Warder Clyde Allee (1885-1955) and Marjorie Hill Allee (1890-1945) travelled. I went to tropical Mexico and tropical Africa. For the past 32 years I have been in the Brazilian Amazon. There was indeed something special in this book, luckily made available again in pdf form from The Biodiversity Heritage Library."},{"rating":"2","title":"From The Heart","review":"This book is a treasure. The author has reached back in time to a place in her mother's childhood. She writes about the subject in a simple heartfelt way that any child or adult can relate to. I found the Lesson Plans in the back of the book perfect for home schooling or extra credit projects. All five of my grandchildren love their copies and read them over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasurable Read","review":"The book shows that a journalist wrote it. That wasn't meant to be as backhanded as it seems. The stories about Clinton et al are those we can recall, this isn't a back room exposé full of conspiracy theory.A good journalist (at least) writes as if he has something to tell you. Only in the last chapter does Klein really subject the reader to an opinion piece.If you were alive at all for the eight years of Clinton's presidency then...no, none of this is really \\"new\\" or \\"insightful\\" but I, for one, found it none the less interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fair but ultimately very sad book","review":"Joe Klein takes a detailed, dispassionate look at the Clinton Presidency. He takes great pains to put it in perspective, both generational (Baby Boomers take over from the WWII Generation) and international (pre-9/11). He acknowledges that it took Clinton a while to get a handle on being President, and bemoans how much was opportunity was squandered because of the President's own failings. Yes, Klein opines (and I agree) that Bill Clinton is one of the most staggeringly bright and naturally gifted men to ever hold the White House. But he also nails Clinton on character issues, even beyond Monica Lewinsky (once referring to the President as \\"a bimbo when he comes to flattery\\"). When you're done with the book, you appreciate all the nuanced things Clinton accomplished, but you're heartbroken over what he could have done, if not for the inexcusable distractions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid book","review":"Joe Klein writes a good and informative book about the Clinton Presidency. At times the structure of the book seems a bit illogical, but what it lacks here is made up for in terms of anecdotes and good analytic work by Klein."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think so...","review":"I think a rating of one star is a little too generous, but I guess I didn't have much choice. In short, this book is a big pat on the back to try an elevate Clinton to the ranks of more notable (not to mention more honest and qualified) former presidents.... Great read for your most radically liberal friends who are constantly trying to make it seem as if Clinton was America's unsung savior."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS BOOK","review":"In fact, I've written to Doubleday asking for a refund. There is not a single new fact, concept or idea anywhere on the 217 pages of this major disappointment. This book is like reading back issues of newspapers -- after you've read them the first time! Klein also has a disturbing inclination (via multiple references) to pooh-pooh ethical lapses of government officials by trivializing them in the overall scheme of things.Unacceptable. Too bad,as I enjoyed \\"Primary Colors\\" but this is a cheap follow up."},{"rating":"1","title":"too short, unorganized","review":"I got the impression that Mr. Klein just threw together a bunch of odds & ends he had left over from another book and notes -- the way they made the movie \\"Midway\\" out of edit-outs from \\"Tora, Tora, Tora!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this!","review":"When I was really young, I used to bet the other children that I could swallow loose change.

How kind of you Mr. Klein, to write The Natural.Please Mr. Klien don't do us anymore favors. Leave our PresidentClinton alone.

Wonderful book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, done that","review":"The book provides some lovely and inspiring photographs, but ultimately the book is, as a whole, hollow and disappointing. What Porter peddles as unique and original are actually standard craft and decorating ideas (candles, books, crystal chandeliers), and she provides precious little practical advice for transforming ideas into reality.If you're a Tracy Porter fan looking for new material, beware: Approximately 17 of the photos and corresponding instructions are projects that have already appeared on her website over the past couple of years. Or, if you have a limited amount of money to spend on books, you might want to just check out the website instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumble Book","review":"I just recently purchased this book. I have to say I was disappointed. Although there were some nice pictures I found her style to be jumbled.Very few ideas, and those that are there looks like an afterthought.

If you want it, buy it used."},{"rating":"1","title":"there are far better books out there","review":"I got this book, and realized I made a mistake almost immediately.I gave it a chance. I really did.But the photography was completly insane. Grossly over done - wide apertures, etc. And what you want to see was not clear.So, don't buy this book expecting to see anything useful. Besides not being able to actually see the ideas, they are so [bad]. What do you want to cover a tin can with fabric for? Buttons on lampshades? Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very realistic","review":"This book is not for everyone, as the title promises. its not for people who don't live with men, children, in suburbs or normal houses. Lots of this vignettes look messy, dirty, and frumpy. Grandma style doesn't sell homes or impress anyone with an ounce of design savvy. Who paints their walls dark purple and hangs pictures up with thumbtacks and calls it design? Who glues beads to their door knobs? She is one of many designer who tell others to decorate one ridiculous way, while living in another completely different way."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing new","review":"I have to say I was disappointed with this book. I can't believe that Tracy Porter can live in a house decorated like hers with three small children. She must be living in a fantasy world just as she aspires to. I actually did read through the whole book and found nothing unusual or creative in Tracy's tips section or in the \\"make it section\\". In fact, maybe I should write a book.

I don't think I'd trust anything cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described","review":"I ordered two of these. I like the one in the picture because you do not have to worry about big plug ins taking up 1/2 of the strip. However, I did not receive the one that is described. I received two totally different protectors. But instead of taking the time to return it, I'm keeping and using them.

I grew up receiving items manufactured under this name as my daughters. So when it came time to get my grandson his first bike this is the first company I thought of for my purchase. When the bike arrived yesterday, I was showing another member of my family what our grandson was getting for Christmas. I was deeply concerned with a warning on the bottom of the box. This bike does not have brakes. I can't believe that any bike would be manufactured without brakes. Tricycles, yes but bicycles? No where in the product description does it state this warning. So now I have to return this product and try to find another bike that has coaster brakes. I have to wonder how many other descriptions conveniently leave out product warnings as was in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small for 3-4 year olds","review":"I bought this bike thinking it was the next step up from a tricycle. I wanted a small bike so that it would be easier for my daughter to learn to ride first. I figured she would grow out of it in a year but didn't mind since my son could use it next. (I had a hard time finding a gender neutral bike otherwise.)The bike was like those bikes you see in the circus where the rider is riding a teeny-tiny bike. It looked like a toy.This is the only gripe I have with buying something online. You can't really judge the size online.If you want this for a 2 year old (instead of a tricycle) it would be fine. Anyone older I would say it is a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adorable but way too heavy (and, no, there are no breaks....","review":"We bought this bike for our son a year ago, for his third birthday. I liked that it was a nice small size and the look was gender neutral and gorgeous. However, we have been very disappointed with the bike's performance. It is just so HEAVY. My son has a really hard time getting going on it and going uphill just doesn't seem to work for him on this bike. One mistake that I won't make again is trying to surprise him with the bike and not trying it out ahead of time in the store. We will soon buy him a new bike and this time will take him to a real bike shop to be fitted and to try out the bike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, til it fell apart!","review":"I purchased this bike for my son on clearance at Target for $[...]. You get what you pay for!I kept it outside, well it is a bike...an outside toy! It rusted in no time, wish I had known that prior, I would have sprayed it with some rustoleum first. But that's not the worst of it, the brace plate covering the chain fell off within 2 weeks and so did the plates that cover the top part of the wheels. No more protection for my son's fingers. This is actually a real cute bike and easy for my son to ride, but it is made real junky...I would have expected much more from an old company with a gret reputation (why I purchased this brand). I have the plastic wagon and it has held up great, easy to wash down and it hasn't fallen apart...perhaps b/c it is plastic and not metal. Overall, I was disappointed in this purchase. Looking to buy a bew bike for my son now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"My son received this bike for his third birthday. The first time he saw it his eyes were as big as saucers! This classic bike is not only extremely cute, but it seems to be quite durable and safe. His little sister can't wait to take it for a ride and I love the fact that it can be handed down because it is very unisex and definelty a classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this model!!!!","review":"We have this model and the chain keeps falling off due to the fact that the chain is attached to the training wheels and it has a movable back wheel, so when the wheel gets loose the chain falls off. I don't know why it is not stationary but it is not, the back wheel spokes are open so that part moves and chain falls. So every time this happens you have to loosen the back wheel and pull it so that you can then retighten it and then hope it doesn't happen again. Which it will because if anyone with some weight on them rides it, it moves the back wheel again. This bike is not worth it, please do no buy it, it will only give you headaches. You have been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bike for a 2 year old","review":"My 21 mo old got this for Christmas. It is SO cute. He only wanted to sit on it and ring the bell the first few days, but now almost 2 weeks later, he is starting to pedal backwards, so I know he'll be pedaling forward very soon. He is tall for his age(around 37 in) and can reach the pedals(but barely), without the plastic cover installed under the seat. An inch shorter and he probably wouldn't reach. It doesn't have breaks, as other reveiwer's mentioned, but I don't really see a need for breaks when it has the training wheels on since it doesn't go too fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belkin SurgeMaster F9H320-CW 3-Outlet Wall-Mount Surge Protector","review":"This is a fantastic product to use for applications when your not using alot of electronics.

I like APC."},{"rating":"1","title":"deceptive description, misleading photograph","review":"Had to return this product when it would not mount on a wall socket to protect against wall current surges, which is what you would expect with the product name and appearance in the photo.

I looked at the picture of this and thought it was something you could plug into the wall to get more outlets out of one outlet. That is not the case. I have no idea what it actually does (something to do with modems and/or phones because it has a bunch of phone jacks on it) since I don't see how you can even supply it power. So, take heed and make sure you actually know what this is before you order it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Live performances are not what Deep Forest excels at...","review":"I find this album unlistenable. As someone who enjoys the first album (Deep Forest), and even parts of the second (Boheme), but detests the third (Comparsa), I had my doubts before listening to \\"Made in Japan.\\" Unfortunately, these doubts were well founded.Most of Deep Forest's appeal comes from their meticulous manipulation of samples and the rich, spacious atmosphere of their recordings. This live album strips away all of that, leaving behind mere skeletons of the original songs.The vocal samples (which are the most fun part of DF's albums) are replaced by live people who cannot replicate the exotic otherworldly-ness of the originals.The result is a painful hodgepodge of keyboard noodling and cheerful-but-awful imitations of DF's original tracks. Sad but true."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEEP FORREST","review":"WELL I LIKE THEIR CD BUT I WAS DISSAPOINTED BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE LIVE PERFORMANCES ON CDS WHERE EVERYONE IS CLAPPING AND SHOUTING.

I found it to be a fresh look at the wonderful music of their previous three albums. It was as rich a blend of EuroDance and native music as they've ever done, and the live vocals added extra spice. Go get it. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do much for me","review":"I had heard a couple of Deep Forest's numbers on youtube and liked them, so I picked this album up. Unfortunately, though, I didn't like it.I don't exactly know how to describe it. There are a lot of diverse sounds, and someone is singing, perhaps in some foreign language, or perhaps just in syllables, I don't know. There are some kind of rock guitar interludes, but that's not the whole thing. There are audience noises.Perhaps it was different if you were there in the audience, or perhaps I'm too old for this -- or perhaps I just like a different sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Escape into Ethnic Fusion","review":"Deep Forest has tribal textures with soothing melodious moments and earthy comfort.

Not only does it cover some of the films released by Japan Shock Video (\\"Naked Blood\\", \\"Mermaid In A Manhole\\", \\"Entrails Of A Vergin\\") but it also gives you a brief history of \\"pink films\\", exposes the Japanese fascination with fetisches of all kinds and shows some of the differences between Western and Japanese culture.While it offers only a few answers to why films like \\"Raping Female University Students\\" or \\"Rapeman\\" are tolerated in Japanese society, I'd say it's a good start for someone wanting to understand a culture so very different from ours.Since most movies are mentioned with both English and Japanese titles, it is also a good book for film collectors - for me it's more or less a shopping list.\\"Eros In Hell\\" - approved."},{"rating":"1","title":"This specific model doesn't fit a 2003 explorer","review":"I've used Wagner brake pads on all my cars and I love them, they've never let me down.

In fact, half way through the CD I found myself asking \\"hey, where's the mandolin, fiddle, cello and flute?\\" This CD is so one dimensional it's annoying.

He is one of a handful of contemporary novelists and short story writers who never let me down, who are consistently intelligent, original, thoughtful. And entertaining. \\"The Speed of Light\\" is, for me, his best, most accomplished piece of writing. The story may be about young adolescents, but the novel's natural audience is adults, and why it was marketed as young adult literature is beyond me. In point of fact, young adults would miss much of the humor and irony of the story. No, this is a book for grownups who have lived enough life to be able to reflect on the innocence and idiocies of childhood.

The Authors views are very very similar to my own. I strongly agree with many of the statements and descriptions that the author makes in this book. There are a few things that the author talks about that never did come to fruition (like engineers playing an important role in todays political scene) but this does not in any way hurt the other messages the book portrays.Again I would strongly recommend this book to students entering or currently enrolled in the study of engineering.

Whether you accept Him as your savior or not, his existence is thoroughly documented in many sources, including from those who were hostile to him and would have preferred he didn't exist - the Romans and the Jews. We have many reliable ancient Roman and Jewish texts from the time period of Jesus that corroborate his life and the message of the Gospels.Only the most rabid, fanatical atheists deny the existence of Jesus.

I thought the authors might try and glamorize criminal life, but after reading Charley FLoyd's story, I'd want to grow up to be anything but an outlaw. The chapters are short, quick, but affecting, sort of the way life is when you're young and in a hurry to grow up. I've read LAST PICTURE SHOW and LONESOME DOVE and loved them; nothing will ever be as great as LONESOME DOVE, but this book ranks right up there with the rest of McMurtry's stories. The characters are colorful, flawed, makes you wish their lives had taken a far different turn (especially Charley and Ruby). Highly recommended!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PRETTY BOY FLOYD (LARRY MCMURTRY AND DIANA OSSANA","review":"THIS BOOK IS NOT PROOF READ PRIER TO SALES.BAD SPELLING, NEW PARAGRAPHS WHICH JUMP FROM ON END OF THE STORY INTO ANOTHER FIELD ALL TOGETHER WITH OUT ENDING OR STARTING THE STORY.THE WRITERS TREAT THERE READERS LIKE THEY ARE CHILDREN AND THIS IS A CHILDS STORY SO THEY PUT IT INTO CHILD READING TERMS.THIS BOOK NEVER GETS OUT OF THE BORING STAGES AND INTO MORE INTERESTING READING ABOUT HIM UNTIL THE LAST FEW PAGES OF THE WHOLE BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Larry....you're much better as a solo act","review":"Since Larry McMurtry was listed as one of the authors of this book, I picked it up and thought I would enjoy it. Boy, was I ever wrong. \\"Lonesome Dove\\" was a masterpiece, and so are the other McMurtry books I've read - but this, by comparison, is amateur night. The writing is stiff and reads like something McMurtry might have written when he was just starting out - and then threw in the trash.Forgive me, Mr. McMurtry, but you're much better as a solo act, and I'm only sorry that you're not going to write any more novels about that wonderful pair, Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninteresting","review":"McMurtry and Ossana have written a novel that is wholly uninteresting. I'm given to believe that Pretty Boy Floyd is something of a legend, and this novel does very little to tell me why he attained that status. Most of the novel focuses on his exploits with various lovers, rather than on his bank-robbing, which would be fine if there were any more depth to the romantic entanglements than there is to the short-shrifted heists. Worst of all, Floyd himself is a blank. We don't understand why the people close to him remain devoted to him, and therefore I have no idea why I should care about him. All in all, this is a boring novel, and a big disappointment given that one of the authors is McMurtry, who is one of the better novelists America has ever produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful retelling of a Russian Cinderella story.","review":"This is a delightful tale for children in early grade school. Younger children will enjoy the realistic and warm illustrations by Diane Stanley. This story tells the tale of a young girl who is forced to go out in a January storm by her stepmother to look for flowers for her stepsister. While stumbling around in the snow, she meets all twelve Month Brothers, representing all the months of the year. My 8 year old has checked this book out of the school library so many times that we are finally purchasing the book for our personal library. That is the highest recommendation any author can get, the repeated reading by a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"My headline is that Amazon never managed to get this to me!","review":"I ordered this. I received a 'brochure' type thing that appeared to go with a Britannica encyclopedia. I sent it back. I then received the CD-ROM for this, and not the book. It is a CD-ROM for a PC, and I have a Mac. I sent it back (again having talked to someone at Amazon about the problem). I then received the CD-ROM for PC AGAIN. I told whomever I spoke wth in customer service that I wasn't going to send it back, but that I wanted my money back. So this is how it was left. Gee, I wish there was some way I could get the book! I can't order it from you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful mushrooms","review":"I have purchased many porcini mushrooms in grocery and gourmet stores. These were the best quality (flavor and shape). The price was excellent as well. I added some to a fresh mushroom soup I made and got an incredible depth of flavor. Have also used them in braised beef dishes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swerving of the Arts","review":"Out of all of Sheri-D Wilson's four published books of poetry, my most loved is her second, Swerve. This work is purely transendental. It merges both her brilliant talent for rhythmical poetry , alive with action and sparks, and her obvious internal knowledge of the stage. The continual metaphors of this book show a dedication to the oral tradition in poetry, taking the reader inward in a burst of colorful motion, then spewing out the dynamics in gesticulation of the written word. Minds who claim that poetry is purely for academic stiffs, prepare to be taken where the lyrical sounds of a modern day female writer will take you, --the stillness in between pulse beats is only a momentary illusion--but swift enough to make the open minded among us dance with the power of poetry. Recommended to those looking to explore both poetry, and acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good UFO Documentary","review":"Decent production with interviews from leading UFO researchers plus some of the last footage of the late Col. Corso, author of:The Day After Roswell."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best DVD on the subject out there.","review":"I own probably 10 UFO dvd's - - and this one, by far, is the best of all of them ! The interview with Colonel Philip Corso in the \\"special bonus material\\" section was truly superb. GREAT research went into this marvelous movie. This DVD won two EBE awards.

Alexie's prose is beautifully simple with a rhythm they can sway to. Have them use his text as a model for their own personal narratives...and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lone Ranger and Tonto a poetic eye opener","review":"I first read a snippit of Sherman Alexie's work in my English class a supplement to a novel we were reading and I had always wanted to read one of his books since. Well I finally got a hold of this one and I couldn't put it down. It is written so fluidly that it is obvious he is a poet and the stories are interesting and subtle. Each story conveys Alexie's life philosophies and some interesting insight on the fate of the Native Americans in today's society. Although at times it can be depressing this book is written with a touch of black humor and sometimes you can't help but laugh at the ironies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"The author's introduction is well worth reading; it made me want to jump into the book. This book could only have received a lot of attention because of the author and unique title. Must have been very cathartic for author S. Alexi. Very disappointing. My two stars are only for the writing. One or two of the stories would have been more than enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alexie","review":"I have read most of the books Alexie has written. This one is particularly enjoyable. It is funny easy reading and gives one a lot to think about. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant \\"must read\\" book","review":"I bought this book in part because the title is irresistable and I had heard an interview with the author. I believe its the first book he published. These short stories of life on the rez,have recurring characters, and many are clarly autobiographical. Yet they are completely accessible, universal and beautifiully written. It's fabulous book which will cause you to think about the vignettes he's just presented you, the lost way of life of Indians, the current life of Indians--the functional and disfunctional sides, and the role of whites in making it happen and perpetuating it. It's a great and beautiful read from a major talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"no","review":"Not the greatest book but I needed it for class so I had no choice but to buy it. Don/t recommend"},{"rating":"1","title":"?","review":"I found this book to have interesting parts but it was pretty confusing and thats why i put a question mark for the title. If the book had one focused theme or if the author made it easier for you to be able to tell who the narrator is it would have been a much more understood book and easier. The author would give good detailed conversations. Such as when they took a drug and they were describing what they saw. It made the reader seem as if he was right there listening to the conversation. The author could have been a little more thoughtful of how well the reader would understand the book. He had no central plot and and it kind of seemed more like some type of a documentary were they just record daily, what the characters do. Overall it was an ok book, but it could have been reader friendly and have some type of theme or plot that sticks out more boldly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrically Exquisite","review":"This book is a must have for anyone who loves a story where the words roll right off the page. Wonderful stories that can only be amplified by watching Smoke Signals which is based on this collection. A friend turned me onto alexie and now I'll be buying it all up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Wolfe was wrong.","review":"Having spent my teenage years on the Nez Perce Reservation to the south of the Spokanes, I was sadly reminded of life there. I found very little humor in the book. Too many of the people, characterised in this collection of short stories reminded me of those who are still there. I fall into the heading as one of the urbans according to Alexie's definition. And as much as I have tried to forget, I am haunted by the memories of those I left."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indians Survival in America","review":"I rated this book, The Lone Ranger and Tonto FistFight in Heaven, two stars. It wasn't very interesting and I couldn't really connect with words. Few of the chapters left me confused and pondering. This book consisted of twenty-three different tales each relating about Indians. The main points that were established throughout the book were about how Indians got discriminated against by whites. Another point made about Indians was how they overcame their sorrows by drinking, telling stories, and trying to have a good time while living on the reservation. But overall the author does make some good points and analogies about Indians' struggle to make it in the world. I just felt it could've been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very mediocre book","review":"The vignette is the last refuge of the scoundrel, or at most a struggling writer like Sherman Alexie. The stories in this book are filled with characters drinking and dreaming of their horse riding pasts, complaining about the Washington Redskins. What else is new? Can't Alexie get over these stereotypes and invent more interesting things for his readers? This is not a book, but a diary filled with random observations. The prose is very confusing and unimpressive, giving the readers a worse impression of Native Americans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parents Beware!","review":"My son was required to read this book for his freshman high school class. It is full of the f-word and other foul language. It also is replete with drugs, binge drinking, and overt sexual situations among teens. I am totally mystified as to why this book is taught in schools AT ALL! It sends mixed messages to teens, who are very vulnerable to such powerful imagery and may be influenced by it. Why fill our children's minds with garbage when there are so many brilliant and inspiring books to choose from?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Misperceiving in Birmingham!","review":"This is an excellent book. The author uses a series of vignettes to illustrate how one's attitude is shaped by one's perception of a situation. She also shows how healing can come from seeing a problem from another point of view. Each chapter is brief and clearly written and food for thought. This book would be ideal for a small discussion group. I have found it very helpful in dealing with \\"difficult\\" people, and have lent it to several people at work who have also enjoyed it. One word of warning: be careful who you lend it to: you'll never get it back! Buy an extra copy for your personal library."},{"rating":"2","title":"That Perception Thing!","review":"It's a very good read and I think the bright yellowcolour says it all - very upbeat, very inspirational.I really enjoyed it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware...rusts easily","review":"Terrible set. For the price you would expect it to, at least, not rust. Unfortunately, this set rusted the first time I put it in the dishwasher. Very disappointed. Cutting was inefficient at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Knife Set","review":"I bought this set because the price was so low for Henckel knives which are some of the best on the market. The knives are very sharp to the point where you have to be careful if you are not used to very sharp knives. I do have to sharpen once a year but this set has been a much needed upgrade in my kitchen. The handles are really easy to grip but I hand wash so they stay in good shape longer. I bought 3 other sets as gifts and everyone loves them and has them out on their counter tops. This is an amazing bargain if you don't want to spend more than $200 for a set of knives but still want great quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"knife set","review":"Purchased a set at a navy store in Virginia and I loved it so much I wanted to get one for my mom this mothers day. It was just as described, just like mine and for a cheaper price here on Amazon. These knives are super Sharp and look really nice in the block. Would buy again as another gift. Don't hesitate to buy, worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"J.A. Henckels","review":"I purchased this set from a now defunct seller. I had a GREAT experience with a set of dusty rose colored handle J.A. Henckels knife set 20 years ago. Unfortunately, some of the knives from that set disappeared, so I decided to replace my old set w/a a more modern, new black/stainless steel look. Bad choice, these rusted almost immediately. My previous dusty rose set was washed in the dishwasher and after 20 years, still have not rusted and are sharp and sturdy. I am very disappointed in this new modern set. They still handle well, cut, but I am constantly (even with handwashing) trying to remove rust stains. Thankfully, I still have a few of my old dusty rose set!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality knives","review":"I purchased these because I was familiar with J.A. Henckels and associated the name with quality. I figured that might hold true even with these inexpensive knives. Unfortunately, in this case, inexpensive truly was cheap. These knives are garbage. Rust started appearing almost immediately. The blades are stamped, not forged, and show imperfections out of the box. There are chips and bent areas near the point of the blade and the machining marks to make the \\"everedge\\" look very crude. I may be wrong, but I associate the low quality with these being manufactured in China rather than Germany. These no longer come out of the block and may soon simply go into the trash. I've gone back to my Cuisinart set of blades that is FAR superior in quality and craftsmanship. I'll keep my eyes open for genuinely quality knives made in Solingen."},{"rating":"1","title":"They work OK... for a while","review":"I have had this knife set for almost 3 years, and have been mostly pleased with their performance. I don't like that they're all serrated, but in general they worked pretty well. Unfortunately, the tips are now all bent and the tip of the paring knife has completely broken off. Knives ought to last for more than 3 years. These are obviously poorly made. Your money would be better spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price!","review":"I bought these knives about 3 months ago, and I love them! Yes, yes, they are all serrated, which is the reason I gave them 4 stars. I have never experienced \\"tearing\\" of my food, which some other reviewers have mentioned. Also, none of my knives have rust spots on them, but I have never put them in the dishwasher, and I wash them right after I use them.Definitely worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good looking and cutting knife set","review":"I ordered this set and was very excited because the price was very low compared to stores. It looks very nice and elegant and cuts very well. I love the serrated blades for tomatoes and onions which I chop a lot.I used it for cutting chicken with bones - the handle becomes a little slippery when its held with wet hands. But I like the way it cuts.On the whole good price and value and free shipping is the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Information","review":"I bought this knive set as a Christmas gift for my sister.

The knives tear food and do not make a clean cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it, even if it's cheap","review":"This is the worst knife set ever. The handles of the knives feel decent but the serrated blades don't cut well. It tends to shred instead. Like the other reviewers stated, my set also began to develop rust spots on several of the knives within the 1st month! My other knives...some also higher-end knives from Henckels... have never rusted and I care for all of them the same way. The best thing about this knife set is probably the metallic coated block that the knives are stored in. The knives themselves are totally lacking quality and they definitely give Henckels a bad reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I was lusting after this set of knives for my kitchen for the longest time, but after getting them as a gift and using them for about a year have found them to be not very good at all. The grip handles are great, but the blades are strangely perforated and they have all rusted! It says they are made of stainless steel, so why are they rusting? I was shocked to see this low level of qaulity from a company like Henckles. I really don't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chefs Knife Broke in Half on a Pepper","review":"I bought this set almost two years ago. It's true that the knives cut sort of \\"funny\\". Not a real clean cut. But the kicker is, I was chopping a red pepper for some chili, and the chef's knife snapped in half! It was not under much force, and in fact the knife was barely used. These are not good knives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great but rusts fast!","review":"On the first day of use, we managed to get rust spots on a couple of the knives. ON THE FIRST DAY! It was a wedding present so I couldn't return it. It was a huge disappointment because they really did look nice in the box.Oh and they cut fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad buy","review":"These knives are garbage.

That can be dangerous, I tell you from experience.I wanted to give them away to someone I know, but I don't think they deserve such a bad knife set. By the way, MADE IN CHINA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very pretty but no functionality","review":"I have owned these knives for over a year and i love the way they look on my counter.

I'm not a professional chef, but my wife and I enjoy cooking. I'm not good at sharpening knives and thought that this would be a good option for our needs. The knives feel and look cheap. The edge cuts well, but tends to be a bit grabby with certain substances like chicken breast or fibrous foods. Most disapppointing though is the spotting that's developed with washing. Yes, we put them in the dishwasher. At this price I'm not too concerned with the longevity of the product, but I expected them to last a bit longer the a month. They still cut well, they just don't look so hot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gift For My Friends","review":"My friends have a wonderful house, but the oldest (dullest) set of kitchen knives I have ever seen. I bought these for them as a gift and they were blown away. Best of all, they thought I spent a TON of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete garbage","review":"Do not buy this set. Henckels should be embarrassed for having their name associated with this garbage. I've had this set for about a month and it is anything BUT stainless. You would think the knives are made of iron, they rust so much. Complete waste of money. Knives can't be sharpened; they're all serrated. This is especially bad for the chef's knife. These are not quality made knives made in Germany that Henckels is famous for. These are cheap, and made-in-China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tips of knives bent and broke within a few weeks!","review":"I bought these knives for my wife's 40th birthday. I had heard great things about Henckels, and expected a decent set of knives, even though I understood it was not the top of their line.Still, I was surprised and dismayed when the tips of several knives bent after just a few weeks of normal use. When the tip of one steak knife broke and left a tiny metal fragment in the food I was preparing, I said enough and took the whole set back to the store for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst knives ever","review":"These are the worst knives I've ever owned.

I have owned henckels knives before and these are not even close to the same quality as previous purchases. After a couple of uses, they start to rust, cheap metal used for the knives. They are sharp, hense the one star, but other then that I would never purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't cut straight and annoying serrated edge","review":"We bought this knife set as our first \\"real\\" cutlery set after we got married... To its credit, its lasted two years, but they haven't been great. The blades don't cut straight, they cut more like a blade thats only been sharpened on one side. The serrated edges make it impossible to sharpen them, and they chunk-up anything soft you try to cut. Essentially we've have to keep our old knives as a backup to these. The rusting is our own fault for putting them in the dishwasher, though they stand up surprisingly well to it. The money would have been better spent on a much better knife set that would last longer and be less aggravating."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst knives ever","review":"I actually won this set at a work function and now after using them once I am giving them away. The box said that they are not recommended for left hand use. I am left handed but I even tried using my right hand just to see if it was different. No difference.

Lets get rid of these mediocre artists and save American musical environment forever. Joss Stone go do anything else, music it is not your job. You should consider that inside photo with that black man and think better about your real profession and about your real talent that is clear now to everyone.

If the interviews are correct and she did her own thing on \\"Introducing Joss Stone.\\" someone ought to introduce her to a songwriter, a business manager and a producer.

Just painful to listen to all the way around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunningly insignificant","review":"Ms. Stone has had a makeover. Most of what made her distinctive has been removed, and she now fits in quite well with the mass of copycat female singers.

This CD AND Joss Stone are totally overrated imo. Her previous album was a little better but this one was mediocore at best and nothing special about it.

She has thick vocal range with deep soul and feel and I am genuinely pleased with the sound she pulls off. I will check out her other works for sure.All the songs are at least good, but the standout is, by far, \\"Tell Me What We're Gonna Do Now\\".

I had been looking forward to receiving my copy of introducing Joss Stone for many weeks after making a pre-issue purchase.I couldn\`t believe my ears from the moment the too high bass notes hit me on the 1st track. It was badly balanced. I think the sound engineer got it totally wrong here. The only track which was of listening quality was \` Tell me Bout it\`. I am a great fan of Joss Stone, but I hope she doesnt release anything like this collection of downmarket numbers again. I will listen first before any purchases in the future. Let\`s have a sultry collection of old Jazz classics Joss."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's aight","review":"alot of Hype has been bestowed upon Joss stone since her debut album&so far she hasn't met the marks that she was suppose to reach. Problem here is that there aren't any real songs that I'd call songwriting. Vocally she has some moments,but the material her is either trying to maintain the 60's vibe she has been tagged with or the so-so attempts at modernizing her to sound like today. either way it's a mix bag&isn't convincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Good About This","review":"I really can't understand all of the adulation that is given Joss Stone. She's ok, at best, but very little of her work is even ok. I used to halfway like her, but that was very short-lived. Now, I think she's just another wanna-be. She sounds so phony and unnatural on this and really on her other 2 albums, even though they were a tad better. It looks like she's desperately trying to be something she isn't, nor ever will be. This album is atrocious and she's gone from bad to worse. There is nothing good to say about this CD, it screams \\"phoney\\" and \\"desperate\\". Don't waste your money on this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musical Kleenex","review":"Joss Stone's a decent singer, but shouldn't be writing songs; or releasing them. I couldn't find a single memorable tune here. I also thought her singing was too flamboyant, but perhaps it's to keep up with the heavy production, which is so overcooked it's insufferable. Next time Joss should try losing the rappers and the big beat overkill. As one critic wrote, \\"Sometimes it takes more balls to go it alone then with a whole crew.\\" I couldn't agree more. This album is like musical Kleenex, use it, then lose it. Better luck next time.On the other side of the coin, there's \\"The Orange Album\\" by Stefy (Rae) which is a stunning debut. Had Gwen Stefani made it, journalists would have called it a pop masterpiece. It's new artists like Stefy that could keep the music business afloat. Are we listening Ms. Stone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste","review":"I'm very disappointed with this album. It's a waste of money, and worse, it's a waste of talent. Although Joss Stone performs with perfect vocals, the hip-hop/rap style does not suit her. Some tracks needlessly feature a male rapper who drowns out Joss's voice easily, especially since the mix is poor and the the bass is overblown.I'm sad to see Joss Stone at the top of the slippery slide which leads to becoming one of the mass of untalented rappers and bimbos that pervade the commercial market. I hope this album is only a temporary aberration, but given the allure of the easy bucks that come from catering to the lowest common denominator, I wonder.I'll think more than twice about buying her next album, and certainly would not recommend this one to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoulda Listened","review":"I should have listened to samples of this recording before I bought it! If I had, I would not have bought it since I do not like it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Was She THINKING?","review":"I will never, ever buy another Joss album ever. I just knew her sound on the first two albums was going to be short lived and she would give into the pressure of being one of the \\"normal\\" R&B sounds that seems to be polluting the airwaves. I though this was gimmicky and I am truely a non-fan now. Waste your money on something else other than the insipid sounds of a washed-up wannabe singing to horribly put-together beats!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I did not like the the first songs.

She will go far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Great album. Heard her sing it live in Central Park (with Common) and it sounds even better in person. She is a beautiful songtress and has many strong lyrics, beats (thanks to Rafael Saadiq), and songs with other great artists (Lauryn Hill and Common). She even sounds better than many other black female singers whose music is already on the market. Joss can saaaaaaaaang!! It 'aint a color thing...it's a gifted thing. And she's only 19. She is doing big things at such a young age. God bless her soul, literally and figuratively!:) You won't be disappointed with this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for the next CD","review":"I loved her first record! The now classic songs,and her voice cut across generations. The production and playing felt timeless. With her writing the new songs on \\"Introducing\\" I couldn't wait to hear her voice with modern production. The problem is that I can't remember one of them. Now I can't wait to see what she does on her 4th CD. Artists have the right to change as they feel, and we have to right to enjoy or not enjoy their art. She is only 20 and has much to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stone's song...not so pretty","review":"Caught Joss's first performance a few years back at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage fest...she then blew up like nitro on the U.S. scene....performing at all the major awards shows....hot like a stick of dynamite due to two great CD's coming out the gate. The sad thing is that perhaps she got a bit big for her britches.....she has a ways to go to be even remotely considered in the class of U.S. diva's in the soul world. Her sudden rise to fame, perhaps has gone to her head on the third CD....I understand it's her own work...and, well, not so good. I would simply recommend that she get the past producers and direction of the first two albums and go back to work. The potential for her is great, but she's going to have to work at it, or she temps the fates of being a flash in the pan kind of star."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON\\"T BELIEVE THE HYPE","review":"I heard her first album and it was okay. Nothing to really shout about. I took a chance to buy her 2nd new album claming it was good. I played it once and never will play again. Her voice is drowned out by the mixed up garbage they call music playing in the background. I think she has a voice but she needs new songwriters and producers. I can see why she's really not that popular with the american audience. Amy Winehouse album is more enjoyeable to listen to than this R&B crap. At least she writes her own songs. Do yourself a favor and buy Amy Winehouse instead of this annoying album. This and barbie doll, plastic, mask heavy make-up wearing beyonce are the worst clowns I have ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Introducing Joss Stone","review":"Ordered on 7/12/07, shipped 9/12/07.

It was great! However, this CD was a waist of $$. I hate it so much, I'm getting ready to throw it out right now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere Safe to Rest Your Eyes","review":"Not since Norah Jones has someone been so overrated, and as the previous commentator said it better than I, mind bogglingly pretentious. And at least Norah Jones was pleasant, in a kind of young sort of sesame street kiddie appeal, and Jones is cute and has a sort of harmonious prettiness. Stone however already seems to have a Joplin sort of mannish hideousness and middle aged spread going for her. To paraphrase Cracker: the world needs another overrated tired white girl pretending to be black and around the block a few times a la Aretha Franklin, like I need a whole in my head!Go away Joss Stone-at least just torture your own country men and women!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She did it Again","review":"With the soulful sounds of Betty Wright mixed with the seductress groves of Alicia Keys and the all no holds bar nature of Millie Jackson, Joss Stone stands apart from all other female artist in the R&B, Rock, Soul, and Neo genres. With the launch of her self written Tell Me Bout It and Put You Hands on Me, Stone has emerged into the US music scene with her gloves on. Yet she stands apart from the other her age with a voice so soulful that chill are sent ravaging down an unsuspecting parties spine. As an treat the genius of Lauren Hill and Common, two icons in the US music scene enhances the album on tracks Music and Tell Me What We're Gonna Do Now respectively which takes the album to a all new high. Stone poured a lot into this album as she did with her second album Mind, Body, and Soul. 2007 began as a musical disappointment with best artist of the last two decades third album not doing so well, now I must end by saying Stone broke the pattern that was plaguing the R&B industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed, overproduced, where are the real drums and instruments","review":"way way way overproduced, with protools and all this modern technology crapif she were smart she would have been using well established producers that know how to incorporate some of the modern engineering/producing into her craft rather than utilizing protools with no real instruments on most tracksit is a travesty to her talent ......very disappointedthe total opposite when you see her live, she has one of the most competent rhythm sections on the planetbetter luck next time!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD- Every song!!!","review":"I always have a had time buying a CD because I'm never sure if i will like the whole thing or just one song, I took a chance & am very glad I did!

This is a CD I will listen to for years to come!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jossing Around","review":"I think this is the 5th review I have written today, so I guess you will have to deal with the silly puns. What you don't have to deal with is some lame R&B; album. Joss Stone is squarely on the map with this effort. Buy this thing baby!She has a rich voice and knows how to turn a phrase. Her style is not indicative of Joss turning 20 this year. If she is this good now, I can't wait to see what she has produced over a 20 or more year career.Get this one because it she has a lot to offer, and this I think is only the beginning.Kevin"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave CD to my daughter","review":"The CD was not what I expected from the snipets of songs that I listened to on-line. I thought it would be more jazz/blues, but it is definitly more rap/hip hop. There was one song on the CD that I liked. I passed it on to my teenage daugher, and she liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as the last one","review":"I loved Joss' last album. I was very excited for this one. It just wasn't as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Joss Stone","review":"I was so excited to see that Joss Stone was releasing a second cd of original songs. This cd wasn't worth the weight. Three of the songs due sound like the blusey and jazzy Joss Stone I first fell in love with. Three more are just to Britney Spears (to much POP; Doesn't due her voice justice). The rest of the songs are just bad techno. This cd is diffently not worth the $20 price. Due yourself a favor and just say NO. And what is with Track 1 and 14, its just people talking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money....","review":"If you're looking for a great follow up to her first CD, you'd be hard pressed to find it here. \\"Introducing Joss Stone\\" sounds nothing like her first album, all of the songs are R&B based (not the jazz/blues/soul music of the first) and most of the lyrics I couldn't understand. I would think twice in purchasing this if you really liked the first album and are expecting something similar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible CD","review":"The Joss Stone of Snakes and Ladders is MIA. On this release she appears to be a background singer for a second rate rap group. There is NONE of the magic of her voice and lyrics from the Body and Soul CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is She Trying To Be Non-Original?","review":"I loved the first Joss Stone cd's because they were more distinct from so much other music out there. Now Joss Stone is going through some wierd phase where she has to sound like everything on the radio and look like every other hoochie out there. I like the bear-footed Joss better. Too desparate to be mainstream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again, Sorry Joss","review":"I realize this review is a couple of years overdue but I think everyone should know about the copy restriction on this CD. I had heard some of Ms. Stone's previous work on the radio and from friends. After seeing Stone being interviewed on every talk show imaginable I bought this CD with the intent of listening to it on my IPOD as I do every CD I own. I guess the joke was on me because there is software on the CD which prevents the CD from being loaded into Itunes. This infuriated me to the point that I've never actually listened to CD. Sorry, Ms. Stone and Virgin records, but this is unacceptable to me. As a librarian and a consumer I believe in the right to make a backup copy of anything I buy as long as it is for my own use. You've violated my rights. I am done with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Change isn't always good","review":"I liked Joss Stone's first two albums but really hated this one. It was like the producers wanted to throw every rap and funk effect possible into the mix. Her voice still sounds great, but the material was very weak. This one sounded way too much like a rap release for my tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The girl has funk and soul!","review":"I put the CD on at work and declined to tell anyone who was singing until it was over. They had never heard of her but they were fans now. They were all dancing in their seats and wanted to buy the CD! They did not imagine a 19 year old British girl singing with so much funk and soul.This an ALBUM. You truly can listen and enjoy from beginning to end. It wasn't created to just release one or 2 hit singles. She just keeps getting better and better. Cant wait to see her in concert!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great voice","review":"Definitely a great voice, I love almost all the songs of this album, especially \\"Tell me 'bout it\\" and \\"Tell Me What We Are Gonna Do Now\\".

It's not one you'll get and just listen to a few songs. You'll listen to every one. Its a great blend of 70s soul sound, Joss's vocal styling, and a little hip hop thrown in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joss needs no Introduction","review":"Joss Stone has the pipes to sing, she definitely does not need to change as the 'LAME' intro to this CD states. Joss has a voice you never get tired of listening to. The 'RAP' on this CD by 'whoever' is a disappointment and a waste of time and takes away form the real talent of Joss.It gives me the idea that whoever that person is may be trying to ride in on Joss's coat tail, taking advantage of her talent. She really lowered her standards to allow the intro & rap to be included. If you are a true Joss fan, you may want to save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLY AMAZING","review":"This girl is new and real! Living in the US I am over Christina, Brit, Fergie, and oh so over Mariah. We are left with the amazing Alicia Keys to provide us quality music. Then comes Joss. She sounds just as amazing live as she does recorded. I don't care if she is sampling old school music and artist. IT SOUNDS GOOD! WE LIKE IT! I can put on her CD's and just get lost in her voice. I hope she kepts up her sound and doesn't sell out and become a pop tart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not just bad but sad.","review":"I knew I was in trouble when the first cut started and instead of Joss I get some guy telling me about how you need balls to change. I didn't buy the cd to hear guys talking but to hear joss singing. I have listened and liked joss from her first cd and her live performances are transcendent. I checked all the reviews and there's a love it or hate it feel to them. Joss is a talented young woman and if this is her sound all I can say is good luck girl and catch you later. One thing thought I will say is that on this cd she loses her freshness. There's nothing here that stands out, no cut that I want to play over and over. There's a sameness to it like a million other young wanna be's. When a women has got the pipes and Joss has got them the trick is less is better.You don't need the backup singers, the guys rapping and the heavy back beat all you need is Joss. Some time it takes more balls to go it alone then with a whole crew."},{"rating":"1","title":"STILL WAITING...","review":"Joss Stone has a strong voice. However, her pipes are totally wasted on this collection of weak songs. Even worse is the quality and total lack of musicality. For that I blame the producer. The bass is very loud, though not particularly good. The other instruments sound like they are covered in wet paper towels and strained through a brick wall. A few tasty horn tracks near the end, but by the time you get there I'm guessing you won't care. Too bad. Maybe she can call her fourth album REALLY INTRODUCING JOSS STONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy application of psychoanalysis to black history.","review":"Overall, I was very dissapointed with Baker's approach and expected much more from someone with a good reputation for literary analysis. I could accept his psychoanalytic speculative ventures about Booker T. Washington's personal biography, but as the major underpining of a judgement against Washington that he is intent on making, it is very thin. Especially when there are no specific references from Up From Slavery, or testimony by students, acquaintances etc. to support such theorizing. All in all I found it very unbalanced and unscholarly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing clicked.","review":"Except for brief appearances by Carol Lynley, it was a bore from first to last minute.Actors didn't seem to interact.

The product description indicated the book was new, however, it came without the jacket cover which shows the name of the book and the author.

I can find no way to contact the seller to inquire about exchanging it for another book WITH the cover.

I love this Blu-ray production, Elton John and his music. Unfortunately, this stage is still Celine Dion's. The stage design is OK, nonetheless, the biggest drawback is no large stage dance like Celine Dion's \\"A New Day\\". I give four-star rating for everything in five but dance. The recording, the band, the performance, the directing, the editing, all are artistic and professional in their highest standard. Just, it could be \\"better\\" with large stage dance.

Comparing to it, the Blu-ray is a great deal, a must buy to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont' Bother","review":"Why this was released in Blu-Ray I will never know. It is outright deceptive as it is not in high definition worthy of Blu-Ray and the sound quality is sub-standard. I saw this concert in Las Vegas at the Caesar's Palace Colosseum stage. The live concert was brilliant, from the top notch performance by Elton John to the spectacular stage and video screen designed by Dave LaChappelle, to the crystal clear sound system. When I saw that the concert was on Blu-Ray I jumped at the chance to own it, thinking it would accurately depict the spectacular colors on the background screen and blow me away with high quality sound. I have never been more disappointed in a video I have purchased. The video poor, colors nothing like what was seen at the live show, and sound less than equal to what was available before 5.1.

He is sent to China to investigate the Taiping revolution in the years 1840-1860. Flashman gets himself into impossible predicaments, managing to extricate himself just in the nick of time. He is a real man with the ladies and takes every opportunity to consummate every encounter. This a great blend of historically accurate story telling through the eyes of an engaging rouge. He does everything that I would want to do if I just had the guts"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dancing Truth's Tightrope","review":"After reading Hornblower and Bolitho, I thought I would give the army a try. Fraser is an excellent teller of historical fiction with a touch of Jeffery Deaver for fun! Quite graphic in his portrayls of the characters and events, Flashman delves into the whys and not just the hows.Yes, Flashman is a roque, but if given the chance - wouldn't we all?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flashman and the Taiping rebellion","review":"Tricked into making what he perceives as easy money on an opium run, Flashman finds himself in the thick of the Taiping Rebellion. Once again Fraser takes a major event in history and plants his anti-hero right in the midst of it. A fascinating account of the development of the rebellion and its eventual defeat is the core of this book and Fraser does a great job of explaining the events and the principles making this a particularly satisfying Flashman adventure. The cast of characters are true eccentrics in many cases and make for humorous and exciting reading. This is one of the stronger Flashman novels I have read and maintains a nice balance of history and adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent Mine Back","review":"I wanted a PCO air purifier to have in my office, but this was too rinkydink for my tastes. I has four light-emitting diodes, one in each corner. I've seen small PCO filters that were made for use in a car that used LEDS, but for the space this fan takes up, I think it is way under lit. It seemed to add more odor to the room from its own off-gassing than it cleared up. I ran it for about two hours. It was very quiet on low speed at first, but then it started making a scraping/bearing noise. I sent it back and will try the NanoBreeze next. I don't have anything against Sunpentown. I have a humidifier and a portable air conditioner from them that I am very happy with. The PCO fan was unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive fan","review":"I like the design of this product. It is able to swivel from side to side and tilt up and down. It also runs pretty quiet even on high. It comes with an extra long cord. That is about as much positive as I can say about it. I was hoping to clear out some of the musty mildew smell I was greeted with upon moving to my new place. It has made no noticeable difference in the air quality of my apartment. I purchased one for a friend with my order, and he didn't pick his up for a few weeks. So I was running two of these units side by side for a while and still noticed no improvement in air quality. He placed his in a room with a litter box and it seemed to spread the odor around instead of eliminating it. The LED's used to light the grid are very dim. It seems to me that the photo oxidation and ion production is very minimal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat album with few Cuberisms.","review":"As a life long Ronnie Cuber fan i was quite disapointed with this album. This album felt dated and unoriginal. If you are familiar with Ronnie Cuber from his work with Gad Gang then this album will likely feel uninspired. It's a blend of smooth jazz, thanks to the collaboration with George Benson, and pop jazz. The feel is decidedly elevator or dental office like with little to really grab the listener. On the upside Cuber brings his amazing improvisational skills to attempt to liven up the otherwise tame jazz surroundings. If you buy this album try not to spend much for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"All New Chilton Books","review":"These books are a joke! So mouch false information and so much useless information.

While Joe is no choir boy the truth is stranger than fiction. Little is known of Hill's buddy Otto Applequist, but over the years more facts have been uncovered about this man's fascinating life. Not the ... son of a Swedish minister but one of many sons of a working class family. An immigrant who becomes disillusioned with the American dream after he finds, instead of streets paved with gold, only forests, mines, docks, and streets covered with the blood of his fellow workers. Not a romantic bandit, but a revolutionary who chose to use his death sentence to bring the cause of labor to the forefront. If you want a balanced book about him get Joe Hill by Gibbs Smith. \\"Don't Mourn - Organize!\\" - Joe Hill 1917"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with ambient light sensitivity and ...","review":"I bought 3 of these night lights on May 06. One of them has already burned out (Oct 07).A problem common to each light was that they remained on most of the time, even in situations where the ambient light was of sufficent level to read a newspaper. It would take direct light from lamp or sunlight to turn the nightlights off.The only good quality was low power consumption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I have purchased two of these twice (I didn't learn the first time), and all four burned out after only a short time--around 4 to 5 weeks. I would NEVER consider buying them again--poor design or poor quality. Buy them if you want, but my experience is that you will waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent LED night light","review":"Very nice little night light. Uses LED, so it runs cool,and uses very little power. Cool \\"bluish\\" light, that you can point any direction using the rotating bezel. Photocell sometimes does not turn the light off if ambient light is not bright enough, such as when you have the light in a semi-lit hallway. Still, a great little product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't they look a little Extra-Terrestrial?","review":"Unusual shape for a night light but we like it. Shuts off during the day, starts early evening. Can be rotated to face up or down and it looks (probably just me) somewhat robotic or extra-terrestrial. Anywhoo, it works just fine and is a proud member of our recent new and improved collection of night lights, which include other kinds that do colors in a cycle and one that puts out a show of lights at night. Never occurred to me these things could be fun but they surely are. 4 Stars, no less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"We got these because we had a 5 week old baby at the time, and needed to get up every few hours during the night. We didn't want to turn on lights because we wanted to keep the baby as sleepy as possible. These lights let off enough light to see what you are doing without being obnoxiously bright. You can rotate the light to shine up, to the side, or down, so that it's not shining in your face. They are also great because they automatically turn off during the day when you don't need them, and they turn back on at dusk, saving energy. A very useful product and we have them all over the house now."},{"rating":"2","title":"I saw the light!","review":"These work great in my cabin and in my RV.

I ended up throwing away all of them since their brightness faded away with time. Consider alternatives before you spend money on these useless lights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocore light","review":"I had high hopes for this nightlight after reading other reviews, but it isn't so hot. The light isn't very bright and quite diffused, and the light sensor isn't sensitive enough - it stays on in all but the brightest light. I ordered two, but have only opened one, and the other is likely to stay in its packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY long lasting!","review":"Four of these have been in use constantly in various rooms in my house for over two years now and I have not had to replace a single one.

I highly recommend these for peace of mind and reliability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Night Light","review":"The lights provide good lighting and the swivel head permits directing the light.

At the time I thought that the period costumes would be excellent for discussing style trends during this time period. However, upon recieving the (highly priced) DVD I watched and imediately regretted my purchase. The video is filmed live in what appears to be a school cafeteria for 4-5th graders. The characters banter is of period speech, but highly geared toward younger students. Also the DVD was just simply slow and quite boring. Needless to say I did not subject my students to this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Erudite But Less Than Compelling","review":"Regrettably one of the more unreadable tomes about Wall Street, \\"Every Man A Speculator\\" comes up as dry as a professor's rambling essay, as unyielding as a sermon, but with relevance much harder to discern. The book is laden with--one might say overly reliant upon--quotes and convoluted, often pedantic sentence structures. It is admittedly informative at turns, at times socially insightful, but with no joy in its reading. It compels as a reference manual would, but that's not why we read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Was This Book Written?","review":"Every once in a while I come across a book that begs the question: why was this book ever written? Steve Fraser's \\"Every Man A Speculator\\" is one such book. While it purports to explain the impact of Wall Street in American life, it never reaches this lofty plateau. It is a regurgitation of stories told about Wall Street figures, stories told by other people much better. It assumes you already know what Wall Street consists of and the difference between what Wall Street actually is and what people assume is Wall Street. I won't go into what I had hoped this book would be and failed utterly at because that would be unfair. Let's just say that the research behind this book is second rate and that there is no analysis whatsoever. In fact, there is nothing new whatsoever in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little bang for your (beaucoup) buck!","review":"This necklace was disappointing and that is putting it mildly.

This book, however, is a tedious and ponderous journey through the author's own meandering thoughts. I read 125 pages and cannot recall any clear facts; everything the author writes is airy and speculative. Granted he writes well and has a masterful understanding of French politics, people and culture during this period. But for anyone looking to understand the colorful forces and figures which contributed to both French Occupation and subsequent Resistance, this is not the book for you. This book might be better suited for a Doctoral student or a French historian...but not for the average student of History."},{"rating":"2","title":"its a hoot","review":"I am from England but this is one of the first truly American books that has tickled my sense of humour.

The author presents a very-nearly-interesting concept, that Custer survived the Little Bighorn fight, only to be court-martialed for his failures. However, he presents it in third-person, present tense; an unusual choice in modern literature. Also, the narrator offers the inner thoughts of a different character each chapter. The result is a style that I found tedious and forced. As to plot elements outside the realm of what one might read in a history, they appear to have been left out. Although one of the characters refers to the case as \\"having more intrigues than the Arabian navy\\", I suspect that I've known houseplants with more interesting lives. Finally, lacking any notes from the author, I'm left not knowing what was fiction and what was not. In the end, I wish that I'd read a proper history of the incident instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Nice and Cheap!","review":"A watch of exquisite taste, which calls attention to the design and beauty.

Yes. Sometimes when I used it I would get the blue screen of death, sometimes not. It had its problems but we used it because we had to use it. Because everyone else used it and we had to, too.StarOffice does the same stuff, handles the same file formats, costs soooo much less money. OpenOffice.org, ditto, and free.

Overall I think 'Wrathchild' were moving a way from their Great British-ness and attempting to compete with the likes of Poison in the US way of thinking, therefore its not always convincing or very good. 'Hooked' is a little painful to endure with an attempt at Vince Neil cry-baby vocals that get quite animated by the end of the track (but not in a good way), 'OK-UK' has a 'Rockin in the USA ' by KISS blue-print stamped all over it lyrically but fails to take off in any real way, and most of the others are just okay I guess.

As with \\"Amor De Una Noche\\" in the last CD, Voltio brings something special to this salsa. \\"Zoom Zoom\\" is also an enjoyable track.

The title role (originally played by Albret Finney)is challenging for an actor, and intriguing for the reader. The second act--in which Luther fights the Catholic Church--is strong and well-written; the first is also dramatic in its attempt to explain why Luther did what he did; the third, however, by viewing Luther at the end of his life, disappoints because we are only TOLD about his accomplishments rather than sharing them.The scope of the play is too large--it tries to cover too much time rather than concentrating on one (or a few) specific events.

A suggestion, when watching the Rush Time Machine Blu-Ray, have your home theater system set-up for true surround sound. don't use any theater enhancement setting like Music Video, Concert Hall, etc. It takes away the sound quality of the Blu-Ray.

If you're reading this review, you probably are a Rush fan, anyway, and knowing Rush fans, you are probably considering buying it anyway, so I say go for it. But if you're simply a fan of music, and great live music in particular, you could do a lot worse than checking out this disc. It is an example of what great musicians can do, without crutches, without other ham-and-eggers joining them onstage. It is an absolute spectacle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair Video Quality + Geddy's Failing Voice","review":"I'll keep this brief since most other reviewers have touched on every aspect of what I am going to say. It's time that bands realize that if they are recording a concert intended to be released on Blu Ray, they NEED to have the audio mixed well and the video quality needs to be top-notch - is there really an excuse for that not to happen? There is no excuse for anything less, especially if we, the fans, are expected to pay Blu Ray prices.As for the performance, it is painfully obvious that Geddy is incapable of hitting those high notes anymore. Sometimes I would cringe because his voice was so strained and pitch was so off. I was perfectly happy with the musicianship of all the guys, but Geddy's (lack of) voice made this Blu Ray a 1-time-watcher for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey . . . It's Rush.

I know there may be a lot of smoke in Cleveland, but not as much as this video shows. During the dark passages from afar in the arena you can see some king of \\"Matrix\\" like effect in the background of the picture. It looks like it was already ripped to Xvid and posted to the web then upconverted to DVD. I can't wait to see the Blu-ray version. The video will probably still suck horribly, but maybe the audio will be even better.This was a major major disappointment on the same day as the Pink Floyd Wish You Were Here Immersion boxed set.Today's Rush releases are the worst thing ever released in their catalog even worse than the Vapor Trails mastering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost","review":"I Liked it until I saw Tom Sawyer.

Geddy Lee can't hit the high notes like he used to. I do not know why they just didnt cover Mike Ness songs. Maybe then they might be tolerable.I can offer a review of that venue: good place to go to watch LeBron James throw down thunder dunks, boring place to see a concert. I did see several concerts there while I lived in Cleveland (Aerosmith, Smashing Pumpkins, The Who, Tom Petty, Roger Waters), but those arena shows are all the same. I did enjoy seeing LBJ throw down thunder dunks there a few times as well, but now he appears there less frequently and with a different backing band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush live...an exciting audio/visual experience.","review":"Watching the rock band Rush in concert is a very entertaining, enjoyable experience.

I was bored silly by the book, didn't get anything out of it, and the cover isn't even pretty enough for a coffee table book.

I was in tears more than once. She tells her story... a story that needed to be told. Both for her, and the country music world, and beyond. I purchased her latest album right after it came out and I listened to it from beginning to end and was moved beyond words. This film, her story, is exactly what people need to experience. It takes seeing the pain, the heartache, the loss, and the fear, in a real person to realize that the culture of our society needs to change. Chely is a REAL person and her story, as well as her passion and the direction she is taking her life, is to be commended. Each step she takes, in her music, her book, as well as this film, WILL make a difference.Chely has done and has the ability to do what I would like to do, but don't have the fame, the reach, or the presence that she does.

It details the journey that Chely Wright went through to come to the best place she could be in to come out as a lesbian. There have been some that have said that Chely came out of the closet as a media tool to boost her career. This documentary proves all of those people 100% wrong. As you watch the video you can easily see the pain and fear she goes through while working toward her coming out. After viewing this video I challenge anyone to say that her coming out was to gain a few record sales.Watch the video and see for yourself what an amazingly courageous woman she is. She will truly inspire you. And if you haven't read her book I encourage you to do so. \\"Like Me: Confessions of a Heartland Country Singer\\" is by far one of the best books I've ever read.

In my opinion, this isn't the game for you if you are into the more serious RPG's that you can actually really get into and feel the game and it's characters. But if you love a fun game to just goof on and slaughter a TON of monsters with your buddies, then definitely get this one for your collection! The only problem we had was that it refused to run on my brother's computer. The reason is unknown for it worked on everyone's computer except his and it didn't really tell us why it wouldn't run.

Now, you are saying: \\"Wait! This is Back-to-Black, why did you use it on non-black trim?\\" Well I used it on the gray because both labels said I could with the same effects as the black, no matter the trim color. However, on the gray it was runny and splotchy. For this they recommend that I buff harder, I did every level of buffing until my power buffer came out.

I have a 2006 Acura RSX(last year they made them), Milano Redand I can't tell how many compliments I get on it's appearance. Friends are always asking how I get it to look so good,and I've made quite a few converts. I also use their Leather cleaner/conditioner on the interior which works great and leaves the seats looking good.

It keeps on beading water way past the time that the others starting sheeting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Are you kidding me. This game is horrible. Hard to control. The camera angles are just to hard to control.I rented it and played it about 45 minutes before I put in a new game.

This game is probably the glitchiest game ive played in my life this game is unfinished and its not fun. Sonic is impossible to control,Shadow is just plain slow,Silver runs like a slug! overall do not get this game even if you see it for a few dollars just stay away from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"Sonic 06 is a very underrated gem of a game.It is flawed with a bad story and uninspired final boss, however. But the gameplay is more of an accomplishment. It is not the best sonic game ever (Sonic Unleashed takes that title), but it is nowhere near as bad as Sonic Genesis GBA ( that is one of the worst games of all time) , and while it is unfinished, it is still an amazing game. Despite its overall flawful story and some marred difficulty, It is worth getting, unlike SGGBA and is undeserving of the title of the worst Sonic game ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder its so cheap.","review":"This game is just sad. I played the first area and got bored. Its just not fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm no sonic fan, but this game blows","review":"I read the reviews, but I thought I'd still try it. It couln't be that bad. Here's the bad i found:1. Sonic kind of freezes up waiting for tails to catch up.2. There's just too many long loading times in the same level. For any activity there's a loading time.3. The characters and town look boxy. It's not 3rd generation. It looks Sega Genesis quality.4.You have to \\"talk\\" to pretty much every character in town. And most of them tell you useless crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's up with sonic here?","review":"This game just down right HORROBLE. Did sega rush through this game?Camera is HORRIBLE, wich needs to be decently good.VOICE ACTING???Human characters make these wierd sounds. The Text messages should have only existed for this failure.So many other mistakes to list. Now getting to the point!!!Don't know if sega had to rush the game so they can meet a relese deadline or what????????. The most important part's of this \\"not considered game\\" are missing.This is an incomplete game that should have not been released when it did.If the developers gave this game a few more weeks of development, I am sure people would have appreciated it more.Instead it became a waste of resources, blu-ray disk, time, and money.Whoever released Sonic like this should be relieved of their job.Sonic needs to be rethinked from the Dreamcast days. DREAMCAST was the last time Sonic showed what he is made of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This game is full of glitches and has long load times. I played it on xbox 360 and it wasn't as bad as for playstation. Do not waste your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible game","review":"I think this game should be recalled. There are too many issues to list but a couple are: extremely slow load times, too many areas in game where disk needs to load, bad point of view on characters (meaning you can't see where the character is going because the screenshot is showing an area that is of no importance), maneuverability of characters is terrible. I have never written a review of a product but hopefully this will save people money and they will buy a different game."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOADING all the time, don't buy this game!","review":"I wish I had rented it, cause it is ALWAYS loading, you spend at least 70% of the time waiting for it to load.

I bought this game because of the good times I had with dreamcast, all honest, this one is a #@*!% of #$@% !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It","review":"Sega really flopped on this one. I treid playing it for a few hours..the camera angles, yes you can adjust them..but as soon as you start running again, they resume their same terrible view point. This is the biggest waste of my money...Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad impulse buy.","review":"i bought this at a brick and mortar store on impulse. what a sad waste of $20. bad game play, bad angles, bad story line, bad everything. i was thinking that it would be a normal sonic platform game. i was sadly mistaken. my only hope is to give it away to someone dumber than me. i'm just that mean. i hope sega is able to redeem itself in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Opposite of Fun...","review":"Allow me to join the chorus of 'boos' for this game. The only Sonic game I've ever played was the original game on one of the Sega systems. When I saw this game pretty cheap at Target, I thought hey that oughta be fun! Turns out, it is the opposite of fun. Bad Control, bizarre camera angles (one moment, you are running or jumping straight ahead, the next moment, you are flying 90 degrees off into oblivion because the camera just changed..) LOOOONG load screens like every 5 seconds (brought on by the fact than you will DIE every 5 seconds through no fault of your own). It is just generally awful. Buy this for your worst enemy...maybe...but not for anyone you care remotely about."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOADING....LOADING>>>>>LOADING>>>>>>>","review":"This game takes way too long to load. I can't believe the amount of time I waste waiting for things to load. I thought that one of the things they were going to cut down on with the ps3 were the number of transitions and loads necessary to play even the most hardware intensive games. At least games like call to duty 3 have a story line that plays while things are loading. Then to top it off the game just isn't that much fun. I was bored in the first 45 minutes I owned the game. I went and traded it in for tonyhawk. Much more entertaining for my money. I would definitely rent this one before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!","review":"Sonic is a game that you should only rent. I've played a good handfull of PS3 games, such as resistance, madden, need for speed and tony hawk and none of these games were as hard as sonic is to master. I do not like the gameplay at all, text boxes get in the way, there are more than one action assigned to a certain control and sometimes the game freezes my playstation 3. There are many problems wrong with the Sonic game and i could probably go on. Half the time you don't even control sonic and he will fall off the track. SEGA should have spent a lot more time perfecting this game. The graphics, however, are a nice feature... state of the art graphics and the enemies are beatable. Those are the only two things I like about sonic. I stood it out and beat the game but it was hard. Final verdict- the game is a good game if you like to get mad because sonic won't do what you tell him to do. I've played a lot of PS3 games and this is by far the worst, besides marvel alliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and repititious","review":"I enjoyed Sonic quite a bit when it was a frenetic scroller on the DC and even the one that's out for PSP is reminiscent of the originals. Sadly, the 3d environment, twitchy controls, and unforgiving timing critical events, leave you wanting and frustrated. You're forced to repeat segments in multiple zones until you're sick to death of seeing the sequence and hearing the same droning cutsey dialog. This is exacerbated by a lack of save points. Visually it's decent, but hardly a showcase for a next-gen platformer. This one is likely to spend most of its life on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Sonic, I doth weep for thee...","review":"No nostalgia here. This game was released unfinished. Timed a 2 min load for a 2 sentence \\"conversation\\" (cut scene), and then an even longer load for the level right after it! The shading is absurd - using dithering and blocks.I only bought this because it was both cheap and Sonic. BAD mistake. Well, I do have a proper anthology of Sonic now, so that is something. Just don't take out your frustration on your controller, it is not it's fault."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sega really killed Sonic's name with this one","review":"The game was rushed. The instruction manual says there are things in the game, that in fact, never made it in the final release. The load times are totaly unacceptable, incredibly long load times for just five seconds of either a CG or mini-game instruction. The controls are HORRIBLE and in some areas, the ground is there, but you can still fall through. The slowdown in this game is UNBEARABLE and the camery WILL KILL YOU. Try to avoid this game alltogether, unless you don't mind playing 20 dollars for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"leave it be","review":"You want to talk about a disappointment. The Playstation 3 is supposed to show off amazing graphical improvements compared to the PS2, and yet, this Sonic game doesn't do ANYTHING at all to show off the consoles supposed \\"amazing power\\".Also, this game is pretty bad because the trademark of Sonic the Hedgehog is supposed to be speed, and yet, he's SLOWER than ever in this game. Also the levels are pretty tough and the controls aren't anywhere near as good as the old Sonic games on the Sega Genesis. A rushed game with mistakes all over the place that should be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Game... Ever.","review":"Five minutes into it...

The camera has been the biggest issue and the trend continues for this one. Speed is Sonic's gig and they just haven't figured out a way to mesh that with a 3D world, but they are getting closer. There were parts that showed promise, but it still doesn't make it a good game. Playable for only the most hardcore Sonic fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sonic the Hedgehog","review":"I wasn't was I was expecting for this game.

I got the game in 2006 for the Xbox 360 and have recently purchased it again for my latest console, the PS3. I don't know how it differs on PS3 (it most likely doesn't) but on X360 I used to have so much fun on this game, even on multiplayer. I do remember a few glitches, but they're not awful considering the quality of the game.

You've found the game of your dreams in Sonic for PS3This game tries too hard in all the wrong areas-- the opening scene is dazzlingly beautiful and intricately detailed, but why exactly is this Final Fantasy-esque sequence pasted on a game about a blue rodent who runs really fast?-- and doesn't give any thought to playability or flow-through.Unless you're doing your doctorate thesis on how popular game franchises grossly misinterpret the desires of their customers, this game will probably be a waste of your cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of them all! Yes even worse that heros!","review":"first off - Zero Stars! not even worth one! terrible!Super slow too many reasons for this game to be recalled and remade.....well if they remake it it needs to be done with the Sonic Adventure 2 game engine! that was by far the best one!

Unfortunately, the designers rushed by things like testing and usability. Like others noted, the camera angle controls are worthless and you end up not knowing where you are.

It is very exciting and very entertaining. I especially like how there are three different story modes, one for each hedgehog. The ONLY thing which drives me crazy is the load time. You have to wait over a minute each time you enter a new place, even if you have already been there. Also, for missions, you accept the mission, LOAD, get the instructions on the mission, and with \\"Ready, Go!\\", you get to load again for a minute! A complete waste of time. Other than that, this game is awesome"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could be better","review":"I rented this game because everyone said it was terrible. Yet I had to buy it as soon as I returned it. This game is incredibly fun! Yet it does have its issues. Load times are horrible and there are a few glitches. Yet I had no hard time with the camera. The graphics are ok and switch from good to ok quite frequently which gets annoying. The story gets really good but has a really slow begining which you have to force your self to get through. Overall this game is pretty good with only a few issues. I give it an 8.5 and would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This game is not worth spending the money on. The controls are very hard to master and keep a handle on Sonic. The load times verses the actual play time are rediculous. It seems as though the levels are very short and un-eventfull.

I was very disappointed in this game and wish I would have rented it before I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this game","review":"I have never had a game on any platform with controls this poor.

This, I am sad to say, WILL be the last Sonic game I buy because as of late Sonic games have been getting worse and worse.The loading is aggravating to say the least.Camera's should almost ALWAYS be behind the character and be able to toggle to the sides at the player's discretion.And when you designate a control for a function, maybe, just maybe, that button should control that function. Not let you fall off a cliff innumerable times."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst sonic game of ALL time","review":"Oh my goodness, this is the worst sonic game of all time. The controls are a mess, the game play is broken, and it looks like it was beta that was rushed out. Those who say that this game is good are blind.

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME."},{"rating":"1","title":"The blue hedgehog isn't what he used to be...","review":"Okay, so we all know Sonic's games haven't been doing much justice as of late, and this one is no exception. On a whim, I gave in and said I would see for myself just how bad it has gotten. poor controls, missions have little to no fun value and I won't even start with how frustratingly long the loading screens are. There is some good to the game though. The cutscenes are well done with stunning visuals and voiceovers. The soundtrack is done well, though not as memorable as some previous Sonic games. The game definitely takes Sonic in a different direction with a vast and interesting storyline with new enemies, Robotnik's devious schemes and a new collection of playable characters, such as Silver the Hedgehog and Blaze the Cat. Even with this new lineup, the gameplay fails to deliver and further slows down the blue hedgehog's momentum.Rating: 2/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID AT ALL COSTS","review":"Long story short, DON'T BUY THIS GAME. It will disappoint in almost every way and isn't worth the trouble.

For Sonic fans only.","review":"I was waiting for this game to come out for PS3. The only positive thing about this game that I can say after playing it for over two weeks is that it states that it supports 720p, but actually shows on my HDTV as 1080i via component connection, which was a nice surprise. The niceties pretty much end there.I would say the quality of this game is ok, but the gameplay is really awful!The motion control is bad, the camera is even worse.When the Sonic is running forward, hits something and loses a life, he ends up stuck, beating his head against a wall for several seconds, or just flies away to never-never land. The worst thing is that if you lose all lives, you have to start over. The save points are far-far-far apart.Don't bother with this game unless you are a hard-core Sonic fan, and just want to have this game, period.There are better games out for PS. Resistance. Motorstorm. Ridge Racer 7. Virtua Fighter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good graphics. Terrible gameplay.","review":"This is hands-down the worst game I have ever played.

Rent it first, you WILL be dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"An absolute waste of time","review":"I used to be a huge fan of sonic. I played the genesis games, Sonic CD on my PC, Sonic R, Sonic Adventure, Adventure 2, I even enjoyed heroes. But at the time of this games release, I didn't have a PS3 or Xbox 360 so I never picked it up. Little did I know how fortunate I was. This game is unplayable. It takes way too long to load, which it does frequently. It is also impossible to control with a terrible camera. And anytime you touch anything the game glitches, often resulting in death. Also, the graphics are downright terrible in certain spots, like Nintendo 64 quality. Don't buy this game unless youre the biggest sonic fan ever and just need it for display. If you need sonic on the PS3, but Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection or Sonic Generations. Even download Sonic Adventure over PSN if you must, but avoid this nightmare of a game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sonic's debut on next gen systems","review":"I remember seeing this game at Gamestop for $20 so I thought I would give it a go. I am a huge fan of Sonic and it looked alot like Sonic Adventure 1 & 2 on Sega Genesis. The game looks great thats the only thing that can be said good about the game is that Sonic Team put alot of work into the graphics department. Everything else about the game is just terrible: the controls will leave you dying alot in this game and the camera is just horrible you'll have lots of death and have to position the camera with the right analog stick just to see where you are going. Its a terrible game and should of been better if Sega didn't rush out of the door with this just in time for it come out on next gen systems.

They still have not fixed the camaera angle. The character has the same freaking stages as soon as I turn on the game I play one stage I am tired of playing because all the stages are the same. The character all had the same videos. THE STORY WAS CRAP WAS NOT ALL DEEP LIKE SONIC TEAM, SEGA SAID IT WOULD BE. THEY ARE RUNNING OUT OF IDEAS THEY NEED TO TAKESOME IDEAS FROM THERE FANS.

I purchased this because I thought it would be fun for a freind and I to play sonic like the good old days. Well, I was horribly shocked to find that this has the great graphics and speed of sonic when it is not loading, and the controls are awful to use here. The camera angle keeps wanting to go straigh above the character when you start to run, making it at times impossible to see where your shooter is that is killing you. It really makes the game difficult to enjoy because you are always stopping and tilting the camera. It is possible to make progress, but there is a steep learning curve. Not recommended for young users because it is so tough to hold your attention haing to stop the action all the time to adjust. I'm glad I got it at 1/5 original cost.

Half the time you spent just along for the ride and trying to not crash into something, which would result in instant death of the character. The rest of the time, the camera is moving around such that you can't see what's in front of you and as the camera controls control where the camera is, rather than what it's looking at, I was always moving the camera in the wrong direction (I've seen this particular problem many times before and it is not unique to Sonic, but it is something you should be allowed to select, like reversing the Y-axis on FPS's). My wife and I gave up on this game after becoming frustrated with it. We buy games to have fun, NOT to see how many unique ways our characetr can be killed."},{"rating":"1","title":"SEGA lost its ability to make good games","review":"This is by far the worst Sonic game ever. I thought that Sonic Adventure 2 was starting to lose its entertainment factor since it strayed far from the original games that made Sonic so good. Don't buy this game at all. It's a waste of your money. You can rent it to confirm all the issues mentioned in the other reviews. Yes, horrible camera angles, long load times, and boring story really make this game unbearable.

The characters were well developed and very likeable without being perfect. The plot was believable and really drew me in.

After reading this book, Barbara Samuel is definitely on my list of authors to watch for. This is romance that raises the bar for the entire genre.

This one is my favorite by far. An intriguing and different historical romance; well researched, poignant, and quite fascinating. The characters, time period and setting really come alive. The story lingers pleasantly in my mind. It's a book I will definitely read again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different perspective on history.","review":"As a keen reader of historical fiction, I was delighted when Barbara Samuel's book took me to into a different time period and country from so many I have read. Based on real events in Strasbourg in the fourteenth century, Ms Samuel's book manages to intertwine a passionate love story with an exploration of intolerance and fear. There are certainly familiar elements in this Romeo and Juliet themed novel, but the characters are original and appealing. The setting is convincing and Ms Samuel's handles the factors that keep the young lovers apart with skill and credibility. When I finish a book and do nothing but sit and think about it for a while, I know I've got a keeper. This is the first of Ms Samuel's books I have read. It certainly won't be the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I found this book so interesting that I recommended it to some of my book club friends.

I was greatly disappointed.Not only does this book repeat what just about every other book on earning money online talks about, but it also involves many things that could be considered SPAM and annoying practices. The author states he is against those practices and insists that his techiniques are fine, but I can't help but get a bit sick to my stomach when reading his tips.Also, he claims its super-easy to make lots of quick money, but even with his deceiptful tactics, you will still need a good product (which he doesn't tell you how to develop) in order to sell anything worthwhile.Please do yourself and the rest of the Internet community a favor and don't both with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new, full of mistakes","review":"It's hard to take Internet advice from someone who tells me how to change my email signature in Internet Explorer.

Half way through the book, I realized that I didn't know anymore about making money online than I had before. All Allen does throughout this book is talk about how great he is and how he did this, that and the other thing. He talks about all these so called wonderful marketing strategies, when really all he's doing is promoting spam. I'm not even ON his mailing list and I'm getting [...] from him in my inbox. It's disgraceful. I do not recommend you waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oversell in Overdrive","review":"Master of self-promotion Robert G. Allen has plenty of ideas about how to use words and technology to hype yourself and your business. There's just one tiny thing missing from this forumula: He doesn't tell you how to get this great idea to hype.He also manages to skirt the truth. For example, he talks about how he made an online offer that became an instant success in 24 hours. He leaves out the time he spent developing a website and the lists of interested prospects to which the offer was distributed. If we add in the time spent building up to making the offer, it isn't exactly a instant success story anymore.It takes time and effort to develop a business. Allen can dress those facts up in hype -- he's good at it -- but the only business this book will build is Allen's.

The story takes you to yet another undiscovered time and place that I would only want to visit with Larry McMurtry. This time he focuses on a well known name, but not a well known person. We all know Billy the Kid, but none of us know Billy, and Mr. McMurtry artfully weaves a tale that is more than believable and entertaining.If you have or have not read one of his book it should not matter, but you need to make sure you start or continue with this one.

Rough and unpolished, darn it, it just doesn't make much sense. While there are some very quirky and interesting characters and incidents (the US Cavalry's experiments with the dromedary camel was a hoot), its just not McMurtry's best. The Arabian/African swordsman really reminded me of that line in The Third Man where the British Major is reading Holly Martens' dime novel and says \`Interesting...I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas.' Don't be fooled by the jacket either...this has VERY little to do with Henry McCarty AKA Billy The Kid.

The prose is often distracting and it feels like this is either the author's first book or he was in an hurry to finish it. The pictures are all black and white and too close to the subject. You really get the sense that the author is more concerned about showing off his jig making skills rather than helping you make your own.

It simply hangs over your ear, but does not have a 10 cent piece of plastic or gel that focuses the sound into you ear canal and shields out background noise. The result is you cannot hear when you are on the freeway.

The price difference and ability to prevent hitting the button by closing the headset made it worth the sound issues. When this product arrived I was amazed to see that it was nothing like it's smoke-colored version. The clarity was great on both ends, with no pops or echos.

Although the design is very sleek and sexy, and opening the boom is convenient for answering calls, there is a disturbing echo heard by anyone calling me. I believe this happens because the mic on the HS850 is so close to the earphone. When the volume is up where I need it to be the sound from my earphone goes back into the mic and the caller hears a delayed copy of his voice...only when I turn the volume way down does it go away, but not all the way.

Next morning it was deader than a door-nail.So, I took it back and got another one just like it. This time, I charged it for two hours and then talked on it for about 15 minutes. Next time I tried to use it, it was dead. It wouldn't even light up or respond in any way. Again, I charged it for two-hours and folded it up and put it in my shirt pocket.

For example, I picked up the album after hearing \\"Change for Me,\\" which is very radio friendly and very catchy. \\"Turn Around,\\" on the other hand, a song about two brothers, is much slower with touching lyrics and a pleasant melody; again, the chorus really shines through.Some songs fade into the background, but it remains an album one can listen to from beginning to end.

Even though the effects are dated a little bit, they can still make your girlfriend squrim!! Unlike the really fake cgi stuff out there now.

The music was so annoying that I kept turning the volume down every time it came on and we both thought the acting was horrible. Yes, there was a lot of atmosphere to the movie but that alone does not make a horror movie scary. We found ourselves laughing at so much of this movie it was ridiculous. My favorite horror movie is the \\"Exorcist\\" which still scares me every time I see it - and I've seen it at least 12 times.

And Joan Bennet's performance makes her turn on Dark Shadows look award-worthy. Really!Visually, it's wild to look at ... kind of like a whorehouse in Querelle or a Ken Russell daydream. Otherwise it does not have much going for it. The soundtrack is effectively creepy - but if you have a home theater system, be warned: it is LOUD.And scary ... Not At All.

This film is more likely to be enjoyed by \\"art house\\" cinema enthusiasts than your general Horror audience. The movie is shot with unusual colours which are supposed to add to the movies eeriness, but in my opinion, take away any sense of realism. The plot is reasonable but not enough is made of it; rather than having a climatic ending which the film appears be slowly drifting towards you are left somewhat dissapointed by a cheap effect.I would only reccommend this film to those who are interested in artistic visuals or Argento fans.

It's a headache for theviewer.The writing is as unimpressive as the direction. Argento has done much better elsewhere. Take a lookat that thing he did with Keitel.

The colors are so beautiful and the atmosphere keeps you into a really scary and strange tension from the beginning to end.

Stephen King and Clive Barker believe that this is one of the best horror films EVER! Do you hear?The eerie music score (done by Goblin and Argento himself) assaults the viewer in every way you can imagine. It's twisted, noisy and higly effective.Remember, after all this is a witch story right?And believe me.. this is nothing less than pure Magic.On the other hand, if your favorite horror films are Scream, I know what you did last summer or Killing Ms. Tingle, try something else...This is art, not cheap butchery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AM I MISSING SOMETHING HERE?","review":"Well, at the risk of coming off as stupid, I can't for the lifeof me see what is so great and scary about this movie.

Not much middle ground. I like it and always have.I first saw it in a very edited version and was disappointed. Next I rented a video documentary about Argento which oddly enough showed many scenes that had been censored from the version of Suspiria I watched. Those scenes are not permitted in actual movie context but were allowed in a documentary on the directors work? That is so weird.......Many complain here that there is no track listing for the 3rd disc/soundtrack in new DVD-Box.I have not examined the contents of all the discs in new set yet but I know the titles to the songs.Here they are: Track 1)Suspiria 5:57 2)Witch 3:10 3)Opening to the Sighs 0:32 4)Sighs 5:15 5)Markos 4:036)Black Forest 6:06 7)Blind Concert 6:11 8) Death Valzer 1:51 by Goblin (not 'the' Goblin)Hope that helps some curious people.

I also liked when Suzie's roommate friend went through all the scary scenes in the film, up to the barbed wire scene. That was all pretty good. And the soundtrack is amazing. I need a CD of that!

How can ANYBODY find this movie interesting? Let's ignore for a minute that the special effects were awful and that the acting was terrible. There's so much wrong with this movie, I don't want people to discount my criticism simply due to the era in which the movie was made. The plot was fragmented, choppy, and unbelievable.

I was reading online that Dario Argento was a great horror director so I downloaded \\"Suspiria\\" to see for myself. The plot was really stupid, what's so scary about a ballet dancer going into a witches' coven? As I continued subjecting myself to it I discovered that NOTHING in it was scary! It didn't have enough gore, over-produced special effects or a really scary looking killer. Another minus was that it's really old.

Is it visually different? Yes. Does that make up for the rest of the movie being bad? Hardly. There were a couple of high tension moments but overall this movie is completely forgettable.

Dario Argento's masterpiece of terror! And so on, ad nauseum...When I saw this film, I was completely disappointed. SUSPIRIA is a very stylish, yet incomprehensive film. I consider Argento's THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMMAGE to be a lot better than this horror film. Other than some really bloody moments, SUSPIRIA suffers from too much style, an annoying soundtrack, & weak performances from everyone involved, especially the lead actress Jessica Harper. It's as if she's bored to death in this movie!Argento should have done better, in my opinion. SUSPIRIA was a very stylish, colorful, slick, yet weak & overblown. All style, but very little substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails on all levels.","review":"With all due respect, if you think this is \\"one of the scariest movies ever made,\\" you have not seen nearly enough scary movies. Suspiria is indeed frightening...frighteningly bad. Don't try to find any semblance of a cohesive plot...there is none. Rather, we get a series of badly acted scenes intended to spook us but which merely made me laugh out loud at the ineptitude on screen. Funniest of all, perhaps, was the obviously fake bat and fake dog, which were no doubt purchased at the toy store down the street.A couple of violent scenes do interrupt what seems like hours of plodding, boring exposition. But these death scenes are so amateurish, so badly executed, that you'll laugh yourself silly watching them. Of course, if you like watching endless scenes of people dancing, this is the movie for you.Actually, there is one good part of the film...the closing credits.

Many fans of Suspiria will claim those who hate it just aren't smart enough to get the movie. Those who despise Suspiria wonder what flavor of Kool-Aid the fans have been drinking.

Argento found the perfect heroine in Jessica Harper, who plays the role of an emotionally detached American at a German ballet school. The emotional detachment that she portrays in her character adds significantly to the mood of the film. Argento also uses color for setting mood brillianty, much in the same style as Kubrik, though not with quite with the subtleness that Kubrik used color in his films. The acting of the rest of the cast is satisfactory at best, with the exception of the first two victims who shouldn't have been given any dialogue in the film. 3/5 stars for low grade acting and poor special effects. But mood, atmosphere, and suspense, the foundation of any good horror, get a solid 5/5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indescribable","review":"My friend is a cheap-70's-horror movie buff, and I'm not. I figured I was in for a good laugh with this one, but I was wrong. I figured I'd fall asleep after the laugh, but I was wrong. Instead, I didn't take my eyes off the TV until my friend turned off the VCR. Not to sound overly dramatic, but Suspiria is completely stunning and unlike any of my friend's other cheap 70's horror movies. I haven't seen photography like it anywhere else; it's almost like an elaborate, freaked out home video. It impressed me so much that I had to do it justice by writing a review for it. A very strange, amazing movie, whether you get scared or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic splatter film.","review":"Though admittedly lax in the logic department, this film by Italian horror maestro Dario Argento is still a stylishly ghoulish treat. The bizarre sets and brilliant, almost lurid, color schemes(utilizing Technicolor's \\"Matrix\\" system)combine to create a strange netherworld of supernatural menace and imminent doom. Immensely adding to the viewer's unease is the booming score by Goblin. A diabolical concoction consisting of many different styles, the music acts as the final catalyst in the audience's free-fall into unimaginable terror. Intensely savage, flamboyantly artistic and unforgettably terrifying, Suspiria is definately a classic splatter film."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad","review":"Second disk was broken but I had worked so many back to back doubles that by the time I caught up on my sleep it was days later I decided to take loss because I had no way of proving that is how it came so I just keep it ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where are the sub-titles?","review":"An excellent transfer of a long awaited release.

I bought this movie because of all the great reviews on it saying it was a must see and you haven't seen horror until you've watched this movie, etc. Were these people drunk or high or something? It was a very slow, boring start & middle. I imagine the end was too but I was so bored I fell asleep. My BF thought it was horrible too and was so glad I nodded off so he could turn it off. Do not buy this movie if you care about actual HORROR. This is not scary and the only horrifying thing about it is how horrifyingly horrible it is! Not worth $5 if you ask me."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing!","review":"this movie was not worth seeing. one of the worst horror movies of all time (including Howling 5). Was the director high when he made this movie?!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful attempt at horror","review":"This was, without a doubt, one of the most pathetic excuses for a horror movie I've ever seen. I'd say about three quarters of it was nothing but some girls fartin around yapping about nothing. There are just a few very short killing scenes, which aren't that great. The soundtrack everyone seems to rave about sounds like a few kids in a basement banging on trashcans. I wouldn't reccomend this movie to anyone. I'd suggest movies by Lucio Fulci, such as The Beyond, House by the Cemetery, or Zombie, to name a few."},{"rating":"2","title":"I saw this on the big screen","review":"Skipping out of high school for a day, a friend and I decided we wanted to see a horror movie. What punishment! I wanted to leave but my friend did not. And, yes, I could've covered my eyes but I didn't! I couldn't. This movie is an assault on the mind.

The acting is gratingly bad and the violent sequences of the movie seem almost randomly displaced throughout the film at times. Its stupid. But the script is not what draws one to a Dario Argento movie. No, it is Argento's directing flair and sense for framing scenes that makes his films special. Suspiria takes full advantage of the concept of using film as an art form and not just mindless entertainment. I mean, it IS mindless, but when you can look beyond that and just marvel at how beautifully done this film is, shot for shot... even mute the film if you have to... you can really begin to appreciate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you guys kidding me?","review":"Sometimes the public is right and the critics are wrong. Sometimes the critics are right and the public is wrong. Sometimes they're both right but in the case of \\"Suspiria\\" they're both wrong. This is the most over-rated horror movie ever. Only the first and last 12 minutes of this movie are worth seeing. Everything in the middle is just bland. A few inane death scenes here, some over the top music there and lots of senseless chatter. The story should've explored witchcraft more thoroughly and made more use of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suspiria","review":"I was very disappointed after viewing this dvd. It had been given a high rating and touted as one of the scariest horror movies of all times--this is not true. The only scary part of this movie is the opening murder. It pretty much goes down hill after that. I've seen worse horror movies, but I was so disappointed with this one because there were so many great reviews on it. I've seen many, many horror movies and this one is at the bottom of my list. The sets and use of color in the movie are beautiful, but it does not make it any scarier."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's different, and worth a look, but...","review":"when it's all said and done, I felt like I COULD'VE done something else. It's the kind of movie that I don't regret watching, but really have a small need to see very often, but may want to in about 10 years. The first attack was the best. The rest of them were noticeable to kinda silly. It has a good use of sound, color, and atmosphere, and recommended for viewing, but not more than the initial time, which took 3 viewings before I was able to reach the end. Worthy of credit, but a high level of acclaim is not what I would bestow to this title. Maybe I just saw it too late in my life(2001 vs. early 80s)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm... I didn't like it.","review":"One thing this film is well known for is the visuals and the score. Not so much for th plot. The acting and dubbing was, in my opinion, ok at best. Rent before buying. I myself found this movie to be rather boring and slow. I can see why it was classic over 30 years ago. The visuals and the score(which in my opinion tended to be a bit repetitive) are rather unique. What was eerie and scary 30 years ago may not be for many in this day and age. Some people seem to still like this film but I mostly found it boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not God Awful, just not good.","review":"I agree with the people who said the movie was shot well, and the soundtrack is creepy....the transfer to dvd was very well done.

Maybe I just didn't get it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"If ever there was a turkey of a film, this is it","review":"Dario Argento definately hit an all time low with this overlong excursion into the absurd and ludicrous. Jessica Harper is a ballet student from New York who is attending the German Dance Academy run by Joan Bennet and a Naziest dance instuctor. The story is convoluted and filled with holes and the music score is the most annoying in film history. The acting here is not even amaturish, it is just plain awful. On the box of the video, it states 'the only thing more terrifying than the last 5 minutes of this film are the first 90!', it should of stated, 'the only thing more ridiculous than the last 5 minutes of this film is the entire film itself. I cannot begin to trash this film enough, it is that bad. Stay away from this movie!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOCKING!!!","review":"I had wanted to see this movie forever, none of the local video stores carried it. The reviews and Bravo's reccommendations made me sure I would love this. I did not. The color and sets were amazing. The story and acting were not. There were many plot holes and things that didn't make sense. I understand why some people would like this, but there are many horror film buffs that find this out of place in cannon, and I 'm one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Italian Horror Film","review":"For those of you who think movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), Jeepers Creepers and new teen horror movies are great, just hit your back button and find something else. This is a classic piece of cult horror cinema. The effects are bad at times, the story is choppy and it can be difficult to follow. But this movie is 25 years old! Argento is a master of filmmaking. His use of colors, beautiful editing and an amazing soundtrack by Goblin all make this a classic. Why rent a new horror movie that looks like a Gap commercial when you can own a classic?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A horror movie that may haunt you","review":"This is among the most effective horror movies (specifically of the witch-coven genre) ever made, thanks to skillful handling of suspense, some excellent acting, effective sets, and an appropriately maddening soundtrack. There are holes in the story and it's in no way believable, but it's such ghastly fun one hardly minds. Some of the blood-red photography is a bit much, but all in all this Italian film (well dubbed into English) is an irresistible piece of fright-mongering, leagues ahead of most of its American counterparts. I am not even a horror-movie junkie, but this highly atmospheric number has lingered in my memories... it's just wonderfully creepy and weird and unsettling!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hype","review":"I started this movie in the hope that it would be one of the scariest I have ever seen. I was sadly disapointed! The first kill seen was good but then the middle of the movie was slow and boring. It had a \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" feel to it. This would not even rank in the top 20 of scary movies I have seen. If you are looking for a scary movie don't choose this one. If you are looking for a ok movie with a good story this might be what you are looking for. I think the problem was I did a lot of reading on this movie and got caught up in all the hype of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bit by the same dog twice","review":"I bought this largely due to rave reviews here. What a shockto realize I had seen this before - in its theatrical release.Didn't like it then, don't like it now. The music's just wierd enough to be compelling, and I like Jessica Harper, it's just that the movie is less than the sum of its parts. Blurry red hallways, funhouse lighting, cliched characters (check out the Cloris Leachman-like teacher with the German accent and the vaguely militaristic outfit) - I just don't get the appeal.Might seem raw and arty to someone who never saw a foreign film before."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a good movie.","review":"I'm sorry, But when I rented this i exspected this to be great and it isn't nearly good. The acting is fine., the colors and the atmosphere are neat, but the story wasn't very engaging. In fact it seemed stupid and the ending was really cut short and wasn't good either. This film doesn't hold a candle to Rosematy's baby, halloween, or Carrie. Sorry, but not even close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over hyped","review":"Visually the film is quite good. The plot however is quite thin and the acting pretty unexciting. The music had an uncanny tendency to annoy. The plot has little going on, the film could have been shot in 30 mins as a short film and would probably have worked better for it!I can't honestly see why this film gets the rave reviews it does, belive me there are a lot better films of this type out there. Again this film gets a mention as a cult film frequently, but just why it falls into that classification is again a mystery, as mysterious as Argento's use of red, green and blue lighting.If this is Argento's \\"masterpeice\\" I'm afraid I won't be trying any others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusual, Artistic, Creepy.....and very boring","review":"Having read a number of reviews saying that Susperia was a true horror masterpiece, I just had to experience it for myself. What I found was definetely different from any horror film I had ever seen.Susperia is not filmed in a typical western style. The soundtrack is overwhelmingly loud, the visuals are bright and overly colorful and the gore is graphic. Despite all that, the story is filled with plot holes, jammed together and mostly non-sensical.Don't get me wrong. I get why its a classic of a sort but its not my cup of tea. If you have never seen it before and are new to the way Italian Cinema is shot, you may have a hard time not turning it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving and ugly.","review":"I first read about this movie saying it was one of the best horror films ever and then a good friend of mine,Rich, told me he had it and I watched it. What a dumb film.The story is about an American dance student who attends a European ballet school only to find it is a witches coven. As with all Argnto's films there is a good deal of unneeded blood and graphic scene's to keep you woundering why the hell you are watching this. The story developes very slowly so by the climax you really have lost intrest and you watch it to see what happens almost out of obligation.Over rated and dim witted this film leaves a bad taste and an even worse memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror(ible)","review":"I bought this movie based on all the great reviews here at Amazon. I brought it to my brother's house for a bunch of us to watch. I told him that critics claimed \\"One of the scariest movies of all time\\" and \\"One of the most terrifying murders ever filmed\\". I will never live that down. What on earth were you people watching? This movie is not scary or suspenseful. The acting is terrible. The special effects are horrible (even for the decade it was made). I spent more time laughing at how bad this movie is than feeling any interest in what happened. If Amazon allowed it, I give this film minus stars. This film is 98 minutes of your life you will never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this??","review":"After I finished watching this I could only wonder why \\"Suspiria\\" attained such a cult status. There were a few brief periods of suspense, and the mood and atmosphere make it somewhat interesting; however, you need more ingredients than this to come out with a decent movie. Not horrible, but mediocre at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who said this was scary?","review":"Plain and simple -- I bought this DVD because every review raves about its atmospheric, frightening presence on screen.This movie is NOT scary. It's stupid. The plot is dumb, the acting poor, and the ending is so weak I sat stunned in my chair. Way too much dialogue, red herrings throughout the film, and rock music that adds NOTHING to the overall feel of the film.I admit the camera work is artistic, but that's the only good thing I can say about this over-rated, simple film.If it was that good, it would hold a better place in film history.P.S. Blood isn't orange..it's crimson. Fake, fake, fake. Don't buy this DVD..rent it first.Scary to me is disturbing social matter and evil. This film doesn't even come close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspiria - Thrills & Chills from the Master","review":"Suspiria is a visually stunning piece which is well worth viewing. Dario Argento was on a roll when he did this film (some may remember Dawn of the Dead, Creepers & Inferno). I particularly like the blue, green and red hues which give the film a gothic/nightmarish vision and lots of atmosphere. Some spectacular/unusual murder sequences(reminiscent of The Omen) and definitely not for the squeamish.Also, a creepy ghoulish cast of characters helps to build tension and incoherence. Some references to alchemy and the occult make it black magical!!I really enjoyed it and highly recommend it for horror fans. Watch it in the dark for maximum effect!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspiria","review":"This DVD is enhanced for widescreen televisions, packed with extras, the film is confined to the first disc (no annoying breaks to change discs) and the transfer to video is immaculate."},{"rating":"1","title":"far from the scariest!","review":"i gave this film two stars only because of its stylized camera shots,and the use of the creepy music was a good choice but it all leads up to a bunch of nothing.one over the top bloody death at the begining and a dog that turns on its owner by tearing at it's neck.only to conclude with the killing of a witch that snores real scary and is invisible!!!this is not the scariest movie ever.i think it just might be the worst however."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst films i've ever seen","review":"wow! suspira is super bad. i love horror and jessica harper and i'm surprised i bothered to watch through the end... don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply put ... [bad]","review":"Don't get me wrong, I am no prude. I like gore, macabre horror, and sinister plot lines. But, Suspiria was just too disturbing. It is for those who are unconcerned with plot and dialogue and just like graphic depictions of murder. I only got through the first 10-15 minutes then stopped the tape. I contemplated just throwing the tape out, but that would've been a grand waste. I will never watch the movie, and don't suggest anyone buying it unless on an impulse buy ... But, most people, I suspect, will be highly disappointed.

In the first scene, it shows a woman getting drenched in water, poor thing. But thats not the \\"good\\" part you see. The \\"good\\" part is when all you hear is continuous drumming, which could drive anyone mad. Then out of nowhere a woman half falls out of a skylight. This reminded me of an acid trip, \\"Which is kindof scary\\". Then, there is a retarded romainian caretaker.

Great picture ideas somehow try to come to life as motion but hardly do. Weak story lacking flow and complexity.

See Jean Cocteau's Orpheus 1950 to get the real effect of a slow but great Euro movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell of a movie","review":"Argento was once dubbed \\"the Verdi of Violence\\", and with good reason. SUSPIRIA is perhaps the most operatic horror film ever made (that is, if one doesn't consider Visconti's THE DAMNED a horror film), with great, garish colors, baroque settings, high-pitched music, and incredibly bloody death scenes.Argento dispenses with logic early on, and if you're looking for linear plot, go elsewhere. This is a nightmare vision captured on celluoid, worthy of Bosch and Dante, and not for the faint-hearted. But if you've got a stomach for it, it's a hell of a movie and an unforgettable experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dario Argento's Best!!","review":"Suspiria in my opinion is Dario Argento's best film!!It's story, the color, the gore is all part of the masterpiece of Suspiria.If you like horror, this one is for you!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"I saw this movie a few months ago and I still haven't quite been able to put it out of my mind. It's not a horror film in the sense that it was \\"scary\\" - I think few movies truly are - and I think to refer to it simply as such robs it of its ambiance. The score is mesmerizing, the set is dreamlike, the acting is surprisingly good for the genre and the era, and although I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a perfect film, I do understand why it's referred to as Argento's masterpiece. Watching this film is like watching a Dali painting become tangible. The opening sequence of this film is something that will remain with me for a long time. It won't give you a quick thrill, and it won't wow you with a fabulous plot or intensely graphic scenes like those found in today's gore films (save for one particular memorable death), but it's a great movie if you take it for what it is and don't fault it for what it is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"For those wondering I don't know why they put \\"kit\\" in the title, it's just one injector.Either way it's just a stock Delco fuel injector, matched my 95 LeSabre perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title is misleading....","review":"For a true network professional this title is very misleading.

Readers unfamiliar with song writers such as Aunt Molly Jackson, Jim Garland, and Ella May will be delighted by Lynch's descriptions of them and their songs. Scholars will find new insights into the songs, and a lengthy bibliography. One of Lynch's principal points is that \\"unlike their husbands, brothers, and fathers, women lyricists drew an overt connection between the deprivation they saw their families experiencing and the fight for higher wages, improved working conditions, and collective bargaining rights.\\" Lynch's prose sparkles, and this sets his book apart from so many others published by academic presses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for a Beginner!","review":"If you're an experienced Paint Shop Pro user, this might be a good reference book.

The consequence was great irritation and befuddlement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have worked better as a stage play","review":"I just felt bored. I was looking for a promising story about the american gold rush - and so I got to this film. I really love movies and I must say that watching this movie just was a waste of time. Nothing really works. The story could have been of some interest. But neither the director nor the really poor cast could transform the drama into the necessary dimension. There is not one character you care about. Well, there is a lot of just white landscape. You can do not much with that setting concerning outdoor shots. But if the camerawork would have been a bit more inventing, the whole thing could have been more interesting. I don't think that static shots have to underline stagnation in the character development. It might be that the movie works better in a theater, but for home entertainment on DVD it offers nothing of inerest. The sound design works well, but that's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll sleep soundly. Don't forget the blanket.","review":"Good heavens, is this film boring. Long, meandering, poorly edited, well-shot, and generally well-acted (with the exception of Milla Jovovich...this film is at least noteworthy for highlighting her lack of charisma and acting talent in a stunningly effective manner).

An overrated snoozefest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thomas Hardy? Not even Oliver Hardy!","review":"After two hours of watching it, I still don't know what it was about. Yes, the scenery is fantastic, but a National Geographic film would have done more.I applaud the acting of Milla Jovovich, and Nastassja Kinski. But, the kudos reviewers have given to Peter Mullen would have been better deserved if this were a silent movie. I hardly heard anything he said and there are no English subtitles offered on the dvd. As for Wes Bentley, that's acting? He kept the same expression when he was having sex as when he was having a gun pointed at him, or a co-worker being blown to \\"Kingdom Come\\" (that's a pun based on the movie). He makes Clint Eastwood look like Laurence Olivier.The film is supposedly based on a Thomas Hardy book, but very loosely based, and the scriptwriters should have at least used Cliff Notes to have learned more about the story and the character development. They obviously fell asleep after the first couple of chapters and made up the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epic (n): 2+ hr. movie with no attention to characterization","review":"Thankfully, it's only 2 hours (as opposed to typical epic movie durations). When will Hollywood and movie critics realize that a movie isn't very satisfying if it has only one dimentional characters? No amount of scenery or historical reference will change that. I bought this video because of the positive reviews on the cover: \\"One of the top 10 films of the year\\"--Chicago Sun Times, \\"Two Thumbs Up\\"--Ebert and Roeper, and \\"One of the years best films!\\"--Jeffery Lyons. It's interesting to note that Hollywood has been in a decline since film historian/critics began to frequent the airwaves with their own shows (which, btw, are produced by the same corporations that make the movies). Oh well, I should've known better than to listen to the praise of predicable critics. Overall, I give the movie 2 stars (the scenery and the actresses were pretty), 0 stars for the reviews. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing, boring mess that never goes anywhere","review":"This is a bloated pompous mess of a movie that looks really good and wants to be good, but cannot be. The editing is mostly to blame. It jumps around from time period to time period without much warning and then there are the events in the movie that make little sense. For example, why does a fully furnished house moved into place by men and horses, not have broken dishes, crockery, paintings on the floor, etc.? Instead everything is perfect when the actors step inside. And why is a train circa 1930's running around in 1900 California? And how on God's green Earth could someone be buried six feet under when there is a good two feet of snow on the ground (anyone who lives in a snowbound area knows this is impossible)? Wes Bentley isn't so much acting as just saying lines. The one thing this movie had in its favor is that none of the actors had straight teeth - and that would be fitting for the era..."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Epic Bore","review":"Sytle over substance in this bleak, dreary, cimino-lookalike. The characters faded into obscurity as the director attempts to make his film more than it is. He absolutely aims for EPIC when his screenplay and characters are not up to the task. I gave it two stars for wardrobe and cinematic audacity. There were great sweeping scenes of mountains, snow, barroom burlesque, fires, railroads, but little in the way of an engaging plot.Other reviewers have given the basics of the plot and setting, so I won't repeat that information here. Suffice it to say that as this film dragged on, I eagerly anticipated the ending, not because I was curious about the outcome, but because I was weary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This blew. I got suckered by the blurbs on the front of the box. I don't see how Siskel and Ebert gave this movie two thumbs up. The story is bleak and depressing. Not a single character is likeable.

Editing mostly I'd say, I asked myself halfway through \\"where's the plot?\\" and didn't even realize it was borrowing from Thomas Hardy till about the three-quarter point.

He arrived many years earlier with his wife and infant child, whom he traded for the claim of the goldmine in Kingdome Come.

Sarah Polley's character is annoyingly undeveloped, coming off as innocent and naive in the first half of the film and then suddenly out of the blue (boom!) she is an aspiring actress and is singing in a bar?!? Wes Bentley looks exactly like he is - a young actor in a fake beard trying to play someone older and more mature. And Winterbottom's direction is intensely bland, looking like he must have attended the Clint Eastwood school of uninspired filmmaking. No wonder this film sank out of sight after its release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Las Vegas again","review":"This is the first NEW CD from Buddy Greco in years.

I wear a size 7 on every pair of shoes that I bought and they're usually a bit loose so I can move around easily. This sizing must have came from Japan or something cos it ain't U.S.A size. A 7 is more like a size 5.5 so don't bother buying this shoes. Its nothing special. The only thing about it is its cheap but since it doesn't fit you, no point of getting it at all unless u don't mind throwing away $10 + shipping and the shipping for me costs more than the shoe itself. Buyers be warned!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I See A Deal....and Shame on Me...","review":"I couldn't wait to get these shoes. I work with children and have to be able to run all over. I ordered two pairs, one in 6.5 (my true size) and one in a 7 (size I can wear in most athletic shoes). They charged me for 2 pair and canceled the size 7. I've been fighting with them and waiting forever for the pair they did have. Now, the shoes came and are made for a concubine who binds her feet and I'm out the cost of the other pair plus shipping. REDICULOUS!!!!!!!!!!! I will never do business with them again. I thought I could trust them because they were selling through Amazon...THINK AGAIN!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizing is wrong","review":"I ordered a 1/2 size bigger than my normal size and the shoes are too tight and very uncomfortable. I am going to try to sell them on Craig's List since it looks like there would not be much of a refund if I return them to the company!!The shoes are cute but if you want to buy them, I would say get a whole size or even a size and a half larger than you normally would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sure as hell not what I expected","review":"Like others have said below, it is a very very tight fit. I had even gotten a size a half size bigger than what I normally wear since my feet are somewhat wide, and they were still incredibly tight. They gave a pittance of a refund.

I knew the Ladies could play--but this disc also shows what wonderful singers they are.I'm not usually one for recordings that I call \\"guest-fests.\\" Yet the Ladies have picked such great partners (John McCutcheon, the Clancy Brothers and Arlo Guthrie among them) on this CD that I am most impressed.Beyond its excellence, you just get the sense that this music was a blast to play. This is artistry and music done at its best--in community and friendship.The songs are all great. There is not a weak link to be found. My personal favorite is the version of The Mad Puck Goat. Also of special note are Rambling Irish Man (with its excellent grouping of artists) and the absolutely haunting Down by the Glenside.I give this disc my wholehearted recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few too many guest singers","review":"I think there should have been more focus on the band, rather than guest performers. In general, I didn't like the guest singing performances, despite how famous the guys may be. The instrumental tracks are stellar, with all-star guests such as Liam O'Flynn and Matt Molloy. \\"Broom of the Cowdenknowes\\" is my favorite track. Great song, great vocals. \\"Erin Grá Mo Chroí\\" is a beautiful song very well-sung (the Dervish version on Midsummer's Night is also highly recommended). \\"Queen of Connemara\\" and \\"Jolly Beggarman\\" are other good songs. I didn't really like the arrangement of \\"An Poc Ar Buile\\", although it is still a good song. The other songs just didn't do it for me. But still definitely worth buying for any trad fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cherish The Ladies.....Everyone should cherish their lovely Celtic Music!","review":"I absolutely love this album! I purchased my first copy about 2 years ago and played it over and over again because I love so many of the tunes and learned a few songs for the Irish Feis' and the Fleadh Ceol. I played this CD so much, I think I wore it out...so I recently purchased another copy in June, 2006. I love Deidre Connolly's voice (especially on Erin Gra Mo Chroi---Ireland Love Of My Heart)....just brilliant!

Not happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"Disregard the advertising that says this album is by Cherish the Ladies; it isn't. First, you have to understand that in this kind of music there is a terrible double standard: Female singers are expected to sound angelic while male singers are expected to have spent the last twenty years conditioning their voices by gargling with drain opener. The album is more of medical interest than musical interest. It displays many of the various ways the male vocal chords can be damaged by gargling with drain cleaner. The closest analogy I can think of is: Imagine a CD \\"by Judy Collins\\" 80 percent of which is actually the singing of American ex-president Bill Clinton."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure if this was the right soil","review":"I received the soil and transplanted my gardenia bonsai and noticed that the little tree was doing less well day after day.

A tale that might have been told in 100 pages -- if at all -- is dragged out far too long. The timelines are confusing, and verifiably inconsistent; the characters are unappealing to the last and completely predictable; and the story itself goes nowhere. You're told all you need to know on page 1 and the rest is overblown description and repetition. Obviously, I regret taking the time to read this book and can only recommend that other readers try something -- anything -- else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truthful fiction","review":"Matthiessen's Killing Mr. Watson trilogy, of which Lost Man's River is the middle part, is to me an excellent example of how fiction describes reality better, more intensely, and in a way that is hard to explain, more truthfully, than, let's say, a factual report by a newspaper (or the police, for that matter)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Until now I thought I was a patient reader.","review":"I've read only the first 135 pages of this novel, but feel compelled to publish my critique less I die of boredom (or old age) before I finish it. Perhaps my exhaustion comes from the fact that I've had to reread every other sentence to have any idea what's going on. Despite a beautiful cover, this book is a web of tedious geniology almost completely void of anything close to a plot. If I live long enough to finish it, I'm afraid the experience to date will still be enough to leave me dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mangrove Novel","review":"Living in southwest Florida in the area of much of the locale of this story I was constantly reminded of the tangle of the mangrove forests which are typical of the coastal waters of this part of the world and the Ten Thousand Islands in particular. Virtually impenetrable. So was the confusing mass of cracker family detail piled on the reader. One has to force one's way through it and the result is a pretty thin story at the end. However the author's tidbits of history about the area and the spoilation of the Everglades is of interest for those having some knowledge of and curiosity about the subjects. I also felt that this New York born writer carries a lot of his Yankee baggage with him which causes him to unload the usual northern liberal unsympathetic, vulgar, racist stereotyping of southern life of the past on the readers. Way overdone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A scientist writes great Literature","review":"Second part of trilogy starting with 'Killing Mr Watson' I can't wait for the third. A man searches for the 'true' story of his father and finds the universal truth. That what we think and say depends on who we are talking to and why. These books tell us much more about humanity then the bible for example, even touches on. What seems a simple story that Mr. Watson was gunned down by a erstwhile posse because they suspected he was a killer, becomes a beautiful literary exercise in the terrible legacy of the human animal. Mr. Mattheissen has awesome experience in all the ways of the world and shows it off here with ruthless honesty. Imbedded in this tale is the utter desecration of the enviroment as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picks up where Mr. Watson left off, and goes way beyond","review":"Matthieson has one of the most unique and evocative writing styles, and for a person who grew up in NYC, his ability to write in the voices of denizens of the everglades is amazing. It gets a little slow at certain points, as some of the same ground is gone over many times - but once you finish, you realize that this repetitiveness is exactly what the main character's obsession with his father's death would lead too: he just can't let go; he needs to keep at it, no matter the cost. And what a cost. Overall, I loved it. I can't wait for the last installment of the triology."},{"rating":"1","title":"a chore to get through","review":"although i admire the author's use of language, and do admit he's a very good writer, i had a rather hard time with this book. i usually read about a book a week (generally not fluff), and it took me almost a month to get through 2/3 of it. i had a lot of trouble keeping track of all the characters -- i actually made a series of \\"family trees,\\" trying to figure out how everyone in the book was connected. that helped, but didn't make the book any more fun to read. (the author should have included some sort of chart or legend in the book -- i kept looking for one every time he introduced a new character). maybe the ending makes the whole book worthwhile -- i don't know. i gave up before i finished. maybe if i had read the first book of the trilogy, i would have gotten more out of it. as it is, i've moved on to books that are a pleasure to read, rather than a chore."},{"rating":"1","title":"An effort to sell books leads author to incorrect timeline","review":"After waiting eagerly for the second saga of life in the Everglades, I was disappointed with an inaccurate time line, malicious use of real people 's names with bad events at the wrong time and place in The Everglades history.... a portrayal of good and simple people as rednecks, crooks and drug runners.

When I first saw it as a play I did not understand the plot at all. Finally I read the play and enjoyed it immensely. I think one of the reasons that I enjoyed it so much is that it is not a tragedy. I really enjoyed this edition because of the fact that it is written using Shakespeare's vocabulary. But it has definitions of the words that you are most likely going to stumble over.It has two plots which makes it more interesting, but it is still very easy to follow. Much Ado About Nothing starts off with Count Claudio falling in love with Hero whom he is going to marry. Don John doesn't want him to marry Hero. So Don John decides to come up with a plan to keep Claudio from marrying Hero. The second plot has most of the characters trying to make two people who hate each other fall in love."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest stories ever overlooked","review":"Much Ado About Nothing will entice even the most stubborn high school junior into reading Shakespeare. Forget about Romeo and Juliet's tragic love, don't even think about turning to Othello and Desdemona for entertainment. Instead, see what happens when Claudio plays out the classic role of never going to the source to find out the truth when he hears of his future wife's unfaithfullness. (He really missed the boat when he believed his jealous half brother over his bride-to-be's indignant insistance of innocence.)Then there is the other pair of equally 'star crossed', ah, enemies, Beatrice and Benedick who spend the majority of their time cat-fighting and spitting hateful nasties at each other; as everyone around them, Prince and Uncle included, know that they are truly, if hopelessly, meant to be together. This is Shakespeare's best comedy, and it deserves more recognitio"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare at his best","review":"This is probably the best play by Shakespeare I have ever read. It's funny, romantic, and classy. I loved the movie. I was first introduced to the play when I watched the film, and I loved it so much, I decided to buy the book. Now I read it whenever I can. Shakespeare isn't all tragedy and murder. He can be funny too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Ado About Something...","review":"Of the Shakespeare books I have read, Much Ado About Nothing is one of my favorites for several reasons. First of all, the notes on the bottom of each page were useful because I didn't have to take time to search for archaic words in a dictionary. When trying to read a long play, stopping to look up words every 5 minutes or so can be quite annoying. Secondly, this book had an intriguing plot. Although I do not clearly understand the motives of the cruel Don John, his plan to destroy the happiness of Claudio and Hero is quite clever. Furthermore, I found Beatrice and Benedick's relationship somewhat bizarre, it quickly transforms from hate to love with no logical reason. My favorite scenes of the play featured the characters Dogberry and Verges. I thought their constant confusion was quite amusing. Overall, I'd say reading this play is very worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never came. No response from Best Price Mirror","review":"The product never came.

Adams states right up front that he does not agree with many of the ideas put forth in his work, and that he has chosen simplicity as the determining factor when choosing a theory to present. This leaves the reader free to cull meaning selectively, sometimes in a very literal fashion, other times in a very abstract way, rather than trying to make sense of the disconnected dialogs as a whole.Rather than beating an idea to death, most chapters are very short and sweet, without forced segues to the following chapter or idea. The work can easily be read in an afternoon, but nearly every page contains hours of discussion material. Definitely worth reading, and re-reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute waste of time, money and effort.","review":"Anyone with a basic understanding of science and religion will wonder where the thought provoking ideas are.Want an example: Galaxies are formed following simple probability. i.e. a Bell Curve. That's why they all look like they do. I guess Scott has never heard of a cluster galaxy. The entire book follows that same pattern.And as for the part that tries to deal with religion, here is all you need to do. Read about Augustine and the little boy he encountered while attempting to come to grips with the depths of the doctrine of the Trinity. Here's a hint,you can't fit the ocean in a small sand hole.I truly enjoy Dilbert and believe Scott is an excellent comic writer but he should really leave science and religionto people who truly understand it. BTW, I returned the book the very next day and got something worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing work from a good author","review":"I expected to enjoy this book but just couldn't. Scott Adams is a smart man, witty and clever, but this book was just frustrating in its very weak logic and its ignorance of bread-and-butter philosophical ideas found elsewhere. I normally enjoy a good new-age thought experiment but this one was just too hastily conceived, too from-the-hip to be given any weight. I feel like I have wasted my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really funny and fun too","review":"If you find you can't laugh while reading this book, no amountof explaining will help you.

This was good,but definitly an \\"early work\\". Most chapters had me laughing,and on a few it took me several minutes to stop so I could keepreading. Telling a joke verbally and telling it on paper requiredifferent timing, and I think he's almost got it.I'm looking forward to more books from Mr. Adams - I'm prettysure he will improve with practice. God's Debris is easy toread, fun and really funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Author Scott Adams challenges the reader to seek out the truth or BS in the various statements made by the two characters in this book. I took him up on it. Conclusion: It's almost all BS.Most of the obvious \\"fact statements\\" were patently false. Some merely a trite condensation of complex physics. Very few were even relatively close to accurate. This \\"thought experiment\\" was not worth the time I spent reading it, let alone looking for the material to prove or disclaim the various statements made by the protaganists.In looking at the reviews, and his introductory claim that no one under the age of 14 should read this, I was looking forward to a truly interesting and thought provoking read. What I found was an ill-composed, poorly thought out mish-mash of New Age pseudo-philosophical concepts. The only reason I won't give this to my 12 year old is that I don't want to waste his time as I wasted mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"Because God is all powerful & all knowing, the characters in Scott Adams' dialogue believe that self destruction would be His only challenge. Having taking up that challenge & having blown Himself up, God has been reduced to His own debris. We are part of God's dust, which (according to the characters) is now on a mission to reassemble itself (for another round of self-destruction?).Outside of some pretentious smart alecks with whom I went to high school 35 years ago, I don't know of anyone who could take this book's basic premise seriously! I guess the not-so-subtle inference is that anyone else's theology makes just as much (or as little) sense.If Adams is trying (in a very convoluted way) to make the point that the only reason for believing anything should be that it is true, I wholeheartedly agree! With that in mind, I suggest that theCompendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Churchand theHandbook of Christian Apologeticsmake far superior investments."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a thought experiment","review":"This was one of the best books I have ever read.

However, Adams fails to come up with anything interesting, new, or even profound in this non-comic endeavor. While some readers may find ideas here that are \\"new\\" (in the sense that the reader hasn't seen the idea(s) before), most people with any serious background in philosophy, science or religion will find anything new.The book itself is written decently enough, and as a story may hold some interest for some. I even like the overall goal of making people think. But after reading it, I find the overall \\"philosophy\\" to be sloppy and unimaginitive. At least I'll give him credit; he warns the reader in the forward that some of the \\"scientific facts\\" in the book are \\"baloney.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"Adams says he wants this to be a thought experiment, but for anybody with even rudimentary knowledge in a hard science, math, or philosophy, the majority of ideas presented in this book will be either obviously false or trite. I'm not quite sure why Adams thought it'd be fun to tease out what he says that's reasonable from what he says that's unreasonable, but it isn't fun. It's boring. Worse yet, anybody who has considered these same issues has probably already discovered a better system. I guess if you're really desperate for an unchallenging philosophy book to read, then read this one. If you want something with novel, reasonable philosophical views, read something else.

But, it has value in challenging a modern reader to ask themselves why they see the world and life the way they do; do we really believe what we say. The product, I'd guess, of a deep cynic.

All the major points have been covered multiple times by other reviews, so I won't restate them here. However, the person who complained about the science being completely wrong OBVIOUSLY failed to read the introduction. Adams explains that a good part of the science is made up.

It's just a silly book. It wasn't challenging, there were no really new ideas expressed in it. It was a thorough, resounding disappointment. Scott Adams really should stick to what he's good at - Dilbert. Additionally - I was absolutely nonplussed at the audacity of the reviews that were put on the jacket cover.

I am in my third year of medical school and graduated undergrad with honors with a hard science degree, so I have a pretty firm science background, and I know many points in the book are inaccurate.

It's the kind of stuff you'll find amazing if you've never read a book in your life, or dare I say it, if you have a double digit IQ.I'm quite saddened so many people rated this book highly.

It's borderline plagarism (here, let me steal the writing style from Plato and move on), except that none of the ideas presented in this book make any sense when compared to the Republic. In fact, the ideas in this book could not hold up to the intense scrutiny of an Eighth Grade Science class. If you think this book gives you any insight on philosophy, you're sadly mistaken.

You could even just stick with the Dilbert books, since those are brilliant and are what Scott Adams does best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak arguments, full of Hubris","review":"Adams uses typical arguments meant to disarm traditional theists. Too bad the arguments are weak and tired. By the way, the only person who can say that all the roads lead up to the top of the mtn is the person who sees and knows all roads. I don't know anyone truly that arrogant who believes he knows all religious systems, especially since there have been thousands of them! Beyond the thought experiment there is little to commend here. It might be best if Mr. Adams were to stick to his comics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and thought provoking","review":"This is a book that will really make you think. The whole point of the book is to try to find where the argument that is presented in the book is wrong. Not an easy thing to do - as long as you work within the framework presented (some of the facts that are offered to support the argument are obviously wrong, but must be accepted as basic postulates - you don't have to agree with them, but whether they are right or wrong doesn't really impinge upon the thought expieriment presented). It's a form of writing that hasn't been done much recently (Think something closer to \\"Plato's Republic\\").One thing that should be mentioned - This is NOT a Dilbert book. It contains no humor and no cartoons. If that is what you are looking for, then pass this book.In short, if you are looking for something that will make you think try this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very worthwhile read","review":"This book will definitely set your brain in motion. Even though it's relatively short (I finished it in about three hours, and I'm a slow reader), there's plenty in it to think about. Adams raises some good points, and then some not-so-good points, but just about everything he says makes sense on some level and forces you to look at the way you think. The story through which the whole God's Debris theory is told makes it a bit more enjoyable. Adams' writing style is likewise engaging. One recommendation, though: get the electronic form if at all possible.

Pretending to rise to an intellectual challenge of the human mind, it does little to stimulate and tends to serve at best as bedtime reading when you are trying to fall asleep.Some of the premises are plain absurd. The idea of the \\"all-knowing\\" character is a good start, but what comes after that is flat and uninspiring. Take the first point: Probability triggers off no \\"why\\". Statisticians and mathematicians must cringe at the suggestion that the chances of a flipped coin falling on one side (head or tail) are 50%.

Most of my rebuttals came before I finished reading the paragraph at hand.I give two stars instead of one, because Adams actually made an attempt to think deep, but I don't honestly feel he is qualified, as his writings were so very shallow and uninspiring.Do yourself a favor, and save your philosophical inquiries for Socrates, Descartes and Nietzsche."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new","review":"Those who find this book \\"ground breaking\\" or that it \\"spins their minds\\" have done very little reading in philosophy, theology, or modern physics.

While this book isn't for the faint of spirit, anyone who likes to think outside the box will enjoy this book.I definitely look forward to future experiments from Scott Adams!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is weak!","review":"I'll give this book one star because it did generate some thoughts. However, if you're looking for a book that will give your mind something invigorating to ponder, forget this one. Its psuedo-facts, its psuedo-logic, and its incorrect use of the notion of probability make this story easy to dismiss. It doesn't even read well. It also doesn't present any real meaningful truths. The author wields a grandiose idea that \\"probability\\" is in control of the universe. This is merely semantics. It's like saying \\"time\\" is in control of the universe. Both are only ways to help define events--not the cause of events. The author says in his introduction that there is some hidden agenda or message to be extracted from this unbelievable and child-like conversation. I really think that statement is a ploy to sell books. This story is too contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't quit your day job","review":"Well I guess I'll have to be contrary because I didn't get anything out of this book.

I love Dilbert though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Analyzed It, Loved It!","review":"I was a little iffy about wanting to see this movie since most Mafia comedies are pretty bad, but I was surprised to discover this movie is actually funny! It is all about De Niro and he definitely makes the movie. Just watching him cry is funny because you just can't really imagine him ever doing so, and watching him break down is hysterical at times. It has a few slow spots here and there, but a very good movie in the end. I highly recommend this movie, there were a lot of times that I busted out laughing! This is the kind of film that you will want to watch again and again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A comedy classic that stands alone","review":"Analyze this is a funny movie, there is little doubt of that. However it is not the premis here that is funny (well it is but there is more to it than that), but what makes this really funny is that Robert DeNiro is spoofing some of his most memorable roles here. Let me explain.Robert DeNiro plays Paul Vito, a head of one of New Yorks most infamouse mobs. One day one of his best friends is murdered in a drive by. From there he decides to track down who it was that called the hit. However in his search he sufferes an emotional breakdown and needs therapy. One of his lackies takes him to Billy Crystal who is very reluctant to treat him. The end result is a very funny movie where DeNiro just won't quite and will do anything to be treated, using of course his powers of persuasion.Analyze this is a comedy classic, with a funny cast, jokes that are hits, and plenty of humor to pass around, this is a classic for the ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like De Niro, stay away.","review":"I bought this DVD right after I watched RONIN, and Heat. I am also a fun of Billy and love comedies. This movie is not funny at all except for a few scenes. Kudrow should not be in this movie, she made the average-quality film below-average. Billy did so-so job, but De Niro does not seem to be serious to act here. They could add French track so that I could get at least some advantage from this. I just started to learn French."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is too much","review":"Ok I get it, it was supposed to be funny. But in reality it wasn't. A mafia man who cries all the time?

And that's about all this film has. The theme is somewhat similar to \\"The Sopranos\\" with the big time gangster seeing a psychiatrist. But any five minutes of \\"The Sopranos\\" has more wit and imagination than this entire movie. Robert DiNiro does a good job playing his stereotypical gangster role for laughs, and he does manage a few. Billy Crystal, on the other hand, is yet again playing the same character he plays in just about every movie he's in. That wouldn't be so bad if the script didn't completely take plausibility for a ride. \\"The Sopranos\\" is so good (and funny) because it seems so real. \\"Analyze This,\\" especially the horrendously unbelievable and unfunny climax, scene rings so hollow and so false that it becomes nearly unwatchable for any true fan of gangster movies. Bottom line, if you are a gangster buff, fughettaboutit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped","review":"After reading all of the good reviews this movie received I made the mistake of purchasing it. I love DeNiro but this movie was just ridiculous; I just couldn't buy into DeNiro as a mob boss with panic attacks. Instead of being funny, the movie comes off as completely ridiculous. Crystal is horrible as a psychiatrist and really kills the movie. Overall, just another movie that has its moments but is not nearly as funny as it should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't remember laughing one time!!! STUPID at BEST","review":"I'm not sure what was funny about this movie. Maybe I was just having a bad day, but I thought this movie was stupid. It is, by far, Robert DeNiro's worst performance. I couldn't stand to see him act like he was crying(if you want to call that acting?). It's not his cup of tea. I couldn't recommend this movie because it is not a comedy...it is a travisty! I couldn't get past the 'TOUCHY-FEELY' aspect of the movie. NOT FUNNY or ENJOYABLE at all! STUPID AT BEST. Gary Fox"},{"rating":"1","title":"Analyzing This Bad Movie","review":"You know, real mobsters don't even swear as much as the fictional one's in \\"Analyze This\\" do. Profanity in the movie is taken to a new level. You'll hear four-letter words in this movie in people's vocabulary more than a, and and the. The swearing is so terrible that it makes the movie just sick and almost impossible to watch.There are a few very funny parts: when Paul Vitti(Bobby De Niro) cries when he sees a tv commercial about life insurance; when Vitti offers his psychotherapist(Billy Crystal) action from one of his mermaids; when Lisa Kudrow mocks Bobby De Niro with a voice that makes you think: that was funnier than anything she ever said on friends; and when another mobster points a gun at a cow for standing too close to his car. Those limited funny parts give me a reason to give it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"One of the worst movies ever produced.

Be sure to check out Analyze This also!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining and Funny","review":"Analyze This is a very entertaining and humorous movie, starring the comical Billy Crystal, and the acting genius Robert De Niro. De Niro spoofs the mafia, and portrays a mobster don who, on the exterior appears to be a violent tough-guy, but on the interior is really a disturbed man who has turbulent emotions, including anger, sadness, and panic. It's hilarious seeing a mobster cry. One of the only faults was that sometimes they overdid the adult language (just a little, not that much though). But, besides that, the film is a wonderful laugh riot. Don't expect this to be as funny as De Niro's \\"Meet the Parents\\", but do expect an entertaining parody of the Italian mafia."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great comedic role for De Niro","review":"I saw this movie a second time after watching a Bio episode on Robert De Niro. It said how this movie ended the typecasting he faced: only a dramatic actor. He really is funny in this role, and it was a pleasure to watch, again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible De Niro movie, shame on him.","review":"This movie is nothing more than a theft of plot from National Lampoon's 1997 hit \\"The Don's Analyst\\". If you want to see a hilarious psycho-spoof about a Mob boss, see this one. Robert Loggia is, as always, excellent and very, very funny. The rest of the cast supports with vigour.As for \\"Anylyze This\\", if it weren't for De Niro I would have given it 1 star. Billy Crystal is his usual incompetent self; Harold Ramis fails miserably.Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was Disappointed","review":"It wasn't that great.

If anything it would have been more ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Funny If You Analyze It","review":"If you analyze this movie, you find the very stereotypical character played by De Niro, wasting his time doing God knows what. The psychiatrist played by Crystal spouts some Fruedian nonsense that is neither humorous, nor serious. At the movie progresses all actors seem to conspire to overplay their roles--they almost compete against each other as to whose mannerisms will be more pronounced. The end is contrived, which is probably the logical conclusion for this lame movie. It symbolically self-destructs, having managed only a few laughs along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Analyze This","review":"First of all, I'm a huge fan of The Godfather and The Sopranos. I'm also a huge DeNiro fan as well. Despite some of the negative critics, I found this movie well worth seeing due to DeNiro's display of comedy.

But still it is good.If you want to enjoy this movie don't think of it as it can be real or not... instead swallow it as a light funny meal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant refreshing comedy!","review":"This has to be one of the funniest movies that has ever been made. The premise itself is funny. A mob boss getting in touch with his feelings. The therapy sessions bring out very funny scenarios as ideas and concepts are intrepreted from different perspectives. What is normal in phsyco speak is completely repulsive to a mobster. Likewise, what is normal for a mobster is completely irrational to a psychiatrist. When Crystal suggests Deniro may have sexual feelings about his Mother that are described as normal, Deniro is afraid to call his mother after that. Then of course, the patient confidentially issue comes up. As a patient, Deniro shares secrets with his doctor. The consequences for the Doctor violating that confidentially has a whole new meaning when the patient is a wiseguy! This is not a movie that relies on one liners or gags for the laughs. It is the situations that are funny. A movie that will stand the test of time and keep you laughing long after it's over."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Won't Find A Lot Of Laughs Here","review":"The movie was watchable (rent from Blockbuster or another video rental store).

'Please God! Dont know!\\" or where he asks Robert DeNiro to \\"hit a pillow\\", so he pulls out his gun and starts shooting it...

But whoever made this film did a total 180 and had the guy go back to his ex-wife. Shudder and gag. As werewolf movies this was marginally ok, especially with the effects.

The same author has done this before in relation to Atlantis, immediately after the spin-off series was released.This 'presentation' is a variation on the astronauts built the pyramids and the gods are really ETs theme, and a poorly presented one at that.

I'd recommend plowing through the rest of your reading list and then picking this book up for a nice, informative, quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Effort Falls Short","review":"A very uneven book, with a fundamentally sound point the author makes: The military has more tools (and less will and training) than either the US State Department or the UN with respect to its impact on foreign governments. I say \\"uneven\\" because it starts as a documentary of what the Defense department structure is, worldwide, fails to complete its \\"explaining\\" for each sector, and then launches into \\"Kosovo in detail.\\" The grist for the last 1/3 of the book is probably the FOI act court transcript of the guilty sergeant, as well as reporting from the area.... but it completely fails to mesh with the front 2/3 of the book. The writing of the Kosovo 1/3 is beautiful. But the author fails to summarize the case, call for specific change, and ends with a whimper. I wish she had written a novel about Kosovo instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD EARLY GANGSTER FILM","review":"Roland West's \\"Alibi\\" is a good example of what gangster films were like before Warner Brothers delivered its 1-2 punch of \\"Little Caesar\\" and \\"The Public Enemy.\\" Yes, it's a bit theatrical, the action is patchy and the characters are less than role models of \\"gritty realism.\\" But that doesn't mean that \\"Alibi\\" is a failure. On the contray, it's of interest precisely because it IS so different from what came a few years later and established a template for other gangster films.The plot and dialogue give initmations of what the \\"hard-boiled\\" style would become without quite being there yet.\\"Alibi\\" is worth a look for casual viewers and is a must-have for serious students of the genre. Now, if Paramount would only get around to releasing \\"City Streets\\" and \\"Underworld\\"...."},{"rating":"2","title":"good fun","review":"This is an early talkie so you know what to expect.The sound quality is not great and the acting is awkward and stilted but there are some suspenceful and well edited sequences.I especially liked the scene where the detectives retrace the route the crooks took to the warehouse in order to time the movements of the murderer.But what really makes this dvd worth buying is the amazing performance of Regis Toomey? His performance as billy morgan the boy broker has to be seen to be believed.For this alone i give this movie a high rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"ART DECO GANGSTERS!!!!!","review":"Overall, I was very pleased to see this film come to DVD. Kino rightfully gave an explanation as to the lesser quality of the soundtrack, which I found to be generally satisfying and only noticed one actual dropout during dialogue. The picture quality does show its age but is not a problem. The only major issue is the recreated opening credits for which there is no explanation. DVD companies should note and explain the reasons for such glaring issues as this. The original end title is intact."},{"rating":"1","title":"English translation is terrible","review":"I've seen both the English dub' version and the Japanese language/English sub-title version. The sub-titled version is orders-of-magnitude better. Whoever did the English dub' for Appleseed didn't just translate, but tried to localize it, swapping the original dialog for phrases and text that would sound \\"more american\\". The result is almost two different movies. If you have a choice, ONLY get the Japanese language version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of disappointing.","review":"I was a big fan of Shirow's original manga but when I picked up the anime version I was disappointed. It seems that all the themes that made the manga meaningful were dropped sheerly for action and swearing.

The end does leave you hanging a bit though. I recommend the subtitled version over the dubbed version. The subtitles were extremely well done but the dubbing job is questionable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The CG Versions Are FAR Superior","review":"Coming from a hardcore Masamune Shirow fan, if you want to know about Appleseed, either read the mangas, or see the two excellent CGI films. This OVA from the early 80s is total cheese, taking none of the futuristic drama into account, and going for cheap laughs. It might fit the Tank Police series, but not here.

For one, There is no character development what so ever. Two, The animaton ain't all that great, plain and bland, not to much detail. Third, get subtitled, The dubbed is a sacrilege to the entire movie which isn't a very long running film to begin with. The dub degrades the entire flow of the film. It's terrible acting with misplaced words.The F word(not fornicate but the other one) is said mindlessly throughout the entire pic. The plot really was a bad one. I hoped it would develope more but it didn't.Good side is that i was in the hospital at the time. I had my appendix removed and my brother came in and handed me some movies. It helped pass the time away. That was the dubbed. Later i got it subtitled, and to my amazement nothing much changed except that i had to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Let Down Compared to the Manga!","review":"Shirow, Shirow, Shirow what were you thinking! Allowing Appleseed one of the greatest cyber punk story lines of all time becomeing a 50 min Anime! Not only that but the main story line is taken mostly from the second book in the manga series, published by Dark Horse. The voices are absolutly annoying and the animation is average.

The part that really killed it for me was where Goleman casually dismisses Richard Dawkins' \\"Selfish Gene\\" theory with an explanation \\"it works in some cases, but here's what I think is _really_ going on...\\" Way to tackle an argument buddy.You will understand less after reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of limited value due to fact that neurosciences basis for emotions is barely understood.","review":"In a nutshell this book is about the neuroscience underpinning human emotions. Yet this so-called science leaves much to be desired as the neurological basis of emotions is little understood, as even advanced researchers in this field admit. Yet Goleman's exposition makes it sound as if the relationship is down pat and solid. neither are alternative neurological views underpinning emotions presented. Hence the book give the incorrect impression that there is an agreed upon concensus among neurological scientists regarding the basis of emotions. The reality is far from this. Thus the book is of very misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of time and money","review":"If you like a rambling style of discourse that goes on and on about social experiments you might like this cd or book. The author has no concept of summarization or conciseness. Disc 1 was full of ramblings about anecdotal events remotely related to social intelligence. Same with disc 2, ditto for disc 3, disc 4 and sadly, disc 5.The author never provides suggestions, recommendations, or plans or action plans for improving one's social intelligence.This set of CDs would more aptly labeled, \\"One man's ramblings about what he read in the news in the course of a few years\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time.","review":"I read, and enjoyed Emotional Intelligence, so I assumed this book would \\"mirror\\" not only his former success, but also give me an in depth review of the latest research in this area. Instead I got a repeat of the first few opening sentences, rephrased dozens of ways, but all saying the same thing and adding nothing new. I finally gave up in disgust after the second chapter, which gives this book the honor of accompanying only two other books that I did not finish - in my entire life. It was just too much of a waste of time. If you are still interested in the latest research in this area, see the article in the November 2006 \\"Scientific American\\" (and I'm sure there are others more recent).PS, I gave it one star because the system would not allow fewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enlightening, but clunky prose","review":"This book has an interesting take on how the mind interprets the slightest events between two people such as body language, facial expression and more. The facts laid out are informative. The prose though has much to be desired. Thu author uses \\"tacit\\" far too frequently, and clutters his points with obscure and infrequently used words. Commas and em-dashes are not in expected places, leaving you to read many sentences over again to get the meaning. I felt I had to stall way too often and not glide smoothly along. Good scientific work, but bad read."},{"rating":"1","title":"social Intelligence","review":"This is more a book on how the body chemistry effects our behavior.

It doesn't feel like it's getting anywhere. And so what? What does this example MEAN? Why is it important? Is that a GOOD thing, a BAD thing? Meh.It's ironic that this book is often about how we pick up on unconscious social cues and yet the writer seems out of touch - like he's from another time. He uses words like \\"busybody\\" and \\"hitherto\\" and I can overlook that but every other line is a metaphor and every other one of those metaphors uses the word \\"dance\\". Every social interaction between two people is a \\"subtle dance.\\" YUCK.Maybe it's more obvious to me because I'm listening to the audio version, but every time he says it, I groan.Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"social intelligence","review":"1.

The thing is that it is written as a series of un-linked short stories to prove his theory. Even though it proves the point, in my opinion it is very difficult to read and follow. I am kind of disappointed, as I have read other books and articles from him, and I am having a hard time reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very academic for a book on social intelligence.","review":"The book provides tons of stories that describe and support the various explanations of SI. The mountains of material lends strongly to the author's credibility but the book is very dry. It is a bit like going to a social event and having someone talk to you about the wonders of tax code the whole time.It did examine and articulate many of the social dynamics we see every day. It could just have used some of the dynamic in the writing. Perhaps it would have been best for the author to hire someone else to translate his findings and conclusions in written form. Someone better at communicating in a compelling manner. The author describes an \\"optimal\\" state of learning that is \\"inspired.\\" Reading the book does not put you in an optimal state of learning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio CD read too fast","review":"I cannot recommend this book. I found Emotional Intelligence to be similarly dry and overly technical, but it was much more substantive. Social intelligence has a few interesting points, but overall it gets annoyingly repetitive.The main reason for my review however, is about the Audio CD. It is read to you in a hurry. With all the technical jargon thrown at you, you need time to follow. This pace is too fast for a regular book, let alone this. After repeatedly rewinding and replaying, I gave up and returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Neurological Basis for Adopting Good Manners","review":"\\"Social Intelligence\\" is a natural follow on to the ground-breaking \\"Emotional Intelligence\\". Reviews of this fine book gush on for hundreds of words. Yes, this is a book that every thinking adult should read. It's that important. WEAKNESSES: You have to endure the Golman's pedantic, somewhat tedious monologue. (I now know more about studies of white mice, children and college students than I care to know.)Hang in there! STRENGTHS: Now comes the gold nuggets. Golman synthesizes these data from some of today's finest researchers and rewards you with stunning insights. His writing is well structured and compelling. SUMMARY: Golman provides the psycho-social basis for good manners -- be open and honest, look people in the eye, smile, encourage others, never resist the opportunity to touch others in emotionally generous ways. Hey, Doc, I think you're on to something. Well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, poorly written","review":"This is a very boring, badly written text -- it just wanders all over the place and never says anything. The basic premise, I think, is that we are neurologically wired to communicate with others -- and that it takes a concerted effort on everyone's part to understand and be kind.Other than that, the thing just kills you when you try to read it straight through.Find a 10-minute video about this on YouTube and watch that instead. You'll get all you need out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good,...Not Great","review":"While the content was good, Daniel Goleman only reinforces what we already know! The contents were more a consolidation of various research out there and nothing original seems to have been conveyed in this book by Daniel Goleman.There is no consistent flow from one chapter to another and Goleman keeps moving from one EI topic to another without making any connection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Goleman is adept at sounding impressive, but this book contains little of substantive value. It seems designed to confirm the average person's existing beliefs rather than to educate. He often mentions research of marginal relevance using unnecessary technical jargon in ways that sound superficially authoritative.The subject of the book might be better described as social skills rather than intelligence.One example of how the book annoyed me was this jab at a strawman: \\"to the great surprise of those who believe genes alone determine behavior\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Associates Matter","review":"On page 5 under the subheading; The Social Brain, he makes this comment; \\"The spotlight shifts to those ephemeral moments that emerge as we interact.

Our creator warns us about the same consequence, without scientific explanations, by saying, \\"Do not be misled. Bad associates spoil useful habits.\\" (1Corinthians 15:33) It made me question myself, what other 'scientific' explainations do we need before we start listening to our Creator that many scientists deny the existence of?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Book Has No Contents!","review":"I know I ordered the audio book, but honestly, can I at least have a printed table of contents so I can understand which of the ten CDs I should put in to re-listen to a portion of interest?This product has NO printed information about the book's organization.

This book does it a disservice.This book is poorly organized and presents only brief summary of many fascinating ideas. You might find something that interests you, but you're unlikely to find it in enough detail to get a clear understanding of it.Honestly I expected better from Daniel Goleman and I was quite disappointed by this book. Unfortunately I don't yet have a better book to recommend instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Social Intelligence: dealing with connectedness","review":"I generally read Daniel Goleman's books because, to me, they contain a great deal of sense. This book is no exception.Whether this is new science or not, the reality is that our connectedness with each other is important to both the way we interact and the (often subconscious) assumptions we make underlying those interactions. Some of what is written in this book may seem obvious, but in the context of the electronic media we increasingly use to connect with each other there are new social issues to explore.I recommend this book as a starting point to those managing and interacting with people in an electronic age and as an adjunct to Dr Goleman's earlier works. While this can be read as a standalone book, I believe that the best learning value will accrue from reading this book in conjunction with Dr Goleman's earlier work on emotional intelligence.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"rating":"2","title":"Readable and full of examples","review":"The author posits that social intelligence is an important trait in our lives and often takes place in a level outside our general consciousness. He also attempts to distinguishing between \\"social intelligence\\" and \\"manipulative social control\\". While aspects of social intelligence can be used to manipulate, true social intelligence goes beyond that.After describing the concept of \\"social intelligence\\" in the first part of the book, he goes on to detail many of the examples of where \\"social intelligence\\" can be used to achieve true games in individual relationships and society at large. Many of these arguments come across as \\"socialist\\" (which should not be surprising, given that they are based on \\"social\\" intelligence.)He provides some scholarly base throughout the book, yet never comes across as being overly academic, making the book easily readable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but too long","review":"This book is an expansion of Emotional Intelligence.

This, good sirs, is no Amelie soundtrack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent...","review":"My introduction to Tiersen came by way of the soundtrack to \\"Amelie\\", a magical film. Tiersen used a combination of instruments from accordian to mellotron to create music that seems to from a future cafe in Paris that tries to capture a moment from the innocent 1920's. On the strength of that work, I bought this.I'm definitely impressed with the range of his own album and mix of vocal and instrumental tracks. In particular, the guest vocalists run the gamut of ranges and styles but yet all of the songs seem to part of a main theme. This is no doubt due to Tiersen's use of instruments such as the accordian (and finger harp, I swear) strings that are common throughout the album.Quiet and emotional but never boring. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointed...","review":"I, like so many others, was taken by the subtle magnificence of the 'Amelie' soundtrack. Yann Tiersen's moody pieces perfectly captured, not only the essence of the film, but the hearts of so many listeners. Though I was not expecting an artistic repeat of this perfectly captured CD, I also was not expecting L'Absente to be so disappointing. Here, Tiersen has added (or perhaps subtracted in good taste on the soundtrack) vocals to accompany several of Amelie's pieces...rendering the pieces campy distortions. Any charm of an individual piece is made moot by the cd's poor track arrangement. I kept listening for a tread to sew the pieces together, but was left with a jumble of discontinuity. After reading other's reviews, I was hoping to learn more of Tiersen's work through this cd. After several listens, I won't be looking any further...bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proceed with caution","review":"It is perhaps because I was expecting the smooth, charming, nostalgic refrains of the Amelie soundtrack that I find L'Absente so disappointing. I found elements on several of the tracks to be noisy, mechanical, synthetic and intrusive if not annoying. The English lyrics on some of the tunes put me off as well. Not that I don't appreciate the English language. It's just that I was anticipating something French (of which there are a few). I'm writing this after a couple of listens. With a few more, I may mellow. But this is my initial reaction. I sure love Amelie, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am using another review becuase it is exactly how I feel.","review":"\\"It is perhaps because I was expecting the smooth, charming, nostalgic refrains of the Amelie soundtrack that I find L'Absente so disappointing.

If you're looking for serious *Borges*, this may not be of much interest. But if what you're looking for is a bestiary in the medieval tradition (with roots going back even further, to the 2nd Century Greek Physiologus), this is a great addition to the literature.Wry and clever on some pages, deliciously ambiguous and foggy on others, Borges' compendium of curious creatures makes for enjoyable perusal. The only thing missing, of course, is more creatures. Borges himself begins the work with a disclaimer that any such undertaking can never be complete, yet there was plenty of room for more here. Some omissions are surprising.

In 308 pages there is barely a positive statement like \\"this cat is black\\" or any causal construct.Instead, it has long sentences trying to touch several disparate subjects at the same time but not analyzing any, lots of rhetohric questions the author makes to himself, no honest effort in deepening on anything. It is desperating, one reads on wanting the author to say something, to enuntiate a thought, but that never happens.This writing style was fashionable among some \\"social scientists\\" circles of the seventies, and I thought it had been ostracized for good, but apparently not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointing","review":"I bought this book because I had heard of the author due to my knowledge of France and the French language.

Although she is French, she was born in the USA to an American mother and she carries an American passport.) I found the prose in the book somewhat rambling, disjointed, and seldom interesting, let alone entertaining. The contents of the book just did not seem to have any real purpose or goal; it was mostly a random collection of thoughts and observations, many of which were seemingly pointless. Perhaps it is unfair for me to say this, but this book just re-inforced my belief that one of the problems with France is that the country has too many so-called philosphers, of which BHL is one."},{"rating":"1","title":"ewwww!","review":"Having enjoyed levy's \\"Who killed Daniel Pearl\\" i was anticipating a thought-provoking intelligent read.

I didn't abuse it either.Another complaint is the on/off knobs protrude so far from the unit that when you try to put it in its undersized bag, they turn on and run the batteries down without your knowing.Lastly, if you're trying to operate the generator knob with your left hand while looking at the front of it and holding the radio with your right, there are no more hands to operate the tuning knobs or volume.

Worked just as it was suppose to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emergency Radio","review":"Received this emergency radio several weeks ago, and I have used it several time since then (thank the Lord not in an emergency situation though!). It worked great out of the box. Did everything that was promised it would do. The only draw back is that I still have not received the cell phone adapters that I sent for when I received the radio. I guess it takes the company awhile to get them into the mail to me? Otherwise, a great emergency radio!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mid-range quality. Good for occasional use rather than constant use.","review":"Everything worked out of the box. Construction is plastic, rather than metal, so long term durability may be an issue especially if it is used daily. Nice rubber sealed battery door to keep moisture out, but I'd still avoid getting it wet. I've experimented with the crank charger which worked fine, but haven't really put it to a tough real world test yet.It has a nice little battery pack that is included & you can also insert three AA NiMh batteries of your own. The tight fitting fabric case has a shoulder strap, but no room in the bag for the AC charger.It didn't include an adapter for my Motorola Razr cell phone, but when I called Eton, they sent one for free.I only use it occasionally during emergencies. Not sure if it's durable enough for constant everyday use. If your looking for something for constant use, get ready to spend a lot more money for a radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charge doesn't last, and adapter doesn't fit - DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!","review":"I was really excited about this Eton hand crank radio. However, I soon realized several problems:#1-It says to crank it at the speed of two revolutions per second for 90 seconds, and the charge should last 30 minutes. Actually, the charge only lasts 10 minutes.#2-The cellphone adapter that the company sent me fits into my cellphone, but does not fit into the radio! This renders it totally useless as a cellphone charger.#3-FM channels get all staticky once you set the radio down. It seems that if you're holding the radio, your body acts as an antenna but once you go away from it, it instantly gets all this static.To sum it all up, let me just say this -- great idea, peeps, but poor execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice little radio, and it makes me feel prepared","review":"This is a nice little radio for the price. I've noticed that it doesn't seem to work very well from the wall adapter, but works great either from batteries, or while you are actually turning the crank. Regular FM radio and the weather band stations come in loud and clear, which in my remote area is not true of cheaper radios. The alert feature works very well also. This little radio kept us informed during some scary summer weather, even with the power out.As far as the phone charger goes, the adapter tip for my cell phone came in about 6 weeks. It does in fact charge the cell phone (veeeerrrryyyy slowly...) Many minutes of cranking would probably get you enough juice to make a very brief call or send and receive several text messages. Not fabulous, but it would make essential communication possible in an extended power outage (if cell towers were working, anyway)."},{"rating":"2","title":"FR-400 No Longer Has TV Channels...","review":"...no need for them since analog is dead early next year. Great multi-function radio-light hand-crank device, but the flash light portion is really small in comparison to the overall size (light is about half the size of the smaller FR-150). Just ordered the cell phone tips AND connecting cord. The cell phone connecting cord is NOT in box like it is in the FR-150. As you can tell, we have both models; they are good complements for each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inacurate Description","review":"Product description says it comes with connection tips to recharge cell phones. It does not. One other reviewer said you have to call Eton to get such. After Christmas, I'll give that a whirl and see what happens. Otherwise, it's a good radio and the cammo version is much less expensive than the others though I'm not sure why. Maybe the cell phone tips????"},{"rating":"2","title":"still waiting on phone charger","review":"Great little product. Have not used it enough to test the battery life yet. Still waiting on the phone charger. It required sending in a card with the model of my phone. Would have made more sense to have a cigarette lighter receptical for this purpose so it could be used for more than just a phone charger."},{"rating":"1","title":"internal battery doesn't hold a charge","review":"i wound the crank at a steady pace for 5 minutes each time i have tried to use it. it worked twice for about 30 minutes each time, and now it doesn't hold a charge for more than 15-20 seconds.it still works if i plug it into the wall or if i put batteries into it but the advertised emergency use of the hand crank generator is of no use at all. this renders it no better than any other radio for emergency use.it is quite a bit more money than other radios of similiar quality(meaning cheaply built).i would not purchase this radio if i had it to do over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for power outages","review":"I use the most basic features of this radio and it works great.

I like to read books on historical fiction because you learn of the past and use it in the present to help you make decisions of things you go though. You also learn of things that you never knew took place. The main character, Martin Crawford, a young Scottish person, joined the alliance with the Robert the Bruce, king of scots, in 1290's. The Bruce is at war with King Edward, who is known as Longshanks. Martin's mother sends his brother, Sean, and him off to fight with the Bruce. Martin is not a fighting person, but he is a very clever lad, so the Bruce made him his page. As time goes on, the Bruce wins many battles and Longshanks dies. Martin's mother also dies in the book. After his mother's death, the king makes Martin his swift rider. Martin goes though many adventures and many more battles to come in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work of historical fiction!","review":"I read this book a while ago but I remembered it when I watched Braveheart several days ago.

She became and stayed what she fought against earlier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible book","review":"I was never really into this series.

(Totally Awesome) Tally is simply devilish and Shay pure malice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action Packed End to the Trilogy","review":"The Specials was the most action-packed of the first 3 in the Uglies Series. The writing and the pace moved along quickly, keeping you interested and maintaining your need to see how all of the characters from the first 2 books come together. You also begin to incorporate all three stories with the overlapping moral and ethical issues broached by Westerfeld, causing you ponder and reevaluating the plots and twists from the Uglies and the Specials. This one left me with the most unsettling feeling of the all the books, but all questions were answered and ends tied-up. I'm just not sure how I feel about society any more, especially living in Southern California where we are not to far away from this way of thinking. I would defiantly say you have to read all three to get the true feeling Westerfeld had intended and would give the overall series 5 stars. It was defiantly worth my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome but too much about tally","review":"i loved the book but there was too much about tally. i know she is the main character but still, she is too much acting like she is the center of the universe>when she ISNT.

I found this one was action packed and thought provoking in between. It is missing some of the romanticism of the first book, and also alot of the mystery. What you gain is the insight of the mind of the special which is actually really cool. Scott Westerfield also thankfully did not destroy Tally's evolving character. I am glad he didnt muck up this book in an attempt to make it like the others, although I think I needed more mystery. I think some of the anxiety / horror of the first books, where people were afraid of transformation, and fitting into different cliques is not in here. I am not sure if teens will relate as much, or anyone for that matter, but its still amazing, and if I wanted that again I could reread the first book. I would rate Specials a B, and say that its alot better than pretties, and there is really nothing bad I can say about it. Must Buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great information","review":"I just got back from a wonderful vacation to Barcelona, Spain. It was during my research for the trip that I came upon Gaudi and the architectural influence that he had on the city of Barcelona. I actually purchased the book before I went on vacation but I wanted to read it afterwards. From the intimate details that discuss the life of Gaudi and all the information I received on my trip from guided tours of the Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera (Casa Mila), and Guell Park, I have an amazing appreciation for Gaudi.Also, the pictures in this book are excellent and are much more detailed than the ones that I was able to take. They make a great addition to my visual explanations of my trip.I would recommend this book if either you are going to Barcelona, or have been there. But I would also think that it would be good for someone who is just interested in architecture or the history of someone who changed the face of Barcelona permanently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming an Informative","review":"I found this informative little volume full of wit and charm.

Someone actually took the time to think about how the pieces feel when you use them for their intended purpose ------ answer is ...... very, very nice. The lines are simple and elegant and, I think, the set is compatiable with many styles of tableware. Great buy, in my opinion, if you can straighten out the 18/0 or 18/10 to your satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Quality, Stains and Rusts Easily","review":"We bought this set based on the looks and good reviews. However after only a month of use we started noticing black stains and rust stains. We figured out that if they are not dried right away, it will stain. Which is impossible because we don't have time to individually hand dry them or when we use the dishwasher (even with the heated dry option) they still don't completely dry.

When you hold them and look at them up close you can tell they are a high quality flatware.We wash them in our dishwasher and haven't had any discoloration problems. You have to be careful not to let them sit in standing water; specially the knives.

I put a lot of blame for this waste of paper on his editor/publisher. This book should never have been released.I don't know if this is Nance's first book, but he is NOT a good writer. Indeed, he would be an average writer for the High School level. Granted, he's got a great idea - very intriguing. But (and let this be a lesson to you future writers out there) sometimes you need to let someone who has actual writing talent take your great idea and go with it.This is what Mr. Nance should have done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"I was not a fan. It wasn't very aviation-oriented. I suppose if you're into \\"Law and Order\\" style antics onboard a moving vehicle, this might be a good read (I'm not really into those kind of books).

I have the impression that Nance is trying to write a new niche thriller - \\"airborne legal thrillers\\"! Good effort, but certainly room for improvement. In fact with Nance's background I believe he should be able to produce a very good one next time.This is not very typical Nance's style but it is nonetheless a page-turner. For readers who have not read Nance's previous novel this one would be a starter.Keep up the good work, Nance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Transparent Story","review":"I'm a big fan of John Nance books but I was disappointed with Headwind. A former U.S. President is set to be arrested on an international warrant while travelling in Europe. Fast paced and interesting story premise that is ruined by the transparency of the character's actions. The story constantly ignores the ability to use other obvious and simple ways for the President to get of the problem. Also, throughtout the book the characters are constantly amazed out how other characters can anticipate their only obvious option.

There is NO ORGANIZATION WHATSOEVER!The insulators are not arranged by color, manufacturer, style, age, embossing, or anything else! It's completely random-- and there is NO INDEX so there's no way to find a particular piece except to page through it. This is very, very bad-- I've never seen a randomly arranged, indexless reference book before. That's because it's not a reference book, not a \\"guide\\"-- it's just eye candy.Which might be OK, but the photography is not good! The colors are not accurate-- often they are too saturated-- and the shots were up taken from far too close so the insulators all suffer from major barrel distortion.Definitely do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive Guide to Colorful Insulators","review":"Wonderful photographs and extremely informative.

I am disappointed.First thing you notice is the cheap plastic webbing that rests against your arm. It's functional, but won't hold up for long. The second problem is the pouch...made of plastic and will tear apart before you get 100 shots off. For some reason, misfires are common as the 3/8 steel shot will drop at about 20-30 feet, yet occasionally sail straight at high velocity and hit a pie plate at 90 feet, no idea why this happens. The flat bands are good for velocity however, you have a tangled mess after each shot. What the pictures don't show you is that there's actually 2 bands on each side, so if getting off a second shot in a hurry is important, forget about it. The frame is well made and disassembles without tools. The band snaps are fine but you can't use tubular bands should you wish to replace them, and you will."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best slingshot you can buy. Period.","review":"This is a great slingshot. Shoots faster than most other slingshots on the market. It is highly accurate. I own over 20 slingshots and out of all the slingshots I have tested this one is pick of the litter. For starters the pouch will only take round half inch ammo. Anythign else will not work. If the ammo is too small it will fly out of the back of the pouch. This however is not a problem.

I'd like to read more by him."},{"rating":"2","title":"One part magic to one part common sense","review":"This is an obscure but delightfully written collection of fantasy and fairy tales geared mainly toward adult readers although older teens with advanced reading skills may also enjoy it. The stories settings are as varied as the charactors and range from the middle ages to the future but all have a core grounded in the commonality of human behavior and relationship dynamics. In one story a young woman is married off to a less than desirable husband but finds a way into a solid relationship and understanding with her spouse using a bit of magic and a bit of common sense. In another a media personality is finally able to shed the burden of fame via something similar to a clone only to find that fleeting fame leaves a void that must be filled.If you enjoy the short fiction of Neil Gaiman; you will enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"advert..?","review":"Technical content of this film is okay, the claims it makes seem reasonable, I've used EOs with some benefit for cleaning the air in my home.I give a low review because this film is in essence an advert for Young's Living Essential Oils + Diffusers (any EO could do the job).

I have bought HP maint kits from other online retailers before, but they are usually HP surplus parts, packaged by the seller. This kit was the genuine thing, factory sealed by HP. The kit includes almost everything you would need. It would be nice if HP could include a separation pad (the flat rubber platform that the manual feed roller rotates on) with their kit but they don't deem it necessary. The kit is easy to install and takes just minutes. The price of the kit was excellent. Most stores charge about $300 for the kit. My only complaint is that the box I received had a gouge through the bottom of it. Luckily, the fuser was not damaged. (The kit had an outer-shipping box, so it was not damaged in shipping, the damage was done at the warehouse and was probably why it was on sale at such a discount)."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Sunday morning go-to pot","review":"Every Sunday is a waffle or challah french toast breakfast day.

I just played the album again in the first time for over a year and I'm really surprised how dated the melodies already sound. The problem isn't really with the melodies, which I guess are fine for the most part, but the production mixed with Natalie's singing voice and wannabe-poetic lyrics makes almost every song sound awkward and overproduced. Beneath the dancebeats and gimmicks of \\"Torn\\" and \\"Wishing I Was There\\" are some pretty good melodies, but it's really hard to notice when you're being cast into 1998 chick-pop Lilith Fair America. \\"Smoke\\" and \\"Pigeons and Crumbs\\" are brilliant ballads, however (especially the latter), and I'll stand up for them any day.

You got \\"Torn\\" of course, the pop radio-friendly little that all the bubblegum boys and girls will enjoy. BUT unfortunatly it's not all thanks to Natalie. She obviously worked with some of the best writers around to create this CD. Her mega hit TORN wasn't even co-written by her. And I get suspisous when she only co-writes songs, and thats with the help of about 3 or 4 others. While she may have a pretty voice, it is way to overproduced. Seeing Natilie live is SO much better than listening to this album because it is SO OVER PRODUCED. Songs like \\"Smoke\\" for example, would sounds absolutly beautiful with nothing but a piano accompanying her, but it is bogged down by horrid voice effects, computer beep beeps and stuff. Her pretty voice is constantly being destroyed by production. Go buy Jewels new album, it's amazing, a beautiful, clear, pure voice on that one. :) Or, you could buy yourself a Live Natalie bootleg CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Impressed","review":"Yeah, I come from Australia and so does Natalie. But ironically it was in Australia where her music took the longest to hit the charts. Last week she won 6 awards at Australia's Music Awards, including best female artist. And to her merit she deserves it. Her album is very good but at times you feel she is trying to make a stab at too many music genres. First, there is 'Torn' the pop song of the 1990's. Then there is the Alanis-style songs, 'Big Mistake' and 'One more Addiction' Then there is the techno 'I'm impressed' But two of the greatest songs on the album are 'Smoke' and 'Left of the Middle' If you have liked the singles she has released so far you will love the album. It is one of the best albums of '98"},{"rating":"2","title":"Natalie Imbruglia hits it big with album Left of the Middle","review":"Left of the Middle is a collection of melodic tunes that seem to blend every way of making music together.

I recommend this album highly and besides, Natalie's version of Torn is the best"},{"rating":"2","title":"Throw the technical critque's out of the window","review":"Natalie has revised several songs that were obscure until she got a hold of them. She has received flak for not having an original flavor. However, what is the purpose of music? To entertain and delight the audience. I love original talents like Billy Joel, or political bands like Rage against the machine. But when an artist is trying to entertain, it's time to just sit back and enjoy, instead of analyzing the work. I have to admit that I was sick of 'Torn' (due in part 'cause I worked in a music store for some time), but now it's beauty is apparent.

The sound is bad, the instrumentation is poor, and the songs lack originality (not only the known Torn which was taken, without bothering to inform the public about its roots, from Danish singeress Lis Srensen).Left Of The Middle could've been a quite OK album if the songs were polished a couple of times more, and if they had found a producer who was able to produce.

With \\"Torn\\" she had a unique style that rivaled Alanis, Sheryl Crow, Sarah McLachlan (artists I like as well too).I bought the album but when the CD player moved past \\"Torn\\" I was definitely disappointed, the songs were so flat and common, it did not live up the uniqueness of \\"Torn\\". As much as I tried to play to get hooked to the album, the songs just failed to do so. Just as most of the reviews and critics said \\"it was more middle of the middle\\", the album was flat and boring.No wonder despite the huge success of \\"Torn\\", it being 2003 (5 years past and before Internet piracy) is still only 2X platinum.With the lack of success with her 2nd album \\"White Lilles Island\\", she will only been seen as a one-hit wonder and the girl next to Beyonce Knowles in those Loreal Feria Hair Care commericals."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums all year!","review":"The first time I heard \\"Torn\\",I knew the rest of the album had to be good.Natalie has got an amazing voice and a great talent.I'm looking forward to the next album with great anticipation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally awesome!","review":"Natalie's got a unique style.

Find them, and you too will see how insanly mediocre the music of Natalie Imbruglia sounds in comparison.One exception to my \\"five year\\" prediction.

Isn't it ironic?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong vocal and musical content shine through","review":"Natalie Imbruglia gives listeners what Alanis Morrisette will once she grows up.

This disc is a gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"It gets better after Torn","review":"Despite what everyone else here is saying, I truly think that Torn is the weakest song on this CD. It is clearly there to suck in the masses (and it worked) but her integrity as an artist is found in tracks such as Smoke, One More Addiction and Pidgeons and Crumbs. So for those of you who find Torn kind of inane and way too mainstream, give this CD a go for the variety of arrangements, the constantly changing production styles and the interesting (OK, sometimes cliche-ish) lyrics. It's a pity she doesn't have the musical nouse to write her songs alone. From what I've heard she basically just does the lyrics and then mucks around with the melodies whilst her more accomplished colleagues work on the hard stuff. I think Natalie will find herself on the next album.

In fact, her White Lilies Island album songs should be on the radio more. The rest of her songs seem much more edgy and beautiful than the hit playing daily.Leave Me Alone has interesting nostalgic and electronic moments. It seems to skip through time periods and countries. Wishing I Was There moves from sweet and sensual to sexy and sometimes mischievous and then cold and independent.

What repulses me the most is that \\"her\\" #1 single, \\"Torn\\" was originally written (and performed much more effectively, I might add) by the band EdnaSwap.

On \\"Smoke,\\" Natalie's voice sounds downright annoying. \\"One More Addiction\\" copies Alanis too much (and not as well.)

I must admit that it is beautifully put together and covers every area of popular music today i.e. Madonna, Morisette etc etc . But what worries me is how well it was put together - someone must have spent a huge amount of time and money to present such a perfect debut, and I wonder whether that allows Natalie Imbruglia the true artistic freedom she claims.

My favourite song of hers has to be her hit single, \`Torn' closely followed by \`Big Mistake' and \`Wishing I was There' which are also very good songs because they both are slow, but with quite fast choruses. Her CD is great. There is a good mix of music ranging from slow to fast beats.

Before I even saw the video, the pop radio stations were hard at work gaining my attention with Natalie's powerful lyrics about disillusions in love. Track two, which is my favorite song on the album equates a person who I will assume to be an ex boyfriend of Natalie's to an addiction.

Her debut has caused some critics to compare her to Alanis, but both individuals stand alone. This green-eyed, darked hair singer proves that some actresses can do a whole lot more than act! Overall, most songs are potential chart toppers."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Mature Than Alanis...","review":"I found Natalie's approach to similar subject matter softer and more mature than that of Alanis, perhaps due to Natalie's avoidance of the gimmicky street language pervasive in so much of Alanis' music. As a woman in my late 20s, I can definitely relate to Natalie's lyrical frustration with the opposite sex. I bought this CD only having heard \\"Torn,\\" and was pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"TORN: BY EDNASWAP NOT natalie imbruglia","review":"I got this for my girlfriend because she loved 'Torn', which is the only decent song on this...record. But this version pales in comparison to the original written by EDNASWAP several years earlier. The arrangement of Natalies version has no relevance to the lyrical content of this song. If you really want to know what it's like to be 'Torn', then check out the original on either EDNASWAP's EP 'Chicken'(which is desperately hard to find, or on EDNASWAP's full-length record 'Wacko Magneto', which is an all-around much stronger record than 'Left of Middle' and also available on amazon.com. It's a real shame that you can't erase and re-record over this cd...Once you check out EDNASWAP you will probably use Natalie's cd in the same manner as I do, and the manner that serves it any justice: As a beer coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"90's","review":"It's hard to believe she was only 22 when this album was released. Her songs have so much substance it's unbelievable when you compare Hilary Duff, Lindsay lohan, Ashley Tisdale and so many other females in her same age group today.She has been so overlooked in America for some strange reason I don't know of. Her songwriting abilities are unbeleivable, and that voice is outstanding.Natalie tampers with just about every music genre if you listen, you can hear, Jazz, RnB, Soul, Pop, Electronic and Mid-90's hiphop, drum n bass, It's all here for you.She's pissed like Alanis Morissette, bluesy like Fiona Apple, She has the poise of Sheryl Crow and Jewels tenderness.\\"Left Of The Middle\\" is so well-rounded and is my favorite Natalie Imbruglia set.I laughed at some of the one-star-reviews, I never realized how boring people actually think she is- that's just so funny to me. She has such a great voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic? Perhaps.","review":"While it is a good album, none of the songs are as great as Torn. But maybe it's because when I listen to Torn, it still feels the same as the first time I listened to it when I was 7 years old. I'm 17 now. Natalie's other albums are much better.

The movie was a good adaption of the book. An improvement, even. Most of the actors filled their parts gracefully, and the plot was well laid out. Samantha's friendship with Nellie O'Malley was convincing if simple, and her relationships with Grandmary, her uncle, and her new Aunt Cornelia were potrayed as complex and interpersonal. How refreshing to have a story about a girl who is wealthy but not selfish -- who enjoys nothing more than giving to others, not only things, but of herself.

He captures the camaraderie of sharing a shelter in a storm with a bugle player, he captures a lot of the beauty; flowers, trees, salamanders and other wildlife.

This book contains lengthy descriptions of the rules and explanations of the different roles each player has on the court. I found all of this helpful. My only complaint is since this is an older book it does not mention rally scoring which is predominatly in use today. The book centers on describing the old 15 point system, and the rules associated with that.

The 2nd season is just as good as season one and in fact is a bit more exciting. The plots are not nearly as over the top as '24' and the realism is much much higher than in Alias. The characters are well portrayed as everyday people which makes it easy to connect with them. Again, I like the fact that the show has a British view on world politics and seeing the landscape through their eyes is very interesting compared to how American TV portrays the world. Buying this show is money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another review of the price","review":"This series is remarkably good. In its genre I don't believe I've seen anything else on TV that comes close. But $60 for ten episodes does seem like a high price. That is why I went to Amazon.uk, found the same second season for a total price of 12.42 including shipping to my US address. That converts to a little over $20. This solution may not be for the faint of heart since there can be issues of country code and so on.

The suspense builds both within each episode and throughout the series. Personal as well as political stakes are high for our heroes.The acting and writing are superb in this series with a subtlety rarely found in spy dramas. The intensely close relationships formed under combat situations are touchingly portrayed. These are passionate people who must put their feelings aside for a cause they believe in.Another bonus is that while violence is present it is not gratuitous.I have been at the edge of my seat waiting for Season Three!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Show NOT on US Television.","review":"Why, Why, Why does a US cable station not pick up this wonderful show.

Yes, people die, people betray each other, and people get framed (if you haven't seen it, I won't give that one away).

I suppose the Beatles decided to get into the whole \\"strip the production down\\" mentality that all grunge bands lived by... fifteen years ago. The Beatles had obviously missed the bus on the whole grunge movement, and they're trying to compensate way too late by putting out an underproduced version of something they'd already done.

ANYWAY, Let It Be - NAKED is well ... disappointing. If you already have a copy of Anthology 3 and or any of the GET BACK/LET IT BE bootlegs, don't bother. It's the same stuff. It was nice to hear a cleacn version of Don't Let Me Down (after all those years), but besides that .... It's a NAKED RIP OFF!! I understand Sir McCartney had a lot to do with this re-make.

His production technique has been the standard for most every artist to follow. Spector is indirectly the entire reason that the Beatles ever made it out of the days of the two and a half minute single. Spector motivated Brian Wilson to create Pet Sounds and that motivated the Beatles to become more creative. When I listen to \\"The Long And Winding Road\\" without Spector's production it's just unimaginable how this could have happened. Spector is probably one of the greatest musical geniuses of the last century...who is Paul McCartney, master of the corny love song, to undermine Spector's genius? If you're a hardcore Beatles fan though I recommend buying this album because it's got great song (even though in my opinion they've all been ruined), but not before you get the original with Spector's production!

Perhaps this is why their original recordings gathered dust on the shelf and were not commercially released until the band had publicly disbanded. \\"Let It Be\\", most would agree, represents the nadir of the Beatles career in terms of songwriting and performance; even they themselves were so appalled with their work that they quickly reassembled and recorded \\"Abbey Road\\" which remains today as one of the finest recordings of all time.LIBN breaks no new ground; the unadorned recordings have long been available in bootleg form, and at just over 35 minutes running time it leaves the listener feeling short-changed. However, the digital technology has brought out nuances to the performances heretofore lost and, although the music is far below the Beatles' high standards, it is still better than 90% of today's popular music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally we can throw the old Let It Be to the trash.","review":"The original Let It Be album was a mess: the silly and irrelevant dialogues, the fragments of songs (\\"Dig it\\") and the overproduction of songs (\\"Across the universe\\", \\"The Long and Winding Road\\").Now we have something that sound like a real album.This versions of the songs and the new track list brings new life to The Beatles. They sound like a vital and poweful band again.The low points of this release are: the bonus CD (It doesn't add anything), the cover, and the title.

Of course, Ringo Starr praised Paul's efforts and called the new version \\"bloody marvelous.\\" However, I expected -- and deserved -- more. Where is the original, unedited \\"Get Back\\" album? Where is the rooftop gig? Where are the rough edges? Avoid \\"Let It Be . . . Naked\\" and track down the superior \\"Get Back\\" bootlegs that continue to flood the market. Regardless of what Paul believes, he hasn't put the \\"Let It Be\\" issue to rest.

John singing Across The Universe is awesome, and I never particularly cared for I Dig A Pony, but it is SO GOOD on this CD! And I LOVE Don't Bring Me Down.

Many have dismissed this release as not adding anything but I disagree. The performances are much more energized. Listen to the wonderfully energetic \\"Don't Let Me Down\\". This version surpasses the version that was released as a single.And listen to the vocals on \\"I've Got a Feeling.\\" Paul hits notes so high and with such emotion that it brings to mind his vocals on \\"Long Tall Sally\\" and \\"Oh Darling\\".All told, this is a wonderful record and it's much better than the Phil Spector version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the real","review":"\\"Let It Be... Naked\\" is so offensive it both concept and content, that it's hardly possible to believe that this release actually happened. What the \\"fans\\" of this version must realize is that THIS VERSION IS NOT THE VERSION THAT THE BEATLES INTENDED TO RELEASE OR ENDORSED. This irrelevant release is Paul McCartney's vision of what he NOW wants \\"Let It Be\\" to be. [...] To sum it all up: Buy the real 1970 version, buy it quick, before Sir Paul decides to have it deleted form the catalog and enjoy that album for what it is, Beatles outtakes and live tracks rescued by Phil Spector and cobbled into a fairly satisfying album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected at all","review":"I thought they would keep all the diologue in.

It also validates to me who was the primary ego that broke up the group.

And then I heard \\"Let it Be... Naked.\\" Ugh. \\"Let it Be\\" is the worst of the Beatles' albums anyway (though still better than 95% of the garbage out there), and stripping it down makes it that much worse. I realize now that the cheesy orchestral bits actually helped. \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" is an atrocity. So is \\"Get Back.\\" The Beatle chatter CD is too short and random and could have been so much better. Also, I really haven't been too impressed with the way Macca is trying to \\"fix\\" things-- including changing \\"Lennon/ McCartney\\" to \\"McCartney/ Lennon.\\" Paul wouldn't have dared try any of this if John were still alive. I wish he'd left this alone. Or relegated it to the Anthology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring! I prefer it dressed","review":"Don't buy it. It's 2 CDs, one of 35 minutes, the other of 21. So you'll pay double for 56 minutes of the worst music in the Beatles' career, with dire, dull, boring performances. Only two exceptions: the crisper \\"For You Blue\\" and the better \\"The Long and Winding Road\\". Excepting these two cases, Spector's album is light years better than this stuff.With zillions of hours of rehearsals and outtakes, was this the best they could do with disc 2? I'm really angry at this ripoff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just...Let it Be...","review":"I think the title of this cd is ironic...why couldn't they just let the original cd be? Why fix whats not broken? Call me crazy, but I like the Phil Spector arrangements. Some of the songs (Two of Us off the top of my head) are identical which make this almost seem redundant. The Fly On The Wall bonus disc is cool for a little while...but let's not kid ourselves...the way it's edited and they way the Beatles talked...sometimes it's impossible to figure out what they're talking about. Still, it's the Beatles and the songs are well done. Buy it only if you're collecting all the Beatles CDs or you're a Beatles fanatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not much has changed","review":"When comparing Let it Be...Naked to the original Let it Be album, I noticed something: not much has been changed. In fact, there are only four tracks that are noticeably different to the average listener: \\"The Long and Winding Road,\\" \\"I've Got a Feeling,\\" \\"Don't Let Me Down,\\" and \\"Across the Universe.\\" Now, I've been listening to the Beatles for years and so I did notice little changes in \\"For You Blue,\\" \\"I Me Mine,\\" and \\"Let it Be\\" (as well as noticing that they cut off the coda of \\"Get Back\\"). But all in all, this is simply a remastered version of the Let it Be album with some replacements.From a musical standpoint, this release earns five stars. But because it hasn't really changed all that much, and because of the awful \\"bonus\\" disc, I can only give it four."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let It Be at its finest","review":"This was a great CD remixed and I give the first disk 5 stars. What I found tedious though was how all the fly on the wall material was all one track! All the material is great except it was annoying to fast forward to great songs like \\"Because I Know You Love Me So\\" and \\"Child of Nature\\". Plus, it was missing a few unreleased tracks that I feel were the highlights to Let It Be. For example, \\"Suzy Parker\\" was a great jam that I did not see. Otherwise both CDs were very good and a 2 disk set to add to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could have been better","review":"Over 600 reviews already. As a Beatles fan for over 20 years I must say that I really like this album. I rate it 4 stars as it could have been better. The sound quality is 5 stars, absolutely brilliant. Is is about time all Beatles cd's were remastered. The song Get Back is too short however, something is missing. The Long and winding Road is wonderful, much better as the original version and different from other versions known to me thru bootlegs and anthology. Don't let me down is well worth buying the whole album for. An excellent version, beautifully sung.The album is too short however. To make it something really special they should have included much more. The whole rooftop concert for instance and so many other versions of the songs are available. The title of the album and the cover are horrible. Why not use the picture made for the originally planned \\"Get Back with Let it be and 11 other songs\\" album?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then the original!","review":"There isnt a whole lot to say really, but this is way better then the original album The Beatles put out... what was it 30 years ago. They got rid of all the stuff that was cluttering the record and got rid of the bad songs and put on better ones. Let It Be....Naked is worth the money for 'Across The Universe' and 'Dont Let Me Down' alone. 'Dont Let Me Down' should have been on the original album anyways, I mean it is the best thing they did since \\"A Day In The Life.\\"I never liked 'The Long And Winding Road' but now that it has all that crap like the strings and all off the album this song is really quite good.Other Highlights are 'Get Back' 'Dig A Poney' 'Two Of Us' and the great title track 'Let It Be'In concluesion this blows the original out of the water!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The music is good, but...","review":"the title is horrible, the cover is ugly, the booklet is boring (save for the essay), and the 2nd disc is a complete joke considering the wealth of material that exists (10 second song clips- how generous.)

I think that EMI/Captiol/Apple should stop messing around with classics and release \\"Let It Be\\" on DVD, I think that's what most Beatles fans want, not an album that you could find on the \\"Anthology\\" discs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let It Be","review":"The best version of the song \\"Let It Be\\" is on the original 1970 album release. The three most recognized versions include the original album cut, a spectacularly produced version by Phil Spector including a great distorted guitar solo by George Harrison; the 1970 single, which edited out the guitar solo to fit the song for radio play; and the reproduced version on this album which has a thin, tinny-sounding guitar solo. On the original album, Phil Spector saved an average song by adding the background, which is very obvious by listening to the two versions side by side. \\"Across the Universe\\" is also much better on the original 1970 album, as Spector's production again adds to an average composition, and overlays the nasally singing by the Beatles. As bad as this is, I'm surprised that Rolling Stone and VH1 don't rank this more highly like the other albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naked or Not, the fabs are still the best!","review":"Before I start, I do have to say I miss the some of the chatter between songs as well as the guiter work on the original 'Let it Be'. Having said that, I never liked Phil Spector's way of record producing. I always thought it was gimicky, over the top and not up to par with George Martin's style.This album, on the other hand, shows the music the way it should be; up front and without fluff. I gotta believe if George and John were around today, they would have approved. In the past, all Beatle albums were produced so well, with the exception of 'Let it Be'. Now they got it right. I also liked how the version of 'Don't Let Me Down' was added to the mix. I am so glad the didn't let this album 'let it be'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darn It, I Like It!","review":"I haven't much liked the Beatles remastering efforts that came before (Yellow Submarine, the '1' album), because they seemed to suck the life out of the songs. Right now I'm giving this CD a second spin, after liking the first spin a couple of days ago. Unlike the previous remasterings, this one absolutely, positively brings the songs to life! This is a very warm, exuberant album, and it really brings a smile to my face. This is probably the most live sounding album they ever did, next to Please Please Me. And stripping out all of Specter's garbage is a phenomenal improvement. The Long and Winding Road is actually growing on me, there's some very delicious parts to that song.I always liked the original \\"Let It Be\\", except for some teeth-gritting moments. This is a much better release, no teeth-gritting moments, and it's almost like hearing the Beatles again for the first time! Congratulations and thanks to the guys who remastered this one. Beautiful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Natural, clean, and NOT overproduced","review":"What exactly is this re-mix? I will tell you. Phil Spector's mix of these recordings was typical Spector: very thick, and heavily produced. Phil's style was never to have the music sound natural. You likely have heard of the typical description of Phil's output: \\"The WALL of sound.\\" This NEW mix takes a completely different approach. This new mix shoots for a completely natural, almost dry sound. The sound of each cut now is close to how a live performance in a small hall would sound. The tracks sound very clean now and one can easily hear each instrument and voice. I can now hear details of the drumming and bass playing that were never clear in Phil's mix. Personally, I am not a big fan of Spector's approach. I often find the wall of sound to be a wall of mud. I like Paul's new mix because it sounds so clean, natural and UN-produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paul hits a new low.","review":"Last year: a live album from Paul with Beatles songs credited to McCartney-Lennon.

I have been a Beatles fan for many years and was extremely happy with the Anthology series which provided my ears with great alternative versions of the classics and not-so classics I have always loved. However upon listening to this latest McCartneyfied version of Let It Be, I can see a clear easy path to the mediocrity supreme that is the band Wings. Aside from the nice raw versions of \\"For You Blue\\" and \\"I Me Mine\\", this disc explores, rather too intimately, the self destruction and alienation that was apparent in their relationship with each other.

His wife or the Let it Be album! I absolutely adore that this release came out. No matter how you look at it, this is the way this album was meant to be heard. All tracks sound phoemoninal!! Get Back should have had the fade out though (as it appears on the single), but other than that, every track (especially I've got a Feeling and One after 909) sound perfect. Kudos also go to Across the Universe mix for giving John's vocals more intensity. Spector should stay in jail (even if he's acquitted) for his WALL OF SOUND on The Long and Winding Road and Across the Universe. His work upset the group and George Martin and should not go unpunished! I never even knew that the multi-talented Billy Preston had a solo on Winding Road until I heard this.

Given the snips of dialogue, the soupy mix, and the overwrought and leaden Spector (and, yes, Sir George) Martin orchestrations, I always thought the original LIB was the anomaly in the Beatles' canon.My only disappointments on LIBN (keeping me from rating it 5 stars) are the perfunctory guitar solo in \\"Let it Be\\" (instead of the masterful solo that was emphasized in the single version) and the absence of the \\"yeah, yeahs\\" at the end of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" (I know they're corny, but to me they're an echo of a distant bend in that Road).The additional disc has some tantalizing song snippets, but, generally, I don't think an artist is well served by short un-rehearsed bursts of tunes. A better approach might have tracked the development of a particular tune, but some might think that's too tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let It Be 2003 vs. 1970","review":"Unnecessary remastering (by an amateur). That's all that this is. And no, I don't wish that George had remastered \\"All Things Must Pass\\".On one hand Spector is criticized for his original 1970 version (masterpiece) of \\"Let It Be\\", and then Paul is criticized for leaving out the guitar solo that Spector put in. Yeah, that makes sense. The one thing that is clear is that John can't hit the high notes on \\"Across the Universe\\" on either version.The 1970 version stands as the classic because of the nicely produced version of \\"Get Back\\" that is cut short on this version, \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" with the great orchestra backing on the original, and \\"Let It Be\\", with the great distorted guitar solo that I guess Paul thought overshadowed his song."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best","review":"Let It Be...

I am that rare Beatles fan who considers the original LET IT BE to be their favorite effort by the Fab Four. The charm of that album is the relaxed, tossed-off vibe you get by listening to John Lennon making wise-acre remarks after songs and ditties like Maggie Mae and Dig It. With this album, the Beatles dropped their pretensions, let their guard down and wrote some charming and moving songs. I would say their most moving songs. Oddly enough, a lot of the tracks on the original LET IT BE sound more raw and \\"naked\\" than those on this new retread. I find that rawness to be a nice counterbalance to Spector's elaborate string arrangements. Anyone expecting LET IT BE...NAKED to sound dramatically different from the original should be forewarned: you're better off with what's been around for thirty five years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the act you've known for all these years...","review":"When I first heard about this release, I, like countless listeners I'm sure, was really looking forward to hearing the GET BACK album that was pulled shortly before the record was to hit shelves; this is not that album, despite the schilling of the hyperbolic sticker on the cd. Instead, what we get is yet another attempt by Mr. McCartney to re-write the legacy of his former band. How else to explain the suddenly thundering bass levels at the expense of Harrison's now muted leads? As someone who always gave McCartney the benefit of the doubt, his actions of the past few years have served only to strengthen claims by Lennon and Harrison as to the selfish egotism of his character. LET IT BE - NAKED is NOT The Beatles, it's PAUL McCARTNEY's BEATLES. Perhaps this time, fans should Listen to What the Man Said and not give him their money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand","review":"I really do not understand why they want to release Let it Be...Naked at this point since 'they' really now is 90% Paul and 10% Ringo. The feel of 'Paul' is everywhere in the album, sorry to say but that was how I feel when I heard it. The songs became 'studiofied' and dull replacing the magic and special quality that the album supposed to have. And what is up with the drumming, I thought Ringo did a better job. Instead of making the drumming more interesting, they actually made it more systematic. If you listen to Ringo's drumming in the White Album, all of the later music for that matter, it sounds nothing like this one. And don't get me started with Don't Let Me Down. It hurts me very much to hear the version in this album and the guitar solo in Let It Be? Well, Harrison decided to replace the Fuzz to a scaly pucking. Good one Paul, you did it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get It Right Or Let It Be!","review":"The good news: This is better than the original. The bad news: It could have been much better. First, I agree that the little quips, \\"I dig a pygmie, Arc the angels comin', Hope we passed the audition\\" etc., were good enough for the original soundtrack, more importantly, the original bootleg. They should have been used here, at least on the bonus disc. Second, Where is the truely naked version of \\"I Me Mine\\" with the flamenco intro? Finally, since many of us were hoping for \\"Get Back\\", would it have been so bad to include \\"The Walk\\" and \\"Teddy Boy\\", etc., again at least on the \\"Fly on the Wall\\"? It seems the powers that let it be are still in denial about the original bootleg, which is still more exciting than any of the published versions. Next up, \\"The White Album...Fat Free\\" less filler and half the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beatles CD","review":"If you like the Beatles, add this one to your collection. It's worth the price and the quality is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better Then \\"Let It Be\\"","review":"The songs are alot cleaner and are a pleasure to listen to without the crackling noises of the original. \\"Fly On The Wall\\" really shows an inside look at what happened during the time when they were creating \\"Let It Be\\". The songs are the same except they leave out \\"Maggie Mae\\", but that's not important as long as we have \\"Let It Be\\", \\"The Long And Winding Road\\", and \\"Get Back\\". All the songs are classics. This is a needed factor in a pur Beatles collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to get excited about folks.","review":"Kind of paltry. Kind of odd, too. I'm happy to have different versions of Beatles songs but really there aren't huge differences over what we've heard on the original LIB, Anthology and Past Masters. And a CD has more space than an LP - so why remove any content? The second disc is meaningless and gives us precious little song material. If the title and cover weren't so awful, if the marketing was more honest and if the second disc had been a good collection of the volumous LIB outtakes (some which, if edited skillfully, could make decent new Beatle songs), I would have rated this higher."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Should Have Let It Be","review":"Unbelievable. How in the world could any competent producer cut the wonderful distorted guitar solo and fills in the Spector produced original version of the song \\"Let It Be\\" and replace it with the chicken picking version on this album? It sounds like George Harrison's take was removed and McCartney was substituted practicing his pentatonic scales.People interested in the Beatles should just buy the original albums, plus Past Masters. This reconstituted effort after two of the Beatles are now gone is simply re-writing history. 2-stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"fell apart on us..twice!","review":"the deck broke off....we called the company and they sent us a new one. the inside room divider broke. called the company again with a list of toys that had broken (play toys) with no response. these toys are pretty, but expensive and don't last."},{"rating":"2","title":"dollhouse for a cockatiel","review":"This is the most amazing dollhouse ever, for my cockatiel! I bought it for its non-toxicity and simple design to use as a substitute for a bird playpen while it is out of the cage. I bought bird furniture feeders, shaped like a bed, couch, sofa, etc. and strung her toys throughout. My 9-month old cockatiel is so ecstatic that she sleeps facing the house and can't wait to wake up and saunter into it in the morning looking for treats. It took me 15 minutes to put together, the pieces fit perfectly and it is well-made, durable, sturdy, yet lightweight. I can't tell you how thrilled I am with my purchase. If a little bird loves it, a little girl would too! And it arrived in just a few days time, packaged perfectly. Stores in my area carry this product, but they are at least 20 to 30% more in price.

It not very open and it is plain and it wasn't very appealing to her. I think she would of enjoyed a more open and decorated doll house. It isn't as open as it looks and it is hard to play with the bottom part especially. It doesn't come with anything and the people you need buy don't stay standing very well.

At half the price, the mesh tip of the less expensive stylus is far superior and much more responsive on the screen than the BoxWave tip. The only reason I bought the BoxWave Slimline stylus is because the others are thicker and do not fit in the stylus holder on my Nexus 7 case.

I can't find it anywhere, and this stylus (as far as I can't tell) isn't designed to have replaceable tips, so all I can assume is that the adhesive used to fix the tip isn't strong enough.For the record, I always kept my stylus plugged into the headphone jack on the bottom of my nexus 7 when not in use, and never stuffed it into a small space that might have rubbed it loose."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"This book was okay.

Thus you should not be surprised by not finding any reference to intellectual capital in the Index. One would expect some heated discussion over this controversial concept before being offered a framework to manage it. Forget it.

I imagine they will still be having as much fun with it months from now too because of all the creative activities in the game. They get to decorate cakes, design stained glass windows that are then put in the windows of the shops, they can wander all around the town and the woods.

I loved these guys since i heard the self titled CD in 1999. Long Gone are the rough buzzing guitars heard in 'I say I Love You' and 'love is a Gentle Whip'. Now it's a cleaner too intentional 70's sound that seems all too contrived. While I do like a few tracks on this new album, such as 'Alive And Amplified', I found myself missing the signature sound I fell in love with in the beggining. Don't expect to find a great song with a sound like 'A simple life' had. I'm not one of these people that disregards a band because they sign to a major label, I let the music speak for itself. Unfourtunately, the music didn't say much with this release. It comes off as a sort of parody of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"This album is a complete let down for all of the long time Mooney Suzuki fans. Instead of the raw fuzzy garage guitar and banging drums, listeners are exposed to over-produced generic FM Rock. The Mooney's songs were engaging in the first place, and anyone with any decent music tastes who bothered to listen to their music would come to like it. The production on \\"Electric Sweat\\" was definately good enough. There was no reason to go with such a high producer. Also, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LEATHER JACKETS,SOMETHING HAS TO BE THE SAME! I am giving this album 2 stars because it's the Mooney Suzuki and their earlier material is Prime A+ Garage. Hopefully the Mooney Suzuki will realize their mistake and put out another \\"Electric Sweat.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Like The WHO, this band needs to be seen to be believed","review":"I had my doubts after listening to this the first time, but after repeated listenings, this has become one of favorite records of the year. From the \\"Oh yeahs\\" of \\"Primitive Condition\\" to the hammond organ stabs of \\"Loose and Juicy\\" the proof is in the details. Some of the lyrics are cheesy, but have you heard any 60's era Rock music? See them live. \\"Shake that Bush\\" and \\"New York Girls\\" are even better in concert. So what if the hooks are poppier and the production's a bit polished. Until these guys are in GAP commercials or played on TRL, I would hardly call them sell outs.

I'm surprised in R. Kelly especially, because he has had some great songs in his career. Unfortunately, this isn't one of those collaborations. For Ja Rule, he also has overused that process not in what he makes as a collaboration, but who he has collaborated with, Ashanti. Their three-way collaboration Wonderful really isn't a very well put collaboration in Rap music. It sounds a whole lot wimpy, and not really a great song at all. This is one of the worst collaborations this year. As for Ja Rule, he really should try other people to mix great music with. That goes the same for Ashanti.Song: D-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was excited to give this towel as a baby shower gift for a friend. When I received the towel, I was disappointed, because it was a fair bath towel quality and the duke portion was ironed on the towel. The imprint looks like it will flake off after multiple washings. Not a good quality product I would have liked to give as a give. Great concept , just needs more quality into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great...for awhile","review":"After a couple of washes in the machine, this ripped up pretty badly.

It is the story of the Beauregard family which consists of many different character who all seem guilty of something.

The novel is quite suspenseful and never dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute!","review":"Well I read the other reviews before I read this. But I did like the cute love story.

But all and all I really enjoyed this easy read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"thank goodness the book was free","review":"I didn't know I was reading a religious book until about 1/3 of the way through. I'm sure this is a good book for the naive mormon girl who doesn't know the real world. The way the main character was depicted in the begining makes his transformation seem unfathomable. If Cheyenne's parents raised her so independent and confident, why would they question her \\"boyfriend\\" like she's not an adult and she's not smart enough to make her own choices. I didn't think the storyline was believeable and I believe this book should be kept in the mormon family.

I've thrown out everything I've made with it so far because the flavor was just a bit too strong.This product is best used as only a very small fraction of whatever it is used in, but on the whole I would look to more palatable sources of fiber.For a better tasting fiber for bulky baked items, defatted coconut flour has a much better taste and having the ability to be used as a much, much greater proportion in a recipe."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS","review":"This book is a sad copy of The Italian by Ann Radcliffe. I purchased this book for a Gothic Lit class, and upon opening the book to read it found myself greatly confused by what I saw. This book is a compilation of scanned text from an original version of the novel, reprinted with absolutely NO editing. Because there is NO editing, this edition is full of random symbols, gaps in pages, missing information, and is separated into \\"Sections\\", which has no particular meaning in regards to the flow of the novel.Chapter headings are located within the main body of text, and very hard to find. I have purchased a different version of this novel since discovering the sad state of this one. I repeat: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. It is absolutely terrible, and in my opinion shouldn't even be available for purchase on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Italian","review":"This book was unreadable due to many errors in the digital process.

Significantly, the scan kept all of the \\"f\\"s in the text rather than converting them to \\"s\\"s. This is the second time I've purchased a book from this publisher and both were very sloppily done. It doesn't appear that anyone proof read the the manuscript after they scanned it in to their program. It's frustrating to pay so much for a book and then have to re-buy the book from another publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Edition","review":"I want to caution anyone from buying this edition of The Italian. The print is incredibly small - I suppose in the publisher's effort to make the book appear more attractive by limiting the number of pages.

Once again, I find it totally unrealistic to believe that a man who only sees a woman a couple times could fall so madly in love with her so as to endure all that this couple went through. I guess am too much of a realist to really enjoy novels of this type."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing imitation of Matthew Lewis' The Monk","review":"Anyone who has read the classic gothic novel The Monk by Matthew Lewis need not bother with this one.

He treated his people very good and all involved were happy with there island life. Then,as I recall, Nick is threatened in some way and he has to bug-out, or face the music for whatever the reason it was that he came to be on the island in the first place.

Epic in scope, beautifully photographed, scored and acted, it is Milius's most underrated film.Milius has done a fine job of reshaping a difficult novel, to be more faithful to the story would have required a six hour movie. He is also more optimistic than the novelist in both the story's ending and in the treatment of the episode of the phantom Japanese column, but it is still a haunting, powerful film that undeservedly failed at the boxoffice. Much of the film was actually filmed on the island of Borneo, in the Malaysian state of Sarawak (formerly ruled by the White Rajahs until 1946).This is just the type of visually and aurally appealling film that cries out for rediscovery in the DVD format, with commentary by the director and lots of bonus material."},{"rating":"2","title":"From The Best of John Milius","review":"It's been more than ten year since I watch it in theaters but I still remember that they, who a war movie change my way to see this whole kind of films (maybe it was just a preview for the coming of the Terrence Malick's Masterpice The Thin Red Line).Actually it's the first time I remember watch something with Nick Nolte who later become one of my favorite actors and here there are so many reasons, specially if you feel the poetry behind one story about the search of paradise, the friendship the need to understand the true meaning of freedom.But there's more... beautifull scenes and the best soundtracks of Basil Poledouris made till now.This is not a film about war it's a legend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dances with Dayaks?","review":"I am watching this in HD on cable and it is one cheesy movie.

Badly written by someone who knows nothing of Borneo, badly acted, atrociously directed. I bought it because I heard it was filmed in a mountain area in Sarawak which I know well. It went into the rubbish bin (unfinished). I rate it one star because no lower rating is available."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing effort by a good author","review":"I have read several books by Anne Mather, and this one was definately not one of her better efforts. I felt that both characters were too wishy washy over their feelings, and there never seemed to be any real communication between them. They would start to discuss their feelings or their relationship, then they would be interrupted, and that was it, conversation over. I felt that Ms Mather didn't really know how to get the 2 lovers back together and she was in a rush, so she just decided to forget all the previous issues they had spent the entire book worrying over, and had Oliver and Laura announce their love for each other right at the end, so we could have a happy ending. This book is definately not a keeper, and I was very disappointed because I know Anne Mather can do so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word - Suckage!","review":"What can I add that hasn't already been mentioned in the previous reviews....except that the author is challenged in coming up with new twists to her vaguely incestuous plots!Don't waste your time on this one.

But, this book was so alarmist that it made me think that many marijuana smokers would doubt its validity. Judging from other reviews of this book, this seems to be the case. There might be some good info in this but it seems really outdated. Perhaps the author needs to write the 2012 edition. And basically I do agree with her that pot is not the benign substance that many insist it is. For many people, especially those not developmentally ready for this recreation, it becomes a lifestyle and an unproductive, unhappy one at that.

This author is obviously lacking in her research skills.Substantial research exists regarding marijuana and addiction. While the scientific community has yet to achieve full consensus on this matter, the majority of epidemiological and animal data demonstrate that the reinforcing properties of marijuana in humans is low in comparison to other drugs of abuse, including alcohol and nicotine. According to the U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM), fewer than one in 10 marijuana smokers become regular users of the drug, and most voluntary cease their use after 34 years of age. By comparison, 15 percent of alcohol consumers and 32 percent of tobacco smokers exhibit symptoms of drug dependence.And I think it is good to note that marijuana was only a \\"gateway\\" drug when it became illegal."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Ignorant View at Marijuana","review":"Yes, Some people have addictive personalities, and those people could concievably become \\"addicted\\" to Marijuana.

I never even thought about it. Giving up cigarettes on the other hand, was tough. If this book does anything, it \\"plants\\" in the readers mind they have a problem and need help.

Fischkin takes us from Long Island to Ireland and gives a wonderful look into the world of journalism. Her characters are funny and endearing. As I know the \\"Real Mulvaney\\" and am familiar with some of he other real-life characters, it was fun for me to try to figure out what was true and what was untrue. Her sharp wit and obvious love for her husband, the egotistical but loveable Jim Mulvaney and his escapades, keep you turning the pages.

Later, I needed to learn Java since I had to manage a software upgrade project that was going to involve Java. I wanted to be competent enough to be able to look at the code and know what the heck was going on. This book is aimed at people like me who are real beginners and like to have the code broken down and explained line by line. The author does a very good job of explaining the concepts in a way that beginners can understand (that's rare, and is the reason why I gave it five stars).Having said all of that, this book is a little out of date, but I'd still recommend it as a good first book that can be supplemented later with newer references to fill in the gaps.The author published another book in this same series (\\"No Experience Req'd\\") on C++ that is also very good, with a similar title.

Seton's ability to identify with the wildlife he studies,but with a minimum of anthropomorphism or sentimentality, and then write touching, exciting mini-dramas is enhanced by his role as an observer who does not inject himself as a foreign influence in their lives.I'm buying copies of the hardcover edition for my grandchildren, for this book will be read more than once, and kept for a lifetime.

Although it is based on the biblical story it is not for bible purests who are expecting a GOOD rendition of the timeless tale. Save your money, DO NOT buy this movie.

She enters the realm of the pre-Katrina New Orleans with this romance/mystery novel but as an outsider to that society she is unable to capture its actual nature (believe me, as an insider to the pre-Katrina New Orleans, I know about that lifestyle). She makes horrible mistakes in her New Orleans geography and lifestyle then compounds those errors with the fact that in this novel at least she seems to forget about the basic differences between men and women! Considering her fame as a romance writer I find some her writing not only bad, but actually bizarre! I realize that a ghost story is somewhat bizarre by nature but she takes it to an absurd point! As you can tell I found this novel disappointing and do not recommend this book. Nora Roberts should leave this sort of writing alone and let Anne Rice write about the haunted houses in New Orleans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out in left field.","review":"This book was disappointing but I guess that's redundant once you look at the star rating. Perhaps it was the worn out story line, good twin/bad twin evil mother or the patronizing and cliche' lines spouted by Declan regarding child birth and rape,(these scenes were almost offensive as he \\"comes back\\" and can now instantly identify with the pain and degradation). Declan's angst is annoying. Or maybe it was the lack of plot or sizzle between the main characters.

While I do find her books a bit formulaic, they are still entertaining. However, this one was just not as good as her previous books in the same romance/suspense genre, such as Sanctuary and River's End. Her female character was rather flat and undeveloped throughout the novel. The entire book seemed like a remix of various stock characters from earlier novels, mixed and matched to provide a new story. The ending lacked her usual unexpected twist, and if you have seen the movie \\"Dead Again\\" you will guess it long before it occurs.

The storyline is so unbelievable, even for a supernatural tale, that it was extremely difficult for me to continue reading this rediculously written novel. \\"Ick\\" is all I can say. I think about all the time I spent on this book, and it truly makes me angry. What a silly concept - as I said before, \\"Nora, what were you thinking?\\" If anyone out there wants to read a real romance, pick up The Color of Revenge by Millicent Hart. Don't waste you time with Midnight Bayou.

If you read a lot of Nora Roberts you know that usually she has an interesting twist at the end, however this time this was a very convoluted twist.

I couldn't believe it when all of a sudden the hero became the heroine. If Lena was the hero, and I was Declan or whoever he was supposed to be, I would have wished her/him/it a fond farewell without a backward glance.

Interactions with the secondary characters are well done. However, I think that the conclusion was too abrupt; instead of a dramatic climax, the end just dwindles, and you are left with a sense of letdown instead of the sigh of satisfaction you get when a novel ends perfectly. That said, the other 95% of the book is amusing and well written, and I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"This book is a must read, one of Nora's best in my opinion because it deals with the past and the present with some ghosts thrown in for good measure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"I've read and enjoyed almost all of Nora Robert's books. Midnight Bayou, however, was a huge disappointment. I loved the book up until about the last 20 pages. Then it seemed as if Nora handed the manuscript to someone else and said \\"here, you finish it\\", someone who didn't understand the characters' personalities or the depth of the story.Hopefully this is not a sign of things to come with Mrs. Roberts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Not Put Down","review":"Rarely is there a book that I can not put down, this was an exception. Quite a suspensfull page turner. Any book that can draw you in and you can visualize the characters and the scenery is excellent and this book did that. I would have given it 5 stars, but I do not like romance blended in with any suspense novel, that's just my taste. By far, however, one of the best books I have read in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two's company, three's a crowd!","review":"Here's another Robert's wonder...couldn't put it down. Declan is a Boston lawyer who falls in love with a run down New Orleans Mansion, buys it and vows to return it to it's original beauty. He has great building talent and goes right to work, His Law School buddy, Remy, lives in New Orleans and introduces Dec to Lena, a gorgeous cajun who runs a trendy Bar and puts out untouchable vibes. Declan vows he can handle her, but, when trouble starts on the third floor at his new house and clocks chime and doors slam and he finds himself in a 100 year old mystery he wonders if he will live to love her. The story builds and builds to a marvelous climax with typical Nora Robert's ingenuity. Read it, you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"She's done it, again! This book is wonderful, full of lush scenery and ghosts of passions in the 1900's are guaranteed to raise the hair on your neck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This One Has Everything!!!","review":"What a great read! Right from the first paragraph this story captures the reader's interest. I coudn't wait to read the next page and it was hard to put the book down... The unexplained visions that Declan has, the icy cold rooms, the sleep walking that disturbs him so and yet he is compelled to not only purchase the old house but to restore it. The story introduces the reader to some great characters that are really allowed to develop along with the story. I loved it, especially the unexpected twist at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"HO HUM","review":"I have been a Nora Roberts fan for years and have read everything she and JD Robb write. This book is not her best. The charactors were not interesting, only her attention to detail made the book acceptable.I say wait until paperback or it hits the used list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of a dissapointement","review":"I usually love her books. But this one, it fell short of her usually high standerds. I could swallow the gender switching ghosts, but for Abby & Julian to just \\"rest in peace\\" after all that. It left me kind of annoyed!! She put so much of them into the story that I expected more in the ending. As for the relationship between Dec & Lena, well it seemed that they go through this \\"spiritual cleansing\\" toward the end, then everything is just peachy?!?! What was that all about???I will still read her books, as I think she is a gifted story teller. But I am sorry to say that this one just did not do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This was my first Nora Roberts. I gave it a try because the \\"haunted New Orleans\\" aspect sounded fascinating. Here are some reasons I'm sorry I picked it up:1. Rape scene: The story begins with a rape scene. I don't want rape scenes in romance novels, even when they aren't committed by the hero. With romance like this, who needs real life??2. Language. Bad language doesn't phase me, but I'm not looking for it in a romance novel.3. Strip club. The hero and his buddy spend an evening hitting the strip clubs. Major turn off. Give me a man who is too mature, and has too much integrity, to treat women like sex toys. (Yes, there are plenty of men like that.) And give me a woman with too much backbone to take it.I won't even get into the \\"Prince Charming marries the maid\\" aspect of the 1900 romance.On the plus side, there is a brave attempt at gender bending in the reincarnation aspect. However, for me it interfered with the romantic mood.It's back to British Chick Lit for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's happened to my favorite author?","review":"For years now, long before she was famous, Nora Roberts has been my favorite author. I read all her books and never has a reprint been a new story for me. I also read J.D. Robb and enjoy that series. I am very unhappy and disappointed with the direction she is now taking. In a very recent book, she wrote of magic, and as a Christian, I found it offensive. In Midnight Bayou, she has turned to reincarnation and the occult, which for those who study the Bible is offensive again. What's with this? I have always purchased Nora Roberts' books, sight unseen as soon as they are released. I won't be doing that anymore. It appears that I must check her books out now before purchasing them to determine content. I fear this has happened because she has made it big and is just spitting them out as fast as possible. Come on Nora, be true to yourself, and your loyal fans. This rating of 1 is a gift; I would have given it a zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great read","review":"I've always enjoyed this book and found it hard to put down. The first time I read it, I read it in 24 hrs, the second time was even less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"This story takes place in the present, but also in the past. Delcan Fitzgerald is drawn to a house in New Orleans called Manet Hall, but he really doesn't understand why. He just knows that since he first saw it in college, he would own it someday. He gets strange vibes from the house, and when he meets Angelina, they intensify. Together they go on the 100 year old journey to find the answers to the strange happenings within Manet Hall.While I generally like ghost stories with the paranormal added to the mix, this went beyond the scope of what I can take. The rebirth and reincarnation of characters was just too far out in left field for me. I normally like Nora Roberts books, but this is one I couldn't get into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back Nora!","review":"This book is like the Nora Roberts everyone can't wait to buy and read. I must admit I was somewhat disappointed in the last book, THE VILLA. MIDNIGHT BAYOU has everything, suspense, romance and lots of laughs. I enjoy how Roberts brings the legends of the region her books are taking place in.Lena and Declan are both very likeable characters. Although the rich guy and poor girl routine has been played to the death, this story was both believeable and caring. The fact that everyone's lives were not \\"fixed\\" by the end of the book was good. Lena's mother was like some mother's or father's I have known from friends. I like the way Nora Roberts handled Declan's relatives also.Anyone who reads Nora Roberts will love this book. CAROLINA MOON, SANCTURAY, and HOMEPORT are just a few books like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed w/Nora Roberts Midnight Bayou","review":"will be very short; Nora Roberts is one of my favorite writers;have never been as disappointed as i was with Midnight Bayou.The ending was not believable and left you unsatisfied; hopefully this is a fluke because i buy a lot of her hardcover books. prior to the ending, the plot and story were enjoyable; but with a bad ending, it leaves a bad taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this one","review":"This story caught my attention form the start. Loved it. Glad one of my favorite authors recommended it. Did not want to put it down. A ghost story that takes you back and forth from past to present."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midnight Bayou \\"Wonderful!\\"","review":"I read most of Nora Roberts books but this one is definitely a keeper. I enjoyed this book immensely and find myself going back to it when I am in a slump for a new book to read. I love the atmosphere she creates and the setting. Great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always fun","review":"I've always found Nora Roberts' books to be fun, enjoyable, and great reads, and she doesn't disappoint with this one. The characters are so well written you can hear their speech and accents in your head, and find yourself sympathizing and truly caring about them. Miss Odette and Remy really steal the show with their southern charm and interesting personalities. And the twist that Roberts works into the ghost story this purports to be makes for a great time, and a lot of fun. Overall, really enjoyable - it definitely brought a smile to my face a lot as I was reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!!!!","review":"I almost always give a book a three star rating even when I think it is really bad. I guess I just think that all books deserve at least that. So, when I gave this one a one star rating (and I would have given it a zero if possible) you know I really disliked it. I don't mind the reincarnation aspect but the gender change just totally ruined the entire book for me and badly enough to give it a one star. I love all of this author's other books and have most of them. The last few have been on a downhill slide. I just hope this trend doesn't continue for her. Like the others that were disappointed in this book, I know I will be checking her book jackets for the scoop before I buy another one of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the Bayou","review":"I am a huge Nora Roberts fan. I think I own practically every book she has written and have loved almost all of them. However, I found this book to be a HUGE disappointment. It is so incredibly boring that I couldn't wait for it to just be over.There is no suspense to the story as the plot is obvious in the first 40 pages. This follows her rather annoying second in a series paperback book about the 3 witches. I do hope this isn't a trend for her, because one more of this vein and I won't be buying her books again."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and last Nora Roberts I'll ever read","review":"My first question is... How on earth did this woman get published? This book started out great and I was excited to see the story unfold. As I kept reading, I got more and more frustrated. My friend was reading one of her series and told me that the men in those books were all pizza eating, beer drinking card board cut outs too. Declan got on my nerves.Then the big twist, which I won't spoil if someone is desperate enough to read this, made me shake my head and scoff. Its hard for me to leave books unfinished, so I kept with this one until the very last page... Then I wondered why I had just wasted so much of my life, when I could have been reading something worth my time. Maybe because I hate romance novels, I can't stand Nora Roberts. I can't stand Nick Sparks either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"I normally do not read this type of book, therefore, I hesitate to give it a rating.I do not like stories about ghost, haunted houses, reincarnation,etc. I rated the book based solely on the way it was written. In my opinion, the story was boring, the characters were not well described and much of it was repitious without adding anything to the situation; for example, clocks chiming, doors slambing, baby crying. The same situation kept happening over and over without any variety to it.This book is the 13th one I have read by the author. I loved all her other books but this one was a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my time","review":"This is the second Nora Roberts book I've read, and I enjoyed the first, so was excited to have another to read. Well, this is absolutely the most stupid book I have ever read. I don't know if I'll read another, since I felt like it was such a waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"This is by far my favorite book written by Nora Roberts. It was absoloutely the most wonderful book I've read. I couldn't put it down. The setting, the characters, the pace of the book was all wonderful. I didn't get \\"bogged\\" down at all. It's a real page turner!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting yet ....","review":"I have to admit. I was hesitant when I bought this book. Than I could not put it down. I would read when ever I could. I just had to get to the ending...than poof. It fizzled. It seemed Mrs.Roberts was tired of writting the book than just ended it abruptly. It was like reading the end of a Harlequin Romance. The obligated chapters were set in place. Time to emd it and send it in.I did indeed love the story. But the ending was rather abrupt. I felt it left loose ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I am an avid Nora Roberts fan and have every single one of her books including the ones she writes under \\"JD Robb.\\" By far, this is my least favorite of ALL her books and she has written many. I was very disappointed with this. I felt the characters were rather dull and cliche and I did not care for the \\"ghost\\" theme. However, everyone has an \\"off\\" day, and I am anxiously awaiting her next novel..."},{"rating":"1","title":"MIDNIGHT ...","review":"This was one of THE WORST books that I have read all year. It had got my attention because of my love of New Orleans and period piece books, but this was just awful. The first seven pages had me in disbelief that a well known author could write something soawful. It was like she woke up and decided to write about southern plantation life and reincarnation-without doing any research. Everything was so obvious in the first chapter, she included the typical idea of people of the south are usually portrayed; with balls and slaves! I wouldn't recommend this book, if you want to read a romace stick to Daniel Steel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Special K Cereal","review":"This product has been excellent for portion control. My husband is dieting and eats one small box every morning with 1% milk. He is losing weight!! The case of 70 serving boxes is convenient to pull from daily. The small packs also are easy to pack when we are traveling. Calories are low particularly with this size. We are really pleased with this choice of cereal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love to get controlled quantity healthy cereal","review":"I really wanted to get some of these serving size boxes of cereal but all they had at the grocery were the \\"fun\\" boxes of very sweet cereals. We eat this cereal once or twice a day either with milk or with yogurt and fruit. The cereal did not get stale, of course, but be aware if you have storage issues that you will be getting 70 small individual-serving size boxes of cereal. I made the mistake of trying the Rice Krispies at the same time as the Special K and we had boxes of cereal everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adorn unscented extra hold","review":"My wife has used this product exclusively for decades. We are glad that it remains available. Unlike countless great products that are no longer offered, this one has not fallen victim to misguided attempts to replace or \\"improve\\" it.March 2011: Amazon just increased the price more than seven-fold - they are now asking almost $23 per can. That is price gouging at its worst. They get away with it because the manufacturer discontinued the product. As a result of the price gouging, I have now reduced the rating to 1-star from 5-star."},{"rating":"2","title":"TO EXPENSIVE","review":"My 80 year old Mother has ben using this product for YEARS. You cannot find it in stores here anywhere. So glad I found it for her on Amazon. My problem is is keeps going up in price! I know its because you cant find it, but geez , almost 30 dollars for two cans!! My poor Mother would be lost without this product, so I must keep paying this inflated price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Like the Original!","review":"This product might have the same can design as the old favorite Adorn. But the contents are NOT the same as the Adorn line of products we grew up with. For one thing, this hairspray, despite being the \\"unscented,\\" has an odd, lingering odor about it. Worse yet, it leaves the hair with a sticky, unnatural feel. I have to use it very sparingly, and even then, my hair ends up looking like something molded out of plastic.Perhaps knowing that there was still a market for the original Adorn hairspray, some overseas manufacturer put out a product in an identically designed can. But they were not able to get the original recipe for the hairspray itself right.I'm afraid the Adorn we grew up with is probably gone forever. This item, whatever its provenance, is definitely no substitute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme dissapointment","review":"While the subject matter of this book is interesting and, to some degree, useful, the fomatting of this text is so bad as to be barely readable. There are far too many errors. This is more than shoddy work as the issue is easily avoidable. There are many books--free and otherwise--which are far more accessable to readers. This one is a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good!!!!!","review":"The movie is pretty good but the ballet is fake. They should of did more classacal ballet."},{"rating":"2","title":"charming, but chock full of cliches","review":"This is a fun movie to watch, and most people will enjoy it, but don't go into it expecting some cinematic brilliance. It is so full of cliches it is almost unbelieveable, but if you don't mind that, it's a whole lot of fun. I've watched it many times because I am a dancer, and I've known the star of the movie, Amanda Schull since I was five. She's incredibly beautiful (she really does look in real life exactly as she looks in the movie) and she does a great job with the dancing. Ethan Steifel and Sascha Radetsky also are amazing dancers, and the three of them make the movie very enjoyable and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth behind beauty","review":"This DVD is one of the most lovely but real stories about ballet dancers .The lovely is because when you see the reviews for this film , you expect just to see ballet trainings or classes , but what you receive is 2 great love stories and some ballet performances at the end .The real is all the preparations and the suffer that a ballet dancer could have .In my case , as a former ballet dancer , this is the true story of all of us , maybe shown as a fairy tale more than the reality , but the good part is that the director showed the problems like anorexia and competition plus all the frustrations but at the same time the beauty and the dreamworld of the Ballet ."},{"rating":"2","title":"[ Title Here ]","review":"You can tell some of the actors aren't all that great, but the idea... the contents of the movie makes up for it BIG time. The choreography was great... not the stereotypical idea of ballet pointe, but really jazzy and it was cute. It had some romance, which is always a plus to me! The movie was something different for me. You know, like seeing that people eat, sleep, and breathe ballet and how they live. It gave me another perspective on ballet dancers. The movie even encouraged ME to become a dancer... It's worth it if you want to see something interesting and new or if you just like ballet/ pointe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"I really loved this movie. I thought it was great. Made me want to get up and dance. Very inspiring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ballet movie","review":"I didn't think I like ballet or even ballet movies.

I really enjoyed it. ...and they did end up going to a salsa club."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"I loved this movie! I'm a dancer myself, and I really enjoy movies about dancers, and this one was by far my favorite! The movie was a bit slow, but all the great dancing totally made up for that, making the movie great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dance Moves","review":"I thought that \\"Centre Stage\\" was a good movie. There was aa average story line, but the dancing was fantastic!! It was a very inspirational movie for any one that is striving for their goals. After watching this movie you will want to get up and dance!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great comedy/drama!","review":"Dancing dominates in this comedy/drama which makes you appreciate the work and dedication it takes to be a dancer. This movie focuses on 7 dancers in NYC - their hardships and triumphs, and their determination and will to fight for what they really want. Dancing comes first in this movie, which means although the acting isn't the greatest, you have to remember that they were hired for their dancing, not their thespian skills! To sum up,this realistic picture highlights the joys and fears of professional dancing, and is very realistic and cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie I've ever seen!!","review":"I thought this movie was fantastic! I danced for 7 years and the story and everything is just so real that its scary. I bought this movie, and during the months of December & January I watched it every single day, twice on the weekends. I highly suggest you purchase this movie because once you watch it, you'll be hooked!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Enjoyable","review":"I found this movie \\"truly enjoyable.\\" The plot was a bit old and over used but the dancing more than made up for it. The dancing is absolutely amazing. However, the story does not really portray the life of a dancer. It is true that dancers tape their toes and get blisters and sprains but most of a dancers struggle is elsewhere. This movie doesn't show the hard work put into the dancing, the exhaustion at the end of the day, or the way that dancers tend to be harder on themselves than any teacher ever could be. While people should enjoy the movie, because it is more about achieving a dream than any thing else and the dancing is beautiful, they should not be under the impression that the actors are behaving as real dancers would. For example, no dancer would ever talk back to a teacher or walk out in the middle of class. This movie is much better when one pays more attention to the dancing than the acting. The dancing makes it a 4 star movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars for Center Stage!","review":"This is an incredible movie that truly portrays the life of a dancer. I highly reccomend this movie for dancers, or anyone who just wants a good laugh, or an incredibly inspiring movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"this is one of the best movies of all time. the dancing in it is as dirty as the dancing in the movie 'dirty dancing'. i can say that i dearly love it though. i recomended it for almost all ages the girl i was with was 8 and she loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and good if you like dancing!","review":"While this movie may not be the best for plot and story development its just fun and a different spin on a teen style flick. The dance scenes are entertaining, although with as many as their are in the film you feel like its a showcase for the dancers.The acting is done by little known actors who can dance basically. The only familiar characters are Maureen [Susan May Pratt] from Drive Me Crazy, and Johnathan [Peter Gallagher] from American Beauty.If you love ballet then this film is entertaining, and if your a teen like me the hot guys like Charlie are enough to keep you watching. :P While the movie lacks in plot it has its good moments and the development is a bit weak but honestly I couldn't help liking the film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! I was surprised!","review":"This movie was adorable! I thought it would be another teeny bopper movie but it was the furthest thing from it. The story was great, the characters were a lot of fun, and the dancing made you want to get up and join in. The two male leads were really hot, and Amanda Schull was so cute! Give it a try, you'll love it. I'm 23 and had the best time watching it-it's not just for teens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Center Stage...","review":"I stumbled upon this film January 3, 2009. I ordered the Soundtrack to the film on January 4, 2009. The film, and the accompanying music engaged me to that level of interest. You really get a good view of what it is to try and become a dancer at a certain level. An entertaining movie, I liked it enough to rate it: 4 stars. See it and be inspired!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"I have loved this movie ever since it first came out, which was quite a few years ago. I loved dance movies, and romantic comedies, so if you do too, get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"You don't have the right body type.\\"","review":"Center Stage is a fun and sexy film about the world of dance. The film centers around young, gifted ballet dancers who get a chance to study their craft at The American Ballet Company in New York. The acting is so-so but the dance numbers are a knock-out! I love the jazz dancing class when the dancers rock out to the song Higher Ground, I could watch that scene all day long. Great ballet rountines, beautifully choreographed, the performers have a lot of energy and heart through-out the film. Now I wished I would have stuck with ballet when I was I kid. I love this film, a very under-rated gem. Buy Center Stage today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Center Stage","review":"Center Stage is a typical teen flick but this one can appeal to all ages because of the fantastic dance scenes at the end and throughout the movie!! I've known adults who have loved the dancing as well as the encouraging story of a young girl who is told she doesn't have the right body type for ballet by a prestigious ballet academy. She soon discovers that her love of dancing and her body is perfect for a different kind of ballet - with catchy dance moves and a great soundtrack, Center Stage is for everyone especially those who love dance!!If you liked Save the Last Dance, you'll LOVE Center Stage. This movie is great in spite of its teen genre and sometimes cliched or predictable storylines - see it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome look into the world of Ballet!","review":"This Movie is so good that you can watch it over and over.The Characters are well acted and the Dancing is awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies!!","review":"I THINK THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE FOR BALLET DANCERS, OR DANCERS PERIOD. ALONG WITH SAVE THE LAST DANCE IT IS GREAT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Center Stage","review":"This movie is the best movie I've seen in a long time! The songs are great and dance is a sport. Just because baseball, basketball, and football dominate doesn't mean that dance should be ignored!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great dance movie!","review":"Center Stage was throughly entertaing! It's one of those movies that I can watch over and over again. It's such a fun movie. The dancing scenes were wonderfully choreographed, and exhilarating to watch! The only flaw I could see was that the characters were not incredibly developed, nor did they really need that whole Jody/Cooper involvement. Especially since that part of the story was not really well developed. Other than that, it did a great job depicting life at a competitive dance school. I especially liked the conflict between Maureen, the school's best dancer, and her overbearing mother. Her battle with bulemia was very beliveable. Overall this is a sexy, fun, movie that can be watched over and over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! You have to see this movie.","review":"The movie has great dancing, of course. And also the personalities of the characters are brought in throughout the movie for each decision made, something that many movies forget nowdays. And the movie gives you more than just some ballet, but they give you a little bit of modern dance,clubbing(going to a club and dancing), and a spin to the ordinary ballet. There are twists and turns throughout the whole movie to keep the watcher interested.A must see for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Beautiful choreography,dancing, costumes, and young people. How wonderful to see the dancers faces in a movie while they dance. The acting wasn't outstanding, but who cares, it was about the dance."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Life of a Dancer","review":"Center Stage is a fantastic movie that realistically shows the world of dance through the eyes of a group of young ballet dancers. For anyone who has ever danced, has any appreciation for the art, or for anyone who wants to learn more this movie is a definite must see. Not only does the movie deal with dance, but it deals with more serious issues such as eating disorders and the sarcrifices that we must make in order to reach our goals. If for no other reason, watch this movie for the last 20 minutes. The dance sequences are phenomenal."},{"rating":"1","title":"FLAT","review":"I saw this cinematic abomination recently on television, and I have to say that it is one of the most shallow pieces of tripe that I have seen in a LONG time. It seems like they were trying to rekindle the flame ignited by the movie Fame so many years ago, but fail so miserably to capture any real depth in their characters, I am a theatre major, and I enjoy movies in this genre generally, but this one has missed the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this movie, and I'm a dancer!!!","review":"When I went to see this movie I thought that I was probably going to enjoy it. Unfortunatly I found that it is one of the worst I have ever seen. Although the film DOES show much of the pain and sacrifice that goes with dancing (espically pointe) the characters are so vapid that you really can't feel anything for them. The story line is somewhat interesting, but is portrayed with such bad acting and direction, that it is lost in the mess that is 'Center Stage'."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Great!!","review":"OK, I've read some really bad reviews for Center Stage, but i could care less what they have to say! The dancing was amazing and I think it was a great idea to use real dancers rather than actors, because you know these people really have talent. Get the movie, you'll enjoy, I promise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad plot- good inspiration","review":"a cute plot, but dont go to this movie for any critical analysis of society. It has some neat dances in it, so I suggest it for choreographing inspiration. i guess the \\"nice\\" guy in the movie is pretty good looking too, but why does she have a thing for that Russian? i dont think he's that attractive..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun and inspiration","review":"Regardless of cliches, being labeled as teen-flick, etc. this movie is certainly very enjoyable. If nothing else, see it for Ethan Stiefel's amazing dancing. I've seen him live before, but never in hip-hop or jazz roles. Very exciting to see him show off his versatility in Center Stage! I've danced ballet for years and I don't care about the little discrepancies in the film; it's still great. I particularly enjoyed the portrayals of the daily drudge of class. The fact that Hytner used real dancers (except for Maureen's character, which is fine) was the real kicker for me. I'm still dancing and sometimes I watch this movie as reminder of what fun you can have when you dance for the love of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantabulous","review":"When you watch a dance movie you seldom expect the dancing to be great due to the fact that movies contain actors and not dancers but this is one movie that threatened to break that mould. The acting was average but the dancing and choreography were hands down the best that i have ever seen captured on film. This movie showed that a little hard work never hurt nobody and that if you want something you should fight for it tooth and nail because perseverance seldom fails... the dancing would make you get out of you chair and dance because after all that's what it's all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this movie partially because of some of the reviews I read here on it. I figured that at the worst, this movie would be like Dirty Dancing - majorly melodramatic, but great dance scenes. Unfortunately, Center Stage doesn't even have that much going for it. The acting is very bad, and while there are a few dance scenes worth watching, too many of them are ridiculously over done. Some of them are just not that great. I don't doubt that the people in this movie CAN dance, they just spend so much time with big, vapid cheesy smiles it's hard for the audience to care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dance 10, looks 3","review":"Great dancing, and what is probably a good look at the \\"inside story\\" of dance training. However - the acting is stiff, dialog cornball, characters stereotyped and plot as predictable as the sunrise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Center Stage","review":"When I was little I used to take tap and ballet, but I quit and took up gymnastics. But through gymnastics we had to take dance so it was still a part of my life. I thought this movie was really good, but a bit unbelievable with some of the things they did. For instance the last part of the movie with the dances, some of the scenes couldn't really have happened as they did. Dancers can not change their whole outfit and hair style in that short of a time period. Even though it was not realistic, I thought that part was one of the best parts of the movie. I still really enjoy watching this movie today even though I have seen it many times. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like any type of dancing, this is the movie for you.","review":"Like the great dancing in Dirty Dancing and Flashdance,this movie, by the end makes you want to get up and do the dances from the movie. It's not a classic of course, but it's a cute teeny-bop movie with wonderful dancing and a good storyline.Also attention girls: there's a really hot guy... his character name is Charlie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"At first I didn't think I would like this movie. But my daughter is the one that got me to watch it and it is great. There still are lessons to be learned and this movie has a few in it. It just comes to show you are never to old to learn something from the younger kids today either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dancing, formulaic story","review":"Don't buy this for the story, which is a composite of every ballet cliche you've ever heard. (Company director marrying one of his ballerinas, womanizing male star, dancer just out of school becoming a principal dancer, etc.) Instead, buy it for the dancing and choreography, which are really first rate. The film features 2 principal dancers from the American Ballet Theatre (who, though not from my favorite company, the NYCB, are wonderful). The special features section has wonderful expanded sequences of Kenneth McMillan's Romeo and Juliet and Balanchine's Stars and Stripes. And the film itself features new choreography by hot new NYCB choreographer Christopher Wheeldon and a supercool modern piece by the film's main choreographer, Susan Stroman, that are alone worth the price of the DVD. If you love ballet (both classical and modern), you need this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"This was an excellent movie I saw it 3 times in the theaters. The dancing is phenomenal and the acting is wonderful. It's a great modern day love story too. I definately give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Stereotype of the Real World","review":"\\"Center Stage\\" is a movie that focuses on a group of friends at the American Ballet Academy, and the drama of their lives, all with a fantastic dance sequence at the end. Most of the characters are played by professional dancers, and you can tell, as the acting leaves something to be desired. Every character, up to the anorexic ballet dancer, was a cheap cliche. I wouldn't rush out to rent this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next time get some real actors","review":"This movie could have been really cool. I loved the dancing. But please!!! You are supposed to use ACTORS to act, not dancers. Granted, some people can do both. Wouldn't it have been great if they had found some. Also, the plot and script are much too 'soap opera!' I think my favorite part of the movie was the previews!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All That Jazz, without any jazz at all!","review":"Saw this dog on a plane where several people commented that it was the worst film ever seen in flight. It might not have stunk to high heaven, but it did stink to high altitude. Dull and lifeless are the first words that come to mind. I like a good film with dance as the backdrop (The Turning Point, All That Jazz, White Nights), but this dog could barely walk, let alone dance. The dramatic storyline didn't keep my interest in the least. While a few of the dance sequences (not all!) were fine, the story has to work first. A total bomb! If you insist, rent it for a cure to insomnia! I seldom find movies of this kind this bad! Need a good dance film in the DVD collection? Wait until All That Jazz is released(hopefully soon! )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plotless wonder!","review":"Only women like this film.There is no conflict.

Both albums are great, with several hits like \\"Do You Wanna Dance\\", \\"When I Grow Up\\", \\"Dance, Dance, Dance\\", \\"Help Me, Rhonda\\" and \\"California Girls\\". And there are plenty of great songs that weren't hits, like \\"Please Let Me Wonder\\" and \\"Let Him Run Wild\\". And \\"I'm Bugged at My Ol' Man\\" is the funniest song the Beach Boys ever recorded. But the interview \\"Bull Session With the 'Big Daddy'\\" isn't something that most people will want to listen to more than once. Other than that obvious low point, Beach Boys fans should enjoy this CD a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Of Their Best","review":"Yeah, I love Pet Sounds too, but it is a little overrated. Pound for pound of pure pop pleasure, this is my favorite BB CD - largely because of the great Today!

Tons of great songs on these albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Beauties","review":"I agree with the general consensus that \\"Today!\\" is the Beach Boys' best album after \\"Pet Sounds\\" -- it's a surprisingly deep, gentle record that must have sounded strange upon release. It's pretty obvious that Brian Wilson (with mind sufficiently \\"expanded\\" already by this point -- he beat Lennon & McCartney in the \\"Tune in, Turn on\\" sweepstakes by at least a year) was starting to tire of the Beach Boys' formula, and the result is his finest batch of songs yet. \\"Summer Days\\" (released a few months later), on the other hand, is something of a spotty regression. I think Mike Love & company weren't too hip on \\"Today!\\"'s mellow vibe and put the pressure on Brian to come up with more upbeat tunes. The result is, like I say, mixed, but there's no denying the stunning magnificence of songs like \\"Let Him Run Wild\\" and \\"Girl Don't Tell Me\\" -- even if you have to wade through nonsense like \\"Salt Lake City\\" and \\"Amusement Parks USA\\" to get to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old information. Needs updating badly.","review":"I used this book in high school for a photography class. When I saw that it had been revised and updated, I bought a copy online to check out for offering at a seminar I would be doing. I couldn't have been more disappointed. To me, revised and updated means improving. This has the same old 70s (60s?) photos, and I am not sure a word in the book has changed. There is just more to it than this - basic photography is no longer only analog. Equipment has changed. This book does not reflect those changes. I subsequently returned my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woefully outdated","review":"This is a great book.............if this were 1977, but it's 2007 and about as useful a book on tips for handling your LPs and 8-track tapes. Although this may a 5th addition printed in 2001, the book feels more like 1971. Obviously, the digital revolution has by now fully supplanted film to the extent you can hardly find a film camera to buy save eBay. As good of an intro this may have been decades ago, it today has zero value for any new photographer."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for beginners","review":"I teach basic and color photography. One of my students let me borrow her copy of the original(1989). One problem in explaining aperture, shutter speed, and depth-of-field is that photos would really help. This book does that, as well as having photos that address loading the film, types of lenses, light, and use of flash. Yes, there are people out there that don't know how to load film. Although modern cameras may have electronic gizmos to deal with aperture and shutter speed, this book helps the understanding of how everything works, as all cameras do the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good start","review":"Although the book was revised and updated in 1997, the pictures and cameras used in the book are 1970's style. They have added just a couple of updates with new camera technology. You'd be better off just sticking with your camera's manual. For example, 10% of book talks about loading and unloading film. Most beginners even know how to do that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Basic\\" is an understatement...","review":"If you know nothing about 35mm photography; if you have never held a 35mm SLR in your hands; if you need the low down on \\"how to\\" in the simplest form, then this may be the book for you.

Out of all the shower heads I haver ever seen this one feels worth its weight however as a shower head it is disappointing.I am replacing my shower head because the o-ring that allows the head to swivel is leaking and the head is starting to shoot in some crazy directions - it needs a good cleaning. So I was seeking a replacement. I cam across this one and it got goo reviews but in order to get some decent velocity the spray pattern is way too wide. There is no way to narrow it down and I estimated while showering that at 3 feet from the shower head you have a 4 foot diameter cone of water. My shower was wet in places it shouldn't and never has been. For this reason I am looking for something different and will be returning.

Of course, this is the first showerhead I have ever paid over $100 for (they're sometimes over $200 in stores), so, for my sake, I'm glad I'm very happy with it. I highly recommend this showerhead for its great flow and pressure. If you use a showerarm extension, make sure it's a good one, because, due to the heavy weight of this showerhead, the extension may not stay up.

This was purchased as any upgrade to the 6 jet shower head. It gives a wider spray pattern but lacks the pressure stream that you would expect from such an expensive shower head. When the water is turned off, it starts leaking approximately 90 seconds later and the leakage lasts for about 45 seconds or so. Very annoying!!

I purchased new rechargeable batteries, but that wasn't the answer. I contacted Panasonic but it is out of the warrantee period. They will charge a flat $140.00 to fix it and I can get a new one for about $150.00. I loved this camera, but it is such a disappointment. I was very easy with it - it just stopped working!

But I guess you get what you pay for, bad warranty............"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value","review":"This camera is great value for the money. The 6x zoom is great, the image stablization works very well. It doesn't have some manual settings (exposure etc.), max exposure you can set is 8 seconds in night scenery mode, so some dark night pics can get pretty grainy. But anything with decent to great light is terrific. The lcd itself shows grainy images occasionaly, i think that's because of lower resolution, but the images turned out great. just bought it for $230 and jandr. Pretty fast camera too, don't have a high-speed hd card. very easy to use interface, and all preset modes give info on how to use them. Plastic body doesn't seem like a problem, but i'd recommend getting some kind of a case since the lcd is completely unprotected. very light with the 2 aa batteries too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!","review":"I am just blown away with the detail that this camera picks up.

It doesn't transfer pics onto the computer very fast but that is minor. I am by no means a professional but it works very well in bars, outside, and inside. Definitly recommend this camera. Zoom is great, menus are easy to navigate, image stabilization is very cool, and it is small enough to fit in a coat or my girlfriend's purse (but too big for my jeans pocket)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, broke in the middle of Europe trip","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!

Worked well for about a year. It is pretty much impossible to see anything in the LCD outdoors in any kind of daylight. You often have to just point and guess. When it took pictures the quality was very good. After about a year the LCD screen when black. All the menu items would show, even the flash would go, but the pictures were just black.

How come the price here in US is almost 120 US dollars, which amounts to around 800 yuan?!My suggestion : if you want it, and I can assure you that if you have reached upper intermediate or advanced level in Mandarin Chinese that is the reference work you want to have, buy it from a Chinese bookstore (in China),like www.amazon.cn.

And all his father's old friends are involved someway. Too, he is dealing with the heartbreak of divorce, hanging on for dear life. This was just a great read and one I'm so glad I found.

Regardless if you are utilizing Microsoft's DirectMusic Producer, you will find the techniques and strategies for creating interactive music extremely valuable and useful no matter what development tool you use.Don't be intimidated by the wealth of knowledge and years of expertise from the authors. The straight forward creative and analytical approach to presenting the concepts in this book make it very well rounded for all readers.

My Conclusion, If you like Net Force, You need this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"I've read many of Tom Clancy's books, and enjoyed many of them.But not this one!

Most glaringly, the virtual reality descriptions in this book are simply not believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"This book is devoid of Clancy. There is no hero. The villian is vanquished by another villian, who is vanquished by ANOTHER villian. The depiction of cyberspace patrol, even in a VR world is totally unrealistic. The Net Force team gets absolutely nowhere with their case.The reading is slow, the action boring, and the supposed good guy loses out in the end.There's even a totally unrelated side plot consisting of a petty teen relationship.Definately NOT Clancy's team's best. Clancy is know for being realistic and having done his homework. This book is not worthy of that name.If there were a zero star rating, this book would get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting storyline that could have been given more time","review":"The idea of the computer-world being brought to it's knees is an intriguing one. This novel, however, doesn't begin do it justice.I didn't find the characters as well-rounded as other characters that have shown up in Clancy novels, but it could have happened if the writing team had devoted more pages to the book allowing the necessary details that weren't there. Does every female have to be drop-dead gorgeous and every male fantastic in the use of guns?Unfortunately the plot suffers a lack of detail as well.I rated it two stars because I did finish the book in just a few days, but it was not nearly the riveting read that Executive Orders and others were."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a good read","review":"Most of these other reviewers are right; it's not the greatest book ever written. On the other hand, it kept me up pretty late. You kind of have to read the earlier books to find out what's going on. There is a young boy that had his first heartbreak, A Russian man that they still have to catch from book one. I think what I enjoyed best about the book was that these are starting to become old friends. I wouldn't want to read all the books at once, because then it would become monotonous, but like this is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad and getting worse","review":"Tom Clancy should fire his ghostwriter before he puts him out of business.

I am a fan of REAL Tom Clancy writings. Unfortunately, his major success and the book company's greed (and perhaps his own) to capitalize on his name every which way possible has yielded \\"Clancy Seconds\\" such as this book. If you have ever read real Clancy writings, you will know that he clearly had nothing to do with this book other than lending his name to it. I believe he created the concept for NetForce (which started off very well) but now they farm these books out to ghost writers. This book had poor character development and weak story lines. Stick to reading Clancy's major titles which are written only by him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother reading it-I didn't","review":"I read the first book in the net force series, and I thought that it was ok but that it just wasn't up to par. I haven't bothered to even read the next two in the series, but from what I have heard, they are worse than the first one. I think, just like a lot of other Tom Clancy fans that Mr. Clancy needs to stick to writing his own books rather than stamping his name on someone else's book. My advice is that if it says Created by Tom Clancy and... don't read it-yor are just wasting your time. All of Tom's other books that he didn't co-write, such as Clear and Present Danager, are much much better and I would recommend them any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed","review":"Have you ever listen to a dishonest politician speak.

Also it had a few too many \\"Hot\\" scenes. Come on. These people are profesianals. They don't try to lure co-workers to having sex with them on massage tables. And the perfect Spetznatz agent who can shoot the barreles of five CIA agents before they can blink is an annoying character who lacks deph. The only thing this book is good for is kindling.

No batteries, no solar power. Would you believe it has a SPRING and you actually WIND it! Otherwise, VR whiz Jay Gridley is after this hacker and the guy sends him a mild stroke online. Which knocks him out of the box, and if too many people take this part of the story too seriously, it might start a Luddist phobia against VR that will more than counter the bunch who've made a secular religion out of gizmos.

The haunted part of the book is so pathetic that you can skip it just when you start reading it. It doesn't have any sense and it was written just to fill more pages in the book.When you read a spies' book and the FBI doesn't had any lead to the killer and the killer just give up because he thinks that he doesn't have to live anymore is pathetic, and more if this killer is an expert sniper and turned down the FBI twice before.The plot is interesting and will keep you reading until the end, but at the end you'll be so disappointed that you'd have thought that you'd never have read this book. I think you can skip this one and look for other FBI or spies' books from other writers for example:'Dead Ringer' by JASMINE CRERSSWELLor 'Blind Run' by PATRICIA LEWINamong others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello? Where 's the proofreader?","review":"In addition to many comma splices throughout the book, this was the worst written book by ANY author I have ever read. If your house was shot up by a gun-toting maniac, would you rush to the kitchen for paper towels to mop up a coffee spill? The characters' dialogue is stilted, inappropriate at times, and totally inane. FBI agents sobbing in each others' arms? I think not--agents have nails and gunpowder for breakfast. It seemed as if Coulter did little or no research in order to bring credibility to her characters. While promoting her book, Coulter touted her book as being better then Dan Brown's DaVinci Code; she can only wish it were. A total flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inane Dialogue","review":"This is a poorly crafted excuse for an F.B.I. story. It reads more like a Disney story written for teens and tweens, with the implausibly snappy dialogue completely inappropriate to this genre... or to any book an adult might read.I struggled to chapter 3, but the goofy character interactions and dialogue have defeated me. I'd rather read any of the beautifully written John Sanford books I've already read than subject myself to another paragraph of this book's nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow Out","review":"This book reads like the first rambling efforts of a high school girl. The mixing of romantic patter between the main characters while they conduct an FBI investigation into brutal murders clearly does not work.

If I could have awarded it a zero star rating, I would have.The initial premise is interesting: A Justice of the US Supreme Court is murdered in the Supreme Court building itself.But after that, disaster. Two plots, utterly unrelated. Poor character development. The action doesn't flow-it starts and then stops. And when action occurs, it's over in about 2 pages, getting you back to inane plots. The end never really is revealed.And for some reason, the author is very annoying as she insists upon making up the names of a lot of streets in Washington, DC. Why invent street names, when a simple glance at a map reveals plenty of real street names to choose from. Inventing new one is more work that reading a map!In short, read the first line again."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY","review":"I am a Catherine Coulter fan but I have to say this is one of the worst books I have ever listened to.

There wasn't a true ending.THE COVE by Catherine coulter I really enjoyed gave it a 4 starLYON'S GATE by Catherine Coulter was ok gave it a 3 starLets hope the author recaptures the romance again and bring back her earlier writing skillsI'd definitely skip this one if I were you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak plot, disconnected","review":"This was the first book from CC I ever read, and I won't be looking for another one. The plot is thin and there is simply no actual problem solving. The protagonists come to decisions simply \\"because\\". The use of the MAX computer to find the murder - OMG, what a cheesy resource...

In short: don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful...","review":"I won't buy Coulter books any more. The dialog is incredibly bad the plot lines are non-existant. What was with the \\"ghost\\"? Why title the book \\"blowout\\" when the story revolves around the murder of the Supreme Court Justice.

Not even worth checking out for free at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow Out was exactly that!","review":"This may be the most tedious book I've ever read. The plot meandered through unnecessary people and events until almost the last page. I couldn't even really tell who the main characters were. I suspect they were Carrie and Ben but the total lack of character development left me wondering. In the past, Catherine Coulter has kept me on the edge of my seat with her plot and character development. This book had me struggling to stay awake. \\"Blow Out\\" is just that, a blow out."},{"rating":"1","title":"coulter misses this time","review":"I was very disappointed in Coulter's latest work. She took a potentially complex story and \\"shrink wrapped\\" it. How naive does she think we are? Then to add the paranormal story was just too much. It was almost embarassing. Are the editors reading this stuff before they publish it; or do they believe that we will read anything by certain authors? It is insulting. I was expecting much better from a very good author. But lately many of these popular authors have been just going through the motions and not really trying to give something new. They just need to bring out a new book every year.

My mistake. The entire plot of this book is so unbelievable I had to continue reading it just to see how senseless the ending would be. The two story lines never come together. The ending is not only predictable, but lame. I have nothing intellgent to say about this book because it was soooo bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I have the last four hours of my life back?","review":"Talk about a huge waste of time. There are basically two separate plots in the book: one involving a ghost haunting an FBI agent and another where the same FBI agent is investigating the death of a Supreme Court Justice. The only connecting thread between the two loosely woven plots was that the same FBI agent was working on both cases. That's it. The title of the book has no bearing whatsover on the main focus of the book - the Justice's murder. The \\"blow out\\" refers to the ghostly plot, which in fact, is miniscule both in scale and importance to the entire book. The respective endings of both plots were so unbelievably anti-climatic, I kept turning pages just to see if there really was \\"more.\\" There wasn't. This is the first and last book I'll ever read by this author. Although it was a very quick read, I still feel like it was a waste of an afternoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow out, I think not.","review":"Very disappointing. I was looking forward to this book because I buy all of her books. It took me a minute to get into the book, and besides that I was very easily interrupted. It did not capture my imagination. I could not believe that they brought a person who is on a hit list into their home even though they have a son they love so much. The book was all over the place. All of a sudden, MAX came up with the name of the murderer, just like that. It was just so out there. I liked the Samantha Barrister secondary plot line better than the main plot. Maybe that should have been the main plot. It was hard to believe that the judge was having an affair. The way everyone described him as being private and waiting patiently to marry his wife, does not jibe with him being an adulterer. Instead of paying your hard earned money, I would go to the library and check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"The whole time I read this book I was thinking, \\"Are they kidding? They actually think we'd BELIEVE this stuff? Did the Publishers and Editors actually read the book before releasing it?\\" So many things wrong with this book that I don't think I have the space to write them all down. Here are a couple...1) The dialog is so unbelievable that I was laughing. The characters are too long winded. 2) The main plot-line was horrible. You couldn't even GUESS who did it because they just picked the bad guy out of thin air at the end! And the reason why he did it was laughable. 3) CC needs to research police policies...no Cop would EVER, I mean EVER blurt out every single detail of the investigation to a reporter, victim family members, and other suspects in the case. I mean, PLEASE!Readers, do yourself a favor, skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"On top of her Game","review":"Coulters maturing of the Sherlock and Savage team is obvious in this continuation of her FBI thriller series.

I was alittle dissappointed in how easy it was for Savage to figure out who the killer was and the \\"ghost\\" of a women murdered 30 years ago coming to Savage on the side of the road while he changed a blow out was differrent but the story flowed well and keeps you reading. Overall this is a great read and I recomend it to Coulter fans"},{"rating":"1","title":"People pay real money for this?","review":"I borrowed this book from the public library.

Her Regency-era romances were usually witty and fun and her early FBI thrillers were actually good. This one is just bad. It had good primeses but bad characterization, bad dialogue, no plot, stupid cops and a spectacularly bad ending. She should never have let this one go to print.By the way, I checked the other reviews written by the three people who have given this book a five-star rating. Who's paying these people?

Judging from the others, I'm not the only one who was disappointed. I expected more creativity from Ms Coulter, especially since the story was about the killing of a Justice of the Supreme Court. Unbelievable subplots and an anti-climatic ending made for an extremely disappointing conclusion. Sorry, Ms. Coulter. I expected much more from you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blow Out","review":"This is a typical Catherine Coulter book featuring Sherlock & Savich. It follows the usual outline, with the two murders to be solved introduced in the first 2-3 chapters. The two new characters who will eventually fall into bed and then marry are also introduced within the first few chapters. Ms. Coulter is a good writer, but the pattern is getting tiring. Glad I downloaded it as a library book and did not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy dialogue, poor plot","review":"Even though I love the Savich/Sherlock series--this one was terrible. The romance/flirting between the 2 sub-characters was so lame. The dailogue was cheesy. And the plot left you wishing there had been one. The sub plot was hardly mentioned throughout the horribly long interviewing of suspects and then when it did come up again in the end, it was wrapped up quickly and with no substance. The main plot was a huge let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blowout","review":"Another great mystery in the FBI series from Catherine Coulter. You won't want to put this book down until you've finished reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Be the Worst Book, Ever","review":"Let's see, my stepfather was just murdered and, within less than twenty four hours, I am wildly flirting with the police officer. The only way that any fact can be explained to the reader is through stilted dialogue -- \\"I am going to see so-and-so.\\" \\"Oh, isn't she your sister?\\" \\"Yes, she is my sister.\\" It's a murder mystery, actually two murders, completely unrelated to each other, both of them \\"solved\\" at the last minute through long-winded confessions in the bad old James Bond style, \\"now that I've got you, the good guy, pinned down and could kill you just by pulling the trigger, let me explain to you in long-winded fashion why I've done this.\\" And spiced with right-wing fantasy throughout (the liberal Supreme Court Justice is a horrible person, the Black law clerk is labelled an affirmative action whiner for no discernible reason, the \\"good\\" beer is Coors, and so on). Worst. Book. Ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total flat tire","review":"The title of the novel refers to the strange experience familiar character Dillon Savich has on a lonely, snowy road one dark night. Alas, it is hardly developed at all in the book until the last 40 pages or so, and I really can't see, hard as the author tried, how it is linked up with the supposed hero and heroine of this book, Ben Raven and the daughter of a murdered supreme court justice. The motive for the murders as the body pile mounts up is absolutely absurd, and the twist at the end totally falls flat. I felt really cheated by this book. It was nice to see Sherlock and Dillon and their little boy, but the whole relationship between Ben and his lady love is a wet squib and the macho posturing in the living room of Savich's home is just absurd. A real let down. Neither romantic, nor suspenseful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain boring.","review":"I have read all the other Sherlock and Savich books and have noticed that they get worse and worse. The first one was great, but this last one \\"Blow Out\\", was a total let down. The plot was so unbelievable and the ending was anti-climatic. When I finished it I was like, That's it? That was supposed to be a suspensful book? Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad!","review":"A terrible read. A computer determined who the killer was, from out of the blue, with no explanation to the reader. Likewise I was waiting for a tie-in between the supernatural portion of the story which appeared at the beginning of the book but there was no relationship between the ghost of the woman Samantha Barrister, her family, and the rest of the story. Very juvenile, not at all thought out in a logical manner. It was a page turner, keeping me in suspense as I waited for some coherence, which, unfortunately, never came."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Awful-don't blow your money buying it.","review":"As a long time reader of Coulter's books, I expected a lot more than what this book delivered. First off, the dialogue was really strange--almost like Coulter herself didn't write it. In her past books she has been pretty good at characterization, but in this book, the characters were stilted, wooden and totally unbelievable as was the plot and the twists. The ending of the story line made absolutely no sense to the rest of the book. The characters--Ben and Callie had so little chemistry between them that it was almost painful when they finally hooked up! My advice to anyone contemplating a purchase of Blow Out - is don't blow your money on buying the book--look at how uniformly bad these reviews are and then either skip reading it all together, or go to the library and check it out! This is not a book you will want to keep in your personal library. It is really , really bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.....just awful.","review":"This is the most poorly written professionally printed book I have ever encountered: no character development, dismal plot, completely disconnected subplot, poorly researched.....and hands down the worst dialogue in the history of mankind. To call this book sophomoric is to insult every barely literate, socially promoted high school sophomore in our country. I read Robert Crais, Dennis Lehane, Michael Connelly, Tony Hillerman, James Lee Burke, Lee Child.....so I am not some literary snob. I even read cereal boxes if there is nothing else. The fact that I finished this book makes me ashamed and leaves me wondering if I need a mystery-thriller 12 step program.

In this case \\"less\\" would have definitely been \\"more\\". I found the that the characters dialogue was stilted and boring and you never really felt like you got a grasp on each characters personality. I kept reading thinking that plot and characters had to come together and gel, but unfortunately they did not.

My original Mr. Machine (1963) went for yards before it wound down.As the packaging / advertising says, this is not a toy; it's a collectable replica and probably doesn't have a lot of play built into it.

I was happy with the price of $19.99 and thought that was a good deal, however I forgot to check the price of shipping, as I was in such a rush to get all of my Christmas shopping done. The total cost of the castle ended up being around $48, which was way over-priced. Unfortunately by the time I noticed how much shipping was it was too late, I had already paid.Another problem that I have is that the overall quality of the castle is very poor. Most of the parts (you have to put it together) did not fit together properly during assembly. The parts were warped or bent because the plastic used to make it was very thin, making it impossible to get them to stay together as they were supposed to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap piece of...","review":"Does the guy who gave this five stars work for the company?

At first, it was interesting with the time travel and her confusion with the whole thing. After that, tho, it just got old.

But for me the scariest part was when Clive Owen battled an \\"unsafe work environment\\".The cleverest moment should not be a twist that you can guess 20 minutes into the movie either. I won't say what that was because it could possibly spoil it for someone.After watching Intruders I had no idea what it was really supposed to be about. It seemed like they were borrowing pages from various classic Horror movie scripts... the Exorcist and maybe even the Ring (except instead of a video that makes the spirit attack it seems to be the act of telling a story about the ghost that gets you in trouble).I really wish movies would stop using animated ghouls and ghosts. When everybody else in the movie is being played by an actor it never looks right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uniquely Surprising!","review":"Let's just say that this movie may appear as one thing when you start watching it.

I felt that the acting wasn't anything special, with the exception of Clive Owen. Owen didn't belong in this film at all, he was basically over-acting the movie. He deserves to be in well written films, unlike this one. The director wasn't bad, yet he wasn't amazing. Some cool shots, but yet again not enough to save the movie.

For me this is so far the most helpful textbook on the subject that i've found. Luke Timothy Johnson's The Writings of The New Testament is also very well done and useful and is similar to this book.

I am hoping that when Andy watches this movie now, he regrets it. That would be the only thing that would help me get past his references to oral sex, constant arousal and viagra. He encourages his grandson to forsake chasing after one-night stands and to look for \\"companionship\\". But by the end of the movie they've switched places and basically what Andy is looking for is sex NOT companionship. Poorly written, terribly acted (except for some early scenes with Andy) and pathetically casted. I can't believe the freaky \\"ice cream man\\" (C-flick horror movie) is cast as the leads father. Truly-NO one else must have wanted to act in this mess of a film.Yuck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pair of stockings","review":"This is the first pair of graduated stockings that have worked for me. I have problems bending so getting these stockings on and off isn't the easiest thing in the world to do. The material that this particular pair is made of seems to be more durable and breathable than others that I have tried. When I go to take them off, they don't cling to my leg as much. Others seem to have almost a rubbery cling when trying to remove.

Characters were introduced or slightly beginning to develop, and then they were killed off. Even the ones that survived, I didn't care about. Heck, I wanted the Minotaur to make it. The characters seemed weak, and the Minotaur was the only one who I felt sorry for, being born and then trapped away."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a stinker.","review":"Even Tom hardy himself says this movie is a stinker.

Sci-Fi has become notorious for its shlocky $1 million dollar productions and wooden acting, and \\"fans\\" turn their nose up at anything they offer. Thankfully this isn't one of those films. With a budget of $7 million and high caliber actors (Tony Todd, Tom Hardy, Rutger Hauer, and Ingrid Pitt), and a fairly tight and enjoyable script, this was always intended as a theatrical feature. Unfortunately distributors Lionsgate felt that Americans wouldn't know anything of the Greek myth, and they dumped it on Sci-Fi. Ingrid was very good in her cameo role, but sadly her death scene was cut on the TV broadcast. Hopefully it features somewhere on the DVD. I urge everyone with an interest in Ingrid Pitt, the Minotaur legend, or Greek myths to give the film a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"How could I resist a movie starring Rutger Hauer and Ingrid Pitt? And based on the Minotaur legend, it sounded very interesting. And it's obvious that a lot of money and effort has gone into making the scenery. Unfortunately, that's the only good thing that can be said about the movie. It's a mystery how anyone could greenlight such a bad, incoherent screenplay. It starts out okay but goes downhill very quickly and after less than half an hour you're just hoping the movie will end soon. And for Mr. Hauer and Ms. Pitt, they don't have more than a couple of minutes of screen time. \\"Minotaur\\" is definately not worth wasting time and money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has anyone here reviewing actually seen the DVD?","review":"Amazon is not selling the movie as it was on TV, they are selling the DVD (which is R-rated). Nothing actually shown on Scify could get an R if it's life depended on it. SO, I'd love to see a review on the DVD itself and the film as on the DVD. But, I do not plan to be the first to buy it.Please resist reviewing DVD's based on the film as it showed on any station with advertisers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Done before","review":"The story is some rewrite of an ancient greek story of the minotaur.

A must in your book collection. The only part where the book could be better is in the textual descriptions, which are not very extensive. But well, you buy a book like this because it's a joy for the eye, so who really cares?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle, well written, first class SF","review":"Like several other reviewers I reread this recently after a gap of many years. My first reading was when I was too young to appreciate its deeper themes properly, but it nevertheless made enough of an impression that I've never forgotten it, I think just because it's very well written. Revisiting it I'm very impressed. I suppose it is \\"charming\\" as one reviewer has it, in a sense; but there's a dark undercurrent to the charm - good and admirable people do terrible things. For that matter, the \\"Rite of Passage\\" itself is frequently fatal...This probably deserves a place as one of the top dozen or so SF novels. It is in no sense a \\"children's novel\\" if that means \\"unsuitable for adults\\", but the ideal reader would probably be a thoughtful adolescent (like the heroine)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"Rite of Passage is a wonderful story about a society on a space ship and how their teens are raised.

Up there with \\"The Door into Summer\\"","review":"I have worn out at least two copies over the last 30+ years. I have trouble accepting that it's out of print so it's one that doesn't get loaned out. What an absolute waste of a SF classic. If you have read Heinlein's \\"The Door into Summer\\" you'll love this... when you finish you'll want to start it all over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is this book out of print?? Publisher, wake up!!!","review":"This may be the best coming of age book ever published--certainly it is the least sexist. Not only did I (female) love it as an adult, both my teenage sons loved it, and have now tracked down their own copies in used book stores. It follows the heroine during her society's training for and entering their rite of passage (they are a space colony; at age 14 children must spend several weeks on a human colonized planet and survive. Many do not.), but in the process you really see the heroine grow up. Interesting issues of sustainable growth are indirectly raised, as well as those of personal responsibility. It's extremely readable. It's a great present for anyone from age 11 or 12 on. I STRONGLY recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time, paper, effort","review":"I hated so many things about this book and found zero redeeming qualities.

It is for anyone seeking to understand life."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't pass Trial","review":"Rite Of Passage is the story of a young girl in a future spaceship getting ready for \\"Trial\\", which is something of a space Bar Mitzvah, albeit manyfold dangerous. There are some interesting points in the novel: a fast pace, a refreshing first person POV, along with some poignant fables the heroes come up with. There is also a nod (but just a nod) to philosophy. However, what really spoils this book is the Trial itself. Suddenly, it seems like Mr. Panshin passed his writing torch to Harry Harrison to create 30 or 40 DeathWorld like pages. And while Harrison's characters justify suspension of disbelief, Panshin's 14 year olds going around, blowing up army bases in a totalitarian society is unbelievable as well as unacceptable. 1968 crop must have been pretty poor for this to win the Nebula."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"These speakers have great sound when pluged into you pc with the usb.

What happened to the dreamscape, melodic trance from this early decade?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Longer Trance, and a long trip from what it used to be","review":"With a title like \\"From Trance to Progressive\\" you would believe that the songs on this CD would take the flowing euphoric/melodic trance that made the previous works great and add to it with more progressive sounds. Sadly, on this album progressive seems to mean one-hit \\"trance-pop\\" wonders like dogzilla, with catchy vocal tracks, a repeated chorus, and unnecessary breakdowns instead of melodies. Fans of Armin Van Buuren's weekly radio show A State of Trance will probably enjoy this CD, but any fans of the older A Trip in Trance compilations will find it shallow and wanting."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good CD","review":"The first 4 songs are very good and the rest of the album aint bad. I don't have time to go into detail. You get 17 songs and most are good. It is much better than in trance 4.

I loved this book. There were always twists and turns that kept you pulled into the book. I love his style of writing. He gives lots of details but he makes those details interesting. You don't want to skim through those filler details like most books. It makes the books I have read in the last year or so pale in comparison. I have subsquently bought 8 more of his books and have them stacked to read.As a Mississippian, I think his books are ten times better than John Grisham (another Ole Miss alumni)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great iles thriller","review":"I guess I have read his books in backwards order, but they never fail to disappoint....Another great read....Greg Iles has rapidly become one of my favorite authors...."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book gave me nightmares","review":"I've read plenty of books, none however that grab me the way Iles books do. I've read each of his books, and none of them have lasted longer than four days in my hands. In Mortal Fear he creates a character, with amazing development, that scared me so badly, I had nightmares about this guy. When and if you read it, you will demand to be left alone for the last hundred pages or so, just struggling to get through it. You will constantly tell yourself to stop reading, but you will be unable to do so. It is incredible.Iles is a terrific author, writing about Nazi Germany, racial tensions in the south, on-line stalkers, and kidnapping. I could argue for hours over which is his best book, Spandau Phoenix, Mortal Fear, or The Quiet Game, without ever coming to a conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING!!!!","review":"Rarely do you come across a book as good as this one. You just can't help but like Harper Cole. I didn't even bother trying to read anything for a couple of days after reading this one because I knew anything would pale in comparison. I went out and bought Mr. Iles other two books even though the subject matter isn't what I usually read. I hope your next one is a psychological thriller too. CANNOT WAIT!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like rolling thunder, it just keeps going and building","review":"I listened to this as a book on tape. It was amazing how the plot was laid out quickly yet it kept moving. You really wanted to know what was about to happen in the subplots and Mr. Iles wove in and out of the subplots so quickly and smoothly that you never minded leaving a point as new information was revealed. Hard to explain but the best advice is that you will not want to put this down. I know I ended up having to walk around the house with my walkman (when I could not get a reason to drive around) just to keep listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible thriller","review":"This was my first time reading a book from Greg Iles. Mortal Fear is a great thriller full of action, I couldn't stop reading it. It didn't take me very long to finish it neither. What a genius to come with a story like this one. Greg Iles definitely caught my attention and curiosity on this one, I will be reading his books in the future for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riviting...could not read the passages fast enough!","review":"This was the first Greg Iles novel I've read and I must say that his books will join others in my highest category of excellent reading.

Loved it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put this one down!","review":"This book was so full of twists that I could hardly put it down.

I pulled an all-nighter with this great read. The suspense was palpable and the plot was intriguing. This is the first of Iles' books I have read and I will definitely read more! His antagonsit was the serial killer from hell and brilliant to boot! I was stumped all the way to the end! Fabulous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mortal Fear a Winner!","review":"Completely unlike his former two outings, Greg Iles has hita home run with Mortal Fear. A techno-thriller par excellence, this is one you will not be able to put down. From the cotton fields of the Mississippi Delta Greg Iles weaves a riveting tale about the rancid underbelly of a sexual oriented bulletin board system and those who would use it to further their own strange agendas. A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Greg Iles, could not like the main character","review":"I am a Greg Iles fan but was sorely disappointed with this one. I could neither like nor identify with the central character and had almost no interest in the plot, which did not keep me on edge like Iles books normally do. Iles did a terrible job of keeping the sub-plots together with the plot on this one - I looked at the date published and thought: this must have been an earlier work, therefore he is forgiven but I consider this one a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My first and last","review":"I can't believe the number of four star reviews. Iles is probagbly the most in love with his own words of any author I have ever read. Boring, long winded, over done and loaded with technical errors. I read the first 30% and then the last ten and barely made it through. Maybe if I were into kinky sex"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Couldn't put it down.","review":"Greg Isles is for real. I've now read five of his novels, and they're all well-written page turners. Mortal Fear involves a serial murderer who is being sought by the authorities and two very interesting and uniquely capable civilians. Don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book...","review":"I enjoyed this book. It's very graphic - perhaps too graphic, but still a page-turner. A similar book that gives a better psychological perspective on a serial killer's motivations, I would recommend Morton Bain's Psychopath!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting!","review":"Greg Iges books are always good! There are some slow parts but lots of section you are on the edge of your seat waiting to read what happens. I have loved all his books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Below the gripping standard","review":"This story doesn't measure up to Greg Iles standard. I got the impression he added fluff to meet a word/page count. I found myself scanning without losing content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Drawn Characters And A Smart Plot","review":"Sometimes it's the story. Sometimes it's the writing, and sometimes it's the characters. It's the main character, Harper Cole, that makes this book an easy read. The story and the writing are there too, but it was Harper that kept me reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Drivel - Long and Boring - Crap","review":"Hardcover is 563 pages. This whole story could probably been written in 100 pages and been a short story. It is full of nonsensical details and really lacking of a crisp story line. I found as it droned on that I could skim perhaps 10 pages at a time and not loose the story line (which was silly to start with).And oh my, was it really needed to write every back and forth as they traded instant messages on EROS.The best part of the book takes place in the last 30 or so pages. But to tell you the truth, the best part for me when when I closed the back cover and said thank god it's over.I really enjoy Greg Iles, but this one is a real stinker.I have no idea how some people can rate this book a five, they must have either a very sortid taste, or just want to see themselves in writen form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I find it hard to swallow that anyone would pay $1000 int. fee and a $500 monthly fee for a porn website.

I could not finish this book. I didn't care about the characters and even the story line didn't tempt me.I read at least four books a week and can't remember the last time I put a book down without finishing it! I've also deleted all the other Iles book's on my wish list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Barely Finish","review":"This book is awful. Apparantly there are a lot of people who have a high tolerance for the unreadable. It is boring and poorly written. You will not care about any of the characters. The 'Big Secret' is so inane that you will be insulted by the fact that you are supposed to care. Trust me...I read lots of books, and this is definitely one to pass on. DO NOT waste your time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"another good read","review":"This is the second book by Iles I have read, the first being Black Cross. While this effort does not come close to being in the same league as that book, it is quite a good, stimulating read. It is written in the first person, which can take some time to get used to.Iles tries to add flourishing touches of human emotions into the book's sub-story, but the characters are mostly shells. Thomas H Cook is quite good at this, and I wonder if Black Cross was written after Mortal Fear, because Iles' characters in that book were much better.This is a long book, but reads quickly. It is not really a true serial murder mystery because the killer does not fit into that mold, but it does have some interesting plot twists and suspense.While it is no Red Dragon or Silence, it is fun to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"mortal fear","review":"I could not deal with the fuzzy type interspersed throughout this book. Select a standard type style and stick with it. Italics are OK ocassionally but these eyes rebelled to the point I stopped the book and asked a friend to try it.He had the same complaint! Next time I encounter this style I will return the book for a full refund.As for the story, I will never know if it was any good.Other books I have read by the same author I liked very much.That includes Black Cross and Spandau Phoenix; they were great reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dark novel","review":"This is what one of my friends would call a slasher novel. It is a fictional story of a serial killer. It is not for the faint at heart. The killer has invaded an adult Internet forum to search for his victims. He is obsessed and wants to be a God. It becomes a deadly game of wits between the killer, the company's sysops, and the police. Victims are mutilated and it becomes clear that the killer is harvesting a body part.The sysops' personal lives are dragged into the investigation, and their own dark secrets come to the surface as they attempt to trap the killer. In some respects they are not overly bright (looking through a glass window when you expect something inside to explode? Isn't that a little numb-brained?)The novel is a little long because of long conversations between characters. The white hats win, more or less, but there is a lot of collateral damage. It has strong sexual content and violence. I would give it an R rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a Greg Iles fan but....","review":"Jeepers, this was a hard book to stick with. It is not that there was not plenty of action. Iles never disappoints in that area. It just did not make a lot of sense and the characters were not believable. I have read all of Iles early works, then sort of got away from him. This book did not encourage me to find any others."},{"rating":"2","title":"well written thriller","review":"Harper Cole is a system operator of a erotic on-line network. People log on to air their most secret fantasies and desires. He begins to worry when he notices that some accounts that were heavily used suddenly go dead and asks the police to check on the users. They turn up dead.With the police, psych doctors and friends in tow, Harper is out to catch the killer, using his own family as lures.I didn't really get into this story as other reviewers did, the characters didn't jump out and become real to me. The storyline was interesting though, for those who enjoy a thriller with something a little different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally painful","review":"I read only one other Greg Isles mystery, 24 Hours, and it was fabulous--I was listening to it and nearly missed my exit. But this one? What a waste of pen and ink (and the narrator's breath, as I had selected the audio version).

A+ in my book =0)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mortal Fear","review":"Greg Iles is an original effective writer that not only grabs your attention on the first page but keeps you enthralled through the entire reading. His charactors have distinct complex lives that revolve around a plot that becomes more complex as each chapter evolves. Until the last few chapters, you are still guessing as to whom the criminal is. Few authors have this ability to twist plots and create believable charactors as Greg Iles does. I consider \\"Mortal Fear\\" his best but each of his books are distinctive and enjoyable. I highly suggest reading \\"The Quiet Game\\" next.

Unfortunately that means stuff goes under furniture and your truly has to fish it out. I saw this and thought it would be perfect and the reviews were glowing.Sadly, the glowing reviews do not reflect my experience. My cat rubbed against the catnip mouse for a couple minutes, then briefly batted one of the track balls. When the ball didn't roll away, but remained in the track, he got bored and turned away. I put it away and got it out a couple days later. He was even more bored with it than the first time.If you have a cat that enjoys unpredictable playthings, I don't think this is a great toy, even tho it is colorful and well-made.As an alternate, I suggest the Kong toy with feathers.

Yet, longevity as a play toyhas been impressive, over a year now and still has appeal.I write this with one caveat, the toy on top will be chewed off by aggressive chewing.

He loves and I like it just as much because I don't have to worry about being a nuisance."},{"rating":"2","title":"my cats enjoy this a great deal","review":"My cats tire of toys quickly but they have remained fairly interested in this toy over the last several months. They love batting the elevated mouse and moving the interior balls. I placed several additional balls inside the track that they can actually remove and they enjoy this a lot. I have the toy in the basement because it actually makes considerable noise while they are playing with it. I've seen other track toys with relatively sharp edges but this one is nicely made and doesn't have any sharp edges. It's a good toy to keep your cat occupied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat toy for active kitty","review":"New kitty loved it and caught on to the game easily. Lots of action. Would buy again. Older cats were bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"tried two cats, no dice","review":"Tried this on two cats in different houses. Both of them looked at it, looked at me, looked at it, hit the ball, looked at me, looked at it, looked at me, and said, \\"WTF?\\" and walked away, never to touch it again. Enough said. YMMV but for me, waste of money. I tried to find it cheaper at Big Lots like another reviewer said but could not so $14 down the drain. Too much hassle to return."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 cats say YAWN","review":"I got this toy based on the good reviews here despite the fact that I think it looks like an awful, ugly baby toy and is not only an eyesore in my living room but I'm sure the fact that it's yellow and blue and a number of other colors in VERY BRIGHT shades is completely lost on my cats. So, I tried it out on four different cats, from ages 10 months to 14 years and while their eyes would track it while *I* used it, that's not exactly the result I was looking for. My cats go crazy for Da Bird, the Cat Catcher and hand-held laser toys and they love to chase each other around for a couple hours a day, but this toy was a complete yawn for them. I even left it out for a few months hoping they'd suddenly \\"discover\\" it one day, but no such luck. So, I tried to sell it at a yard sale but no-one was even slightly interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cats aren't impressed.","review":"Set this out for the cats and they have no interest in it whatsoever. eh.

Takes a few seconds, and you're done! It takes up very little space for so much fun! My two 15 week old kittens like the ball games,and even though they don't bother much with the mouse on top, there's plenty to play with here. One advantage to this type of toy is that the balls are contained and will not get lost behind furniture. 5 meows!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unsafe","review":"these shields would become airway obstructions in use since they fall apart when opened. i returned them a few weeks ago and have not heard anything back from the company - no returned money either."},{"rating":"1","title":"CPR Shield Barrier","review":"I bought these to add to First Aid Kits at a school. The barrier is a thick plastic sheet with a hard plastic insert in the middle. Right out of the package, part of the plastic sheet is cracked at a fold. The insert is not a one-way valve, but does contain a filter. The lower portion of the insert is about 1 1/4\\" x 1 1/3\\" x 1/3\\" and is intended to be placed between the victim's teeth during CPR. On an adult this might work, but could cause delay placing the insert properly. My main concern would be in using this in a child's mouth, which would have more difficulty fitting between the teeth, and could also push back on the tongue. Overall, this is an inexpensive barrier that might work for adults, but a different design might be considered for all uses, especially for children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use","review":"I bought these, at first, thinking they would be useful in the car, and in my purse. But then I find these are to be used for CPR manaquins. Even at that, I found them difficult to use in a class with the manquins. I didn't think they were worth the money. The one-way valve resuscitator masks are much better and safer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psmith in Another City - Rupert Comes to NYC","review":"\\"Psmith Journalist\\" is the third Psmith novel and finds the hero cavorting in the New York City of 1914, as he unilaterally takes over a weekly newpaper, runs afoul of politicians and gangsters, and consorts with other gangsters to arrange for his protection. This sounds rather grim but actually Psmith continues to delight us with his humorous language and indomitable aplomb. As with the other early novels the final plot resolution is rather weak but not without being preceded by a hundred-odd pages of hilarious dialog and action. Moreover, the book provides a fascinating glimpse into the New York of a distant year, with which the author was intimately familiar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audiobook is a real let-down","review":"Maybe I've had an overdose of Wodehouse lately, having read Piccadilly Jim, Biffen's Millions, Plum Pie, and this book practically in a row, but I was simply not entertained by Psmith Journalist at all.Perhaps it was Jonathan Cecil's reading (and I know that had a lot to do with it). His characterizations are indistinguishable and his attempt at an American accent is laughable (if you have heard any Monty Python, you'll recognize it).But I think that could have been overlooked (or overlistened?) if the story had grabbed me. It seemed to be about Psmith taking over a New York rag and making it into a scandal sheet, involving a boxer somewhere along the way, but I can't be sure. I just didn't care, and I found nothing funny at all.There is nothing to offer the casual Wodehouse fan in this novel. However, I will read his work again, as he has so much to offer in other books.But I really think it's mainly Jonathan Cecil's fault."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong cover!","review":"I must confess I have not bought or read this book but I was astonished when browsing through Amazon.com I came across it. The publishers have chosen for its cover a portrait of Spanish novelist Benito Pérez Galdós, as painted by the great Joaquín Sorolla! I do not know about people outside the Spanish cultural mainstream, but I believe that a book about the laughable adventures of a semi auto-biographical journalist would be better introduced by a picture of Wodehouse himself, and not by the image of one of Spain's most thoughful and profound writers of all time. A shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally disappointing","review":"I ordered this metal detector on 11/16 and received an email that it had shipped on the same day. Then when I hadn't received a couple of weeks later, I sent an email to the company.

They have an amazing amount of talent. However, this album has fallen short of their greatness. The first song is remenisent of \\"The Distance to Here\\", but you'll find out very quickly that this album lacks LIVE's creative song writing ability, and falls short of portraying their amazing talant. If you're a hardcore fan, I would buy the album, but don't expect greatness because it just isn't there."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it...","review":"I'm very surprised to read how people are praising this album. I've listened to it many times since buying it and the album in general is simply... plain. There are no memorable tunes or guitar riffs, no catchy lyrics or melodies to pull you in. Tracks 1 and 5 are decent tunes, but that's about it. The previous album \\"V\\" at least had some fire in it. This album is very monotone and in some cases boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the last two....","review":"With Birds of Pray Live are almost back to their best. The songs reflect the fact that the band members have grown up, and so don't contain the dark, brooding energy of Throwing Copper. The music is similar to Throwing Copper, but generally relatively upbeat and uplifting. All in all a good album, with good songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Live","review":"Over their past few albums, Live has been experimental with what their sound is like. Mental Jewlery sounds nothing like Throwing Copper, or Secret Samadhi.I see Birds of Pray as being the \\"Best of Live\\" CD. It may not have the exact songs, but it contains in itself a variety of sounds from all of their CDs.\\"Bring People Together\\" is reminiscent of Mental Jewlery,\\"Heaven\\" is more like a Throwing Copper song,\\"Sanctity\\" is a lot like a Secret Samadhi Song,\\"What are we fighting for?\\" fits with the spiritual theme in Distance to Here,Lastly, \\"She\\" fits with the V theme.It is the best sounds of Live. It describes who Live is in one CD. It, to say the least, the Biography of one of the most under-appreciated bands. This CD has potential, and hopefully Live will get the recognition they have deserved for so long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Letdown","review":"I love LIVE and have since their first cd.

No relation!","review":"For quite a while, a rumor has been perpetuated, linking the length of Ed's hair to the success of the latest Live CD. He sported long locks for the masterpiece \\"Throwing Copper\\", had a shorter 'do for \\"V\\" (underrated but enjoyable), and now has done the thing he wouldn't do for the \\"I Alone\\" video...he's gone and shaved his head. Still, the shoring of the hair doesn't affect \\"Birds of Pray\\".I bought this CD solely on the strength of \\"Heaven\\". I saw it in video form on TV...and was floored. In my humble opinion, the entire CD lives up to the standard of the first single, with other truly notable and stand-out songs being \\"Like I Do\\", \\"She\\", and \\"The Sanctity of Dreams\\". I bought this CD and a book today, put on my headphones, popped it into my CD player, and had a very enjoyable time reading while listening to it twice through. I'd recommend it to anyone out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"I am a big Live fan who is actually one of the few who loved their last album V.

Athough thngs are flowing fairly normal, with the songs all finishing within 3 minutes with big catchy chorus, but then song 6 comes along along and hits u in the face, and you sit up wanting to hear it again, and it only gets better from there with song 12 as close to stage thereve ever done.Why it doesnt get 5 stars, again is its just short, although theres 13 songs many are into the first chorus by the 30sec join, and most follow the same kinda structure, although theres enough here to be a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD!","review":"What a great CD!

To me, Throwing Copper is a classic alternative rock album, and is still one of my favorites. In the past few years, they have veered off course -- Distance to Here was not the worst I have listened to, but is was mostly forgettable, and after hearing some of V, I never even bought it. I am happy to say that while Birds of Pray comes nowhere near Copper, it is a solid effort with a number of defining tracks. Live has returned to a more simple delivery, relying on what made them such a success in the first place.I will say that the lyrics don't have the same mysterious quality that used to make Live so much fun -- Ed seems to be a lot happier these days. But this does not distract from a very listenable disc that will please fans of the band, even though it won't totally blow them away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Live","review":"If I had to compare each Live CD with ... uh..., oh well, here's my verdict:Throwing Copper: a baseball batSecret Samahdi: a Shaman's dreamThe Distance to Here: a walk on on the cloudsV: a sweaty thongBirds of Pray: sweet releaseShort, ephimerous, but sweet! This disc, melodically, is amazing. Sweet melodies all around. I just hate the fact that they cease to amaze you in such a short time. You get USED to the melodies. But they're sweet.

Secondly, the book would be much better if it also gave answers for the even numbered problems (even if it was just a simple answer with no work). However, the book does give much more detailed answers (works the questions out, step-by-step) to the odd questions than can be found in the back of the textbook.

This book was on the 10th grade reading list and I can honestly say that I thoroughly disliked it from start to finish. It gets two stars for the language, metaphors, and descriptions within it, but nothing more.This book is based entirely on trying to get an emotion out of the reader, which in this case is sympathy. I find sentimental writing to be very poor and I just can't get into it, but to each his own. I wouldn't object to anyone wanting to read this book as their personal tastes might allow them to squeeze some enjoyment from it but I would never go so far as to reccomend it to anybody.Don't get me wrong. The language used throughout the novel as well as the change in perspective is a breath of fresh air compared to the meat of story itself. My belief is that the only reason this book ended is because the author could not think of any other tragic events that could occur.--tim"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too depressing","review":"I understand that they faced hardships, but after the fifth episode of 'all we had was rice water' I was quite tired of this book. It is so depressing! I had to read this for school and I am a sci-fi/fantasy fan, so maybe that is why I didn't like it so much.I found the storyline to be minimal, and I would leave the book feeling depressed and sad. That's not the way I want to feel when I am reading a book.Seriously, the book droned on about the hardships they faced, and I could barely find a spot that was remotely happy. I want to know about the good things in India! Right now I think of it as a poverty stricken wasteland when there is obviously much more to it than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I read this for an Intro in Indian Civilization class. It is a very good narrative, and I could not put it down. It describes bascially the life of an Indian woman from the time she gets married, and then it goes a full circle until the woman finds herself, essentially alone with no husband, at the same place she first lived after getting married.One of the themes of the book is modernity and its affects on an Indian village and Indian family.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sad story","review":"Rukhmani's story is a sad one that continues to be true in India today. Infant mortality is very high due to poor healthcare and starvation. Women in India have a shorter lifespan then men, Ruku's story shows why all these sad statistics are true.A note about the caste system. It is an inseparable part of India and Hinduism (not a proud part either). One is born into a caste and cannot change it by switching occupations as a previous reviewer has mentioned. The caste system is much more complicated than you're a priest, warrior, merchant or farmer. Being born into a \\"low\\" caste does not mean one is automatically consigned to drudgery and poverty and being a \\"high\\" caste does not guarantee wealth. In this book, Ruku is married to a poor man but he is of the same caste as her (intercaste marriage at the time would have guaranteed social ostracization)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An affirmation of personal values","review":"Something happens to you when you read this book. It seems natural to take a close look into your own life. You imagine how one woman like Rukmani can take on all the suffering day after day, year after year. Rukmani is a woman that you wish you could be more like but fear the result of it. One can not imagine a life like Rukmani without reflecting and wondering... \\"What do I have to be unhappy about?\\" It is an affirmation that we can learn from others and that what is important in our own lives, is in fact the nectar!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what else can happen?","review":"some people don't believe in luck but after you read this book you will believe in bad luck. the things our main character goes through becomes to much by the middle of the story for anyone to believe. if you don't like exageration like myself you won't really enjoy this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dullsville","review":"THIS BOOKS GETS TWO STARS.This book is very boring, however the information given by the author on the lifestyle, and the hardships is a little bit interesting.

It was assigned reading for an College English class - Women Writer's of India. I am so glad that it was assigned or I would have never had a chance to read it.

This book will do that for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A depressing yet true story of life's hardships","review":"This book was very good. It provides a look at a world which we cannot relate to. A world where everyday is a struggle to survive. It also teaches us not to take what we have for granted because there are others out there with literally nothing. I recommend this book as not only a incite into Indian life but a look at reality and life as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This was a book that was required for a World Religion class. I ended up enjoying it very much, and I have a much better sense of the culture and people of this region."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book to make you Cry","review":"Kamala Markandaya's novel of life in rural India is beautiful, as it is haunting. The story follows the life of a young woman who marries a farmer and lives through the trials and tribulations of a changing India. Enduring poverty, starvation, the death of one child, and the decent into prostitution of another, Rukmani somehow survives, her faith unwavering, her love for her husband and children her rock to hold onto in the days when food is scare and shelter but a mat on a roadside. Kamala's book is not about the tragedy of India; rather it is about the human spirit and how it survives against all odds. If you get a chance to read this book then do, it will probably change your life..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book","review":"Although I try to appreciate a lot of books that have absolutely no points of interest or a moral, this is without doubt the worst book I have ever read. The books ends tragically (The husband of Rukmani dying), with no reason to end it like that. The book itself has no moral, unless it's this: Don't live in India. I suggest people who want to read this book to find a better book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"As boring as Bush is stupid","review":"I was amazed at the extremity of the boredom I was forced to negotiate while attempting to slog through this book for Language Arts. Basically, the plot begins with someone getting married and then having lots of children in India. They go through the process of starving and then dying and then starving over and over again, making stupid decisions and having tragic events happen to them along the way. Because of the obvious pattern it followed, he book became extremely predictable and thus even more boring, which I didn't think was possible.In conclusion, some may contend that Nectar in a Sieve is a 'beautiful masterpiece illustrating the hardships of life in third world countries', but I think it would be better characterized as 'a huge waste of paper. Spend your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"An agglomeration of boring, plotless drivel.","review":"I had to read this book for school. To put it simply, it was a pain to get through, because just sitting down and thinking was more interesting than reading it.Nectar in a Sieve is about a poor peasant family in India that faces many hardships. Sounds boring? It is. More or less all the action can be summed up by saying, \\"they farmed, and sometimes the crops failed, so their daughter had to prostitute herself, then their sons left, then they went to the city because they got evicted from their land, then they went back home and that's the end of the book.\\" YESSIR THIS BOOK IS BORING!! DONT READ IT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"we get it already.","review":"Okay. You live in an impoverished country and you don't have enough rice. What else is new? We've heard this story a billion times and now it's really failing to move us.If this book shed more light on Indian culture and history, it'd be worthwhile, but it's just a book thrown onto high school core reading lists as part of the big plan to turn us all into culturally sensitive and politically correct zombiecitizens."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad book","review":"the book is horrible and easy to put down. i was told to read it for school. some of us started and hated it so after all the complaints about how horrible the book is we didn't have to read it and read frankenstien instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This book is gives you a direct view of India, and the hard times people have faced. I truly love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Experience Without an End","review":"Reading the novel, \\"Nectar in a Sieve\\" is an experience, but most likely not the one one would be looking for. Though it is easy reading and somewhat enjoyable, the plot of the story leaves much to be desired. Not only is the end of the novel left dangling without any form of conclusion, but even minor events throughout the story do not possess a sense of completion. The book, however, was very well written with incredible use of figurative language and was, though lacking closure, certainly a fine read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An emotional book that I will remember...","review":"The idea behind Nectar in a Sieve, by Kamala Markandaya is about a poor family that goes through many hardships. Nectar in a Sieve was one of the books that I was actually engaged in. Kamala Markandaya tells a wonderful storry about this family that got the short stick in life.I would definitely recommend Nectar in a Sieve because it is a book that hooked me. Also I became very conected to the characters. Kamala Markandaya did a wonderful job in telling this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"heartbreaking!","review":"More Americans should be exposed to stories like this one, to get some sense of what LIFE means to the majority of people on earth. For me personally, it is very difficult to imagine having to struggle so intensely for a handful of rice to survive. That kind of existence does seem incredibly tragic and the book portrays it as such. What really flies high in this novel however is the ending. The power of love overwhelms everything. I still cry thinking about it! I'll never forget this book and I recommend it to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indian women struggles in modern day India.","review":"This book although interesting in theory is nothing more than a nonsenseical account of a poor indian women. Boring and confusing, this book even though it seems a short read takes more time and effort that most people wish to give. If you are looking for a fun easy book with an uplifting spirit, try Chicken Soup for the Soul. If you want a depressing story of a women who just can get ahead try this. But check it out, it's not worth the buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book so much, it was very boring and slow.","review":"I thought that the plot of this book was very slow.

I mean, come one, one can only take SO much doom and gloom in one book. This is not an emotional roller coaster, as someone else put it. This is an emotional slide down the stairs-- you drop, level out a bit, drop again, level out again, etc. The whole book is one long whining, ... complaint about Rukmani's hardships. ... Rukmani is the most depressingly INactive character I have ever come across, and I read a LOT. She just sits and lets things happen to her, then moans and ... about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful!","review":"This is the worst book that I have ever read!

A definite read for those interested in finding out more about Indian life in the early 1900's."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book forced me to think about the unfairness of life.","review":"I felt a great sadness upon finishing this book. I was not sure whether to cheer for Rukmani or pity her. She worked with what she had, and moved on. She did what she had to do and displayed remarkable strength and dignity. Life handed her more adversity than she deserved and still she persevered. There was no time for regret or compunction because survival took precedence over everything. Her tenacity caused me to look inward at myself, to analyze whether I too possessed this kind of quiet strength. This book brought home to me what women across the world deal with every day. This has affirmed my belief that women are the strongest creatures on earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless and beautiful story of value to anyone serious about growing up","review":"To live in another country, to live in another person's skin.

The family experiences unspeakable tragedy as a late monsoon and one son's involvement in labor organizing catapults them even deeper into poverty. It catalogues the absolute vulnerability of the poor in traditional society transitioning towards industrialization, and the anguish of losing everything for people who have almost nothing.

He changed with the team and with the game, constantly staying one step ahead and anticipating and filling the need on the Cowboys.He doesn't just tell us that he overcame a serious leg injury. He tells us how he overcame it, what goals he had and what his thought process was. It was fascinating to read how he viewed things.Often times the best sports stories are told by players who weren't huge stars. Bates was on a team of huge stars, but he certainly had his moments to shine and he candidly shares these moments with us.This is an interesting book, covering and balancing his personallife with his professional life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing look at the liturgy","review":"I recommend the reading of \\"For the Life of the World: Sacraments and Orthodoxy\\" by Alexander Schmemann.

It's a good thing David Mills has set us all straight about everything from the police, to chiropractors, to schools, to God. My question is, why did he feel the need to write this book? It reads like a teenager going through their rebellious stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severely Disappointed","review":"I am thankful that Mr. Mills does not classify himself as an expert. His views, while seemingly unique, fall in line with what he seems to like to avoid, conformity. Only his conformity is not to a fundamentalist regime, but to an untra beyond liberal regime instead. I am highly dissappointed that a father could relay such pessimism and unrealism to the world (or at least the small one that reads this book) and lead a child into beliefs that will lead her hopeless. While many atheists have non-religious morality, Mr. Mills apparently needs to grow in this area. His proud writing leaves much to be desired. I am highly disappointed that I wasted my time reading this book- thankfully, I did it for free on his website."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oklahoma Sooner Hooded Towel","review":"Excellent quality hooded towel.

The plot was mediocre at best and all the characters are not at all representative of those working at a true computer corporation. No one that looks like Rachel Leigh Cook or Ryan Phillippe and works with computers. Those actors are best suited for the teen drama or love or whatever movies, one of them would be alright, but all of them being a bunch of pretty teens? Not really plausible.This movie is a little too straightfoward and but the ending oh thats the killer! This movie is way too outrageous, but its filled with colorful sets and a bunch of geeks having fun in the office.

The stroy line is loosely based on events of the past few years in the computer industry. All this is great. But when the movie tries to protray the argument between the 'open source' / high priced software, the 'open source' good guys win. But somehow the 'high priced' software guys made a better case - putting some of the earnings back into development sounds a lot better than the 'knowledge belongs to mankind' ideology of the open source camp in the movie..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice movie, though the acting is lacking...","review":"What I said is true, the acting is lacking, and the direction is dry, but the plot is pretty nice, in my opinion.I won't go into detail, as that is in other reviews, and in the editorial.I will say however the soundtrack (which is not seperately sold, though cited in the movie) was good. And also the message about open-source, and the reality and integrity of the technical elements in the movie made it enjoyable for me (an open-source advocate, and programmer)."},{"rating":"2","title":"great great great!","review":"this movie was wonderful. i'm a computer nerd and when i saw it in the theatre with friends and at the beginning they were scrolling code across the screen, leaned over and was like, 'i know what most of that means!' :)anyways, this nice little movie starring cutie ryan phillippe is wonderful in many aspects. first off it's semi-realistic. ok, murdering people to steal their codes is a little off the deep end...but people have murdered to get other things...so why not?it's got a little bit of romance, deception, action, and mystery. all the people that are against milo (phillippe) the most surprising one to me was rachael leigh cook (even though in retrospect it should have been obvious). Although having the security guy end up being an alli of milo's was even stranger.so, overall, i think this is one of phillippe's best movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great technological thriller!","review":"This movie is fantastic.

I would recommend it to everyone, whether they're computer geeks or not. Before I saw this movie, I knew nothing about Open Source. It's actually really cool, and the Open Source Development Network is devoted to all that kind of stuff. With a great plot and great characters, I gave this movie 5 stars. I now own it on DVD, which doesn't have a lot of special features, but does have 6 or 7 deleted scenes, which I always like to watch. Buy this movie! I'm sure you'll love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FAMOUS actors in a BAD movie","review":"This seems like it's gonna be cool with Ryan Phillippe, Claire Forlani, Rachael Leigh Cook, Tim Robbins, and so forth, but it turned out to be very bland. I feel asleep on it. Save your money for a more interesting movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad science fiction, but interesting for historical reasons","review":"The idea of this film is that Bill Gates is secretly murdering young open-source and Linux programmers. The DVD ends with commentary by the director about how software should be open and free. The DVD begins with an FBI copyright warning. Think about it...It's bad science fiction, but historically interesting because it was produced with the help of SUN Microsystem, to help make their most hated competator look bad in the public eye. A snapshot into the greed and machinations of a contentious industry, timed to coincide with the antitrust trial of Microsoft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent the real-deal instead","review":"The only reason to watch this film is to see Tim Robbins as a dead-ringer for Bill Gates. It sure as heck isn't to see Ryan Philippe. I watched one of the featurettes and laughed because of how proud the filmmakers were that they bothered to use real code in the split-second scenes where you see the screen as the characters type furiously. Who cares?If you want to see what the war to find the next great techno-innovation was really like, watch \\"Pirates of Silicon Valley. This docu-drama concerns the very real industrial espionage on all sides that went into creating the first PCs. Bill Gates does the most and of course comes out on top.

I'm really becoming a huge fan of Ryan Phillippe. His performance in I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER was spectacular. His performance in ANTITRUST is just as good. Always have to love Tim Robbins. The two have good chemistry.Ryan Phillippe plays a computer-science major who is graduating from Stanford as one of the top-15 programmers in the world. Tim Robbins (playing a Bill Gates-esque character) spins a web as the BLACK WIDOW of silicon valley to entice, manipulate and force Ryan Phillipe's character to create the greatest communications network in the world.Check your sensibilities of the possible...and you will find yourself enjoying this fast-paced flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic casting","review":"What pathetic casting. My first comment when I saw Claire Forlani cast as the love interest was \\"Hello. Way too old to be dating a just graduated hacker geek\\". So of course she was the bad girl working for the bad guys. If they had cast Rachel Leigh Cook as the love interest then maybe it would have been a surprise what her character was really about. Jeez, who was the casting agent for this movie?? Horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sleazy slam at a software giant","review":"A one star rating is much too high. I wish I could give this film negative stars, because that's what it deserves. This flick exploits a popular notion that the only way a company can succeed brilliantly is by indulging in nefarious activities.

And the reviewer who says it is a \\"veiled\\" shot at Microsoft might want to read the paper a little more. The entire movie is a shot at Microsoft.

Now that is really silly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hacker Hooey","review":"This was a paycheck movie if ever there was one. Why else would Tim Robbins do a film like this?

I bought this at Wal-mart for the (seemingly) low price of $39.99. A camera that you can't function isn't a deal at any price.

When I tried the website that's recommended in the manual, I was sent instead to a home page that didn't have any support for the model number ( 57490 ). They had lots of other models, but not this one. Apparently people have had trouble downloading pictures more than once, but I didn't even get that far. Luckily I was able to return it, but online purchases aren't as easy to remedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst camera!","review":"DO NOT BUY!!! Against my recommendation, my six-year old daughter bought this camera from Wal-Mart with her allowance. The LCD screen is so horrible that you can barely tell what you just took a picture of. There is no optical or digital zoom, so you have to move to get the picture, and I swear there is no focus or image stabilization on this camera, because when we downloaded them to the computer, all 50 or so pictures she took were blurry.

It is a piece of complete and utterly worthless JUNK. I bought it for my 7-year old for Christmas. The quality of the pictures it takes (that is, when it is actually working correctly, which was RARE!) is simply awful! The pictures are so horribly grainy that you cannot even discern who is in the image. It seemed like a great deal and a good price for an inexpensive camera for a kid - but when you see how awful the pictures are, you will realize you've been totally ripped off if you have purchased this!It's really such a terrible product, I don't even know how they get by selling it at all.

There are many more that are much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst She Ever Wrote?","review":"This book, if not Christie's worst, is definitely in the running for that dubious honor. The characters (other than the two sleuths) were uniformly unlikeable, even repulsive. And those were the characters we were supposed to like! The pace was glacial, the dialog uninspired. Even the usually amusing Ariadne Oliver was more idiotic than entertaining here. I skimmed and skipped to get to the end. I will admit the business with the portraits was interesting--a tidbit of the Christie genius otherwise not in evidence in this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely the worst.....","review":"For agatha christie fans,this book is indeed a great dissapoinment.The story was told in a confusing manner,the solution was too complicating and the story doesn't seem to have a plot.I almost gave up on the book but i still finished it cos it was written by my favourite author.Agatha christie has tons of great mystery novels and this is without any doubt,one of her worst"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"This is awful!

Most are good, but have slow beginnings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poirot's Thought Processes","review":"Most readers agree that \\"Third Girl\\" is not one of Agatha Christie's best. Nevertheless, it is well worth reading.The plot is clever (but with significant flaws); the characters good; the writing starts out excellent -- sharp and with Miss Christie's light-hearted, often self-depreciating humor -- but about a quarter of the way through the book it gets wordy and what humor remains seems strained.In other Hercule Poirot books, we do not get a glimpse of his thought processes until he explains everything in the last chapter. Here we get the opportunity to see him struggling, almost dispirited, as he tries to make sense of all the information he has received. I admire Miss Christie for her willingness to experiment, but I think the result was unfortunate.Don't concern yourself that \\"Third Girl\\" is not among the most memorable of the Hercule Poirot books. Just read and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the third girl by agatha christie","review":"Back in the day, many years ago, reading an Agatha Christie was must reading. After reading John Curran'a book Agatha Christie's secret notebooks, I decided to re-visit Hercule Poirot. So far I have read 30 and the third girl ranks amoung the top 25. Red herrings, mystery,a story line that keeps you guessing and of course Hercule with his friend Mrs Oliver, (she is Agatha Christie's ulta ego). A missing girl, who claims she shot someone, or so she thinks, and her friends think nothing about not seeing her for days, including her family. When Agatha wrote this book it was in the '30's, and still today it is timeless. Did she kill someone, is she really missing, and why did she think Hercule was to old to help her?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hercule Poirot & Ariadne Oliver team up again in this satisfying mystery set in 1960s London","review":"I've been a Christie fan since 8th grade and have read them all so many times that I always remember whodunit. Nevertheless, I find them a relaxing and enjoyable read when I'm taking a break from more weighty fiction.This book features two of my favorites- Hercules Poirot and Ariadne Oliver. When a young girl comes to see Poirot and confesses she might have committed a murder before running out claiming he was too old to help her, Poirot is on the case. As he tracks down the identity of the girl and searches for a death that might fit the bill, Mrs. Oliver add bits and pieces of important information that help him solve the case. The final solution is one I never saw coming (the first time I read the book at least)- a very satisfying mystery indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"definitely not her greatest","review":"Third Girl is one of Agatha Christie's slower paced books. It rambles on and on about the same things over and over again. If some of the middle had been cut out, the book might have been a lot better.In the middle, I got so bored that I started counting the pages until the end. Usually with Agatha Christie, you just can't put the book down. With this one, I just wanted to finish it to find out who the murderer is.If you've read many of Agatha Christie's books, you might want to read this, but you shouldn't read this one first. I suggest The Secret Adversary for a more fast paced and exciting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"clever thriller","review":"Kudos for the director and script writer for making clever psychological thriller pitting a police detective and troubled but sexy youny psychiatrist against a ruthless serial killer who taunts the police with a internet version of hangman and if they lose a person is literally hanged!

The photos of author and actress seemed to usually show him smirking into the camera, draped around her, as if broadcasting \\"here *I* am with a STAR!\\"One didn't get the impression of the author as a friend, but as someone more needy. His likening Ms. Ball and himself to the main characters in \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" was therefore strange. He seemed to never forget--or let the reader forget either--that Lucy had been the Queen of TV Comedy, An Icon. And to then cast Lucy into the Norma Desmond role of someone who was forgotten, in need of the constant company of an adoring young man, AND crazy, is egregious. Not only contraditory, but also egotistical.Glad I avoided the bits where he fantasizes that he's actually reliving episodes of \\"I Love Lucy\\"; to paraphrase Groucho Marx, sometimes a TV show is just a TV show."},{"rating":"2","title":"refreshingly honest and intimate portrayal of a friendship","review":"Lee Tannen has successfully and engagingly portrayed his relationship with the star Lucille Ball. From the very beginning of the book it is apparent that Lucy let Lee Tannen into her life at a time when she was becoming reclusive and spending time with only the closest of friends. Lee Tannen describes with wit and clarity the ordinary comings and goings of a friendship. It is a very moving journey of friendship and companionship between a very intelligent, energetic, and funny young man, with a star......it is clear that Lee Tannen loved Lucy, and importantly, equally clear that Lucy loved him.

I picked it up at 9:00 in the evening yesterday, expecting to read just a chapter or two.

The very end is heart wrenching and cathartic. It is not possible to recommend this book more highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"We all love Lucy.","review":"This was a very good read if you are into celeb biographies.

But even the criticism is written kindly.I just wish there had been more pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Loved Lucy, But Not This Book","review":"What a shame. A love letter to Lucy devolves into a boorish opportunity to brag about Tannen's glamorous life, glamorous career, glamorous Manhattan apartment, etc. He didn't miss an opportunity to mention his partner's $100,000 salary, his ability to simply not go to work when he didn't want to, all of his fabulous friennds, and wonderful life.Tannen basically horned his way into Lucy's life and writes as if Lucy's life revolved around him. Because I loved Lucy, too, I found the book interesting. It was a peek, not a tell-all, into the private life of a woman loved by the world. It's just unfortunate that the telling of this story was overshadowed by the author's extraordinary need to let the reader know just how grand a life he leads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would like to point out.","review":"I looked at the table of contents and noticed the first story of this anthology is \\"The Empty House\\" by Algernon BlackWELL.

I believe the standard may still be \\"Scary Stories to tell in the Dark\\" vol. 1-3. When I was young those were just fantastic to read and the illustrations are really well done.

What this book does via it's title and subliminal inferences is imply that the bad is more common than the good. This reinforces the idea that American education is failing us.....nothing could be further from the truth.Parents should not read this and go out and storm the Board meetings.

However, regardless of all of the features of the radio, it is absolutely no good if you can't hear it. That was my experience as I tried every way I knew how to keep the ears buds in my ears. The round design does not let them fit down into the ear. The least motion causes them to fall out. I spent a lot of time trying to make them work but it was taking time away from my work.

A man has been convicted and sentenced to die, while much of the country is blood thirsty, his long lost grandson comes back to try to free him from this deadly fate. This books, as most Grishman novals are, is a nail-biter. Will he live or die? No, I'm not going to give it away, but you will want to read this book asap to find out"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Depressing Book of the Decade","review":"Granted, John can tell a story and set the background so clearly you can smell the stench from where Sam hasn't washed his hair. And maybe the fact that I read this during my nauseous first trimester of pregnancy made it worse than it is. But this is my very least favorite Grisham book--I'm just grateful I borrowed it from the library so I didn't waste my money on it. Usually I buy his books so I can read them again and again. Not this one. I couldn't shake the images of Death Row even when Adam was out in Memphis visiting his aunt. The book ended just like I thought it would, and I felt Sam deserved to die. Nothing in the book led me to believe he was deserving of a pardon or redemption. If John was trying to get us to think about capital punishment, he failed as far as I'm concerned. This character didn't have enough \\"gray area\\" for it--he was despicable"},{"rating":"2","title":"One confusing book...but I liked it!","review":"I thought it was a really neat book because I mean, it was kind of different just because from everything else that I have ever read. But I thought it was kind of stupid how the author said that it was his grandson, and it in the summary it sounded to much more mysterious but then again, maybe that was just to attract readers and all. But I thought it was a pretty good book, and I thought there should have been some kind of like romance it the book to spice it up and the aunt was just in the way of everything and I don't think there should have been any reason as to put her in. And then in the end, I really liked it because it was like a cliffhanger so I mean...read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Chamber was only 600 pages long??","review":"It felt like longer. This book goes nowhere, slow. I would have given it a one, but Grisham actually develops character in this one, for the first time since A Time To Kill. Go watch the movie. It only takes 2 hours, and every plot element is there. The movie isn't that great, but it might keep you from reading the book, a positive thing. Meanwhile, keep waiting for a book as good as The Firm to come out...

Not only is it suspenseful and generally well written, but it gets the reader re-evaluating where he/she stands on the death penalty. All of John Grisham's books are great and I can't wait to read his new one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time!!!!!","review":"I was extremely offended by the fact that Grisham seems to dwell on a lawyer who doesn't seem to care for the family of those who were killed or that justice needs to be served. Adam Hall just wants to waste his time, dwelling on his stupid liberal antics on why his grandfather should not die. You tend to develop a real sense of hate towards him.However, the only reason I give this book 1 star (other than the fact that this site won't let me give less) is the fact that at the end, justice is served in that Sam Cayhall is put to death.I kept waiting for some twist in the plot, or some dark secrets to come out, but they never did. This book was an utter waste of my time. I cannot believe that the author of books as great as The Firm and The Rainmaker really wrote this junk. I strongly urge you to not read it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and sentimental and pretentious","review":"A serial killer and terrorist for the KKK is finally sentenced to death in spite of the perjured testimony set up by his attorney. For nearly ten years, the man uses a private library (provided by the public on the death row) to flood the system with appeals and motions, to delay the execution. He is then joined by pro-bono lawyers (that is, paid by the public), headed by a $400,000 a year attorney (plus all expenses). The team uses every dirty trick and perjured testimony to tie up the system and delay the execution. Their position is that an elderly death-row inmate should just be released outright and they believe that the end justifies the maens.The result is pretentious and boring and a tragic waste of the creative writing genius of Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depth","review":"Clumsy. A pathetic attempt to convey emotion. Ending was a total disappointment. Plots lines went nowhere. The characters are impossible to relate to and feel for.

This was absolutely wasted pulp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and moving","review":"There is so much that I could say about \\"The Chamber\\", but somehow words alone can not do an adequate job of describing how I felt when I had finished reading it.This is a very, very deeply moving novel. The characters are extremely well developed and you find yourself being swept up in an emotional journey as the plot unfolds. This is not a fast-moving action novel, it doesn't have Hollywood-style twists, and it's not a high-octane thriller. But it's not supposed to be. Anyone complaining about the lack of action has simply not understood what the book is supposed to be about.I highly recommend \\"The Chamber\\" to anyone who has ever wondered just how precious human life is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"(...)After getting(...) into the book, I found myself pitying him when I learned what he was going through. I still hated him and considered him a miserable human being, but I didn't think he deserved to die like that. To do something like this with your writing requires incredible talent, something that I believe John Grisham has. Any other author might try to make you feel compassion for an awful and racist person and it certainly wouldn't work, it would probably annoy you. I found this was certainly not true with The Chamber. I have never agreed with the Death Penalty, but that was probably jsut because I grew up in a house were people would tell me that it was wrong. Never really knowing why it was really wrong I just accepted that that was the way things were. I now really understand what's so bad about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it Before Finishing","review":"This book was not enjoyable. It's not only hundreds of pages of soap box (i don't mind that as long as said box is entertaining) but the characters are lacking any sort of appealing personality trait. The atty, Adam, is dullsville, the aunt is the most annoying creature ever (except for Mrs. Norris), and Sam is...well kinda interesting. This book is just long and dull and in no way invigorating. Grish has too many great books for a reader to plow through this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ready for the \\"Chamber\\" after reading it","review":"This is Grisham's worst work. What should have been a short story, rambles on for hundreds of pages. Anyone who reads The Chamber will receive a tremendous education about the intricacies of cigarette smoke. If that thrills you, by all means waste a few hours with this text. If not, read something less laborious, like the dictionary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really awful","review":"Unbelievable to me that others rate this work so highly. Weak characterization, linear plot with no twists or turns, and writing that is surprisingly juvenile. The first Grisham book I'd read; I expected far better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Werid Subconscience Ride","review":"The story is about a racist, who was involved in a murder, of two children, and disfiguring their father. He is being sentence to death via the gas chamber for this murder, that he only helped, but did not fully commit (Although he had committed many other crimes in the past)As one writer said the first half of this book is about this terrible racist man who deserves to die. The second half on the book was about the same man, but he is now portrayed as a guy with a heart, and was truly sorry, and thru the true story you learn that he didn't wish for anyone to die, just a different kinda crime to be committed.I wasn't able to finish this book, because the plot became very predictable, and the facts about what happens when someone suffers at the hands of the chamber became too much for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Of the five Grisham novels I've read thus far, this is by far the worst. I'm puzzled to see so many found this book 'thrilling', as I thought it was extremely predictable. I found none of the characters to be likeable. The book contains several sub-plots which either add nothing substantial to the novel, or even more annoying simply vanish without a trace. This book will probably be satisfying to only the most die-hard of Grisham fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow, couldn't finish","review":"Boy was this book slow reading...I got about one third of the way through it and stopped. I found the character development shallow and the plot weak. JG can do better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I thought that the tis must be the worst book Grisham has written. I have read every one of his books and I usually enjoy them a lot, but this one was even hard to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"The one and only time that I could not finish a Grisham novel. I loved The Firm, and the Pelican Brief, and all of his other novels to date, but found this book completely pointless. The story was uninteresting, and the characters pathetic. I hope that this was a once in a career bomb."},{"rating":"2","title":"This will raise questions about right and wrong","review":"At first, I thought the title referred to a judge's chambers, but this is actually a book about the gas chamber. It took me a litttle while, but after the halfway point I was really connected with the characters and involved with the book. Grisham manages to make the reader just as torn as the other characters about whether Sam deserves to/should die in the gas chamber for his crimes. I got totally immersed in the book, and spent a lot of time contemplating the death penalty in general. This is a masterful story and a good book for anyone who wants to look at the grey areas of the law and what is right and wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very emotional book","review":"While reading The Chamber i cried many times. Sometimes this book will make you smile, other times it will make you cry, and other times it will make you cry out in anger. Sam Cayhall is on deathrow because in the sixties he was in the KKK and bombed a jewish lawyer's building. But something went wrong when he bombed the building;instead of it going off at 5 in the morning when it was vacant, it went off at 8. Unfortunately, it the lawyer's two five-year old sons were in the building and the bomb killed them. Now, his only chance is his 26-year old grandson lawyer who will try everything to help him, and to keep him from getting gassed in the Gas Chamber.Before reading this book, I was stongly opposed to the death row, but after reading it, well, it makes you think about that. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"So, Grisham isn't a total hack afterall!","review":"This is really a remarkable story -- rather a dark look at death row and capital punishment without being preachy (obviously Grisham's a liberal; all his books tout this, but one can overlook it here).It's not really the expected plot-driven fluff. It's a very moving and mature drama, full of details of life on death row which, though perhaps fictionalized, give one a glimpse of an experience quite beyond the norm. I didn't think Grisham could pull off something this good."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Grisham has ever written","review":"After reading Grisham's other books like The FirmThe Pelican Brief, etc. this was the worst.I haven't ever read such a boring book in my life.This book kept going in a meaningless direction.I kept asking myself, \\"When is he going to get to the point!\\" Charles Dickens can write better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is he a best selling author?","review":"I can't understand why Grisham books sell--I've never purchasedone after The Firm. This book is an argument against the deathpenalty with a totally despicable character that the reader is encouraged to be sympathetic toward. I oppose capital punishment but felt if it were ever deserved, it is in this case. It is never clear why Adam Hall, the grandson, cares so much for this person. *Dead Man Walking* did a far, far better job handling this topic. Glad I didn't purchase this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This was the most disappointing book I've read in years. Yes, it's well written in that the characters are well developed and you can really feel the emotion of the heartbreaking story. However there is no plot!! Many, many pages are spent laying the groundwork for exciting twists and new dimensions to the story -- but not a single twist or diversion to the story line ever comes to pass. The plot just plods along in 676 pages via a single, linear story line to the logical conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"huh?","review":"This was tough for me to finish. I almost quit a couple of times. I didn't get the appeal of this book, as apparently so many other readers have. I found it unsuspenseful, and I didn't find any engaging characters. I guess the nuanced issues surrounding the death penalty could have been interesting, but it was somehow presented in a way that made me think \\"hmm, some ambiguous moral soup here, but that's just how things are.\\" Sorry to say it, but Grisham seems to have mailed it in here, in the writing if not the research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a thriller, so boring.","review":"Thought it was another thriller from John Grisham, but my assumption was wrong. Very boring, I found myself frequently skipping pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost as bad as \\"Battlefield Earth.\\"","review":"It is astonishing to me that people have rated this book as \\"five stars,\\" when it is so grossly bad. The writing is horrible; the characterization is junior-highschool level; the plot rambles, meanders, and stumbles from nowhere to nowhere without direction. This book lacks any kind of positive trait.Save your time and money: buy a book written by someone who knows how to write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Boring waste of time","review":"The chamber is by far Grisham's worst piece of work. The story was flat, dull and boring, a total waste of time. In the beginning, it seemed to have a good premise, however, Mr. Grisham wrote this book to death (no pun intended!). After about 90 pages, I flipped to the end to see what the verdict was guilty as charged, as I suspected. Ah there I gave away the ending with absoltely no loss to humanity! However, The chamber should not take away from Grisham's other fine literary works.

Well worth 675 pages of reading!!!!!!","review":"The type of literature is both realistic and contemporary fiction.

In this book, he even failed at that modest aim.The whole purpose of the book seems to be to give Grisham a forum for arguing against the death penalty -- though I'm not even sure about that. If that was his goal, he tried to accomplish it by making us sympathize with an old, sick man on death row. Sorry, but he was once a young, healthy murderer. Executing him sooner would have solved the old, sick man issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!!","review":"Did John Grisham REALLY write this book??? I am a huge fan of John Grisham, but this book is defintely not John Grisham at his best.

But, if you're willing to put your brain into high gear on a high octane adventure of thinking and rethinking your ideas on crime and punishment you must read this book. The heart of this story is the death penalty. Is it morally/legally justified? Is it neccessary? Does society benefit from it? All the usual questions and one I've yet to read about---the effects the death penalty has upon the people duty-bound to carry out the execution. This book will open up your eyes in ways you'd never imagine no matter your view point."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I read strictly for entertainment.

This just strengthened my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Fresh out of law school, the hero of Grisham's story returns to the South, to his family's roots, to defend his grandfather, trying to save the old man from the gas chamber. As the hero digs into his family's sordid past, he uncovers a shocking history. As always, this is an entertaining read, but Grisham's best tales are still the Summons, the Brethren, and the Firm.If you like Grisham, you might also try The Golden CatchRoger Weston, author ofThe Golden Catch"},{"rating":"2","title":"Have a tissue handy","review":"It seems the later Grisham novels are a little slow. This one is too, but it picks up a bit closer to the end. I was surprised by the ending. With all the intricacies Grisham interwove, I really felt emotional for the main character. Hence the tissues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no: Not Another","review":"And in the \\"Big Surprises\\" category, we have a Grisham book with a young lawyer who is a pastiche from \\"Friends\\" and \\"Captain Planet;\\" who embodies Grisham's own unoriginal politics; who looks suspiciously like he could be played by Brad Pitt, or even Keanou Reeves; who engages in a shallow moral milieu with benighted society without actually making a damned bit of substantial difference; who worries up banal (if not completely trivial) moral fodder; who catapults from obscurity to a Momentous Event; whose every emotional twitch is described with complete lack of authenticity; who undergoes character development so minimal that we believe he really IS a lawyer. Welcome back to the bookstand, John: you fit like an old shoe with broken laces and no sole"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"1 Star because it is a John Grisham Work. This was Grisham using his best selling ability to write a book against the death penalty. If you are looking for a story that will hold your interest you came to the wrong place. The only reason I finshed the book is because I kept hoping it would get better. A great writer who wasted our time on this one. If you want to read a good law mystery pick Grisham -- just don't pick this one. The Client , Street Lawyer, Runaway Jury, The Firm are all 4-5 Star Books so read those not this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, gripping reading.","review":"This story is more about the lawyer representing the death-rowinmate than it is the inmate.... I didn't think it wouldbe a good candidate for a movie, but perhaps they are aboutto prove me wrong (movie is forthcoming). An excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I recommend you skip this one.","review":"My least favorite of the Grisham books, The Chamber is a slow-paced story made up of tons of dialogue and very, very little action. For me, it started out boring and remained consistent to the very end. It's true, that it became a \\"page turner\\" near the end, but not the way you might think... I was hoping that something exciting might actually happen, but mainly just wanted to be done with it. I knew better than expect a good ending from Grisham anyway.Grisham once again revisits the racial issues of the South and even references his other \\"racial\\" book (the A Time to Kill) in the process. Unless you've been living in a cave, this is a topic beaten to death and he really has nothing new to ad. I wish I hadn't read it and could not, in good faith, recommend it to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"AS USUAL-GARBAGE","review":"John Grisham never ceases to amaze me with thoughtless writing and trite plots. No characters, no theme, poor writing-a typical Grisham. It started with The Firm, and has continued until this day. His books are a disgrace to all writers in general, and specifically to lawyers and politicians. Every page I read was pure agony as I contemplated burning the book more than once. However, I finished just so I can write this review, and warn people off of this book. It was awful. If I could give it 0 stars, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Grisham's worst.","review":"Grisham has had many bestselling novels. Except this one is boring. Unless you're really into the book you'll maybe like it. When I read this book, I nearly fell asleep. It's just Adam Hall filing out petition after petition. If you loose interest in this book, but still go on you won't know how many petitions Adam Hall filed. It's that boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best Grisham novels ever","review":"this is one of the best books ever by John Grisham. The Chamber keeps you captivated and enchanted thoughout the entire book with his wonderful plots and interesting characters. It is definitely worth buying and reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"and the point was....?","review":"I've read several Grisham novels and have enjoyed the pace and the suspense - two things that were sadly lacking in The Chamber. The characters were unlikeable, the storyline slow and predictable and the ethical questions too contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to cure insomnia and regret buying a book? Read this.","review":"If you want to get thought provoking stuff on the consequences of the death penalty here is my suggestion: Go to a video store and rent the movie \\"Dead Man Walking\\". \\"The Chamber\\" is a boring, pointless slog that goes on and on and on and on and on until you pitch the wretched thing into the fireplace. Grisham is always switching sides on how we should view Sam Cayhall and never stays on one long enough to make a point. Stay as far away from this book as possible!! You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long,drawn out predictable story.","review":"Unlike Grisham's previous novels, this one is slow paced, and redundant. That is, the lead character spends most of his days going between the prison where his grandfather is incarcerated and back to the home with his Aunt. The Grandfather who is on death row is not a likeable character, and does not even seem to have an ounce of remorse for his hideous crime. This slow moving book could have been written in half the pages Grisham did, and would have been a slightly more tolerable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disapointing attempt at thrilling literature","review":"Grisham's best books are the thrilling fights against powerful enemies not yet fully known; this theme makes The Firm, The Pelican Brief and The Client such exciting stories.That his first book (A Time to Kill) did not sell at fist didn't suprise because it just goes on and on in this flimsy tale of legal chitchat of a starting lawyer defending a black man's murder of the rapist of his daughter.The Chamber gave me the same feeling. It feels like a poor attempt to write a literary, philosophical and ethical thriller - presenting the death penalty as an issue (but not really discussing it) and missing the chances of real suspense in the story.I gave it two stars because of the description of the last hours of Adam and his grandfather, which I found really moving.But they didn't make me forget that I had thought I bought a thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it","review":"This is one of Grisham's longer books, but well worth it. The characters in \\"The Chamber\\" are better developed than some of his other books, notably some of his more recent books. As the reader, a bond formed between the main characters and I throughout the book. It was this closeness with the characters combined with a well-written story and thoughtful dialogue that provided me with the opportunity to contemplate something I had never really thought about before - the death penalty. I really enjoyed the book and recommend it to anyone who has read and enjoyed any of Grisham's other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"The good are not always so good, The bad are not always so bad","review":"The Chamber is one of John Grisham's best! It was the first time I've gotten an indepth look at the appeals process. For those people who want to form an opinion on the death penalty based on the circumstances in The Chamber, it must be remembered that people put themselves in the circumstances that they face. No one snatched Sam Cayhall of the street and held him at gunpoint to make the bomb for the attorney's office. There are plenty of people in Mississippi who may have thought the same thing but said \\"hold on one minute,let's think about this\\". As in reality, when I've had conversations with acquaintenences about the death penalty, I always encourage them to examine the case and gain an understanding from the victims point of view. The Chamber isn't for the faint of heart and it does make one think. It beautiful illustrates one thing I try to teach my kids: your actions and decisions effects other people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliched and two dimensional","review":"Usually Mr. Grishom's caricatures of American personalities are an amusing background to the suspence and action, but here it is the whole book. Also, it was almost embarassing for me to see him expose his own biases so close to the surface. He is not a great thinker, and he really just rehashes the same anti-capital punishment arguments over and over with little cosmetic changes. No action entertainment here, and I would have given it one star, except for some of the amusing caricatures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Deeper Then His Other Books","review":"For me this was one of his better books. The reason is that I think he took a story line that had some real meaning and most of us see parts of on the TV all the time. He then really got into the characters and story. He develops it all the way to the end. I truly felt for the prisoner at the end of the book. The book does not move off the main path it set for itself. A lot of my friends felt the book was too slow or heavy, but for me I think most of his other books have been to easy and light. You have to and want to spend time with this book. The time pays off in the end with a book that you will remember for a good time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"magnificent thriller","review":"A spin shaking thriller that has you from the first page and through the worst of times up untill the spin crushing end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, no suspense","review":"We read all of Grisham's books and found this the worst.

It touches on activities of the Ku Klux Klan. It was my impression that the author leans toward those who favor the abolition of the death penalty. However, some sympathy is found for the victims of crime. The story centers on Sam Cayhall who is sentenced to death after several trials over a number of years following the crime. Sam's grandson becomes his attorney during the last months of appeal from \\"death row.\\" The latter part of the book leaves one wondering whether or not there will be an execution. Meanwhile Sam shows repentance and response to the prison's chaplain.I found it to be one of the better John Grisham books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I hadn't wasted my time, but saved by listening to story","review":"I have long had the desire to read a Grisham book, because I have heard good things. Well, my chance came and I was sorely disappointed. The audio cd's were on sale at a truck stop and I decided to get them for The Chamber. The opening to the book kept me going, but by chapter three, I had already decided this, \\"If Sam Cayhall lives I'm going to be mad because I get furious about hate crimes, and if he dies, he had better not die a martyr or worse yet the \\"hero\\" to the story.\\" Sadly, I pursued curious about the ending. I'm very glad I got the cds instead of the book, because it only took six hours to get through it. Sure wish I had those six hours back and the money invested so I could try a diferent author. Mayber Grisham's other books are better, but I won't be reading them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"This, like any good book, will cause you to think, and for me it was to question something at the time I agreed with. Grisham tells the story of a man who was put on Death Row, though he was only the driver of the get away car. It shows very well that death row is a very horrible place and almost barbaric.At the time I read this I was a believer in the Death Penalty, but this, if maybe not making me change my mind altogether, made me at least question it. This was the first thing I had ever read or even heard on how they treat people on Death Row and what they go through, even though they are criminals.Interesting thought provoking read, though somewhat predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is AWESOME ! ! !","review":"John Grisham did a wonderful job on this book. The subjuct grabs your attention and won't let go. The plot forced me to reevaluate a my own beliefs about life, death, family, friends, etc. It held my concentration and played on my emotions. Overall, I think this has been Grisham's best book so far"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Chamber\\" shows that the death penalty is a gray area.","review":"I am a bit confused as to why the reviews on this book are so poor. I suppose that others did not get anything out of the story, but I sure did acquire a heightened awareness of the death penalty. The Chamber reveals that issues of the death penalty are neither black nor white....there is a lot of \\"gray area\\" surrounding each case. Of course, there will always be a conflicting sides on this issue, but this story does give insight into the type of people who do end up on death row. I feel that this is worth reading when you are confused on the issue of the death penalty. The story itself may be a bit try, but learning about why a person would commit a crime & his past life is well worth it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Death penalty, lawyers, KKK, relatives. Sound interesting?","review":"This book, I thought, is a very good book. It's my first John Grisham book that I have read and it's very intersting. I am now hooked on more of his books and I would love to read them. I had seen The Rainmaker when it was in the theaters and I had always wanted to read the book, but never got around to it. But now that I have read one of Grisham's book I am going to try and read as many of his books as I can. It was very good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not typical Grisham, but just as good","review":"Klan rallies, corporate scandals, and the ACLU. I loved \\"A Time To Kill\\" but after a while, the same theme gets old. I wasn't too enthusiastic about picking up \\"The Chamber,\\" However, this book has had a huge impact on me. Grisham finally puts the burning cross aside and takes a real look at the ugly face of hatred. As former Ku Klux Klan member Sam Cayhall sits on Death Row, his grandson struggles to save his life. But the real story lies in the relationship that the two develop as Sam's appeals slip through the cracks. I never thought I would feel pity for a Klansman, but Grisham gives us not just a different perspective, but the whole picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham's weakest novel","review":"A very thin story line, not entertaining, no excitement, disappointing. Not the usual Grisham quality, which is suspenseful, entertaining and brings you into a different world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Defined Characters - Very Weak Ending","review":"This book left me wanting, unsatisfied, and thinking of half a dozen better ways to have ended it. The characters are well defined, even likable, and the theme is thought prevoking. The story is built on a house of cards that collapses from a weak ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not finish it!","review":"I did not finish this yawner. About 200 pages into it became clear that Grisham was using his success to make his political statement about the death penalty. Based on a conversation with a friend, I had correctly figured out the rest of the book anyway. If I can figure it out -- you can too. See the movie instead. It will only waste two hours of your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good book with an ending that wasn't expected.","review":"It was a really good book, but I wish that Sam hadn't died atthe end.That would be cool. I love the book, eventhough it isn't as suspensfullygripping as his others, it is more psychologically gripping."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"The ending is as anti-climactic as any I have read. I loved the Firm, enjoyed the Pelican Brief, and hated the Client. I decided to give Grisham one more shot, but after this, you'd have to pay me to read another of his books. If you're interested in capital punishment issues, do your own research - it will be far more interesting than reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book i have ever read!","review":"I have read many JG books and love him.

I couldn't even finish it!I thought the plot of the story was slow and it put me to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT one of his best!","review":"Compared to some of the other Grisham books - this one completely lacks the tension. The plot is too simple, and the only exciting bit is whether they are gonna execute the guy or not..There is loads of good books out there, so pick another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOTALLY AWESOME!!!","review":"This is the first of JG's books that I read, and I loved it. It made me cry at the end, yes, but it was still a very good book. Adam is a truly caring person, and Sam seems like he's truly sorry for his sins. I wish that the high schools in this country would have their students read this book and then have discussions about the death penalty. It's a very daunting issue, one that too many of the American people are afraid to discuss because they feel it is too gruesome and too controversial to talk about in public. This book makes you think long and hard about your opinion on the death penalty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everlasting nothingness","review":"John Grisham is one of the best authors there is who can write very long about nothing, and this book prooves it. Really, after about 20 pages nothing more happens, but Grisham just won't stop writing. The Chamber is a boring book that simply didn't need to be written. Grisham tries to make the dull story a bit interesting by making his standard young-lawyer hero into the convict's grandson, but he never really bothers to explore what this might do to both of them. And as I said, you can't really tell what he does insted, since it seems as if he's just putting words on the paper without knowing where he's going."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING AND A WASTE OF TIME","review":"I have read all of John Grisham's books and enjoyed them all except for this one. I found it boring - I don't know why I bothered to finish the whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't finish it!","review":"Maybe it was because the Woodward verdict came through whilst I was reading this; that put me of legal eagles for sure, but to be honest I was struggling before that.

NOT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO!!!","review":"This book is by far the most BORING book I ever read.

All I know is that it's a terrible piece of fiction. I gave up on Grisham after this one. I went along with the hype and read a few of Grisham's early works before I came to my senses and realized that he's a mediocre writer at best. If you want to give Grisham a try read The Firm or A time to Kill. They don't set any new literary standards, but at least they are entertaining. But do not enter this Chamber. It's amonumental waste of time"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little above average book on a very convroversial subject","review":"This book deals with a grandson lawyer defending his murderer grandfather who is about to be executed. The book gives quite a lot of details bout the last minute moves of the law teams working for the state, but mainly those of the defense team. It also gives quite a lot of details about the lives of the people who are locked up in the death row, and a few stories of executions gone wrong - even though I'm not sure how accurate they are.The only problems in this book are the characters, that could use a little more developing as people, and the fact that even though the crime was described in detail at first, there's not a lot of sympathy toward the victims and their extended family later on - I don't agree with capital punishment myself, but I do think that the victims'family has a right for sympathy too..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical John Grisham","review":"This is the fifth of Grisham's books that I've read, and it will be the last. It's typical Grisham, with sub-plots ad infinitum. About two thirds the way through, I just got bored and said to heck with it. None of Grisham's books have a definitive ending, they just kind of drift off and leave you hanging. This is no different. From what I did read, it's basically nothing more than a rant against capitol punishment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chamber Review...great!","review":"A wonderful book although I am late in reading it based on the publication date.It kept me up late reading it and the characters were well written.Slightly disapppointed in the late Rollie appearance which I thought Lee was tied to but never the less Sam protected his family and I sort of liked him at the end and felt bad for him.The beginning of the book was quick moving and I enjoyed the pace.Hats off to John Grisham.Staci"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"i love grishams books and his style of writing but the chamber was boring and not very interesting"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham gets no more of my money after this awful monologue","review":"Having enjoyed many of Grisham's earlier books, I looked forward to his latest novel. However, this book lacks plot, mystery, intrigue, character, and suspense. Basically, he takes too many pages to say \\"the death penalty is bad\\". I never felt compassion for the convicted murderer and couldn't believe that any grandson would actually go through these motions. Don't waste your money or time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Grisham book took longer to read!","review":"I have read all Grisham books, seen (afterwards) all Grisham movies, but none is as dissapointing as this book. All through reading the book I was waiting for the suspense to start. I thought many times: when does the story start. And when the pages left to read became fewer and fewer, I got this strange feeling: Is there a story in this book? After finishing it I had a very unsatisfied feeling and wanted to read The Chamber II, the sequel... Maybe the story is in there....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top of the line Grisham, don't miss it, a high recommend!!.","review":"One of the best of Grisham's batch of legal bestsellers.You'll find it hard to lay down once you start and beforeyou're done you'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll surely questionyour own views on the death penalty. I was an avowed advocateof capitol punishment before reading this book;now I'm notso sure! It's hard to imagine caring about the fate of aconfessed killer, but under Grisham's skilled pen, Sam becomesa real person and somebody you actually feel like you know.Theidealistic young lawyer, Adam, who finds the grandfather henever knew and a cause he never imagined, is a hero who is bothlikeable and plausible.Definitely a recommended read."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this get published?","review":"This was one of the worst books I've read in my life. The dialog was terrible in the book and there were many loose ends and undeveloped subplots in the book. I can't go into details because it would give away the ending, but basically at the end of the book, you end up thinking to yourself, \\"Wait a minute, whatever happened to this person and this subplot? What did that event have anything to do with anything else in the book?\\" It was an example of sloppy thinking and poor editing on the editor's part. If you buy this book against my advice, I suggest that you read the dialog to yourself and see how phony it sounds. Nobody talks like that. Basically, Grisham is writing as he always has, he thinks he's writing a movie. It's not literature, it's Hollywood scenes on paper. It's really poor writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kept waiting for it to get intriguing or at least exciting.","review":"Where was the punch to the book? Very mundane. No suspense.

I dread going to bed at night to read it in spite of my dogged determination to get through it. While I find most of Grisham's stuff to be shallow but at least entertaining, the Chamber, however, is dull dull dull. Having bamboo shoved under my fingernails is sound pretty good as an alternative to yet one more evening struggling through this book. Next time you're browsing the Grisham section leave this one on the shelf you wouldn't want to disturb the dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham's worst by far...","review":"I was surprised Grisham could write something this boring. This is by FAR his worst novel. Halfway interesting at the get-go, this story just turns into a sleeper. I didn't think it was ever going to end (with a predictable ending might I add). Are we supposed to feel sorry for this convicted murderer? I think not. The movie's even worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good God it's Awful!!","review":"Why does Grisham keep selling? I got through the first 30 pages and finally finished this book in bits and pieces over the next year. It's boring and poorly written. Grisham apparently had one good book: the Firm. I hate to say it as a fellow Mississippian ,but with the possible exception of King, Grisham is the most over rated writer today. He should read a Koontz or a Clancy and get an idea of what a good thriller really should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Sleeper (Yawner)","review":"This has to be the worst of Grisham. By \\"sleeper\\" I mean you will probably fall asleep many times before you get through this one. I started it this past summer and finally finished it in the fall.

Whether it was Anton Chekhov and Milton in college, Shakespeare in elementary school, or Dante and Homer in high school, I found it all boring and sometimes hard to fathom. Instead, the only poetry I found enjoyable were those by Shel Silverstein in this book and his other classic, A Light in the Attic. Before there was Harry Potter, there was Shel Silverstein's poetry. Fun, enjoyable, easy to read, with minimal need of understanding; these are probably the most famous poetry put out by an American author.

It is my own small children's favorite book. They have their favorites (Spaghetti & Listen to the Mustn'ts) and can recite them by heart. I would like to thank Mr. Silverstein for bringing happiness to my childhood, as well as creating stories that lay the foundation for some of the the most beautiful moments I share with my children. The stories are silly (Dancing Pants), as well as thought-provoking (Colors). I recommend it to anyone, and everyone.

I love reading them to her and she, my sister, my daughter and I love reading them over and over again. I still get excited as I did when I was young. My daughter and niece share the same excitement.

How 'bout \\"Forever Man,\\" \\"Everyone's Someone,\\" or \\"Break\\" even! \\"Love Liberty Disco\\" is a great album from back to front. Why pick \\"Where You Belong\\"? Try \\"I Cannot Get You Out Of My System.\\" They picked rather well from \\"Take Me To Your Leader\\" though (its saving grace). In essence, I'd say \\"Love Liberty Disco\\" ranks second, with \\"Take Me To Your Leader\\" being their best. It's good from back to front. Soooo, why didn't Sparrow let those tracks see the light of day? The rest of the compilation tracks are good picks, but I'd say that if you own all of their albums, like I do, then you should pass on this album. Just dub the 3 new songs from someone else's copy or somethin'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could have been better","review":"I loved every second of this cd, especially that great meg-mix and the new songs. I had just one problem withit, it didn't have but one LLD song. Where was Beautiful Sound or Say you need love, or Everyone's someone or Break. These are all clasics a deserve to be on the Shine the Hits because thay show the maturity that the Newsboys have gained in LLD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well-done Greatest Hits CD","review":"There's a very good selection of Newsboys hit songs here, despite the fact that all songs from their Love Liberty Disco album were omitted. Unlike some Greatest Hits collections, which will leave you scratching your head at some of the song choices, this album gives you exactly what you're looking for. \\"Entertaining Angels\\", \\"Shine\\", \\"Not Ashamed\\" Reality\\"; can't go wrong with those classics. The best part about the CD is that the three new songs included are so strong, particularly \\"Joy\\" and \\"Who?\\". A great CD for a casual Newsboys fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Time for a Greatest Hits!","review":"\\"Shine - The Hits\\" by the Newsboys is truly a greatest hits collection. Rather than putting out a \\"Greatest Hits\\" package after 3 or 4 albums (like Audio Adrenaline did), the Newsboys have over a decade of music to draw from for this collection. The music is diverse and the lyrics are clever. My favorite song is \\"Entertaining Angels\\" from the \\"Step Up to the Microphone\\" album. It combines great multi-layered vocals with cool slide guitar licks. But the whole album is good, solid music. I wish that they included \\"Love, Liberty, and Disco\\" as one of the 17 songs on the album, but you can't have everything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise God for the Newsboys!!","review":"I became a Newsboys fan when I bought my first CD, Love Liberty Disco.

If you have heard ANY of the Newsboy's music and liked it, this is a MUST HAVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, great, great, great, great! :)","review":"This album is more like it! After the disappointment album Love Liberty Disco, Newsboys released an album full of their past hits and also included several new, and very catchy songs. \\"Joy\\" was so great that I had to buy this CD just to put the song on repeat a billion times!If you don't have any newsboys album, this is the one to get! It's got so many good songs. Oh, and although I don't like \\"Got Your Number\\" it's funny to see how much Newsboys have progressed over the years.And of course, because there's no songs off Love Liberty Disco on this album it's a winner (although they could have put on \\"Beautiful Sound\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing from \\"Love Liberty Disco\\"?","review":"This album contains nothing from their last album, 1999's \\"Love, Liberty, Disco,\\" which is because of one of two reasons: 1)Sparrow is still trying to sell LLD and doesn't want to hurt its sales by placing its tunes on the disc or..... 2)Public reaction to LLD was lukewarm (though critics embraced it) and/or Sparrow doesn't think they have any \\"great hits\\" from the album. I'm a little disappointed; I liked their last disc quite a bit and think that at very least \\"Good Stuff\\" or \\"Beautiful Sound\\" should be here. Still, this album contains lots of catchy tunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"An expensive wok","review":"I give it only two stars for two reasons: 1.

The main character was Omri. Omri is a boy who owns a magical cupboard that can bring plastic figures to life. He has a mom, dad, and two brothers. He also has a friend named Patrick and a cat named Kista. I liked the book because it was interesting. I also think it would be cool if plastic figures could come to life. The plot was about Omri and the magic of the cupboard. When Omri's family moves he finds a diary and a cash box. In the cashbox there are little figures. When Omri brings them to life he tries to change the past by telling them what to do. Then Omri leans that you shouldn't change other people's past because it could affect you. The setting was in England and in the country. I think the theme was don't interfere with someone's past because it could change your past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This is the best one out of the Indian in the Cupboard books.

My first impression of this film was Oh My God!, but in retrospect I can see how great it really was. It's a very sad film, It's about a small town criminal named Slue (played by Paul L.

They raise the boy (Sonny Boy) to be the perfect criminal coconspirator, but Sonny Boy (played by Michael Griffin) isn't interested in a life of crime, and eventually finds love.

Dialogs are really unnatural (I recall a conversation about one of victims immediately after his death which was just too witty to be real) and some words are used too often. There are pages where the author starts using some expression and simply cannot quit it: in reality, actually, incidentally are a few examples. They pop up every other sentence.I am sticking to the book only because of the excellent narration by Scott Brick (this refers to the audio version)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"When I saw author Brian Haig was collaborating with my favorite author, Vince Flynn, I figured he had to be good.

I found this book to be awful. The dialogue made me cringe. A constant stream of socially inappropriate one-liners that weren't the least bit funny (and wouldn't be in any setting).

The plot was decent, if predictable, and that's the only reason I give it two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read, but not the best I've had","review":"Overall this was a good book. The storyline was well written and the information provided did a lot for my imagination and for making me want to continue turning the pages. I was rather surprised at the end when the true \\"who did it\\" came out. It's worth buying in paperback for an airplane ride read or as I bought it, to kill time while waiting on medication at the pharmacy, but I wasn't so impressed I'd want to pass the book along to friends.I do have to say that Haig did an excellent job with the conversations and dialogue in the book - Sean (the main character) is very believable and his sarcastic flair brings some good laughs throughout the book.I just didn't care for the chapter transitions and the writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did the author write all those favorable reveiws?","review":"A terrible read...the worst of 2005 for my wife and me. Since the book has NOT \\"taken off\\" I tend to disbelieve all those highly favorable reviews by my fellow voters. (Think ulcer on that point!) First 1% of novel is great. Last 1% is good. Middle 98% is a sewer of words leading no where except to boredom. Perhaps a good short-short story as written but no novel. A favorable note....it sells for a good price used.

I kept turning the pages because I couldn't believe that the writing could get worse. It did. I made it thru page 137 and gave up.

If you can borrow a copy (for God's sake don't buy one!) read a few pages for comic relief. People buy this author's books which proves that H.L.

It's insipid and vulgar. The characters are shallow people I wouldn't hire to walk my dog, let alone protect the president. The dialog is juvenile and repetitive and I lost count of the number of problems/issues I found in the plot. Haig might be a successful author, but only because W. C. Fields was right."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the same, which ain't bad","review":"Brian Haig continues his series of Sean Drummond books with the President's Assassin. It is not his best work, lacking some of the plot twists and excitement of some of his other books. However, it's still a great read. The dialogue is catchy and amusing, and his look at the political infighting during a crisis is well done, if not particularly new. If you like Brian Haig's earlier books, you'll like this one, too. If you didn't, well, you won't like this one either. And if you're new to Brian Haig, start with Secret Sanction or Mortal Allies."},{"rating":"2","title":"The two field marshalls who lost the war for Germany.","review":"This book shows the clearest reason why military leaders should not be in control of a nation. Hindenburg and Ludendorff were great Field Marshalls, but they were horrible in leading the nation. Yet for all practical purposes, they were Germany's WWI leaders. In fact, Hindenburg made political decisions outside his jurisdiction during the war. However, after the Armistice, both blamed politicians, Jews, Catholics, and other leftists for Germany's loss. They didn't suck it up and admit defeat, but placed the blame elsewhere. Both were not honorable men, they pushed aside critics because they disagreed with them. They ultimately lost the war for Germany.Lee does a good job of detailing the successes and failures of these two men. Hindenburg ultimately selected Adolf Hitler as his successor, and this was his worst mistake. I think the book is a good read on two poor politicians but capable military men."},{"rating":"2","title":"right size and price","review":"My son wanted to have his own kitchen and this product is a right one for those kids who want to play occasionally.

The green phyto base allows us to not have to add a variety of expensive green powders, thus saving us a bit of money.The only reason I gave this a four star rating is because even in a smoothie with lots of fruit the taste of the phyto base can come through and may be unappealing to some people.

This is a good story, it will captivate you and have you wondering what is going to happen next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all for an old anime.","review":"For how old the series is, it's actually pretty well made. If you like Go Nagai, a guesser to the end, or even just plain anime gore, you'll want to get your hands on this classic.The story line is excellent. Getting a model that is absolutely afraid of her devil side is very unique. Also, this particular plotline has so many twists that you don't know what to do with yourself. And it never gets too overdramatic. There is always space for light comedy. There are some parts in the show that get a little dragged on, but have patience with it.The worst part of the series is the voice-acting, which was usually the case in the early days of anime. Dubbing was never great in the 20th Century, and I am glad that it has gotten better. It isn't the absolute worst dubbing, but DeviL Lady characters may tend to annoy you because of it.If you are a big fan of Go Nagai animation, try this one out.

However, the book was frustrating in parts where Coben would digress into the minutiae of some of the characters lives and their thought processes; I just wanted him to get on with the plot.The opening of the book grabbed my attention, but after a time the introduction of character after character was too much; I was thankful that Beatrice Smith didn't make an appearance.

Oh, my!","review":"I have a feeling that Coben's high school creative writing teacher told him that you MUST have someone disappear and reappear as someone else or disappear and eventually come back as yourself. I have read the last 4 of Coben's books and am surely seeing a trend.A pack of Photomat pictures has an extra one inserted from many years ago. Husband disappears on the night wife shows him the photo. Nice premise. However, this one fails to deliver.It hearkens back to a rock concert from 15 years ago when 18 young people were killed in a stampede caused by a gunshot. Who did what, when, where, and why is too mind-boggling. After finishing the book, I'm still not sure what happened. Will probably pass on Coben's next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harlan Coben can do better","review":"This book was just too unbelievable. Long married people who know nothing about eachother. A wife who is reluctant to approach her husband when she sees an \\"old\\" picture of him and another girl in a group of young people. Too many unrealistic subplots with \\"surprise\\" explanations which make little sense and are way too convenient. An old rock concert where many young people are killed and thier parents are still walking zombies unable to cope with their deaths 15 years later. A mafia \\"sugar daddy\\" savior who always appears at just the right time. It is all too mundane, like a soap opera, and boring. Harlan Coben has written some good books.

I was impressed with the many turns and twists Coben creates to keep the reader engaged.

Then the fun of unravelling these pasts presents itself and its solution.This is an ingeniously intriguing story presented by a master storyteller who introduces so many twists and turns you are at a loss to determine whether you are coming or going.

And any one star reviews, his friends say that they didn't help and it looks like the one star reviewers are wacko.This book blows as much as his other books blow. If you work hard for your money, don't buy this book. It is not interesting. It is not entertaining. It is not worth the money. The internet allows the common folk to put a hack like Harlan Coben out of business. Do not buy this book, buy a Tom Wolfe book or how bout Nick Hornsby, those are good writers.Harlan Coben blows. Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone pulled the rug out from under me.","review":"I really liked this book and had a hard time putting it down. A break to read a chapter turned into five chapters.The ending, however, left me completely unsatisfied. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not that good","review":"Grace Lawson picks up her developed roll of film only to find a strange 15 year old picture of her husband and friends stuck in the middle of the roll. When she confronts him with it he leaves the house and disappears without a trace. Drama involving bad guys ensues. The remainder cannot be easily described because it is completely unbelievable, and not in a shocking suspensful way.This was my second attempt at a Coben book and I have confirmed that I'm just not a fan. His books are mindless entertainment which is fine with me, but the plots are ridiculous to the point of distraction. Just One Look's story is so contrived that it makes it difficult to enjoy. I'm a big fan of the \\"whodoneit\\" genre, but Coben is not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"mixed review","review":"I found myself hooked by this book and the feeling lasted...until three quarters of the way through the novel. At that point I became a bit disappointed. I feel that the author got off track and did not know how to bring together a believable closing. Things got convoluted and there were too many convenient events and coincidences. I felt let down by the ending. However, the book is still very entertaining and I recommend it. It would be a good book to read on the beach...I agree that the book is poorly edited but I don't fault the author for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with Skip It--This one is awful","review":"I have enjoyed all of Coben's work but this one certainly had me wondering what kind of changes success is making in his attitudes. I couldn't decide who he had more contempt for: his own characters or me as the reader. This story was contrived, unbelievable, and unsatisfying. His tacked on surprise ending casting Grace in a dark role in her own tragedy was distasteful to say the least. His careless and senseless killing off of one person after another was even more so. The truth certainly didn't set any of these people free, everyone in the story was left impoverished and diminished, and for what? All in all the whole story just left me with a very bad taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same story once again","review":"If you've never read one of Harlan's books before you'll enjoy it very much. If you've read ANY of his books you'll find it is just the same recycled story every time. Even one story was so close to the other one if you changed some of the names the rest had chapters that were identical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just one look","review":"Great read. I couldn't put it down. Lost several nights sleep trying to finish it.

I particularly enjoyed the setting in Northern New Jersey, an area I am familiar with."},{"rating":"2","title":"One mighty fine book from Amazon","review":"Oh my goodness...what a terriffic book. You need to \\"Take Just One Look\\" and purchase one great read. I wish the book wouldn't have come to an end. Page after page the excitement just keeps building. This is one I will definately read again. I will most certainly purchase more of Harlan Coben's books from Amazon. I bought my Kindle Fire from Amazon. What a convienience to buy a book from same, and be reading it just moments later without even leaving my chair. Gotta go, I am buying the new Lee Child book next at Amazon. I won't even have to wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unrealistic But A Good Read","review":"This book's ending is a little unrealistic but it's still not a bad read. I love Harlan Coben's books but this isn't one of his best. The thing is if someone else would have written this book then I would have thought it was a pretty good book. So even though I have very high standards for Mr. Coben, I still have to give this book a good review. I enjoy the build up of the book but felt like he really rushed the ending. I did find the twists and turns that Coben is known for to be exciting but I wish there would have been more throughout the book instead of having most of them at the end. Overall, this is a quick read that will for the most part keep you interested. I would recommend this book to mystery readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soccer Moms","review":"If only Harlan would go back to what he does best, that is writing about Myron Bolitar or at least, something clever and amusing. This latest offering by Mr. Coben is the most commercial and uninteresting book yet. He obviously wants to appeal to all the soccer and stay at home moms out there who want to read about one of their own involved in a mystery. However, we really don't care about her, her husband or her neighbors. That's what this book is about, with an Asian murderer thrown in. The characters are not worth reading, or caring about. It took me about 4 attempts to finally finish this mess. Don't get me wrong, I love Harlan Coben books, having read them all, but this one is downright painful to read. Hopefully he will go back to his old style and former characters. However, if people keep clammering for this type of pap, then again, maybe he won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not His Best","review":"Having devoured the past three or four Coben books, I found Just One Look to be extremely disappointing and frankly boring. I kept reading the book in the hope that Coben's signature surprises and twists/turns would redeem the book. Unfortunately, such was not the case as the storyline is altogether implausible with characters that are hardly compelling. Finally, the story simply does not make sense. Hopefully, Coben's next book will be return to his previous efforts.If you're looking for other enjoyable authors pick up anything by Lee Child (Jack Reacher series) or Clinton McKinzie (Antonio Burns series)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Away!","review":"Who cares? Plot twists for their own sake just give you a headache. I good story where you care about the characters and care what happenes and why can benefit from such twists. But here, the twists are just to twist, like in a noose! I've read everything Harlan's written. Looks like he owned his publisher one. Looks like he played games with his plot just to show you he could. Looks like he puts in irrelevant suburban details to add pages to the plot. Looks like you should Tell No One about this book. I hope his talent isn't Gone For Good. After reading this book you may consider No Second Chance. But if you Look Away! you'll be grateful. This Fade Shot may be a Deal Braker."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Truly Awful Story","review":"This book was unbelievably bad. The author is a horrible writer and I have no idea how this made it onto the New York Times bestseller list. One of the things that made it especially frustrating was how he would constantly meander off topic to mention something completely mundane and unrelated to the plot. I specifically remember a dramatic chase scene in a supermarket where the author pauses to inform the reader why a supermarket keeps the milk and eggs at the back of the store.Because I was truly desparate for reading materiel, I finished this book. Trust me, it was not worth it. The characters were shallow and the scary mystery is not so scary after all. Avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"CONVOLUTED - UNSATISFYING - MESS","review":"I READ AUTHOR'S OTHER NOVELS, AND PURCHASED THIS WITH ENTHUSIASM. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT...

The Harlan Coben who gave us Myron Bolitar?Ugh.I'm about halfway through \\"Just One Look\\" and ready to cast it aside. This reads like the first-draft, fourth-rate, churn-'em-out dreck that litters bestseller lists (think Nora Roberts or Danielle Steel). Where's the trademark Coben snappy dialog? the informed insider's slant on topics like professional sports? the twisting yet plausible plots? the smart cynicism tinged with heart and style? Where's Big Cindy when we really need her?Harlan, we hardly knew ye."},{"rating":"1","title":"No pay-off","review":"I enjoyed the writing and I was quickly drawn into the story. I was eager to find out what happened, but I was very disappointed in how the mystery was solved. Perhaps Coben was particularly rushed or uninspired when he was writing the second half of this book. I stayed in it for the pay-off, but there was none.There is actually a scene that reads like an episode of Scooby-Doo, in which the answer to the biggest mystery, solved off-stage, is revealed to the culprit.I don't mind that the scary guy is Korean, but since people don't know his name, they (and therefore, the author) repeatedly refer to him only as \\"the Asian man.\\" Gracious.I'm curious enough to read another Coben book because I enjoy the \\"my life isn't what I thought it was\\" premise, but I hope I won't be wasting my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, Where did Harlen Coben go? This can't be HIS book!","review":"A lousy book. Having read the three books by Harlen Coben before this, I was relishing digging into this one. Those books kept me on edge--I literally couldn't stop turning the pages.This one, however, was a chore to get through. The continuity was horrible. The characters weren't very likeable. And the plot twists were, well, too twisty, like when you twist a piece of taffy too much and it gets so thin it falls apart. That's exactly what happens to this plot. It just falls apart.Somebody (it couldn't have possibly been the talented author of the previous novels, could it?) overworked this one to death!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad to the bone","review":"When I was about halfway through this book, I knew something was not right with it. Since Coben is a favorite of mine, I kept wondering: Did Coben really write this? So I came online to read other readers' reviews. That was helpful, especially the one- and two-star reviews, because those reviewers were saying the same things I was thinking as I was reading. Their reviews convinced me that it wasn't me - I wasn't crazy - and to plod on, realizing the book probably wasn't going to get any better, but I was curious enough to want to know just how bad it would turn out to be. The answer? BAD. Really, really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"just one look...yeah","review":"My first Coben book was a disappointment. The storyline started pretty good for this reader, but somewhere along the middle I got bored and realized I made a bad choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent start, weak ending","review":"In the end, the characters are just not believable.

Love his books.Thank you Harlan Coben"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Fantastic Read From Harlan!","review":"This author's characterization is never a disappointment. They are always fully-fleshed and leaping off the page. To me, this is a big plus when reading this kind of book.

YES","review":"So many authors' books get tiresome and repetitive after you read a few of them-but not Harlan Coben! Just One Look is his most masterful thriller yet. As always, I pick up one of his book late at night hoping to read 50 pages before going to bed, and end up staying up all night (and being a wreck at work) because I have to stay up and finish it. Great characters, the most intersting and credible plot yet, more twists and turns than Space Mountain, my only regret about this book was that it ended and I had to read other authors.I wont do a plot summary since there are many others, but let me say that this is THE BEST HARLAN COBEN YET!!!!! I only wish I didnt have to wait a year for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twisted Plot, Twisted Prose","review":"This guy needs to go take a creative writing class.The plot is somewhat interesting, but the writing style is rough. Coben constantly interrupts the story, going off on some insanely boring tangent, with no relation to the plot.When he introduces a new character, he buries us with pages of the character's biography. Throughout the novel, he puts us to sleep by dedicating several paragraphs to minutiae, such as the entire morning routine of a mother that has to feed her children and send them off to school (3 pages!). I guess he doesn't have enough to say, and has to fill the pages with something.This book could have used a good editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it!!!","review":"I've loved all 10 of Coben's previous novels, but this one is utterly AWFUL. It is convoluted and several notches below his usually high standards. Miss it.Maybe, with Connelly & Crais returning to their bread & butter characters, Coben should consider giving us a new Myron Bolitar mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Middle-class thriller","review":"I have read several Bolitar books, and a few of Coben's stand-alone books. This one falls into his \\"middle-class thriller\\" genre, where people just like you and me find themselves thrown into mysterious and/or deadly plots. The set-up of the plot is fine, but there are so many red herrings and tangled plot threads that it becomes hard to keep up with where Coben is taking us. At the end you'll be saying \\"huh?\\" or maybe \\"duh.\\"I got the feeling I was being \\"written down to,\\" as if he were trying too hard to show that he knows all about what life is like for parents and kids in suburbia. And you'll note that he makes more than one reference to characters in his Bolitar series. This one is not worth the time you'll take to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY SWEET MUSIC","review":"After I read one of the previous reviews, I felt I just HAD tooffer a review regarding this delightful CD! It is wonderful!Of course it differs a bit from hearing John Denver himself, because this is a grand compilation of his music, performed quite well, using instruments only---guitars, dulcimers, and mandolins. In NO WAY does this CD detract from Mr. Denver's music. If anything, this version of his music is a unique, a sweet, and a very wonderful addition to have for any John Denver fan. ENJOY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deliverance Meets Denver: A Bluegrass Butchering","review":"I bought this CD thinking that it was one of the many releases of Mr. Denver's songs that popped up everywhere following his tragic death. I, like so many of my generation, can relate events and people we were with when we first heard a particular song of Mr. Denver's. His music moved us and touched our hearts. I am the first to admit that I should have read the description of the album before purchasing it. This is not an album by John Denver. It is an attempt to turn his songs into hillbilly, barn dancing, bluegrass. One does not truly know the meaning of pain until they have listened to Annie's Song: You Fill Up My Senses being played on a banjo like the theme song from the movie Deliverance. On the other hand, if you enjoy sitting back in a rocking chair with a jug of moonshine this album is right up your alley. Needless to say I was not only disappointed but horrified at the way Mr. Denver's music was butchered."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i was expecting","review":"hey there. this was an odd purchase. it was cheap, which was the only good thing i guess. i apparently did not read the smaller print and didn't notice it was merely a tribute to John Denver, and not his ORIGINAL works. i wound up giving the cd to my mom and maybe she is enjoying it i guess. thankfully i have found a better hits CD in recent months, but this is nice enough if you like cheesy, playful tunes and get a bit bored with what's on your shelves. :/"},{"rating":"2","title":"Duck Toy","review":"My German Shepard loves the Duck sound that comes from the toy !

He only got it during supervised play time, and only for a few hours here and there, so there's no excuse for it being destroyed this quickly.Whoever came up with this \\"dog\\" toy either doesn't own a dog or has the laziest dog around, because I felt like it was put together for kids and not dogs.

The scanner works at very slow speed which could not be tolerated in a business setting. I clocked it at 2-3 ppm. Compare this to Fujitsu Scansnaps 18ppm. With the HP attachment you get a below average looking text in the pdf file even at higher quality settings. It looks somewhat blurry.

There are more than a few. However, most advanced CSS users should be able to spot the errors relatively quickly. But lets not concentrate on the errors.This book is one of the few CSS books that lives up to its title. This is a book on Mastering CSS, and is an advanced book on CSS (the only truly advanced CSS book that I am familiar with). I find myself re-reading this book quite frequently, to reacquaint myself with the information within. CSS is all about details and the results in multiple browsers.

It is laid out well, with a logical progression of topics. And it cleared up many misconceptions I personally had with how to use CSS. Unfortunately, CSS references on the internet often use bad techniques due to a misunderstanding of what some key declarations mean. In my attempts to emulate some of these techniques, I frequently found myself having to make large amounts of change for browser compatibility, etc. This book has shifted my perspective on how things should work. Since then, my time spent fine tuning has been minimal.I would highly recommend it to anyone who was self taught and having troubles getting things to work like desired. Great for beginners up to intermediate too. I think anyone who is truly advanced in CSS will be familiar with most of what is covered, but maybe not bad as a reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"A master's level course on CSS","review":"If I were to recommend one professional level book on CSS, this is it.

Take the \\"Advanced\\" part of the title seriously. But if you have your HTML and chops and a basic understanding of CSS, it definitely belongs on your bookshelf. Or if you're like me, it will be handy on your desk with coffee stains on the cover.

It did not work when I placed it twenty feet away, not to mention the fact that the manufacturer claims that it can be placed as far as 100 feet away!

Where was he in the intervening years? Theories, while varied, also contain many common elements. This video provides evidence of the possibility that Jesus traveled to India, Nepal, and Egypt to study and teach in those locations. This is in keeping with several other sources, such as Edgar Cayce, who state that Jesus was an \\"adept\\" in several mystical traditions. While this information will probably never be accepted by the Roman Catholic church or Christian Fundamentalists, it certainly gives pause to those willing to consider alternative points of view.

Also, you can really substitute one of these for a meal. I eat one for breakfast every day(I hate to get up early enough to eat breakfast)Like the other reviewer wrote, check with your doctor or diabetes educator before you try one, but they shouldn't have a problem with this product.So treat yourself to a Glucerna Chocolate Chunk bar.

I just don't get it! If they spoke good English, my opinion would be totally different. I am Latin and when I want to hear Paulina Rubio - SORRY FOLKS I PREFER HER IN SPANISH NOT IN HER RICKY RICARDO ENGLISH!I pray that Thalia (my other favorite latin singer) doesn't do this dumb crossover thing, IF IT ISN'T BROKEN WHY FIX IT PEOPLE!\\"I an de Bordeer'gil crossin the border in tha name of loove\\"..."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHE IS A STAR!!!!!!","review":"OK! this chica is on fire! if you love dance, or latin pop then, Paulina is your best bet!

I admire her for wanting to do her crossover but honestly 2 good songs in english are not enough. If you have the chance purchase the singles for \\"Don't say goodbye\\" and \\"Fire\\", nothing else is worth listening, oh, yeah, in spanish \\"Si tu te vas\\" and \\"Todo mi amor\\".

Like J.Lo, she is somewhat thin voiced but still loaded with musicality. One can tell that she's not totally comfortable singing in English yet, as the lyrics sound a bit forced. The Spanish tracks, however, flow much better. Despite these flaws, this disc is still fun, full of energy, and dance floor ready. Paulina does not write any of her own music on this album, which doesn't help her. Writing her own music could help her find her own voice and sense of style. 'Border Girl' and 'Don't Say Goodbye' are my fave tracks. They're easy and fun to listen to say the least! Some critics are picking on Paulina because the lyrics are light weight and, what they call, 'Fluffy.' I say, 'Who cares!' If every singer was like Alanis Morissette and Melissa Etheridge, with their deeply personal and meaningful lyrics, the world would simply go nuts! Paulina's music is light, fun and relaxing.

I did like Shakira's CD as well but Paulina manages to come across with less of a yodel to her voice that Shakira has all but trademarked.Instead, she lashes into her songs with a real energy and verve that hooked me. I have to say that her cover of \\"I Was Made for Loving You\\" was worth buying the album for. Say what you will of cover songs and I know some won't like it but it's orchestrated with an instant hook that snagged me and once she starts up the melody I was through the roof.Like Shakira, Paulina includes a few Spanish language versions of her songs and once again, these versions come off better than their translations.While I don't think all the songs are totall winners, it is still MORE than worth it's price and several songs are going to be top hits like Track #1 already is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurl, Hurl","review":"My gosh, who in the world allowed this \\"singer\\" to make such an awful album? I was hyped by \\"Don't Say good bye\\" (which Paulina pronounces as \\"Don say goo by\\") ans decided to buy the album--with unfortunate results! This CD is not worth buying or even listening to it. From start to finish, Paulina's accent is so strong that you can't tell what she's saying. Her interpretations of originally Spanish tracks in English sound misplaced and they are simply a desperate attempt to lure US listeners into what Spanish listeners liked more than two years ago. NOticing the large number of used copies of this album on amazon.com make me realize that most people that have bought it realized their mistake a little too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD!","review":"I like this CD a lot.

More Like 'Dance Diva'","review":"The latest in the seemingly endless line of Latino performers to attempt the almight \\"crossover\\", Paulina Rubio's debut may surprise some looking for Latin-tinged pop. It's here, to be sure, but this Mexican bombshell also traffics in savvy dance-club beats, typified by the entrancing first single 'Don't Say Goodbye', as well as 'Fire' and the wonderfully catchy 'I'll Be Right Here(Sexual Lover)'. She also appears equally at ease with straight-ahead pop, evidenced in such tracks as 'Not That Kind Of Girl'and the title cut. Vocally,her grasp of English gets in the way on more than one occasion, and her voice lies somewhere in the middle between JLO(far better) and Shakira(not quite there). Overall, though it's not as ambitious as Shakira's LAUNDRY SERVICE, the close proximity of musical styles found here makes it the more consistent album of the two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Paulina Rubios Border Girl proved to me that I should not buy an album after loving only one song. When Don't Say Goodbye came out, I instantly fell in love with it. I figured, the whole album has got to be incredible. I was wrong. The rest of the album is so boring, so overproduced I immediately regretted buying it and wished I bought the CD single. Paulina does have a unique voice and she has excellent presence in her videos, but I wish she had chosen better material. It's like her producers wanted her to be the next Britney Spears so they thew together a bunch of bad pop songs to get her noticed in the US. What she should have done is gone the Shakira route or even the Christina Aguilera route and gotten some good writers and producers and put together an outstanding album that would have proven to the world Paulina Rubio has arrived.

Wait a moment, was it English or Chinese? I could not tell if it was English. Her accent is horribly bad and Chinese-like. The music was boring and the vocals where imposible to understand. If you hear one of her songs and hear the word \\"weed\\" it's not \\"weed\\" but \\"with\\", but her accent is so bad that you can't even understand it. The only good song, in my opinion, was \\"Si Tu Te Vas\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE VOICE!!!!!","review":"I'm sorry, but Paulina needs to learn how to pronounciate english words corretly. I was listeing to her songs and I was not able to understand a word. The worst thing is that they dont include the lyrics, which make it all that worse. Now, whats up with her just translating all her old songs into english and calling it \\"Border Girl\\"? Adding 2-3 songs, to old material does not make for a hot selling album."},{"rating":"1","title":"border girl UGH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"paulina has crossed a border too many. Her english is bad and i could hear it in every single word she was even off key in many songs of hers. some beats were nice beat but there should be no singing unless its in spanish which i think she shold jsut quit singing but as for english i think we are looking forward to shakira and gloria estefan maybe thalia who has more talent in acting , dancing and singing but paulina sorry work on your english and music skills and please refund me my money ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, Meaningless, Overproduced garbage","review":"When will this end?

Yep, as Paulina says: \\"There are not rules when it all comes down to pop music.\\"This album is way better than Shakira's, honestly. Buying this CD will be the best thing you can do.

When I popped in this CD, I expected a salsa style dance CD, however, after the first two songs it sounded more like Avril Lavigne mixed with old Britney Spears. I absolutely love the first two songs, but the rest is no good. If you are thinking of buying this CD, resist the temptation of \\"Don't Say Goodbye\\" and say hello to Shakira or Thalia."},{"rating":"1","title":"La Chica Mojada Is Back With One Good Song","review":"This is Paulina Rubio's first \\"English\\" (if we can call it) album. It includes eleven songs in English and five in Spanish. At first I thought that Paulina's English was better, until I heard this album. I could not understand what she said. And even worse, the lyrics were not even included. In this album, \\"weed\\" actually means \\"with\\".Anyway, the songs in this album are not impressing. Have you heard \\"Si Tu Te Vas\\" (the Spanish version of \\"Don't Say Goodbye\\")? Well, if you have, that's the best song you'll hear out of this album. \\"I'll Be Right Here (Sexual Lover)\\", \\"Fire (Sexy Dance)\\", \\"The Last Goodbye\\", and \\"Not That Kind of Girl\\", are all songs of her past Spanish album which Paulina Rubio renewed in English with different sounds. I wouldn't reccommend this album. Just download \\"Si Tu Te Vas\\" if you're still not tired of hearing it...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best","review":"This is a great party album. You've got a little bit of everything to entertain all your guests. She's included pop, hip hop, dance, rock, and a slow ballad. Her voice easily adapts to the style of music at hand. I can listen to this CD over and over. I'm glad I bought Border Girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for one good new song","review":"I like si tu te vas, it's catchy and more like the old Paulina.Her latest cd in Spanish- Paulina was the best thign out there. It is hard to listen to most of these songs. They are really lame and really hurt my ears. The songs in English have no quality. I don't see why they were translated. They sound odd and have lost any touch in English. I think people would enjoy the songs in Spanish even if they didn't understand it, because music transcends many borders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful text","review":"Don't waste any money on buying this book.

The controls are wonky. You can go to the car door and press the action button and nothing happens. The car chases are pretty bad, too. You could be close to catching up to a car only to have it disappear. Or you could be far from a car and it reappears. The out-of-car experience is just as bad. You could be coming towards an enemy and he will just stay put like he doesn't see you. Overall, this game is pretty bad. It feels like they rushed up to put this out. If you want to play a decent Driver game, you should try Driver: Parallel Lines. I found that to be a big improvement over this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was SO close to being a good game","review":"I bought this game expecting to be amazed at how cool the graphics looked....

I find it so funny how people who don't even own the game come on here and say that it's such a great game. I bought this game along with Metal Slug Advanced and Wolfenstein 3-D. I can promise you that I will not be playing \\"DRIV3R\\" any time soon. Not to mention, I'm gonna buy Doom 1 & 2 soon, so this game is gonna be gathering dust for the next 10 years on my shelf.

The controls are so bad that I found myself ready to throw my Game Boy Advance down. It was frustrating. Couple that with the trial-and-error design of this game and I was left a frustrated man. The other review I notice is supposedly from a child. Isn't this game rated \\"M\\"? This game also has the worst computer controlled A.I. You can drive right past the police cars.

I thought this book was boring but I think this book would be good for people that want to travel to Denmark. It talks about how to live in Denmark and how to communicate. it talks how good the jobs and how to get into them.The reason why I thought this book was boring was because I wasn't getting into the book. I would rather read a story book about denamrk. This book only had facts about it but if you really want to know how people are in denmark this would be a good book. This book would also be a really good book it you are doing research on Denmark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the Serious Dane to Be","review":"As a to be exchange student to be next year I had been looking for a book on Denmark that was more than just a travellers guide to the sights. I found the book to be a very helpful insight into Danish culture.

You've written the absolute, hands-down WORST book I've ever read!!I don't understand how a book like this could ever get published. Much less obtain any praise from anyone!! The positive reviews must have been from the author and her friends.This book is badly written, pointless, unfocused, and most of all is drop dead boring. I'm just grateful that I only paid 99 cents for it in a used bookstore and the author got nothing from the sale!!!! I fed it to the shredder since it doesn't deserve a place on my book shelf. Seriously!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down, a great ride!","review":"My girlfriend bought this and I picked it up out of curiosity, expecting to flip through it and put it right down. But from the first page, I was hooked. I didn't move for the next five hours. It's an amazing story, funny, real, incredibly sexy, and inspiring. It makes you appreciate your partner, if you have one. If you don't, it gives you hope. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassingly bad!","review":"Boy, was I disappointed. Maybe because I loved \\"Loose Change\\" so much(admittedly, I read and loved it almost 20 years ago), I expected something deep, something insightful - but instead all I got was a shlocky romance novel written by someone with Ivy league credentials(I know that, because she beats us readers over the head with them.) All I could think of when I read this book was how mortified her real-life children must have been when they read sentences like \\"Zack started pumping for the finish line and I wrapped myself around him as he barreled to the edge and leapt off.\\" I'm 40 years old and all I can say about a sentence like that is \\"Gag me with a spoon!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I was let down!","review":"I too read an encouraging review of this book and purchased it with great anticipation. As I read it, I got more and more annoyed. I really liked Pam Houston's \\"Cowboy's Are My Weakness\\" (boy, do I like cowboys or what?) and thought it would be similar. Wrong. It read like a Dr. Quinn episode with a lot more sex. Zack was sometimes sexy but mostly creepy, and Sara was annoying and self indulgent. The first rock I pulled on amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unchallenging, superficial","review":"I picked this up at the library and can't wait to exchange it for something else. The premise sounded so appealing; I was eager to read something meaningful that explored Romance at Middle Age, Improbable Matches, Overcoming Obstacles . . . what I got instead was a sense that Sara, like locker room boys, has to affirm her desirability and sexuality by sharing the graphic details with the world. I'm no prude, but as she once told her son, \\"That's private.\\" And why does it seem that she is the only one who does any self-examination, hard thinking, adaptation? I so longed for her to tell Zack what HE had to be to \\"run with her.\\" He challenges her, but there's not much mention of how SHE challenges HIM. The relationship may be unorthodox, but the only \\"meat\\" to it seems to exist in the bedroom. (Pun intended.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing. Just not a very good read.","review":"I enjoy reading a well-written modern day romance story and looked forward to this book with anticipation. Disappointingly, it was slow and unsatisfying and never revealed much about the characters. I felt that the \\"half fiction/half autobiography\\" sell was cheap. It seemed like an ego-piece for the writer and very boring for the rest of us. If you want a good cowboy love story read \\"Hank and Chloe\\" by Joanne Mapson. Now THAT is enjoyable, well-written fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow - boring","review":"Mary Chapin Carpenter does not sing \\"Independence Day\\" - Martina McBride does. She got a bum - not a real cowboy. Being born and raised in the West, this is not your typical cowboy, he's a bum. Makes all the hard working, independent, financially responsible real cowboys look bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A romantic novel that goes deep into real love.","review":"I find good novels mix fact and fiction. Ask Tom Clancy or John Grisham. Sara mixes a relationship and spices it up enough to keep the interest continual and \\"hopeful\\" for the rest of us that dream.... As a cowboy, yes, there are those of us who are well read and romantic. After many hard days, I come home to a beautiful wife of 15 years who calls me a \\"hopeless romantic\\". Keep it going Sara!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Having loved a real cowboy, this is a really phony story","review":"I was SO disappointed in this book! I had looked forward to reading it and was very disappointed in the superficial treatment of what could have been a terrific story. I wanted to turn the kids over my knee because they were so spoiled and the woman seemd more concerned about her wardrobe than her lovelife. And even Zach seemed so one-dimensional and predictable and very un-cowboy like. She seemed to enjoy making fun of his lack of education and social skills. I felt no sympathy or liking for any of the characters. Cowboys are amazing people and the possibilities of romance with them are so \\"interesting\\" - Ms. Davisdon really left us cowboy lovers with a pretty limp rope! Rosemary Anderson"},{"rating":"2","title":"Provocative and Honest","review":"I loved this book, because it provoked me (thus, \\"provocative\\") to look at romance in a new way, to see that the hackneyed rules for choosing a mate can be stultifying. I've always had a soft spot for cowboys myself; now if I could just find one! Sara Davidson is a marvelous writer, with a quick wit, a warm heart and an honest mind. A rare combination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and honest","review":"I twice picked this book up in the library but didn't check it out. It sounded like another story of an older woman who has a fling, leaves him, and gains wisdom from the affair--this is NOT that book! Thankfully I did pick it up a third time, check it out, and read it in one sitting. The characters are honest and well drawn, complex and tender. The story was one any single parent can relate to, any woman aging and still vibrant, any person who feels jaded by love. A very compelling story from a good writer. I'm buying my own copy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, bored me to death","review":"I was totally intrigued by the basic story, that's why I bought the book. Since I share many of Ms. Davidson's outer circumstances I expected to be carried away with her love story. Unfortunately she bored the hell out of me, not only with bad writing, but also her condescending attitude towards everybody \\"beneath\\" her. As an actor I feel insulted, I've been an extra many times, and no, we don't go on talking about a handshake for months. I expect a lot more wisdom from anybody claiming to be so spiritual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy & Entertaining - but typical","review":"I bought this book for a light easy read - it was. I got kind of frustrated with how typical the main characters were and how predictable the story lines were. Nothing was discussed in depth; not the main characters during sex, conversation, at work, their families, nothing. I felt things were glossed over. I can't imagine how difficult it would be to write about something like this that actually happened to you, still I felt it was kind of flat and predictable. Zack came into Sara's life, they had great sex, he gets her kids to behave, she gets spooked by the relationship's responsibilities, and ultimately goes off to find him after he leaves."},{"rating":"1","title":"ridiculous and phony","review":"I worked as a cowboy for six years, and Davidson's \\"cowboy\\" seems like nothing of the sort, to me. A) I don't think real, working cowboys are all that romantic, as they are usually tired and often somewhat chauvinistic. B) Her fawning over his \\"rough\\" character makes me want to vomit. Please, Sara, spare us your mid-life crisis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploits Zack and her children for a fast buck!","review":"I was eager to read the juicy book, as it received fairly decent reviews; so I asked my library to order it. I did read it but ended up skimming most of the last part. I kept thinking that she wrote this book because her show was being canceled and she wanted to continue living her affluent life in Los Angeles. What better than a quick and dirty book! One wonders what her children thought of their involvement in the book. Zack probably didn't mind being exploited because a best seller would assure the continuation of his easy lifestyle."},{"rating":"2","title":"It dispells how re-incarnation was removed from Christianity","review":"This was an excellent book with excellent information that clarifies a lot on how the teachings on re-encarnation (tought in hinduism, for example) came to be removed from the orginal teachings in early Christianity. Gives a lot of history that on what happened to a faction of early christian mystics that followed the teachings of Christ and how politics got involved in to what you are now tought. A most read for anyone who wants to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Introduced Me to New Ideas","review":"When I read this book in 2001, it was my first exposure to the concept of reincarnation. At the time, I was steeped in a Christian belief system that did not allow for open-minded thinking of such things as explained in this book. But, I was searching because I had sadly began to realize that I had been disillusioned by the fear-based dogma of the churches I had been attending.This book opened my eyes and introduced me to new ways of thinking and I have continued to search for truth wherever it exists for me ever since. I appreciate this book because it helped me move forward on my spiritual path and accept other people's beliefs without judgment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Effective in a negative way.","review":"This book was only effective in forcing me to seek out any other book on the subject. The history she went over I have no problem with. It is everything else that I find quite annoying. She seems to ignore alternatives to how she interperets scripture and what one person says about reincarnation, being born again, life before this current one, etc.She also ignores concepts, themes, and issues that today may shed light on the subject. She doesn't address or let the readers know of any other authority on the subject, which to me, makes me that much more skeptical of her credibility and ability to write on the topic.I feel that I am alone in this and that is fine, each book affects each person differently. I guess I was just looking for more, and the author(s) didn't deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God, the Truth is still alive!","review":"This book is written in simple language and is engrossing from the first page. Well written and a very good account about the early teachings of Christianity, which was wiped out by the power hungry clergy and monarchy of the times. It is very logical that Christ taught reincarnation and also taught the techniques to achieve oneness with God, by discovering the hidden divinity within each and every one of us. These teachings of Christ must be explored, studied and revived. Every Christian must read this book at least once and then decide for themselves why they should or should not believe in reincarnation and attaining oneness with God within us. Remember that Jesus was to be named Emmanuel which means \\"God with us\\". That could be a clue to the Truth, that God is truly with us because he is inside us."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Probably\\"","review":"I agree with much of the other feedback from \\"Dallske\\" and there is ALOT of info missing in explaining any true facts.

However, to give this film it's due, it was beautifully costumed, scripted, and acted.

That being said, if you enjoy gothic, elegant and deliberately slow paced movies you will probably like Bluebeard. I would like to have seen more melodrama at certain points which would have lent a lively kicker to a few spots but I found no significant weak elements worth mentioning. The best way to view this movie is to NOT read the short story first so that you will discover it as the movie plays out and will enjoy the suspense even more. Overall a fine movie for those who have the patience to see it through."},{"rating":"1","title":"the bluebeard","review":"The known fairy tale but with some good dose of ugliness, and cruelty. We know that the fairy tale too is cruel but the covered cruelty in this film is unbelievable. Mothers don't make the mistake to show this film to your kids.

Women of the 17th Century carried a role within the society in which they were able to stand up, to be a woman. They were able to lift their heads despite what the men had said of the time period. Women were able to gain custody of their children, marry the man they love and become much more of a customary woman that what had been perceived. Antonia Fraser's historically written book justifies the idea that women truly played a role within the society that was not forfeited. The question she had asked, \\"were there women in the 17th century?\\" Yes, yes there were, and Antonia Fraser proved it. Historically, in a fictional manner in a non-fiction piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"More to be desired","review":"The book arrived before I expected it. It was intact and appeared clean.

The glue apparently is dry and ineffective. The book will continue to fall apart page by page until book repairs are made or until I take it to be repaired. It is not usable or readable as is and attempting to puruse page content is unenjoyable at best. I have never experienced a paperback falling apart in this manner. One or two of my old, old paperbacks (some are 35-40 years old) have come apart at sections of the book but never page-by-page as this book has come apart.

In fact I'd rate it the best MySQL reference out there when using MySQL as a coder. But if your looking for this book to tell you how to manage MySQL look on, this book is not for you! It's pretty weak in that area (as is the official MySQL documentation). But again, as a programmer I've found this book invaluable as a resource and would never be without it. I'd recommend it for novices and advanced users."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of In-Depth Information","review":"I generally love the O'Reilly books because they tend to be very thorough and have lots of practical code examples, but this book was a big disappointment to me. I was easily frustrated by this book. As a beginner to MySQL and database programming, I was completely lost whenever I tried to apply something to my own projects. The explanations given here are very brief and the authors often send you elsewhere for more in-depth discussion. I wound up doing most of my research online and just using the SQL reference chapter to look-up query syntax. I give it two stars because it did help me get started, but I'd say this is a poor reference for anyone looking for in-depth coverage."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is NOT for managing MySQL","review":"The book title is completely mis-leading.

I regret I bought it, because I was looking for info to \\"manage\\" MySQL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than the 1st edition","review":"This book is a significant improvement over the 1st edition (which was titled MySQL & mSQL), mainly because it focuses directly on MySQL instead of focusing on the differences between MySQL and mSQL.

The word REPLICATION isn't even in the book's Index (I skimmed the book and didn't see it covered anywhere in the text either), and MySQL's Replication Functionality is one of its most valuable features for fault tolerance! Also, the book is ambiguous on other Fault Tolerance issues. For example, on page 74 the book says to \\"store the binary logs on the same device as the backups\\". Binary logs are generated real-time as incremental updates between the nightly dumps - the book makes no effort to explain how to replicate those logs real-time to a separate server. If you're going to buy only one book on MySQL, I'd suggest Atkinson's book: core MySQL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book for introduction to MySQL","review":"This book was excellent for my need: I had used SQL before but didn't know much of anything about relational databases let alone MySQL. I am in the process of building a web application that reports survey data. It will tell you everything you need to know to get started with a small to mid-size database.Best of all, this book is well written, clear, the examples are GREAT and if you cut out the portions that are not relevant to you (for me this was security and the sections on PHP and Perl to name a few) you can literally learn all you need to know to get started in less than two weeks of studying for a few hours per day. Amazing value.The portions of the book on MySQL itself are not obviously dated, but the Python DB API interface has changed (to version 2.0) since this book was written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent guide and reference","review":"This book covers MySQL at a good level of both depth and breadth.

For what ever reason WITH NO ONE AS A WITNESS took me forever to read and maybe because of this long often interrupted stretch of reading time I had to keep turning back to figure out which of the minor characters was which. On the positive side George's great detectives, Havers and Lynley, get a lot of time, the mystery is compelling to at least near the end and the author certainly pays attention to detail. Yet this is not the \\"pageturner\\" some of her earlier books were. As to the great \\"shock\\" I like some other reviewers found it to be a bit contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not believe this was Elizabeth George","review":"This book was overly long and rambling. The characters did not seem the same people as previous books. It is hard to believe Elizabeth George wrote this book as the style is so different from previous books. I skipped over pages and finally read the ending as I could not read the whole book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Topsy turvy","review":"This is the first Elizabeth George novel I've read and I think it is terrific and am going to read some more George novels. So many novels today are mere outlines but George develops all the characters in detail. Perhaps there was one or two references to characters in movies that we were supposed to refer to. Perhaps not. The ending was not very satisfying but neither is life. The touch and feel of London was great. Actually the ending wasn't very good. The villan Hillier got away with everything and our hero was defeated.

The writer gives us an overly-complex plot and a murder story that is just plain confusing and implausible. It's full of annoying mistakes and, of course, kills off a main character that I felt was essential to the balance of the story. I can't imagine any direction the series can go now that will hold my interest. I'm voting \\"nO' with my pocketbook: from now on, I'll read her books at the library and spend my hard-earned cash on more consistently reliable writers like Donna Leon, PD James, or Ruth Rendell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will it ever end?","review":"I am only about 100 pages into this book, and already wondering if it will ever end. It is boring. Beyond boring. I read the last chapter hoping that it will spice up, but it seems tragic and senseless rather than interesting. I'm giving up on Ms. George before we get going, I'm afraid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"It took me two years to finish this book. I adore Elizabeth George and always eagerly await her next novel. But, this book was so boring that I kept putting it down and picking it up and putting it down and picking it up. Very unusual for me to do. I have to confess that I read the \\"What Came Before He Killed Her\\" before I finished this novel. That book was far more palatable, but, overlong as is this book. By the time I finished both books I really didn't care \\"who did it.\\" I must admit that I felt very sad at what happened. I will not give it away in case anyone reading this posting has not read either book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fallen off my \\"favorite author\\" list","review":"Elizabeth George turns in another over complicated mystery. The plot is by turns boring and over-wrought, the villan is unconvincing, and she kills off a main character in a way that has nothing to do with the rest of the plot and is utterly implausible. With No One as Witness is a deeply unsatisfying book that reeks of the author's fatigue or boredom. Not worth the money -- not even in paperback. If you must read it, get it from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems Like Old Times (Thank Heavens)","review":"Having been so hard on Ms George's last book, I felt compelled to report that she is back on track with another page turner featuring my favorite characters Lynley and Havers. Although she dropped the requisite hints along the way, the ending had a really twisting turning journey to the identification of the killer. There was another plot twist that left some dangling threads but we will have to wait until the next book.Ms. George always features a social ill that she lends light on during the course of her books. In this case although the reviewer mentions racism, I felt it was more of an expose of throwaway children, who are often lost in the cracks of parents' problems and organizational red tape. This made the group of victims quite sympathetic and the killer even more evil for having preyed upon those who had little defense.I'm happy to report that Ms. George's latest book is one that her fans will enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd Have Given It Zero Had That Been An Option","review":"This author painstakingly created 5 core characters who were five of the most memorable characters in detective fiction. In one stroke of the pen, she has totally obliterated all of it. George is, of course, the one who created these characters, and she certainly owes nothing to the readers, so she can certainly write their histories however she wants. However, as someone who has read all the books in this series, largely because of the relational aspects of these five wonderful characters, I find it very difficult to even conceive of reading another book in this series. In fact, she'd be much better off using this book as the end of this series, which she could certainly do given the ending, and start something new. There was just no excuse for what she did in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired of tragedy as an excuse for drama","review":"While in all other respects this is as good as any of her novels, I am giving this one star to protest a trend among my former favorite authors. In these times, who wants the depressing endings and tragedy-laden plots that these people keep dishing out? Is there no other way to keep a series interesting? One of this author's best gifts was the creation of multi-faceted, interesting and humorous characters who her readers came to care about. If I wanted to see one of the best of them axed, I could go read Stephen King. The ending was totally unnecessary. I hated it. I am not even interested to see how other characters adapt to it in future novels. I don't care to invest my time in this any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Emotional Journey for Lynley","review":"WITH NO ONE AS WITNESS is really like two books in one, a crime story and Detective Inspector Lynley's personal story. The crime story, which involved the serial killing of \\"at-risk\\" adolescent boys, was not really a compelling narrative. I usually love Elizabeth George books, but it dragged in many parts and the first half of the book seemed like a bit of a chore to read. What really saved this book was Thomas Lynley's personal story. I don't want to give anything away, but I will say it involved quite a shock. The second half of the book picked up tremendously. Series readers will get the full emotional effect of the events. Elizabeth George is an excellent author, and I hope next time the crime around which the crime revolves will the more engaging.First half of book: 3 starsSecond half of book: 5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"GEORGE FAN","review":"I HAVE BEEN AN ELIZABETH GEORGE FAN FOR YEARS,AND HAVE FOLLOWED THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALL HER UNIQUE CHARACTERS.

I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly disappointing","review":"In this novel, Elizabeth George shatters the quintet of main characters that has given strength and interest to her long running detective series. By killing off Helen Clyde (surely this is no longer a spoiler) she seems decided to make either the perpetually aggrieved Barbara Havers or the dreary Simon/Deborah couple the centerpiece of any future books - even though earlier books that didn't feaure Lynley have sold dramatically less well. It looks like her absorption with \\"growing as an author\\" has caused her to badly misjudge why people bought her books. Witness ended on a dark and dreary note that only bodes ill for future books. I recommend that George fans start looking for another favorite author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Ms. George's books have usually kept me reading to the very end unable to put the book down until finished. I found this book plodding, repetetive and I had to force myself to finish it. Barbara Havers was still the one bright and interesting character, but the rest were just boring. While the end was sad and depressing, Lynley's character needs more depth and color and this might take it in that direction. I hate giving an Elizabeth George book 2 stars because I have had so much enjoyment from the previous ones, but this one became tiresome."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's FICTION, folks!","review":"Her best in years (let's just forget those last two, shall we?)I got such a laugh reading the comments from readers who are INCENSED at the \\"alteration\\" of one of the core characters. It's FICTION, folks, and Ms George gets to write her plots and characters any way she sees fit! I just hope she is taking all of this \\"huff\\" as a compliment. It's her skill in writing evocative and interesting characters that is causing all the ado.I hope this isn't the last Lynley novel. But I'll read WHATEVER Elizabeth George writes next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse book George has written","review":"This is the last book written by George that I will buy. I bought, read and enjoyed all her earlier titles. Her choice for whom to kill off and the effects on Lynley and Havers indicate to me that she is trying to end/kill off the series. Otherwise, why would she make such a cruel decision? Her rightful choices as a writer for this title prompt me to use my rightful choice as reader to write her off."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I have read every one of Elizabeth George's Lynley series, so it was with anticipation that I sat down to read her latest. Before I had read many pages, I found myself getting bored. By the time I was halfway through the book, I gave up on it and read the last 40-50 pages, which are harrowing but, to me, a disappointment. I felt that killing off a major character -- or two characters, as the case was -- is a quick and dirty way of keeping the series going. Come on -- how often does something like that happen in real life? The thing I have liked about George's previous novels is that they had a ring of truth -- that this is the way life really is. Now that she's joined the serial killer bandwagon like almost every other mystery writer, I think she has lost her unique voice. The jury's still out on whether I will read her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm giving up on George","review":"I really did LOVE this series- bought them in hardcover, which I never do for other books. I thought the last one was weak, but I was even more extremely disappointed with this one. Part of what made George fabulous was the insight into all her characters- the detectives, the victims, the killers. She was great at creating the little details, the shades of gray, of helping us understand how these people got to where they were. Not anymore. Now we have random killings, no understanding of the killer, no insight into our beloved friends and their situations. Is she inflicting agony on the characters (and us) because she's running out of plots? Has she forgotten how to build a good plot? I'm not sure why this series has changed, but I do know it's not worth it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disappointing book","review":"I have never written a book review before but feel compelled to warn potential readers -- especially those familiar with earlier books by Elizabeth George -- how disapointing this book is. First of all, her serial killer plot is weak, weak, weak. She never convincingly describes the killer's motivations, or makes him truly scary. (If you want serial killers, go to Ruth Rendall or thomas Harris for a real thrill.) Second, her killing off of Helen was a bad decision that will, in my opinion, permanently weaken -- or kill off -- the series. The contrast she set up between the growing love of the Lynley couple provided an absolutely necessary counterweight to the darkness of her plots. How odd that she didn't understand that. And what a cop-out to have Helen killed by some random person. I'd have given this book 0 stars if possible, and I'll never spend money on a George novel again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shocking betrayal","review":"As another reviewer noted, this book is too long by at least 200 pages, but most loyal readers wouldn't mind that.What loyal readers will mind is that the author deals with a major supporting character in an unexpected, cruel and random way that winds up being completely unjustified by the rest of the plot. I've read this series from the beginning, but I won't be reading the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, disappointing, perplexing","review":"Curious that Elizabeth George would consider herself unequal to the challenge of writing about a happy marriage. In earlier works, she fearlessly took on subjects, such as the Pakistani experience in the UK, that are manifestly much father away from what she knows; or, as in A Place of Hiding, took the highly risky approach of leaving her main character out of the story at all. Yet her courage failed her before the creative challenge of writing well about happiness, and she took the low road of simply killing off Lynley's wife. The result is a short-term storm of interest (the publicity around the plot was enormous) bought at the price of a permanent loss of the interest, the vital balance of light against darkness, that held the series together. With No One as Witness was depressing, disappointing, and perplexing; and the outlook forfuture books from this author is unappetizing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Betrayed and manipulated","review":"While Ms. George delivers an intriguing tale about a serial killer of young boys populated by our regular cast of characters of Lynley, Havers, Nkata, Simon and Deborah, she left this reader feeling betrayed when she killed off Lynley's wife Helen and their unborn child. Clearly this was an author manipulation to keep Lynley isolated and conflicted, but in the process, she's lost this long-time reader of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I loved \\"What Came Before He Shot Her\\". The character development was superb as was the development of the locale ambience. But this book is just the opposite: skimpy character development relying on cliches. And the story line is like \\"number 4 hold the mayo\\" serial killer crime story: been there, seen that 100 times."},{"rating":"2","title":"One superb book","review":"So far, I have read about six of Elizabeth George's Inspector Lynley books, but this one is the best, in fact, one of the best mystery novels I have ever read. Ms. George is a genius! And this one, in addition, is a terribly sad one; although the crimes are solved and the matter reconciled, there is no happy resolution to the horrendous murders committed for no apparent reason, other than some sort of maniacal obsession. This gives the novel added depth, as it points out all too terribly well the senselessness of crimes of this nature. Highly recommended.On another note, I wonder if Ms. George got the name Thomas Lynley from the 18th-century English composer of that name."},{"rating":"1","title":"long detailed boring premise","review":"usually I like Elizabeth George and I am fond of her Insp Linley but he is hardly in this book. The main character was not believable and Barbara Havers was pushed off to the side. I couldn't wait to finish this book and only finished it to see what happened to Linley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent writing","review":"I found the writing to be excellent in this novel by Elizabeth George. While this is a long running series, this is my first book to read. While the book sometimes points toward events in the past, I did not feel I had missed essential points, but instead was encouraged to read the volumes which has come before. This book about a serial killer of adolescent boys has a great deal of grit to it and definitely is not a cozy. I think the closest comparison I can make as to others authors may be Louise Penny with a great deal more grit and nastiness in both language and subject matter. I find both of them to be excellent writers, however. And just as I enjoy Penny's forays into French phrases, I also enjoyed George's British phraseology. I found this to be a 4.5 star offering only because it starts a little slow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Home Run!","review":"Author George really hits one out of the ballpark in this novel, quite possibly the best in the Lynley/Havers series. In addition to writing an enthralling mystery, George managed to make me care about these familiar characters in a whole new way. The book was deliciously long, and I couldn't wait to gobble up a few more pages every time I had a spare moment over the past two weeks: stoplights became a pleasure! I am most definitely no softie, but the last few pages actually brought tears to my eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a Pre-review","review":"Having read all of Ms. George's books, I am looking forward to reading With No One As Witness, so this is not a review in the true sense of the word.. According to articles in the morning paper, many fans are terribly disappointed in this book because Ms. George kills off one of the major characters.One of the worst days of my life was when Patricia Cornwell (another author I have followed from the beginning) killed off one of the major characters in her Point of Origin. But I gave her another chance, continued with the next few books and voila - a miracle occurred - it was all a ruse.So, let's give the gal another chance -- don't abandon her wonderful plots and characters for this seeming betrayal of her public. Ms. George will continue to broaden and grow in her work, and I am sure we will all be delighted with her progress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Been a George fan for a long time...","review":"I am not ashamed to admit it...been a fan of this writer (seems like) forever, smile. I think all of her stories are just terrific, and With No One As Witness is no exception! Loved it! Loved it! Loved it! You will too."},{"rating":"1","title":"another perspective","review":"I was astonished, as many other reviews seem to be. However, I was also very disappointed, and am probably through with Elizabeth George for at least a few books. I wish someone had given me a heads up - sometimes a \\"spoiler\\" can be a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elizabeth George has lost her touch","review":"Once again, Elizabeth George has turned her back on the kind of mystery that made her reputation and produced a novel that is too long, overburdened by subplots, and curously riddled by factual errors. This time, she attempts a psychopathic serial killer novel, but falls far short of the level set by masters such as Ruth Rendell or James Patterson. The killer is neither creepy nor sympathetic, and is not even responsible for the most crucial death in the book. After three mediocre books, George seems unable to turn out another mystery like the early ones that were so highly acclaimed. It seems that this author, who fearlessly takes on subjects (such as the Pakistani experience in Britain) utterly removed from her realm of experience, was undone by the challenge of writing about a happily married Lynley."},{"rating":"1","title":"I find it difficult","review":"I find it difficult to believe that dedicated fans of Elizabeth George could be satisfied with her latest effort. Since her first book, I have eagerly looked forward to the next and even though I felt that she cheated us with With No One As Witness, I will most likely give her one more try, if or when she continues. Most true fans have likely already read this book and formed their own conclusions. To those of you new to Elizabeth George, my best advise is to start from the beginning. Her books are captivating and satisfing (except for the last one where she took a cheap shot which I can only guess was to shock us and make sure we were still awake)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe she would do that!","review":"Some readers' opinions seem to be that she has a grasp of the deep psychology of Lindley etal, i think she has sunk in to gratuitous tragedy. Tragedy for its own sake which lends nothing to this story or to the next ones, or is she planning to end this series? I have read all of her books up until now even when they don't start before page 300, because i like how she paints landscapes, atmosprhere, character etc. but this is the last book of hers i will read. How can she bring them back from the the ton of bricks she has buried them under?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Isn't This Being Rated Higher?","review":"I found this a roller coaster ride and am frankly surprised (to say the least) at it's low rating by others. My frustration is that she only writes about one book every year and a half and I'm dying to know where she is going to go with this - if anywhere. I did not find it overly complex (This from someone who has to write down Ludlum characters as they appear in his later books in order to keep them straight). I found it an extremely moving book and would recommend to anyone who likes her works."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED the ending - -0 stars","review":"I've waited breathlessly for each book of this series to be published. I've been disappointed with a several which focus on minor characters like class-fixated, boring Barbara Havers. George's best books in this series have \\"starred\\" the Lyndleys and their best friends, of whom I am most fond. Strong plots, interesting relationships, and intelligence characterize these books, particularly the early ones.This book is the worst of the series. Serial killers have been SO overdone, and George doesn't do them as well as other authors. Maybe George is simply tired of the characters. The ending shocked and revolted me. What a dirty trick on George's faithful readers.I will never buy or read another book in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much","review":"I hated this book. I have enjoyed the Inspector Lynley books in the past, but this was just too much. Too violent, too depressing, too negative, nothing of redeeming value. The serial killings were too graphic and disgusting and the plot had no subtlety. You knew where the plot was leading well before it got there. This book was so disappointing. When I finished reading it I felt compelled to throw it in the trash. I have never had a reaction like this to a book before. I also felt compelled to write a review to warn other people not to read this book unless they have ready access to antidepressants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo to you, Ms. George","review":"I bought this book because I loved the books Elizabeth George has written before.What a mistake! This book reads as if she's tired of all her characters and wanted to smash their lives to bits, which she effectively does by killing off an essential and beloved character in a way that's unconnected to the rest of the plot but that punches a hole in her cast.What's wrong with Elizabeth George? The book feels like a wanton act of destruction. Surely this master plotter could have come up with a better way to get the Lynleys offstage. Boo to you, Ms. George."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was a frustrating read for me. I miss the way Mrs. Geeorge wrote her first 4-5 Lynley books. I had a hard time staying focused in the middle and the plots were conveniently tidied up in the end without making much sense. I was so happy to get this book for Christmas but I was so frustrated after reading it. Die hard George fans will be happy with how things play out for Havers. Come on, Mrs. George, get back to rocking our literary world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ARGH.","review":"I can't believe I actually was looking forward to reading this book. I loved Elizabeth George. I read every one of her novels, painstakingly (at times) getting to know everyone, feeling excited that Tommy and Helen would have a child, adding a new dimension to the relationships. But no, let's not let our characters be happy, for crying out loud. Let's KILL the pregnant one and end it with Havers crying. How depressing and how utterly disappointing. I can't even say as I miss Helen--I am still trying to understand why she was killed off. ??? Not a fan, I'm afraid. Just not a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"With No One As Witness","review":"Elizabeth George is a prolific writer. Her series featuring Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley and his partner, Barbara Havers has been made into a television series. It was for this reason that I read her latest in the Lynley-Havers series. It is certainly the best so far. This is a long book, but it never gets bogged down. Lynley and Havers, along with newly promoted Detective Sargeant Winston Nkata, investigate a serial killer who kills and mutilates adolescent boys. Nkata deals with a reluctant love interest, Havers with a deepening friendship with her neighbor, and Lynley with a family tragedy while pursuing this high profile murder case. George has woven this all together into a moving, beautifully written story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Longer and longer, worse and worse","review":"Unlike PD James, Ruth Rendall, or Donna Leon, who also write long-running detective serials, Elizabeth George seems to be unable to sustain the quality of her Thomas Lynley series. In With No One as Witness she switches from her typical intimate family murder to a poorly-constructed serial killer tale. And, in a bizarre plot twist that strains credibility past the breaking point, she breaks up her extremely endearing group of long-running characters. The Thomas Lynley - Helen Clyde subplot has been the best and perhaps the most widely-followed continuing side story in mystery fiction since Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane. Why she ended it by killing off Helen smacks of creative breakdown to me; it's very disappointing that she could not have come up with any other way to create new dramatic conflict in her series. I can't recommend this book, nor, by anticipation, any of its sequels. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Witness a Serious Misstep","review":"Elizabeth George pushes, unsuccessfully, into the serial killer genre with this novel. Or rather, she throws together a serial killer novel and a police procedural. It's really not her area of strength as a writer, and the resulting book lacks both the creepiness of a good serial killer book and the solid plotting that was the hallmark of some of her earlier books. Killing off Helen Clyde was a serious mistake that will have long-term repercussions in this series. By suggesting that the death is somehow Lynley's fault (because of his \\"hubris\\") she emasculates her hero; and will discover, in future books, that she has destroyed what kept readers coming back to her. Whatever personal demons drove her to write this book, her editor should have shoved this one in a drawer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst example of lazy writing","review":"With No One as Witness is one of the worst examples of lazy writing to come along in years. In it, George uses the crutch of coincidence -- being in the wrong place at the wrong time -- to bring about the murder of one of her permanent cast members. Some readers praise her \\"courage\\" in killing off Helen Clyde, but I disagree; I think it's the cop out of an author who's kept writing long past her ability to generate meaningful evolution in the lives of her characters. For a book so long waited for, it was a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor showing for George","review":"I share the opinion of many other readers of With No One as Witness: George should have stuck to full tapestry murder mysteries, which she does well; instead of attempting a psycho serial killer novel, which she did badly. Very badly indeed. Oh, and it's definitely cheating to kill off a main serial character, especially when the killing has no relation to the rest of the plot. It suggests that the writer lacks the imagination or the energy to keep the character spinning. That's probably why so many reviewers have said this book felt \\"tired\\" and \\"sloppy\\". Again, I agree. George should stay off the literary scene till she gets her energy back."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great book","review":"Elizabeth George has created true characters with the Lynley series. You care about these New Scotland Yard police and you want to know how they are developing - professionally and personally. George does a great job of making them real. Lynley, Havers, Nkata... all great characters following a serial killer in London. You'll read it as fast as you can to not only see who did it but how the \\"regulars\\" solve it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Darkest of all her books","review":"I found this to be the darkest of all her books. Of course that has a lot to do with the subject matter of a serial killer. But it also pertains to the ending, which is devastating. Lynley must make a heartbreaking decision. The decision he makes is totally in character, which is to Ms. George's credit. The book is very long although it reads very quickly. I think some of the detail on the minor characters could have been eliminated, especially Ulrike. We know way too much about her sex life. However, like all her books, it is beautifully written. Because London is my favorite city I enjoy all the detail but I understand how it could get to be too much for some and detract from the mystery plot. Havers, however, continues to be her irascible self and that is what drives the plot along for me. I wonder if Ms.George is going to finish the series with this book because of the ending. We'll have to see. Do read the book though. It is dark and compelling just like life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elizabeth George does it again.","review":"Ever since I picked up my first Elizabeth George book, I've been hooked. So far, she's never failed to disappoint me. Each of her novels can be read on their own, without needing to read the first novel in the series. If you miss one of the books in the series, it's not a problem as she gets you up to speed with what's happening in the character's lives without rehashing every detail.The ending. . .well, I won't say too much about it, but I think it was a great lead in to the next book and it will be interesting to see how the characters adjust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to her usual standard","review":"I am very disappointed with this latest book by Elizabeth George.As a big fan of hers I expected better than this.The book is overlong,confusing and the ending was a big shock and made no sense whatever.Killing off one of her major caricatures was a big mistake and I cannot see where she will go from here with future books in the Lynley series.Maybe that is what she has in mind.No more Detective Inspector Lynley books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Read This If You Don't Want to Know What Happens.","review":"I give up on Elizabeth George. She has killed Helen for no good reason. Elizabeth George has joined a line of authors I will no longer read because they have found it necessary to dispose of a key character for no good reason other than shock value, or to take another character in a new direction. That is lazy writing if you ask me."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!","review":"This is my first Elizabeth George story and it's a stunner. I listened to the abridged CD version so apparently missed a lot but it sure didn't seem like it. Even without a background for the main characters, the Lynley tragedy was overwhelming. I will have to go back and start with book one of the series and do hope the murders are not as gruesome as in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping","review":"This is one of the best in the series. The continuing characters were well done and not, as is sometimes the case, overdrawn. The plot twist is great even though very sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book so far -- last one for me","review":"Too bad for her long-suffering fans that Elizabeth George's most admired writer is John Fowles, who never writes the same kind of book twice; and that her avowed aim is to \\"break all the rules.\\" I guess these two things are what led her to produce \\"With No One as Witness\\" in which she not only tries -- and fails -- to write a new kind of serial killer/police procedural novel but also breaks the cardinal rule of mystery novels that says good must triumph in the end. Her serial killer is unconvincing, bordering on silly at times; and her decision to kill off a core character pretty much ends my interest in the future of her characters. I'm left wondering why she, or her editor, didn't have the sense to carry on her writing experiments outside the Lynley series. Hope she's smart enough to figure a way to write Helen back into the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"back in top form!!","review":"Her last two books were poor, especially the most recent one, butnow she's hit her stride again, Hooray! This is a powerhouse of a book; don't let the slow buildup discourage you. Welcome back, Havers and Nkata. The end is an emotional body-blow, but it'll befascinating to see what happens in the next book...no, I DON'T think she's trying to end the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"a \\"weeper\\"","review":"Like tragedies and to be depressed? Then this book and this author are for you. The pleasure of the intricate mystery puzzle cannot compensate, in my opinion, for the tragic ending (the main character loses his beloved new family). So a caution, if you like the \\"good guys\\" to win and the \\"bad guys\\" to lose, DON'T read this author. This was my first E. George novel and it's also my last. Given the storyline descriptions of previous novels, this book is probably characteristic of the series so George is off my list -- so many authors, so little time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"She choked","review":"I always bought her books the day they came out. However, I was profoundly disappointed by the cheap, over-the-top drama of the ending. It takes real talent to sustain characters over time in ways true to their own increasing complexity, and I felt she choked at the tough part. It wasn't the loss of the character I minded so much (although I did love Helen), but the whole scenario relied on exaggerated soap-opera twists, like the way first-year creative writing students end a story when it's due the next day. I felt embarrassed to be reading it, like I was suddenly caught up in a Lifetime channel movie, and embarrassed to be wrenched by the loss. How much tragedy does an earl have to endure in his life until the author feels it's okay to write about an earl? I won't be reading any more George novels -- she's run her course."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK People, repeat after me...","review":"THIS IS JUST FICTION!.After making that clear, apparently it was necesary judging some of the previous reviews, KUDOS to EG for another great read, for pushing her limits, for taking chances and being willing to deal with the consecuences and for taking her characters closer to real LIFE. Yes, in real life things also happen that don't make sense ALL THE TIME.And to the other reviewers, you are entitled to your opinion, you can like or dislike this book, but PLEASE stop revealing the ending!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"She killed off the wrong character","review":"I have to agree with the readers that label as gratuitous tragedy George's killing off of one of the main characters in this particular entry in the Lynley/Havers mystery series. I might've even condoned a bit of gratuitous tragedy had it only been the unbearably annoying Deborah St. James who got the ax. I don't know about you all, but I want to spew every time Mrs. St. James whines, cries, or pouts, which is every time she makes an appearance in any of the George novels. I have to wonder if George set out to create the most annoying character on Earth.That aside, the twist with the Yard's profiler was down right asinine, something out of a day-time soap. It was a cheap gimmick. Insert mandatory plot twist here.This novel in one word was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throwing in the towel","review":"I've run out of patience with Elizabeth George. I read her last two books mainly because the ones before were so good. I was especially disappointed with A Place of Hiding, which did not feature Inspector Lyley, but was looking forward to the next book in which, George promomised, \\"all her cast would be back.\\" They are -- but all their lives are destroyed through Helen's pointless death. I'm not looking for mindless happy endings, but I expect a certain rigor and plausibility in my mystery novels. If I want my main characters killed just because they're \\"in the wrong place at the wrong time,\\" I'll read John Irving. thumbs down to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design flaw needs to be fixed","review":"I purchased this Wren house a few months ago. None have moved in yet so I relocated it to a spot where they had nested previously. The day after I moved it, disaster struck! What happened was that the round wooden stick that runs the length of the apex of the roof, and to which the hook attaches, became detached from the house and the house fell to the ground. Just two staples attached the house to the hook bar and they easily separated. I used a nail gun to reattach the hook bar to the house so hopefully it will stay attached.Edit (2/2012): I was looking back through my old reviews and noticed the picture for this item doesn't look like the same as the one I had reviewed initially. The round wooden stick that runs the length of the roof does not appear to be present, judging from the current picture.

Three or 4 others are very strong, very mellow tunes. But great songs!!! Halloween Head is unfortunate - enough said. But my only critique would be the production. It is crisp, clear, all instruments right up front, which is all nice and good. But anyone who appreciates the depth and nuances to Adams' songs knows that allowing the instruments in Ryan's songs to breathe and have space of their own (listen to the Das Haus Oct '06 recording to see what I mean) is essential. The production here does not allow for this space - listen closely and these are truly GREAT songs. An overly neat-and-tidy production does not allow the tracks to fully develop. I saw Ryan last week in Somerville MA - a truly memorable show in which he successfuly demonstracted how alive and dynamic these new tunes really are. Hope this helps..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item was not as pictured or described","review":"This is a great album that I enjoy, but in terms of what I received when I ordered this product, it did not meet my expectations. The album art and packing posted was not what came in the mail when I bought this product. I expected a vinyl that comes in regular packaging, but instead I received a cheap and thin see through plastic casing. I was very disappointed by this because I was hoping to frame this album art.

This is an album of 3 grade A songs and most of the rest A- with perhaps 1 or 2 B+. In other words, you will not skip a song to get to another. I'm reminded of The Beatles consistency on Rubber Soul. Very pleasurable and extra credit for him saying \\"guitar solo\\" before the guitar solo on Halloween Head. Production is not nearly as good as on \\"Gold\\" (Ethan Johns) which was almost as real as vinyl, as the highs here can be a little screechy and prominent, but not enough to detract from the very solid songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Tiger.

If you like Ryan Adams then you will like this album, nothing groundbreaking but vintage Adams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"I bought Ryan Adam's older cd, \\"Gold\\", I liked that one, but it just didn't catch me the way this one does. It seems like he really found his musical calling on this one. The first song, \\"Goodnigt Rose\\" shows off his wonderful old country sounding voice, but yet his music still isn't really country. It's hard to categorize him and that, I think, is his appeal. Of course the radio single \\"Two\\" is a great song too, and followed by many more. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has Mr. Adams been entered into a contest?","review":"Many mixed reviews here. Ryan Adams by far has been the most consistently strong writer/musician in a decade. Bottom line? His music is just great listening to. Yeah, Heartbreaker is phenomenal, but so is Gold, & Cold Roses and all of his records in different ways. He never fails to please me. I've only listened to the first 3 tracks on Easy Tiger as I write this and I'm smiling. BTW, is the reviewer here kidding about \\"Bryan Adams\\" or what's up with that? Personally, I try not to over-analyze and compare a musicians music. If it sounds good, has meaning with sound lyrics, I enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little too country for my tastes","review":"Upon my first listen to this album I could not finish it...the songs were a little too twangy and Adams' voice was as well. My taste is more on the rock side of things, and this album falls definitely more on the country side."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"I have enjoyed most of Adams's previous releases but not this one. Song #5 is the only keeper in my opinion. If I had listened to it first, I would not have bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop listening to it","review":"Love this album. I love Ryan Adams. The only song that disappointed me was \\"These Girls\\" which is a remake/redo of \\"Here there Mrs. Lovely\\" which i prefer(it's a few years old). The new lyrics just caught me off guard. Some gems on this album, much more commercial than say, rock-n-roll and even Heartbreaker, but a nice collection of music, reflecting Mr. Ryan Adams today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Its hard to dislike a Ryan Adams album because frankly he is an amazing song writer and musician. However this album is really no more than I expected. That's not a bad thing. This album reflects upon Ryan's different styles with rockers such and Halloween Head.

It's nice to know that in an age of mystery-solving cats, amateur-sleuth vampires, and crime-happy psychics (why does it always take them a whole book to figure it out? If they were really psychics, wouldn't it be solved on Page One?) that there's a writer with a fresh style, good grasp of language and a fairly familiar rubric that we needn't suspend our disbelief for too long.

He shoots, he scores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong Concept, Weak Execution!","review":"The basic concept of Lupica's latest is a strong, i.e., hazing and murder in a small town. However, Lupica's execution of the plot is fairly slow-moving and predictable, and his characters are devloped with little depth. They are one-dimensional at best, making it difficult for me to care much about what happened to them. Given the blurbs from two authors I like a lot (Harlan Coben and Robert Parker), I had high expectations for Too Far and had moved it to the top of my \\"to-be-read\\" list.

The idea of participating on a team is very real to us, as we've all done so before, and we all know what it's like. Lupica's story takes the idea of competition to the extreme, and in the process, loses a base of reality. It would have been a much wiser decision on Lupica's part to explore a high school team plagued with realistic problems that the layperson could relate to. The rampant sensationalism and melodrama that characterize \\"Too Far\\" prevent Lupica from doing justice to a good concept. Finally, Lupica is unable to keep his writing strong throughout. Witticisms are disseminated throughout large sections of uninteresting prose and poorly done dialouge. On the whole, one would expect more out of Lupica; this is sub-standard work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reveiw","review":"Kevin Bloody Wilson is the funniest Australian comedic singer in Australia!
