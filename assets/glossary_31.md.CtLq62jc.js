The story starts out about a spoiled rich kid who learns there are problems in the world bigger than himself. He wants to help people and it not sure how to do it. But he becomes partners with a super talented martial artist, who happens to make a great cup of Java. This martial artist can also build just about anything. After a few bumps in the road, he figures out that in order to beat the criminals , they have to act like Criminals. Well, that is the short story anyway. The movie had enough action to keep me entertained, and i just hope the make a sequel to it. If you are not a fan of seth rogan, then you wont like the movie.

Must be Seth Rogan hates the image of the hard hitting editor that makes sure justice is done so he made him into the buffoon he is made out to be in this movie.

It is stated by the producers they made the movie so you get into it without the need to watch the series!First on... Seth Rogers, from my point of view Rogers is evolving with time! I have watched movies from him in the past,... not satisfied, but hold on, here comes the hornet!This movie is so hillarious i have watched about 4 times in just the first week!My kids adore this movie, and they are just 2 and 4 years old!!!! Could it be the trailers the bluray has (especially the one from the guys of Open season promoting 3Dtv?) but i cant complain with this buy.Highly recommended for group viewing as you all going to enjoy itSo you say,... Why 4 stars?This kind of movies has no deph or caracters deployment, just a movie for funBut you gotta have a lot of it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously awful","review":"I don't usually leave one star reviews, but this movie was so bad it doesn't deserve anything more. Seth Rogen was terrible in this movie. He came off as whiny, immature, and completely devoid of anything resembling superhero status. The other actors were almost as bad. Edward James Olmos was completely wasted in this movie. The jokes and \\"funny parts\\" were not funny. I wanted to turn it off after the first 30 minutes but suffered through it becaus my spouse thought it would get better. It did not. We were both disappointed and glad it was just a rental.

Incompetent, and unapologetic in it's utter stupidity, it's hard to imagine anyone enjoying this wasted effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Car failed to carry the movie","review":"The car special effects failed to carry the movie. Seth Rogen attempts to make his charactor to be a product of his father's lack of guidance. Just allot of poor acting along with a plot which is attempting to be a comedy. If you wish to waste your money, this is your movie. 3D is OK but rent this for $2 and waste two hours of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE MOVIE","review":"This is by far the worst film I have viewed in years!!!!!

Comedians have a inate lack of respect for nostalgia that is essential for a free society but are consequently unable to discerne when actual homage shoud be paid. THere was a profound lack of respect for the story of the green hornet in this film and this led to a lack of focus and a level of \\" screwballiness\\" that was simply out of place. Comic book stories are not always comic and this was the wrong time to be playing up the bafoonery.Not worth the 4 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"There were many problems with this movie, it is hard todecide where to start. It was filled with inconsistenciesand most of it did not make sense.Were they villains or heros? They go about destroyingpublic property and fight with the bad guys. Kato is theside kick but it is as if he is the real hero. He buildsthese amazing cars in just a few days, but you don't seehow it all happens.It is not funny, it is not an action movie, no goodspecial effects, and the script is no good.I would skip this one and choose something else, thereare lot of other good movies out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank You Seth Rogen, for turning Bruce Lee's legacy into...","review":"A complete piece of trash. The thing is, it could have gone either way with just a little bite more intelligent writing and some actual martail arts choreography. Compound the fact that they let Rogen near both the dialogue and the kung fu and you've got a \\"flop\\" on your hands.Rogen is brilliant in his traditional endeavors of gastronomical humor. Really, I've enjoyed some other films he's been in immensely. There's so much potential here, it could have been Scott Pilgrim meets the Green Hornet and everything would've been sensational. Scott Pilgrim in case you don't know takes a rag tag band of nerds, in a musical band of nerds, and pulls out chop socky action that drips from every pore of the experience. How they did it, is a mystery, but it's clear Rogen didn't follow the formula.Before it was over, I was begging for it to end. You're not missing anything by spraying the raid on this hornet's nest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"I pre-ordered this movie.

To see Seth come out of character and try to play two roles at once is kind of weird. But as the movie goes on you get used to it and laugh your butt off. Overall, this movie is alright. I wouldnt run to get it. But on the same token, if its under $20, I would get it. the 3D effect isnt there much. I didnt notice it. But the movie in general is nice.Also take into account that this is their take on the Green Hornet. So please be advise.If you are looking for some form of torch-carrying movie, this is not it.

The attempts at \\"humor\\" are overblown; everyone's chewing up the scenery. There's very little cohesive story line.

This mess makes \\"Ishtar\\" look like the height of artistic and entertainment achievement.Don't waste your time or one penny of your money on this train wreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to the original","review":"The most insulting thing about this movie is in the final credits where they claim that it was based on the original radio series. Nothing could be further from the truth. Where the original (radio) green hornet was a mature character with a great deal of depth, this movie was designed for teenage drunks with an attention span no longer than 140 characters.The screenplay is something a hungover slack could have produced after dinner. I could do better in a weekend.None of the characters are true to the original.The origin story is stupid and completely opposite that of the original series.Basically, they took a great old radio series (still available on Radio Classics on Sirius/XM) and dumbed it down to the twitter generation. It is a total failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy the comic book insteas","review":"I read the comics,wantch Van Williams/Bruce Lee but this current GH make the others look like Academy Award contenders.

Save your money and time for somebody to do this oldie but goodie TV series justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie, disgrace to original","review":"I cannot think of a word that truly describes exactly how BAD this film is. Seth Rogan adds absolutely NOTHING to this film. The story line is weak. It was like watching a Roger Moore era James Bond film with all the cheesy parts spliced in together.Jay Chou hopefully got his money up front. I wonder if he took this job thinking, \\"This will get me good exposure to Hollywood.\\" He played a decent side kick in Cato.Cameron Diaz, let's face it, was an attempt to have some eye candy to distract you from how bad this film really is. Note to producers, she could have been butt naked and I don't think it would have made a difference.Do yourself a favor, unless you have 2 hours to kill and there is absolutely nothing else to do. Do NOT watch this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD is interlaced.","review":"I suppose in a effort to make Bluray more attractive, Sony has decided to degrade the quality of this DVD (and how many others?) by encoding the video as interlaced, which is where the resolution of each frame is cut in half, and your TV has to reconstruct each image. Just be warned that if you buy this, you are getting a product inferior to what has been standard on DVDs for 10 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Rubbish!!","review":"This DVD is just an expensive cocktail coaster.

Sure I found parts of the movie funny, but if you wanted a comedy call it something else and make it a non descript hero. Taking the good name of a serious crime fighter and making it into this mess just wasn't entertaining and only mildly funny. Kato would have been fine in a serious version, but the Hornet absolutely sucked and I'm not even a fan of the Green Hornet and I'm insulted. One can only hope they remake it like they did the Batmans and take it serious the second time around.CA Luster"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rogen made this movie horrible and unbearable...","review":"They casted someone good as Kato, but Rogen was a horrible choice. From start to end it was not believable and also seemed like a lame comedy. Would not recommend this movie to anyone by any means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I should have read the reviews before purchasing the DVD. Honestly, I don't know how bad it actually was. I turned it off less than one minute into it because of the language. I recognize Hollywood's belief that all movies have to have vulgar language to create realism. I don't agree with it, but I do recognize it. The obligatory four letter word seems a must or it can not be a real movie. If I wanted realism, I wouldn't be watching a movie about a comic book super hero. However, the language just in the opening scene is disgusting.One reviewer mentioned 10 year olds. I feel sorry for any parent who took their 10 year old to this and realized after it was too late what kind of language they would have to endure. After about three sentences of dialogue, I turned it off and my wife thanked me.I gave it one star because I could find a way to give it less."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"This movie is about a rich boy and is very boring, there are some decent parts but over all i would pass, very boring"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one of the most embarassingly dumb movies I've seen.","review":"I quit halfway through.

The end result is neither. This is one of the worst super hero adoptions since the Batman TV series. That show tried to be kamp but fell flat on its face. Ditto with this movie. Seth Regan is at once ugly, awkward and without any true sense of nobility. Well possibly toward the end he becomes a little noble. He does have one distinction-he is the first screen super hero to have some of his back teeth missing. There is nothing else that makes this pic unique. Cameron Diaz does have great legs and Kato is a better character than the Hornet himself. Jay Chou does have potential as an actor even though this movie has no potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"E string snapped after two days of light play; just strumming.

The whole thing, while possibly very accurate in detailing the thoughts and feelings of an acutely withdrawn child, left me feeling dead. For the most part it bored me, and I found the acting irritating. I have seen other movies with similar plots (House of cards, Mercury Rising) and while most movies concering disturbed children seemed to be produced by hacks, this has to take the cake. It wasn't even visually interesting, and the only reason I gave it a two was because it has definate potential. It just wasn't developed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think I'd really call this a game...","review":"Luckily, I had a lot of AmEx reward points that I hadn't been using and essentially got this at no cost. Good thing, because I'm not really all that happy with it. There are no real rules to this \\"game\\". It's simply trivia questions with bad background music. There are about 300 questions so don't expect this to be a \\"game\\" you can play too many times before you run out of questions. Since there's really nothing else quite like it for classic rock trivia that I can find I guess it's better than nothing, but it leaves much to be desired. If re-designed and had some real rules to it there's a good chance this could be a good product. In the end, I'm glad I bought it for myself rather than as a gift because I'd be rather embarrassed giving this as a gift to someone given its limitations."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't have to be a Buddhist to read this book!","review":"Don't think that you should be interested in Buddism to read this book. This book is for people from all cultures, all religions, and ideologies. His Holiness The Dalai Lama is one of the more enlightened spiritual leaders we have in this world today. In his tireless work toward world peace, he has risen above the boundaries of religion, culture, race, and ideologies. In this book, the Dalai Lama has provided an instruction manual to live a meaningful and happy life. It is not quite a self-help book for people who are lost. It is more a direction for people who wants to explore deeper into this live that we are living. To me, it is more a philosophy than a religion. Read it, and come back to it a few years later. With your life experience expanding, you will find different things in this book to inspire you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio book edition","review":"The translator reads this with absolutely no inflection.

After I read it, I felt that I could start my life over with a blank canvas to paint my catholic beliefs on.I'm giving it 4 stars because I found the book to be a little redundant when it started talking about the inherent existance... at one point I even said aloud \\"OK, OK, I got it! move on!\\", but I guess there's people that need for it to be explained thoroughly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dalai should spread his message to corporate America","review":"What an interesting man.

I kinda just wish there where more songs to listen to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this kick's buddxbut it isn't as good as their other 14 cd's","review":"this is the best cd i ever heard I really do give it a 1 star(joiqwejgfnldsfngjjkhujgjs) in my foreign land this means THIS KICKS buddox"},{"rating":"1","title":"It really isn't worth it, get the others instead","review":"Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with this cd. I was really looking forward to it, but when I got it, wow, I couldn't believe I had spent the money on it. It isn't terrible, I'll give it that, but it is nowhere near the level of greatness that Naveed and Clumsy are. It's got a couple of good songs, but overall, it's a downfall. Hopefully they can regroup with their next release. On a side note, if anyone is going out to see these guys in concert, they play mostly songs from this album, so if you don't like it either, don't expect a great show. I saw them October 1, and of the 10 songs they played, 6 of them were new. and that was when the album had just come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Our Lady Peace is coming along...but not strong","review":"O.L.P. is just starting out and will be put into the category of one-hit-wonders because of their song One Man Army.

I quite like the band and their work, and this has to be their most polished release yet. Really catchy, too. I dare you to listen to \\"One Man Army\\" and go the rest of the day without singing it in your head (or screaming it out loud). Made up first name or not, Maida's voice sounds really cool on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT EFFORT!","review":"ALTHOUGH OLP CHANGED THEIR SOUND ON THIS ALBUM, ITS STILL THE SAME BAND. I LOVE THIS CD. I CANT STOP LISTENING TO IT. THE BEST SONGS ARE \\"ONE MAN ARMY\\", \\"BLISTER\\", \\"THIEF\\".... ALL OF THE SONGS ARE GOOD! IF YOU'RE A TRUE OLP FAN YOU'LL LOVE THIS ALBUM. BUY IT!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Lady Peace- New One The Best","review":"OUR LADY PEACE IS A GREAT BAND A THIS CD IS GREAT.

Our Lady Peace does it again!!!","review":"This is a great cd. It usually takes me a couple of times listening to a cd before I really like it, but I liked this one on the first listen. It's different from the previous two, which is a good thing. The vocals are particularly strong here. Tracks 1,2,4,7,9, and 12 are the best. I hope some of these songs get radio play, because I have yet to hear any of these songs on the air. This is an awsome cd. If you like OLP you'll love this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"OLP Continues To Grow","review":"After Clumsy, I don't see any way that OLP could have gotten any better -- and they didn't. In Happiness..., they continue to explore new musical boundaries and the like -- even featuring drummer extrordinaire Elvin Jones on \\"Stealing Babies\\", the CD's best song. Overall, still a wonderful album, but it seems to drag a little near the middle. I'm hoping OLP will come out with some new stuff real soon, because they're one of my favorite bands, and one of the best to see perform live. This is a CD well worth your money, and if you buy it at Best Buy you get a 2-CD deal for the regular price. Definitely check this CD out! Other good songs are \\"Lying Awake\\" and \\"One Man Army\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing CD - Takes a bit to get used to","review":"Eh, when I first heard this cd, I thought Our Lady Peace was just another mainstream pop rock band. I didn't like Theif (Thief?) too much, and many of the songs were corny and sounded too poppy for me on first listen. (This seems to be the case with most of the Our Lady Peace stuff I've listened to.) Thus, I never listened to the cd again (I listened to a friend's copy that time.)Later on however, another friend lent me the cd, and when I listened to it, I was blown away. The songs finally made sense to me and I thought, \\"Wow, this cd is truly amazing.\\" This record has excellent tracks like \\"One Man Army\\", \\"Theif\\", \\"Waited\\", \\"Stealing Babies\\", heck all of the songs are great.Buy this cd if you can.Btw, for better songs by these great artists, check out \\"Superman's Dead\\", \\"In Repair\\", \\"Naveed\\", \\"Whatever\\" and \\"Clumsy\\". Avoid \\"Somewhere Out There\\" and the album \\"Gravity\\" at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't get better","review":"After listens to the primitive sounding Naveed, the well-rounded Clumsy, the masterpiece Spiritual Machines, the unbearable Gravity, this CD is the most versatile. This CD either rocks you or puts you down. Either way, it's very interesting. Though I've outgrown my likeness of Raine's extremely whiny voice, this (with the exception of Spiritual Machines) is the only Our Lady Peace CD I still listen to. The best songs off of it would have to be track 3 through track 8. I would list them but they're sequential so whatever. It's definitely a good investment as long as you wouldn't be embarassed to listen to \\"Blister\\" with someone else in the room. Anyone who has this CD knows what I'm talking about. haha........... if you don't I'm talking about Raine sounding so freaky."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is OLPs Best CD","review":"Pay no attention to the sourpuss reviewers who gave less than 3 stars & fancy themselves music critics extraordinaire. They try to over-analyze aunique album that's fun to listen to. This is much different than OLPs other albnums and I like it best from end-to-end. Thief is a great song whether in its album form or as an acoustic version which I have heard them perform in concert. One Man Army is a great rocker, Lying Awake is aa excellent song & one of their best in concert, and Waited/Blister/Is AnyBody Home/Potato Girl are all quality tunes. The only song i might do w/o is Annie but, in a quirky way it is fun to listen to. The whole album pretty much flows together & I highly recommend checking it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"laughable vocals","review":"out of all the bands with guys that dont use their real voices, this ranks among with the worst, second only to the crash test dummies. how anyone could think this is music much less good vocals is ludicrous! go get smart, buy better music, with meaningful lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ear Splitting Nonsense","review":"Raine...you're cool. Neit. His voice haunts me in my sleep. That whiny, spine-tingling, nerve-damaging, squeal of his sends me to the brink of insanity.Ok, maybe that's pushing it, but how can you listen to him? His lyrics suck...first of all they don't have any meaning to them, and if he says, or you say they do...sorry its just mindless drivel. I'm ashamed to have these no talent #*$-clowns representing Canada as one of our \\"premier\\" acts... Big Props to the reeeeal Canadian artists.. (Neil, you know, you know). Damn. Get outta here OLP... and take your so called \\"alternative\\" fans with you. This isn't alternative. (by the way, what do they classify as alternative these days...sounds pretty mainstream to me)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not be deceived by the reviews...awful","review":"This album, consisting of a pathetically tuneless voice and guitar/bass/drums makes this album a very, very poor album. Dull and lacklustre. From the first screeches by Maine Raida you are able to sense that you have just purchased quite possibly the worst album recorded in history. Do not be decieved by all the hype and good reviews surrounding them. When you read the clumsly entitled album, you either think genius or stupidity. Sadly it is a case of the latter.This album is rather painful. DO NOT BE DECIEVED. Go buy a Weezer album and be uplifted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotone","review":"My friend has this CD. I kind of like OLP (some of their songs from Gravity) but this CD is so monotone and boring. I was listening to it in the car and 3 tracks into the album I wondered if it was still on the same song because they all sound the same!!! The only song that slightly differs from the others is \\"Theif\\" Overall, this CD is a letdown. If you want to be gritting your teeth through an entire album because it is so monotone from song to song, then buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apologies to all the fans, I just don't like them at all.","review":"Raine Maida has the most grating singing voice on the planet. He sounds like a washed-up opera diva crossed with a barn owl on acid. All those \\"wo wo wo's\\" and \\"do do do's\\" really don't help either. When you add to that the fact that the lyrics sound like they were written in 9th grade (\\"Please be careful, Annie dreams that everyone is dead\\" has to be one of the most lamebrained lyrical punchlines ever written), and that the riffs are always \\"emotional\\" in the most labored, poseurish, trite, and dumbed-down way, then you slowly begin to realize that this band has no artistic value, are, in fact, worthless, and will ultimately mean nothing over a long period of time. I find their success extremely depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD ROCKS!!!!!! GO AND BUY IT!!!!!!!","review":"I just bought this cd today, and to say, im very amazed at the new sounds in this cd!!!!!! Much different from thier first 2 cds. But the music and originality is still there. Id recomend it to any olp fan who liked any of thier other music. And to the onlooker, give a listen to One Man Army, or my favorite right now Blister...if you havent heard of olp, id strongly recomend Naveed, or Clumsy. All are great cds!!!!!!!! Cheers to this canadian band!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happiness... Can Be Achieved If You Buy This CD","review":"Don't let the scary man on the cover keep you away from this great CD! It has many great melodies and the lead singer has a unique but good voice. The song Lying Awake is truly one great song and should be listened to right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"...but the album is pretty catchy","review":"Hhmm, a peculiar bunch, these guys. This is the first OLP album I've ever bought, persuaded by the distinctive radio song One Man Army. Not bad. The songs are memorable and evocative, enhanced successfully by well-chosen keyboard touches.One Many Army, Happiness & Fish, Blister, and Is Anybody Home? are all excellent. There are two slight drawbacks: the preponderance of midtempo songs, and Raine Maida's stylized singing (blah, blah, falsetto, blah, blah, falsetto, etc) which gets tiring after a while. I wonder if perhaps a couple of good-looking women told him that this kind of singing made him sexy. If not, he probably believes it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd!","review":"I think this is one of the best cds of the 90's!

The one at home worked well for 10 months and then the ice shovel broke. A piece of plastic that conected the shovel to the motor that rotated the shovel broke off. The shovel won't work so, no more ice. The part can not be bought so, as a result I am out the cost of the machine for a cheap piece of plastic. Remember, I said we bought 2 machines. The ice machine at the office made it 6 months before the exact same thing happened. This is the worst investment I have made in a long time. I have read the reviews of the other ice makers and there are others with the same complaint about other brands as well. My advice is don't buy this type of ice maker no matter who makes it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic Internal Parts Break Easily","review":"This machine seemed like an excellent buy at first. It makes nice soft chewy ice cubes in three selectable sizes. However, the machine broke down within a year. Customer service replaced the parts free of charge the first time, but the machine just broke down again. It's no longer under warranty. So basically, this machine lasted just 16 months.The machine breaks easily because the movable parts, that is, the water tray and its connector to the stepping motor are made out of brittle plastic. The minute a piece of ice gets stuck in such a manner as to prevent the tray from pushing the ice down into the bucket, the motor doesn't sense the problem and continues to push forward until one of these parts cracks.The machine did pay for itself if you count that we use 15 bags of ice a month at 1.50 a bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!.","review":"Save your money and don't buy this.

Unfortunately, the part is not available to purchase, so we had to discard the machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware First Time Owner","review":"This machine is wonderful, however it took me two machines to find that out. The smell in the machine when you first get it horrible. You absolutely must clean the machine using the cleaning cycle at least 10 times before you use the ice from it. On my first machine I used the cleaning cycle 3 times and still did not get rid of the odor (which permeates your ice, by the way). I finally had to use straight white vinegar in the cleaning cycle to get the odor out. On top of that, I used an air purifier aimed directly into the machine for several hours. That put a high ozone content in there to eat up the chemical odor that is in the plastic. I finally have a machine that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible warranty","review":"The ice maker produces ice great, but breaks approx every 6 months.

The warranty is supposed to be for a year but you have to pay for the shipping to send it in for repairs. They sent instructions to check the motor however the diagrams don't match the product we have. Also the warranty says it is not valid if repaired by unauthorized person.

The ice is hollow and soft. If you are an ice chewer, this is good.On the negative side, it is heavy and loud. My wife calls it the beast when it is running. I have had several problems with it. The latest is the ice shovel not working properly. The manufacturer will repair it IF you send the machine in at YOUR expense. They do not extend the warranty of they make a repair.In, my case, I have one month left on the warranty. If I send it in and it breaks upon return, it is my problem.

The insulation helps this perform in heat where others that are not insulated fail. The large ice cubes are really large compared to another brand I purchased before. I highly recommend. I gave it 4 stars because it has 3 design improvements or flaws. Having owned a restaurant in the US and understanding the food hazard and safety precautions for ice...it needs some improvements. One, having to remove the ice basket with your hands to refill...if instead it had a little tube and spout to pour into...that would eliminate the hand carried bacteria hazard. Next, a slot or notch that the ice scoop could fasten to to keep the handle from falling over into the ice thus contaminating it. Last, the lid should lift backward just 2 degrees more to prevent it from wanting to \\"fall down\\" while you are in the middle of scooping ice. Otherwise...a 5 star product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a little over a year..........then.....junk!!!!","review":"Bought this unit for my wife. It was fine for a year plus. Then it quit!!!

Of course, screw me once, your fault......again...my fault. That just isn't going to happen. Will find another brand, or just use ice trays. Not a happy camper and can you guess?

I got it from the warehouse at a cheaper deal. Shipping is not a reflection of the product but...All I have to say is that when I started using it, it felt cheap. The buttons are not tangible. You can't tell if you're pressing it in or not. The whole construction of the ice maker doesn't feel solid. I was worried one of the panels was going to come off. It feels like a anvil-heavy crappy plastic robot halloween costume head rather than a tough machined piece of furniture.Just overall when you get something you know you're in good hands when it feels solid and well made.This just wasn't, so I returned it and got a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for begginers","review":"This book show those tricks you always wanted to do but you never had someone to teach you!

The toy concept is great but it needs a lot of work as no parent will buy this toy if their kids know how to form their letters already. it works best if you know how to form your letters already then what's the point???

He knows his letters very well and can read a little too. So we hoped that this would encourage him to develop his writing ability. The problem is when he writes the letter his way the machine will not accept it. This is discouraging and he tends to ask me or his father to write the letters. Sometimes we can't even get an approval on the letter!? As a result he tends to play the other little games such as \\"missing letter\\" or pressing the animals on the smart board. The animals on the smartboard serve no purpose really. The funny pages that come with the machine are a waste.

My daughter improved her skills right after getting this toy even though she often got frustrated with the board not picking up her writing correctly. So I think that any toy that can help alittle is worth some frustration. It definitely works. I found it helped calm my daughter down when I showed her that it didnt always recognize when I wrote the letters too. When its working correctly its a wonderful fun toy. My daughter was 4 when I first got her this toy...However I just introduced this toy to my son who is 2 and he is also getting some benefit from it.

I still wish Pratchett would write more Discworld books though............sigh.patch"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new Pratchett world","review":"Once again Terry creates a new world that is both unique and believable.

Of course, being the stubborn teen I was, I reluctantly watched it, but glad I did. This movie stuck with me for many years after. Seeing some of my friends become \\"Chantel\\" right before my eyes as a teen, was definitely a wake up call. It made me realize that I had my whole life ahead of me and had enough time to be someone's mother--at a time when I was ready.I think this movie should still be shown today because for some reason teen pregnancy seems to bethe norm today where 20 years ago, it was shameful to be a pregnant teen.

The wall paper border completed the room. I applied it about 1/3 of the way down from the ceiling and it gave the room the perfect touch. The great thing about the wall paper border is that it could even be left up for 5-6 years. It would be a cute addition to a little girls room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made","review":"We purchased this wall border and had nothing but problems. My husband and his father, who are both quite handy, put it up, but it would not stick on the bottom. Mind you that while they were doing this, I had cut up pieces of the leftover border for other various touches around the room. I put different frames of the border in picture frames, put some of the characters on the ceiling fan, ect, because the pattern itself is so cute. but even working with the smaller pieces on the fan, the border ripped a few times, I pushed them together and called it a day, but I don't know how long it will hold once it is in motion. Also, when they put it up in the room it ripped in several places. To try to get it to stick better, they even tried to superglue the bottom, which made it even more frustrating when we realized that It looked too bad to keep up. This is our first child and we would have a lot better places to waste over $40. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the look but .....","review":"I loved this set when I saw it and just knew I would buy it.

For more knowledgable readers, there's not much new information, but it's a very nicely written book. The black and white illustrations are special, however, and the book makes a good addition to any bird library for that reason--they beautifully capture the 'crowness' of these magnificient birds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"I really wanted to like this one. But I also needed it to be either more literary or more anthropological. The illustrations and page design are beautiful. But Feher-Elston's text is annoyingly repetitive, with even less actual information than you might expect from a large-type book. Where I was hoping for well-retold stories about Raven/Crow, she gives a few, not particularly imaginative synopses. Where she might have focused on Native American myths (her strong point, if she has one), she throws in psuedo-information about Raven in other cultures, without really giving you any stories. Where you really want her to just tell the Raven story, she throws in Native American history with only a tangential relationship to Raven/Crow. Aaaargh. I can and have read Original Peoples history elsewhere. I can and have read anthropological accounts of shamans elsewhere. It's called Ravensong. Wouldn't it be nice if it collected songs about ravens?"},{"rating":"1","title":"well intentioned but useless","review":"This is a book by someone who obviously loves corvids but is unequipped for realizing the task she set herself. The \\"fabulous\\" part of the book deals with old world history in two sentences, spending the rest of the space on folksy retellings of stories from Native American traditions. The \\"natural\\" part of the history is anecdotal, sentimentalized and inadequate. Other works serve far better for each of this one's stated purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's nice for the fans","review":"It's a nice cd but certainly not her best.

I loved it as a child, read it as an adolescent, enjoyed it as an adult, & read it aloud to my children as a father. The story here is how a boy finds his way into the past of a house he is visiting, and his growing fascination with the life of a little girl in that past. The style of writing is so matter of fact, i think i truly believed as a child because there is no sense of \\"look how cute this idea is\\" you often get in books of the sort. The reader is invited to fully participate in and identify with both Tom and Hattie, and their growing friendship. The climax of the book, as Tom discovers what has truly been happening, never fails to move me to tears; just thinking about Mrs. Bartholomew's line right now is tightening my throat. Read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Description, Not Enough Story","review":"Well, this book was not too good.

Fantastic, Chicago-area band. They never got the play that they really deserved. Years later another chicago band Chevelle seemed to be headed for the same obscurity, but they broke out.Anyway, i was sad (and somewhat shocked) when i started hearing \\"stars\\" in those mind-numbingly stupid Cadillac commercials, but I more happy that they are getting paid, even if it is 14 years late."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Do Prefer Astronauts!!","review":"Like Failure, another underrated band that never got the credit they were due. Got caught at the end of the grunge-era and couldn't really find a niche. \\"Stars\\" was probably their only song that got any recognition (matter of fact, I just heard it in a Cadillac commerical tonight!!!), but I wouldn't even consider that one of the albums best. Nothing super fancy here, just some solid riffs driving sweet tunes...Highlights of the album: \\"Little Dipper\\", \\"The Pod\\", \\"I'd Like Your Hair Long\\"Heck, who am I kidding, it's all good."},{"rating":"2","title":"My feelings are typical","review":"Basically, there's not a lot to say about this album that hasn't been said. The music is spacey, soaring, and mesmerizing, and \\"Stars\\" is one of the best songs ever written. This is music to think to, music to drive to at night, music to make you feel things beyond words. Some major flaws are present here, however. For one, the album only has 9 songs, although many of them are very long. The recording quality could be better... the album sounds too quiet, and that takes lots of the punch away. A band this good deserves better production. It particularly hurts the softer parts, which can barely be heard even at high volumes. Also, \\"Stars\\" is just such an amazing song that the rest of the album looks weaker in comparison. Other stand out tracks include \\"I Like Your Hair Long\\" and \\"I Hate It Too\\". Despite the negatives, this is one of the best indie rock type albums ever made, and every music fan needs it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"its a shame these guys arent together anymore. they got dropped from their label because the follow up to this one didnt sell very well...all that aside, this is one of the great rock alternative albums of the 1990s. Just about everyone has heard stars and can probably remember when it got some brief radio airplay, but that is just one piece of the puzzle. lyrically speaking, they never let you know exactly what they are talking about, but instead give the listener a chance to figure it out for themselves. The music is simply beautiful and it all pieces together very well. It is simplistic and lots of fun...for anyone who loved the alternative movement of the 90s but wants something different that is just as good if not better, then check this album out..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst cd I've ever bought","review":"This is the biggest disappointment EVER. I heard Stars on the Cadillac commercial and thought, Wow, that is an awesome riff. After reading rave reviews from other customers, I figured that buying this album was a no-brainer. Ugh. This cd sounds like it was recorded in someone's garage, and the \\"singer\\" merely ho-HUM's his way through song after song. The sound of his voice is so grating to me that after listening the the cd once, and after forcing myself to listen to it again to give the benefit of the doubt, I just cannot be swayed. This cd is going right in the trash.

Hum's 1995 release \\"You'd Prefer An Astronaut\\" is, at first listen, quite disappointing to those of us who still haven't learned that patience is a virtue and beauty is found below the surface. Upon further investigation (when I managed to sit down and give the album my full attention), I found that within the monotone vocals, buzzing guitars and perfectly understated drumming was a work that subtly burrows its way into your mind and leaves you better off than it found you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best on the Market!","review":"This is the third vacuum we've bought in the last 4 years, and we finally found a winner!

The cheap plastic clamp that connects the powerhead to the wand breaks constantly, rendering the powerhead useless (I can only vacuum bare floors now - not carpet). Having now read user reviews on several websites, this is an incredibly common problem with this vacuum. Also the plastic release pedal breaks. Repairs not terribly expensive, but they are constant. Done with this vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Vacuum not to buy","review":"We purchased this vacuum and have had problems with it all the time. You would think this company would have tested it but I guess not. For me one the biggest problem is the hose coming out the canister is kinked all the time. There is no way to fix it except to make sure it is not kinked while you use it. That is difficult. I just can't see spending this much money and not getting a really good vacuum. A lot of the other people that have complaints about this vacuum are correct. Do not buy this vacuum. It is too expensive for what you get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Performs as promised","review":"Spent a lot of time reviewing and deciding which vacuum to go with.

From Pergo, tile, to carpet, this vacuum conquers them all. I can mop about twice the amount of floor now before having to change mop covers because so much more dirt has been removed. Plus, the dog (who was convinced the old vacuum was the devil) doesn't even bat an eye when we are using the Electrolux because it is very quiet. We have had this vacuum several months and remain very pleased with our purchase. Getting accustomed to the hose head and cannister takes some patience, but once that is conquered, it is worth working through the learning curve. I highly recommend this vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor vacuum","review":"This is perhaphs the poorest vacuum I have ever owned. Even on the thinnest pile rugs, this vac. has trouble picking up dirt. The self-propel feature on the rug attachment pulls the vac along like a lawn mower, making maneuverability difficult. The \\"low\\" setting is not sufficiently low to remove dirt from newer, thin rugs. The step feature to release the rug attachment is difficult to use, requiring many attempts to release. The wood floor attachment is too tall, not fitting under baseboards or the front of kitchen appliances. The hose is so pliable that it always kinks, and the power cord is very short compared to other vacuum's."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE it! Worth the $!","review":"I am SO glad I bought this vacuum.

I thought I was splurging for the Electrolux because I have always had a great respect for them but this model has a flimsy hose, the carpet piece has little or no suction at the edges (including the front edge), two of the attachment tools are housed in the hose handle and fall off all the time and there is no place to put the bare floor attachment and the handle is very awkward and uncomfortable.

However, it has a plastic clamp for the carpet beater attchment which is easily broken. Ours broke within 4 months. We contacted an Electrolux certified dealer who was surly and rude. He told us not to call him - he would call us when the replacement part under warranty came in. We are still waiting for the call. I contacted Electrolux on Facebook. They said they would contact me to resolve the situation. I never heard from them again. My husband found the part on line for $2.00. We bought 10, and we have used 3 so far. I will never buy another Electrolux product since they can't be bothered with their customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase one of these vacuum units. There is a \\"C\\" clamp that fastens the powerhead to the shaft. Unfortunately, this keeps falling off. Sometimes the vacuum will pick it up and you have to search for it in the debris bag. I did find a website and ordered three more of these clamps but really you should not need to worry about it at all. Vacuum cleaners are meant to be pulled around and they unfortunately run into things. They are not made to be weak and fragile. Electrolux made a huge design error when this clip was made. You will have problems with this little annoying piece of plastic. As for the rest of the vacuum, the suction is above average, cleaning capability is good. The attachments are useful and are very handy. The other downside is the size of the debris bag. It is no bigger than a microwave popcorn bag and fills quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a ripp off!!!!","review":"I BOUGHT THIS VACUUM THINKING I WAS GETTING MY MOTHERS ELECTROLUX!

But with in a total of 9 months of use, the vacuum blew a motor (~3-4 months,) and had to go for warranty repair. This took about a month to repair and 200 miles of driving to drop off the device, and pick it up. Now this Sunday it is overheating again and a change bag light is on. We changed both to a new bag, and a new HEPA filter, but the light won't go off.

I am still using it but without the carpet tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"works well when not broken","review":"When this vacuum is working it is an excellent performer. But ours has burned out twice in dramatic fashion. The electronics in the handle that control the power head fry themselves by spitting sparks and smoke into the room. The result is a completely scorched, melted and disintegrated electrical connector point when you detach the handle to further investigate. The first time this happened I counted it as a fluke after 12 months of use. Customer service politely sent us a new hose and we were back in business then exactly 12 months later it happened again. One week after the warranty expiration. This time customer service was not too keen to help even after the potential fire hazard. Luckily we bought this from a large chain buying club store who were happy to take the unit back and refund me. It appears the gauge of the electrical connections is not robust enough to handle the current going through the system. Not properly engineered and a fire hazard as well. Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure you get the same model you ordered","review":"The product name at the time I ordered it from Amazon was Electrolux EL6988E Oxygen3 Canister.The model that arrived was the older EL6988D model.

I didn't realize at the time that the oxygen is made by a totally different company. Well, I am fairly disappointed in this vacuum and I guess $400 doesn't get you much these days. While the power head is fine on carpet, it is too bulky and clumsy for hardwood floors, which is 80% of my house surfaces. When I switch to the hardwood attachment, it \\"pressure-fits\\" on, which means there is nothing to lock it into place. EVERY SINGLE TIME I AM CLEANING HARDWOODS, the hardwood attachment will fall off and I will have to crawl under a bed, or a dresser, or the TV stand to retrieve it. When I first got the vacuum, I thought I might be missing a piece that would connect the handle to the attachment....this vacuum just doesn't make sense!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Electrolux has regressed with technology.","review":"We purchased this vacuum cleaner and were greatly disappointed for the price of $500.00.

Took several people to hold it to unassemble when we returned the item.The power nozzle shorted out several times on me , I think it may have to do with the fact that it is so difficult to snap and unsnap the utensils on this vacuum.I have owned an electrolux for over 30 years, it has been a name brand in our home for over 70 years - I will not buy another electrolux vacuum - I will repair my trusty older model or switch brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good vacuum","review":"I bought this vacuum to replace the one I had.

The dust bags though are rather small but I can live with that. On the whole, I am completely satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Vacuum","review":"So very happy I listened to the other customer reviews and bought this vacuum!! It is a BREEZE to use and is of high quality.After over a year of fighting with an Infinity upright (do not buy this vacuum) that made me exhasuted just trying to get it to work - this Electrolux canister vacuum was a wish come true. Suction is absolutely great - even around wall edges. On bare floors, it is literally effortless to push.The price I got on Amazon beat BJ's Wholesale price by $41. Standard shipping was incredibly fast- Even my son said-mom- didn't you like order that yesterday? If it's possible for a vacuum to make you happy, then I'd rate this one bliss.

It is made by Eureka.I bought what I believed was a brand-new Electrolux vacuum cleaner. The reason we chose this brand was that this vacuum cleaner - or what we thought was Electrolux - received top ratings from Consumer Reports.The wand broke on the vacuum after only 1 year, so I took it to the local Electrolux store for repair. This is when I found out that the vacuum WAS NOT made by Electrolux . . . it was a Eureka vacuum cleaner. I was informed that he would not be able to repair it for me but could offer me a trade-in $50 toward an actual Electrolux from his store . . . huge difference in the quality of vacuum.According to the Electrolux representative, a Swedish company (apparently the company that established and originally sold Electrolux) bought back the Electrolux name from Electrolux in the U.S. The Swedish company subsequently bought Eureka and promptly put the Electrolux name on Eureka vacuum cleaners.I'll be the fool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get suckered on this item","review":"I ordered this item under the assumption that it was new.

I saw it rated relatively high on several sites and I am still trying to figure out what kind of conspiracy there is behind those ratings. Had it been some American brand, I would have attributed the extremely non-objective opinions to patriotism. But it is made in Sweden - which I thought was a good sign - yet it is a bad product.

My mistake! I preface this by saying that I pride myself in taking care of my belongings and have not put this vacuum through any unusual use. Within the first few months, a plastic piece popped out from holding the rug attachment together and I had to take it for repair. Then the rug attachment's electronic brush has quickly lost steam - it makes a groan instead of the a nice hum, making me wonder how well it is working. Also, since then, many other plastic pieces have just broken off including the pedal on the rug attachment and the button on the hose extension.

Just a couple of weeks after purchasing the vacuum, the attachment holder caught on a corner and part of it snapped off. Aside from the vacuum breaking, the motorized brush head doesn't suck all the dirt from our carpet. I think the brush spins so quickly that it kicks the dirt/debris right out. If I stand behind the motorized brush head, the debris hits my ankles as it flings out of the head. Keep in mind, our carpets are not very dirty b/c we don't wear our shoes in the house and we vacuum at least a couple of times a week.

It's not an attachment we used every day--maybe once per month. So, it wasn't broken due to overuse.About a week later, the roller in the vacuum stopped spinning. The vacuum still has suction.

A backbone of dodgy 80's synth beats and a certain lack of desire to just rip-it-up tempers any chance of this becoming the emotional, passionate classic it should (and could) have been. Songs you feel should soar or stomp or drip with atmosphere never quite reach the heights and much of it really sounds too clean to stir the blood.But it's still good stuff and i'll be investigating their other releases. Hopefully they'll have got themselves a new drum machine for those, that's all they really need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Success","review":"I first got a taste of this new CD at their concert, the best way to hear the music, and fell for it in a second.

Granted, they've progressed their sound from the past; higher quality recording, more violins, Stacey's beautiful vocals, and a different spin on the music itself. It's a lot more energetic I think than some of the other albums, more industrial. But I have been listening to it nonstop!

Songs like 'Carnival' made me cringe and when I first heard it I had to fight against the urge to yank the cd. out of the player and fling it out my car window at oncoming traffic. The lyrics to that song are just plain silly and the girl singing seemed to be trying too hard to sound 'spooky' and 'mysterious'. The lyrics to the rest of the songs are well written and can be read alone as poetry but the songs do not sound up to par. \\"Mystery of the Whisper\\" was perfection so I thought this one would at least equal that.

And to consider themselves Goth as well? Now that's nothing more that a slam on Goths. No self respecting Goth over the age of 12 should ever consider for one micro-second, lowering themselves enough to listen to this drivel. The derivative, contrite, boring, repetitive, unimaginative and utterly thoughtless sounds they've recorded have been forced on the club going public by ignorant DJ's with no sense of history or taste in music.The lead singer can't sing to save his life and it's clear to me that one night when they were all teenagers they each made a wish that they could grow up and be in Depeche Mode.Whatever happened to Gothic Rock?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Have to Buy!","review":"In listening to the progression of Cruxshadows, throughout their albums, from Telemetry of a Fallen Angel to Wishfire, I can see how the band has grown and developed their unique, beautiful music.

Lead singer, Rogue, has a mesmerizing voice, accented by the superb violinist Rachel MacDonnell. Guitarist/backing vocalist Stacey Campell & Keyboardist/Mixer Chris Brantley add a fullness and contrast to the songs, making this CD a must have for anyone looking for new, unique music with depth, intelligence & amazing talent.

He has a more relaxed kind of style and keeps the guest performances to a minimum. Mike Jones and Akon are the best ones with him. I would have left the interludes out--they sound pointless. The music is just dynamic, lots of keyboards, deep smooth basslines and an emphasis on melody and rhythm on most cuts. It makes good background music for the cool winter nights or the upcoming cookouts in the summer. T-Pain produced most of the songs, which definitely shows his originality of the album.

Artists like this make me wish that you could bring back Marvin Gaye or Donny Hathaway, heck even Luther, to smack some sense into this fool. Please don't buy this album, you're better off buying some talented contemporary acts like Leela James, John Legend, and Musiq.

And call me crazy, but have you ever heard of a cop on his last day before retirement acting like Duval did? Ya godda be kidding, the movie fell down, er..., on that alone!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is great, but...","review":"as I am reviewing the product I am giving only one star because Amazon has wrong information for this DVD; according with the product details this movie has spanish audio, however I bought it and audio and subtitles are only in english and french.I can't understand why Amazon gives wrong information for users."},{"rating":"2","title":"A man against a broken society...","review":"I recently saw this film on T.V. and really liked it. Michael Douglas' character is not so much psychotic but more like a man on the edge who gradually breaks down. An original and watchable thriller with decent acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"He fell down","review":"I liked the movie because it moved along at a good pace. The acting was average or better. Michael Douglas was good for the part. The story was good but the writing fell a little short for the sub characters in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast delivery","review":"A perfect quality DVD. Thank you very much. This is an very good movie about the struggles of our society."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Nerdinator\\"","review":"This is sort of a cross between \\"Revenge of the Nerds\\" and \\"High Plains Drifter.\\" If you're a Clint Eastwood fan, then I think you'll like this flick. This is probably my favorite Michael Douglas movie, because he really plays a convincing role. Also good supporting cast, especially Frederick Forrest. Duvall is exceptionally fine also. Really, this movie pretty much acts out what many of us 'white middle class' males fantasize doing when we're just fed up with life in any big city."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of those days...","review":"I think we all have those days where everything just seems to go wrong and things get to you. Just pray you don't go over the edge like Douglas does in this one. One day everything just comes tumbeling down for him. The Whammy Burger scene is, as pointed out by many other reviewers truly funny. I also liked the scene where he tried to get change for the phone. Don't watch it on a bad Monday...just kidding :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid movie ~ don't waste your time","review":"We watched this due to the high review ratings and kept waiting for it to get better. It never did. The characters were not believable and the storyline was lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Movies Ever","review":"Michael Douglas's preformance was spot on. Some one who had reached the end of his rope and just wanted to go home!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great commentary on modern day society.","review":"A very entertaining compelling tale about a man who is broken by the system he has served his whole life. Michael Douglas does a superb job of portraying the everyday man broken by the system that promised to take care of him and reward him. It shows a true break down of a man in our society. Very entertaining and sadly realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining - and dead on!","review":"Reviewer Maltin's query of \\"what's the point?\\" leaves me baffled. The point is that virtually every one of us can relate to the situations Douglas' character confronts and has at some point fantasized about finally cutting through it all. I thought this film was a dead-on (and often witty) commentary on contemporary society which avoided cliché in its portrayal of its very human central characters. Those who could relate to this film might also want to check out the novel \\"Arcadia Falls\\" by Rand Johnson which, though a very different experience, is also a story of a man who finally makes a stand against a world gone wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intense Adventure that gets wilder by the minute!!","review":"I saw this movie for the first time when it was first out in the theaters. I loved it instantly. Michael Douglas is a guy who finally decides to speak up and do something about the problems in our society, in this case it's L.A. What he does is illegal, but it's what a lot of Americans think about doing everday. I like cheering for Michael Douglas in this movie because it lets out my frustration at the same time. That way I don't get into trouble, haha. Unfortunately, his character gets way out of hand and.....well, you have to see the movie, it is an incredible story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is a great classic!

It is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superficial? So What?","review":"I really enjoyed this movie, and I found it even oddly cathartic. Who hasn't felt frustration working through life? This movie is often criticised for using stereotypes and being full of contrived scenes. All true, but the story moves right along at a great pace, and Douglas gives a great performance, as does duvall as a weather-beaten cop near the end of his career. True, it may not be taught in film schools, but I found it extremely watchable and great fun. One of the final shots of Douglas, sprinting along a peer toward his wife, is extrememly powerful and haunting. Suffice to say, it was a movie that sort of crept up on me (not expecting much from it), and certain scenes have stayed with me"},{"rating":"2","title":"my collection","review":"from the first time is saw this picture,i was amazed that mr. Douglas would star in this movie.kudos to him. watch this i see the true life insanity and deep injustices that actually graces our every home and street.this movie happens to tap in the life just a little bit.\\"not economically viable\\"speaks so so true. i never get tired of seeing this over and over again. this movie has many strong messages. this to me is a \\"classic\\"film.."},{"rating":"2","title":"FALLING DOWN DVD - beautiful quality print","review":"Excellent quality color and sharpness on DVD played on large screen TV. Great movie all around, another great Douglas film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was excited to watch this film as I remember seeing parts of it when I was a child. I was quickly dissapointed though. The scenes of urban decay, racial tensions and so on seemed to be very surface level and cheesy. If you want to see a realistic and moving film which presents the loneliness and alienation caused by modern urban society watch Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"more g****e from Joel Schumacher","review":"Regardless of whether this film \\"foreshadows\\" numerous recent shooting sprees, it is still stupid and manipulative. I've always been a fan of Michael Douglas, but this film wastes his talents, not to mention those of Barbara Hershey and Tuesday Weld, who spend all of their screen time having overwrought phone conversations. This film offers absolutely no insight into what motivates the Michael Douglas character, because Schumacher manipulates viewer reaction through a barrage of absurd stereotypes that are a sure bet to threaten middle-class security: a surly Korean convenience store owner, gun-toting Mexican hoodlums in a low-rider, barely cognizant fast food workers, and a slimy Nazi leather shop owner. I stopped watching the film after this last, particularly heavy-handed sequence. Even worse than the director's much-maligned 8mm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling Down review","review":"Really really like this movie. Michael Douglas is superb in his portrayal as a man frustrated and angry with the world and all the stupid people in it. Love to watch it over and over - never get tired of it.

Would reccomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underappreciated","review":"This movie is certainly more symbolic, creative, and inventive than a lot of people give it credit for. Give it a chance--you just might like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Candy Stripers","review":"I have read this book time and again from the time I was 15 years old! I think it is a very interesting book and it has taught me the seriousness of work being done by a Candy Striper or a Pink Lady! The author has really captured the setting for hospital volunteers and how a Candy Striper or Pink Lady can contribute to a hospital with their work! I have really enjoyed reading this book! The scenario just seems to become alive in the description of a Volunteer Program and the tasks in which a Candy Striper or Pink Lady performs at a hospital! Granted, I have found that working at a hospital isn't for me, but reading the book has helped me realise the responsibilities of a hospital volunteer! Dawn E.

I gave it 4 stars because there one or two songs that I don't care for but because of the quality of music, has several songs that are new. This cd is truly inspired with Christmas meaning and feeling unlike many Christmas CD's.I have never heard Point of Grace prior to this, Wow these ladies can make music!! The majority of songs on this album point to the real meaning of Christmas in this beautifully crafted and produced album. Extra points for originality and that It is a must have!! You'll be will be very surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very pleasant cd for holiday listening","review":"I love Christmas music. I bought this disc on a whim - good choice. It is a very simple, relaxing holiday album. The harmonies are smooth and the arrangements are new but familiar. Definitely a keeper for the collection. I also picked up POG's newer Christmas album - also good, but I like this one better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Christmas Album Ever!","review":"This is so cool. All the other Christmas albums usually come off as boring, or too synthesized or something... This one is perfect. I never get sick of the songs! I highly recommend it, more than any other Christmas CD there is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great group, great music","review":"Another hit from Point of Grace that's destined to become a classic.

Hope to see more Christmas music from this group."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is a must have for the holiday season!","review":"Point of Grace brings a new and different sound to the classics on this CD. The other songs are absolutely beautiful. The song 'Coventry Carol' sent shivers through me. I think my favorite song on this CD is 'One King'. What a beautiful way to tell the story of Christmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Words To Describe It...","review":"Well, I dunno what I can say. All I can think of is that it's about time that they came out with a Christmas album. They sound really good. No I take that back--they sound great!

I don't really care for their style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still one of my favorites","review":"This album came out when I was in high school, so it's tied up with many end-of-childhood memories. This is the first CD I pull out when it's time for Christmas music, and I know next year will be no different."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Album for the Holidays","review":"This has become the one Christmas album that I listen to all the time this year. I became familiar with Point of Grace with Steady On, and have been waiting for this ablum for what seems forever. It is a well blended mix of Christmas standards you expect on an album of this type (Jingle Bell Rock, Santa Claus is Comin' to Town), and new arrangements. The way their voices blend with the harmonies can take your breath away, and their version of O Holy Night brings tears to my every time I hear it. Michael Tait is exceptional on O Light of the World, and it is a surprise to hear him when you first listen to the album. And Emmanuel God with Us shows the true meaning of the holidays. I haven't stopped playing this album and don't plan to. It's a beautiful addition to any Christmas music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Christmas Classic","review":"As I write this, I am listening to the Motown-style \\"Jingle Bell Rock\\". It is one of my favorites in the album, and it just makes me lie in front of a fireplace and watch the snow fall outside. This was a very well done album, and Point Of Grace deserves my props! I loved how the instrumental \\"Joy To The World\\" gave an introduction to what the album was going to be like. Favorites of mine were the combination of \\"Let It Snow\\" and \\"Sleigh Ride\\", \\"One King\\", and \\"Not That Far From Bethlehem\\". The girls' voices are in top form, and they stretched their limits on this album. You've got everything--pop, swing, Motown, big band, jazz, orchestral, and choral. It is a very eclectic album, and a must-have for Point Of Grace fans and Christmas music fans everywhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"We never received this from this seller - seller never contacted us after our payment","review":"Never received this - tried to contact the seller, couldn't find any link to get the sellers attention.

The good folks at my neighborhood Christian bookstore know to set aside my copies as soon as they arrive.My review is an endorsement of the entire \\"...In The House\\" series, as they are all equally empowering, uplifting, jazzy, hip while offering (consisently) reverence to our Lord Jesus Christ.I absolutely LOVE this presentation of Urban Praise music and recommend (and even buy extra copies--no dubbing!) to all my friends.Until the next installment, Kimberly Stansell, author Bootstrapper's Success Secrets: 151 Tactics for Building Your Business on a Shoestring Budget (Career Press)"},{"rating":"2","title":"a little night music","review":"This is a great album to just kick back and float to: calm, somber horns recorded in a 2,000,000 gallon water tank (empty and accoustically bizarre) in the Pacific Northwest.

The thing that hit home the hardest was that I need to start acting more like a coach in guiding and not so much as a manager; reading the paragraphs pertaining to this it really made me think of my parenting \\"conversations\\" with my daughter. It's a quick read and I have recommended it to many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kangaroos jump around less than this book","review":"I purchased this book based upon recommendations listed here on Amazon. I should have looked elsewhere for reviews. This book is absolutely unreadable. The author jumps from topic to topic and then back that it makes my head spin. He refers to future chapters, future concepts, and external resources to distraction.Specifically, in the midst of discussing simple element constructions, Mr. Bradley includes a paragraph describing television stations in the UK that has no relevance to the examples given. I'm sure he's proud of his heritage and his expertise on television in England, but what does it have to do with XML Schemas or the current example????????I suspect that Mr. Bradley is a college professor. If he is, he should be forced to sit through recordings of his own lectures. Maybe that would cure him of his unbearable writing style.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a tutorial book or text book at least","review":"I found this book is hard to follow for a beginner. Before one topic is fully explained, it jump to another, and then the topic will be repeated a few chapters later.

With that said....this novel was awful. The characters were one-dimensional and very predictable; the storyline weak and predictable and the writing...well you get the point. The references to our area were sterotypical (and grossly inaccurate)...Really Connie, you didn't have to move to Prince George's County to write this story. Sorry, there is no save here as far as I'm concern, all around bad novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex in the Suburbs oh MY!","review":"Excellent! Bravo! Well worth the wait for Connie Briscoe's return. With the introduction of the Bentley's(aptly titled) Jolene, Patrick, Candace(who really added nothing to the story), Lee, and Pearl, we are introduced to P. G. County, an affluent all Black suburb. The characters were lost in status and power measuring themselves against the stick of the Joneses...whose got the biggest Mercedes, the biggest house, and the best husband. It was a fast intriguing ride. This book comes with a guarantee that there is something for everyone in this story. ENJOY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bourgeosie Black Folks Behaving Badly","review":"This book is definitely a page-turner, and it gets your attention, but not in a good way. The author sensationalizes shallow, tawdry behavior in this tale of affluent Black folks who are little more than social climbers and adulterers. When I was a broke college student, books like this provided a break from my bleak reality. Now that I'm out of school, a litle older and a lot wiser, I find little value in books like this. Vapid plots, superficial characters and wildly unrealistic situations just don't do it for me anymore.I was looking for a trashy summer beach read, and this is definitely that book. If you're expecting anything more you will be quite disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Connie, Connie, Connie","review":"P.G. County initially engaged me -- I was looking for a quick read, nothing too heavy. About two-thirds of the way into the book, I was disappointed, but still hooked by Jolene's antics, so I pushed on! The Candice and Lee storylines added little to the story and the conclusion seemed abrupt. I'm glad I checked this book out from the library rather than purchasing it. Jolene was too funny, so one dimensional, but I couldn't stop laughing at her antics to get the right man, the right house, the right life. I'd recommend this as a read only when someone has exhausted all of the \\"must reads\\" stacked on the your home bookshelves -- or if you stumble across it at your public library!!

Sorry, Connie, but this one didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have read all of Connie Biscoe's books. They were getting better and better and then came P. G.

Out of all the characters, not one, who could be considered a strong Black woman or a strong Black man. When I finished the book, my question was \\"....and.\\" I believe P.G. County was a great disappointment to Connie Biscoe fan club, \\"ME\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"All hyped up but went NOWHERE","review":"I was sadly disapointed in PG County by Connie Briscoe. I waited so long for her new book to come out. I had been reading excerpts on the book before the book actually came out. Ms. Briscoe, PLEASE. This was a nice attempt to come off as Dynasty, but it was also far fetched and her characters were totally unbelievable. They didn't even sound real. I like to read books that I can picture this story happening to me. I could not do that at all with PG County. And the sad part about the book is that even I could have written it. And I don't know the first thing about writing. I am a strong Connie Briscoe fan, but I think she needs to go back to the writing board with this one.One Disapointed Reader!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that is very character driven","review":"I found this book to be good except for the ending. I just found it so intriguing that although these people were upper middle class or rich they had some major problems. My favorite character from the book was Jolene. Jolene might have been sneaky and condescending but I felt so sorry for her because in the end she ended up all by herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth Hurts!","review":"The substance of the stroy was great. I really enjoyed this book and the changes that these so called wealthy people encountered. It proves that the only difference between rich and poor are the attitudes. These people may have lived in a rich part of town, however they are no different than those that live in the \\"Hood\\". It amazes me how people change once they get money which is sad.

This wasn't the best I've seen of Sister Briscoe's writing.I never cared about any of the characters, and the ending was just too Hollywood-ever after-nice and neat. Wonderful book for a diversion, but don't look for too much depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it at all","review":"I didn't find these snobs to be worthy of reading at all. Also, why am I constantly reading about the interracial dating nowadays? I guess I'm just old fashioned but I hope people aren't quite this materialistic. I didn't finish the book but I did scan the pages and pretty much came up with the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read from a good author.","review":"First let us remember this book is fiction not fact. I found this book to be very engaging and well written. Briscoe uses her writing skills to remind us that money doesn't equal no problems. The characters in the book represent everyday people they cheat, they lie, they steal, they hide their true problems and feelings. For this reason I found it a very good read. Keep up the good work Connie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is there a Sequel?","review":"I read this book when it was first published. I thought it was a very good book.

But then who really listens to mama. This book had too much drama, I liked the author's style of writing but this book was a demoralizer for black women. The basis of the book was that you needed to stay with a man who treated you like crap to make it. Or sleep with whom ever you can to make it to the top. And spend well beyond your means. Not a book for someone with low self esteem. But plenty of drama for the soap opera fanatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to the last drop","review":"This is Ms. Brisco's best book in my opinion.Ms. Brisco did an excellent job developing her characters. It was interesting that the things that happened to you in your childhood were some of the very same things that troubled you in your adult life.Barbara and Bradford Bentley were the envy of the neighborhood. They looked like everything was so together on the outside. But, what you see is not what you get.Candice and Jim were a genuinely happy couple until Candice decided to start searching for unknown trouble.Jolene and Patrick were your average couple. Jolene wanted the limelight Patrick didn't. Patrick was a devoted husband and father but Jolene wasn't satisfied she always wanted more. It's amazing how Jolene thought she deserved so much but did so little.This is one of the best books I have read in 2002.If you are interested in a fast read this is the book for you.

I finally checked the audio version out at my library. This book was unbelievable. Really - un (as in not) believable. As a native of the County, I must say I'm so disappointed. These characters were all caricatures. Totally empty! Candace and that story line was contrived and lame. Lee - whatever. I could tell where both those lines were headed almost right away. You knew Lee would end up in silver lake somehow. The inscription on the photo wrapped that up for me quick. I can't even convey how stupid I found the saga of Candace. Jolene had the most to offer, if anything. Not saying much there, though. And did these people ever go to the grocery store or their kids' schools? Sorry. I gave Ms. Briscoe a try.

A typical libertarian science fiction fantasy about a space prison filled with political thought-criminals taking over a luxury space hotel and declaring a new space-republic. Total one-dimensional goofball writing. I can't say it was a guilty pleasure, as it was sort of painful to read something that bad.

The vertical pole came loose after several uses, had to re-tighten the nut. Secondly, there is too much play such that accurate drilling is not possible. I could not figure out a way to get rid of the play or looseness of the stand when it holds the rotary instrument in place. The drill bit end moves at least 1-2 mm, which is quite a bit when working in small scale. That said I'm satisfied with my purchase. Also bought the Dremel brand drill stand, which had more plastic parts on it and made it feel \\"cheaper\\" than this stand.

I went to tighten the press at a specific height and the piece that clamps down on the vertical shaft to hold it in place snapped. I tried to finish what I was doing, since I was almost done. Then the other half of the jaw snapped off when I tried to see if i could get it to clamp just tight enough to hold on for a little bit.If it didn't break just for looking at it, it'd be a great little machine.

Luckily the new stand works better than the original, very smooth action and sturdy. Now, although it's way better built than Dremels offering it isn't perfect. There are no positive detents on the rotating head mount so it's still easy to get it not quite perfectly straight which can lead to drilling at a bit of an angle. Another thing is the locking level for the tool clamp, it's easy to use but can get in the way if the sliding T bar slips down as it can hit the workpiece.Other than that, it's a very nicely made unit. strong, rigid, smooth and reasonably accurate.

Lewis has a masterful way of putting deep concepts into simple words and analogies. The \\"Problem of Pain\\" is an age-old question, asking how can God allow pain and suffering in his creation if he is indeed good and all-powerful.

Lewis","review":"Whether physical, emotional or spiritual, pain is an undeniably reality in this world. C.S. Lewis eloquently explores the pain we endure as humans, as well as the Christian response to it, in this wonderful book.I think many non-believers find pain to be a great deterrent against them accepting faith. They wonder how a loving God would possibly allow His children to suffer. This has never been a problem for me, although I have been fortunate to avoid devastating tragedy in my life. Lewis explains how pain is a product of the Fall, how through the Fall humans have become vulnerable to \\"the laws of nature\\", which they were not subject to before sin tarnished Man. Lewis also writes of animal suffering, the grim reality of Hell and he concludes with a vision of Heaven: \\"But God will look to every soul like its first love because He is its first love\\"I would highly recommend this book to Christian and non-Christian."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spiritual and intellectual understanding","review":"Lewis effectively and poignantly analyzes the age-old \\"Problem of Pain.\\" The logos of his reasoning never falters, but goes hand-in-hand with the pathos of his telling. More still, he effectively establishes his ethos by being uniquely qualified to disect the problem, having suffered much on his own, popularly known to have lost his wife to cancer.This book, an enlightening pleasure, helps the reader understand pain, why it occurs, and why it is necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intelligent approach to finding \\"peace\\" in this suffering world","review":"It is works like this that will have C.S. Lewis ranked, in the future, with thinkers like Augustine and Aquinas. The book is very \\"readable\\" but must be re-read over and over to start to get a hold of the momentous implications of the ideas he is proposing. Do the work to try and comprehend the message and you will be rewarded with a far greater sense of personal peace in this suffering world. Changed my life 14 years ago. Changing my life again as I read it now.There are astounding ideas captured in words. For example, in answer to people saying that they couldn't believe in a God who needed our worship, comes a lucid response about how God doesn't need us, but humbles himself for us to relate to. Lewis writes:\\"A man no more diminishes God's glory by not worshipping Him, than a lunatic can put out the sun by writing the word \\"Darkness\\" on the walls of his cell\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read this book some time before I abandoned Christianity.

My reaction to Lewis's arguments in this book were, \\"Is this really the best we can do?\\" I was deeply disappointed. I'd expected something a lot better and I was astonished at the poverty of Lewis's theodicy.

It viberates with the same passion as the latter. While Hunter's Moon may not appear as glamourous as The Demon Lover at first glance, it has a sweeter plot, a tenderer hero, and hence a more romantic story overall.

Her tone, nuances, and the way she takes us all over the globe make reading her books a fun trip. Not so with The Time of the Hunter's Moon. The pace was very slow, but my biggest complaint is her leading man, Sir Jason. Sir Jason is, in a word, a complete brute. He tries to force young Cordelia from her purity and her morals, which is totally unacceptable. Make no mistake: rape is a crime of power and not a crime of passion. I have no regard for selfish, controlling men. Healthy relationships are based on mutual respect and trust. I don't wish ill of any person, but I guess this is ok to say since Sir Jason is just a character: I wish that he had stayed over the cliff that he went over. ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Holt's best work","review":"Victoria Holt really knows how to spin a yarn, and I've really enjoyed her other books. This one clips along and has some interesting plots turns, but you never really respect the main character, Cordelia, because of her attraction to a man who doesn't exhibit a great deal of solid character, and in fact in one scene attempts to rape her. At the end of the book I felt like her life would go downhill from there. Also, I guessed the keys to the mystery very early in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good romance with a nice touch of mystery","review":"This is the 1st Victoria Holt book I read, now I can't stop buying them.

A couple months after my purchase, the cleanout was backing up so it was my first opportunity to try the new cable. To my disappointment, the cable went no further than 20 feet before I couldn't feed the line any longer. When I pulled out the cable, there were multiple kinks along the cable. This is the same cleanout I've used the previous cable for the past 4 years without fail.

The remaining two die make the point. Whomever has the highest point in the end wins.

I haven't been so consistently pleased by an author's abilities since the early days of Kathleen Woodiwiss.Let's just hope Stephanie doesn't succumb to the same strange malady that later afflicted Woodiwiss' writing.These characters are real, they're sensual, they're interesting, and despite the aforementioned obvious dearth of a good mystery, this romance propels you through 400+ pages with little thought for anything that might be missing.I'm a Laurens fan for life."},{"rating":"1","title":"glorified pornography","review":"I read this author for the first time recently, and was encouraged to buy a second book, this one.

Unfortunately, it was only her goofy cousin whom Gyles had at first mistaken for his betrothed, proving to be a huge waste of time.

Art of Shaving Soap and Post Shave Balm on the other hand are excellent, however the Pre-shave is sub-standard to other products. Once you apply the Pre-shave oil, your hands and face are coated in oil which is tough to remove even with soap.As an alternative, I use the Kiehl's Pre-Shave which allows the face to be slick but not oily so that your shave is smooth.

Their dad is in jail because he tried to sink a boat that was disposing waste into the harbor. No one believes him, so Noah is determined to prove his father right. The best part of the book is when Noah devises his \\"Operation Royal Flush\\" plan! Trust me, this is an awesome book for all ages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A FUN READ ABOUT A SERIOUS SUBJECT! GREAT JOB!","review":"I love to read (and to write) children's books. I think they're much more creative and original than adult books, and FLUSH is no exception. What an imagination this talented author has.I especially like his kooky characters, their sassy dialogue, and that Hiaasen tackles a serious issue like the environment in a clever way that teaches children without preaching ... and makes them laugh all along the way.I may be going about this backwards, but I read FLUSH first; now I'm going back to read HOOT! After reading FLUSH, there's nothing else I can do but read HOOT. I'm hooked on Hiaasen.Fantastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flush this one","review":"Absolutely awful.

Then she went off to school and the first thing she asked for when she was feeling sick was the wellness formula. They are a little hard to get past the nose (I just plug my nose), but they work wonders. One might say \\"miraculous\\".

The price is usually half as much as and/or the quantity is twice as much. I got the largest bottle at 240 tablets which ran slightly over twenty bucks but at a whole foods type place, the bottle would be more than twice as much, maybe close to fifty bucks.

Thinking that maybe I had done something wrong, I ordered another one and the same thing happened after the second wearing. Now I am out of a lot of money with two bras that have failed me. Shame on me. Other than that I could have loved the bra. Did not bother to send them back because the attachment said that if I took the tag off I had to keep it.

The other gripe I have is that what was deliverd in one book before (Chefetz's 2002 book), is now separated into two $50+ books.

The album is street and sweet. Songs like \\"Get No Better,\\" the albums next single has a summertime feel to it. Songs like \\"Can I Talk To You,\\" are street enough for the fellas. The album is just a perfect blend. I'm not 100% sure about the track list listed above because I don't see the song with Mashonda and that is the next single. The album also features Snoop Dogg, Jazze Pha, Styles P, Jadakiss, and of course R. Kelly. I had a chance to interview Cassidy for the site I write for. This is one young rapper that is going places and don't sleep on his debut.DorrieEditor of thabiz.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Than Trash!!!!!","review":"Ive been listening to cassidy for a while and his mixtape material is great but, this album is weak beyond reason, it just stinks its to commercial for an MC of cassidy's caliber, i just hope that he redeems himself on the next album (IM a Hustler June 28 2005)."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"split personalty was a pretty good cd from cassidy. which has songs that are hot. and most of the tracks are well produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"impressed","review":"i was pretty impressed with this cd. since this cd has satisfying songs. and i highly reccomend this cd too rap fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick of worthless newcomers","review":"Ok, my advice is dont buy this.

Face finish is a gray/black with blue markings, chrome hands and hour markers. Alarm is set with Blue hand easily with stem pulled to first detent and counter rotations. On/Off function is marked in blue at the 8 hour position button. Confirmed by \\"beeps\\". Crystal is slightly domed and very scratch resistant. I am a Bulova/Accutron convert.

No matter how much she kicks and wiggles, she can't make the sides move enough to set the \\"motion\\" setting off. We tried the little green pillow to keep her lifted up and it didn't work so we use our boppy and it works great. She's stays entertained for at least a 1/2 hour.

The toys are bright and colourful and the mat and toys all wash well. My only complaint is that the ladybug rattle is quite difficult to use for a small baby and that there are not enough rings included to make the toys low enough for a small baby. Overall a great way to give your baby some activity."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the safest","review":"This product, like many others, seems a must-have for babies. My son was laying on it today on his back playing with all of the dangling toys. He pulled his feet into the air, and hooked his leg around one of the poles above his head. Within one second, as he brought his leg back down to the floor with the pole tangled up in it, he became rolled up and encassed inside the mat. The pillow ended up on his face while he was trapped in the mat. I will definitely be writing to the company to complain. Thank goodness he was not unsupervised."},{"rating":"1","title":"dangerous","review":"I was very angry and disappointed in this play gym. It collapsed twice on my baby within the first two weeks we had it. Once the base mat folded around my baby causing a suffocation hazard.

Now she is four months old and it is still her favorite toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Toy for baby under 6 months!","review":"My daughter loved this activity mat from the time when she just smiled up at the lighted musical star when she was 6 weeks until she could grab and pull each bird and teether when she was 5 months old. Only now, when she is 6 months old, has she really outgrown it (and that's because she is crawling and can get stuck on the padded bars). She still loves the attachments (esp. the blue teething ring) and I feel that overall this play mat was worth every penny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!","review":"Like the previous reviewer, we received both the Baby Einstein and Gymini activity mats. We actually tried them out ourselves by lying down on the mat and looking up to get the baby's point of view (try it yourself!).

Our baby loved it and kept discovering new things about it every few days."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun play mat for my little man","review":"My baby boy has never been into toys that dangle and rattle, so it has been tricky finding him things that would keep him interested to encourage exploration and learning. So when I got the Baby Einstein Play Gym from a friend, I was skeptical. But my baby boy loved it the first time I laid him on it. He especially liked the little star that displays lights as it plays music. I think that's the biggest thing that kept him really focused on this toy for a while. As for the duck, the bird, the other stuff hanging on this play mat, he did use them as punching bags which is pretty cute. Now that my boy lays on his tummy more and more, he's beginning to explore the images on the mat with gusto. I like this product and highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best thing I purchased","review":"I love this activity center and my son does too. He plays on this mat as much as he wants to. The toys can be rotated and moved around on the various links, the musical star captivates him, the picture frame can be changed out with family photos or flash cards, and he loves to read the book during tummy time. I have never really bothered with the green pillow, but nevertheless this is one of my favorite purchases I have made for my baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Terrific Playmat","review":"Being a 1st time mom, I had no idea that my son would \\"need\\" one of these until I received it as a gift.

I love to set it to motion to let him control the activity star, which is definately the main attraction on this toy.The only drawback for me is that the volume level is not adjustable & the lights do not work unless the music is playing too."},{"rating":"2","title":"mikey likes it!","review":"my son loves this play gym, he's been playing in it since he was 1 month. as he gets older he plays longer. he loves the music star that lights up. when i set the music to motion sensored, he figures out how to keep the music going. when he spends tummy time on the mat, he's fascinated with all the colors. he also likes looking at the animal's eyes on the mat. tne play gym comes with extra rings so that you can lower the toys to the baby's level. they have a lot more fun when they can actually touch the toys. one thing i found out is when you put the soft bars up, the picture doesn't show them crossed, the gym is more secure with the soft bars crossed. with the bars the way the picture shows, my son actually rolled the whole mat over on himself. with that problem solved, this gym is overall A+."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby's first toy","review":"This is the first toy my baby played with.

We can raise or lower the toys depending on how active she is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Quite What We Hoped For","review":"I'm sure this is a fine product. Unfortunately, our little one didn't really have any interest in it. She really liked the star though. She would giggle at it & smile, but would get tired of it after a few minutes.

My daughter is 2mo. and she is very entertained by the gym. It keeps her mind stimulated with the adorable hanging toys and the star in the sky singing right above her. She uses her reflexes to play with the suspended toys and is even grasping them now when I ask her to grab a specific toy. My only problem is that the adorable smiling star has stopped playing music and makes a static noise and the lights stopped flashing. I had to turn it off when a battery change did not improve the problem. I need a replacement and do not know where to get one without a receipt.

She has been using it since she was about 2 weeks old. She can't keep her eyes off the star at the top of the gym, even when it is not playing. She is able to kick the toys that hang off the links to make it play very pleasant music. It seems that the motion sensor has become less sensitive over time, which is very disappointing. She is able to play with the motion sensor and the toys for up to 10 minutes, which for a 2 month old seems like an eternity. It give me time to do a quick chore around the house.The mirror on the gym is not the best but it serves its purpose. I like the little pillow that comes with it too, for tummy time and to prop her head so she can see better when laying on the mat.Overall, I strongly recommend this toy! It is well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the star makes the toy","review":"I agree with the other reviewer who said the musical star makes this toy. So far that is the only thing that has really captured our 4-month-old daughter's attention. The songs are different and a little complex without being too stimulating. Best of all they are not annoying to parents, and I like that it can be switched from continuous mode to short mode or motion mode or OFF. The other toys are OK, nothing too interesting, but the rings do allow you to switch out other toys. I think our daughter is just more of a passive observer right now; she can lie on the mat for 20 minutes looking around without fussing so maybe she is entertained, she just isn't reaching out. Also easy to fold up flat and store out of sight. All in all a good product, I feel like we will still get a lot more use out of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful toy!!","review":"This is the best play gym! At 0 to 1.5 months my baby would like to lie under it and look at the lady bug and sometimes the mirror that it comes with and now at 2 months my son is completely absorbed by the sun that plays classical music and lights up according to the notes!

It has alot of things for the baby to look at and some of the toys are interactive (sqeaking, playing music). When my son was about a week old, I would lie him on the mat (while I did the dreaded dishes) so he could look at the hanging toys. As the months went by he began to bat at them, and then tugged at them in an effort to get them down and play with them. He came to love the mat! Because it has all kinds of loops that can be used to attach more toys (any kind of toy that can hang) we would be able to swap them off the playthings, so he would stay interested longer. Sometimes he would spend up to an hour playing (this enabled him to find amusement on his own, bonus!). But alas when he began to sit up, he was too tall to sit under the arches without getting tangled up in them. So onto new amusements..."},{"rating":"2","title":"great play mat","review":"My daughter has been using this play mat since she was born. She LOVES the flashing of the lights and music of the star. She talks to it every time she's there. It's great for back and tummy time. I don't like how the mirror is metallic and doesn't provide a great reflection.

We figured for the price it must have been a good toy, but after 5 mins of the music my husband and I were ready to take it back. It plays only 2 or 3 diff. tunes. My daughter however did like the toys and the star, but she would only lay under it for about 10 mins. She is now 5 months old and still does not like this toy. We do hook the animals onto another musical toy(made by Playskool) that was given to us by a friend whose daughter had outgrown it and she likes it much better and I believe it only costs about $20. This isn't a terrible toy, I just expected a lot more out of it for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"My daughter hated it","review":"I don't know if it was because my daughter was already 3 months old when I bought this (maybe you should introduce it to a much younger infant?) or that she wouldn't have liked it anyway. She cried when the star was turned on and she didn't seem interested in any of the hanging toys. When she was placed on her back, she kept trying to roll over (to get away from that star, or so it seemed) and she learned to roll over right away. Unfortunately, the pad is so rough that her cheeks were bright red from rubbing against it for only 5-10 min. Maybe washing it would fix that problem, but I returned it the next day. Also, it was smaller than I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is the Size Stated right?","review":"I just ordered this item and then realized how small it is. 16\\"?

My daughter would scream after about 2 minutes when laid down on this play gym. She never used it longer than 5 minutes.

But overall, I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"My son liked this gym for only a few weeks.

I purchased it because I figured since it was a Baby Einstein product, it had to be good. Plus, the reviews for it were excellent. First of all, the playmat is too small for my boy. He is an average six month old (19 pounds, 29 inches). Whenever he rolls onto his tummy on this mat, he ends up halfway off the mat. Second, the musical star only plays three very short songs. My boy gets bored of the repetition. Third, when I purchased the mat, I liked how vibrant the colors were. After a couple washings, the colors have faded and the mat looks like we've had it for a lot longer than we really have.Don't get me wrong. My boy does like to chew on the animals and he will look at himself in the mirror occassionally. But the mat only entertains my boy long enough for me to brush my teeth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere for a tummy time mat/toy bar","review":"I put this on my baby registry, received it, but now wish I had done more research. This gym is essentially a blanket with a few toys hanging too far away from a baby's reach.The toys do not hang down far so it's impossible for any baby to reach them unless multiple plastic rings are put together from the other toys. The light/musical star is really irritating -- the musical tones sound awful.Don't be wooed by the 'Baby Einstein' theme. This is too expensive for what you get and I really believe you are paying for the name (the DVDs are good, specifically Bach and Mozart). If you're buying this for tummy time, there's nothing special about it. If you're buying it so your baby can grab at objects, it's worthless. My son loves his $9 Sassy Bugs on Board that are attached to his car seat.I wish I had seen this tummy time item before my son was born: Lamaze Spin & Explore Garden Gym."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I read about this mat online and was impressed by its reviews. So I registered for it and received it as a shower gift. First, I must say my son LOVES this mat. There is a little star that hangs at the top and plays music and lights up. He loves to watch it and sing along with it. (He is 3 mos. old) Unfortunately, the star has broken TWICE. The first time it just stopped playing after only a few weeks. I called the manufacturer and they sent a replacement. GREAT. So, I was using it and after about 10 hours of play it stopped working. I called the company again and they said the stars are on backorder for 3 mos.!!So...while the mat is great and my son loves the star, the silly thing doesn't work. I would have to say NOT to purchase this mat. There's nothing worse than having your newborn like something and then having it taken away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a Great Toy","review":"This play mat is great. My son has been using it since about 2 1/2 months. He LOVES it! He smiles and kicks his arms and legs.He loves the Star and the beetle. You do have to re-start the music often but I believe it is a great way to make sure people are not leaving the child unattended for too long a period of time. I washed the matt 3 times already and so far it looks like it's holding up okay. It also comes with a small pillow to sit the baby up on which is great for my son who has acid reflux. Overall it is a great toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great playmat!","review":"My son just turned 4 months old and now loves this playmat! He didn't really pay attention to the toys on it before, but now, he bats at the toys hanging, stares at himself in the mirrow and rolls all over the floor pad. Plus, I put a picture of our family in the little photo holder, and he looks at the a lot too. The only thing I did not like about it was the music maker. If you turn it on, it plays three little songs, then stops. You have to turn it off, then back on. Now that my son can shake the play mat, I can leave the music maker in \\"motion\\" mode, so when he shakes it, the music turns on! I would encourage you to buy this product but not before a baby has an interest and can grasp toys and/or can roll!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Item, watch out when opening","review":"We just bought this for our 3 week old son. He loves it, and will stare up at it. I have to activate the star, which is fine for now. I think the size of the mat is fine, especially for a newborn, and older baby can sit up on it. I chose this one over others because of the bright colors and the pillow. All in all, a GREAT product. However....Be very careful when opening it. I opened it, and the rods went flying across the room, hitting my daughter in the head. She wasn't hurt, but it sure wasn't expected. As I was setting up the rods, I saw a warning tag on the end of one: \\"Be careful when opening as fiber glass rods may spring outward\\". Oh, gee, that was quite helpful to put there as I couldn't see it at all. They really need to put it on the package. Other than that, I reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My best purchase ever!","review":"My 11-week old daughter absolutely loves this gym! At first, she wasn't too excited about it - it only held her attention for a few minutes. But over the last 6 weeks she has fallen in love with the musical star (she smiles and coos) and has started to bat at & hold on to the toys. I like the fact that you can raise or lower the toys with the extra links, and I have also purchased different toys by other manufacturers that are easily slipped into the loops on the toy bar for variety. She loves the motion setting (she kicks & starts the toy herself) and the music & lights are actually very entertaining. Overall, this is the best purchase I have made for her to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smiles for the Star","review":"My daughter LOVED this play gym. She would talk and smile and laugh whenever I turned the music on. Something about the smiling star and the flashing lights kept her attention for long periods of time. I rated it only a 4 star though because she only used it for about 4 months (she's rolling now and doesn't stay on it) and it's kind of expensive to only use for a short period of time. It is good quality and has held up, though, so I will use for the next baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"They removed the lights from the star!","review":"After researching all of the different mats for our daughter we chose the Baby Einstein one solely because of the star with lights. If you read through the reviews here you'll see that a huge number of people mention that the star is what makes this set worthwhile.We received our mat today and the star no longer has the lights in it. Since looking at lights is the current favorite activity of our 1 month old we were extremely disappointed. We called Baby Einstein and they confirmed that even though the packaging and instructions still say the star has lights that the star has indeed had the lights removed. They had no explanation why this was done.What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birth to 6 months plus!","review":"This play gym is outstanding. We started using it when our son was about 6 weeks old and he is now 6 months old and he loves it. I have found that so many baby items that you purchase are only used for a month or two but this item is still being used at 6 months! Its a great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CHOKING HAZARD","review":"There was a time I would have rated this well, probably 4 stars. However, today we had quite a scare because of this product. A choking hazard size piece (fits inside a toilet paper tube) of plastic broke off of the activity star today, the part of the Baby Einstein activity gym that plays music and shows lights. It is one of the round, yellow pieces of plastic where a light would be shown. My 6.5 month old daughter was playing with her activity gym when I noticed the yellow piece on the floor, picked it up, and determined its origin. I'm so thankful that I found it so quickly before it ended up in her hands/mouth. I'm also very concerned that this happened and the \\"what if\\" that came too close to happening. I filed a report with the CPSC and the company and I'm waiting to hear back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately not worth the money","review":"I went out an purchased this playmat for my 3 month old son and was very disappointed. \\"Baby Einstein\\" products seem to be all the rave now but really it wasn't worth the money...the toys and pictures on it are very cheap looking and overall it doesn't come with anything really interesting for them to look at...what's with the picture of the rabbit and the one page book? At the most we use the musical star that it comes with and attach it to the changing table,,,it's the only use we've gotten out of it so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few faults, but overall, a really good play gym","review":"What I like about it:1. Easy to tear down for laundering the blanket2. Lots of \\"links\\" to move the toys around - keeps things interesting3. We can put other small toys on the links for added variety4. She loved it laying down, and now that she's sitting up, she still loves itWhat I don't like about it:1. The blanket looks faded after just a few washings (cold water, delicate cycle, with Dreft)2. The volume on the musical star is pretty loud and only plays 3 songs, which gets on your nerves after a while3. The open-ended design of the links causes them to stretch easily when your baby grabs a toy and yanks on it - ours now look more like the letter \\"C\\" than like a chain linkOverall, we like it, but if I had it to do over again I might research play gyms a bit more. This one was kind of expensive (we paid $50), and I think we could have found something a little better if we hadn't been so excited about the Baby Einstein name."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good activity center","review":"I started using this with my twin boys when they were approximately 2 months old. They loved it, especially the musical star with the lights. It was a real lifesaver when I needed a break from holding a baby to be able to put him in the gym for a few minutes. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is that the carrying case is ridiculous - it opens from the bottom (handle is on the top with a foldover flap at the bottom that is velcroed in place) so the gym has a tendency to fall out if you use the carrying case a lot and the plastic weakens. Otherwise, a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"My daughter loves this toy. She has enjoyed it since she was about 4 weeks old. It keeps her occupied for up to 45 min at a time. She gets very excited by the flashing lights and loves to kick the bars on the motion setting. The only bad thing is that the batteries wear out every few days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly entertaining for baby","review":"My 2 month old son loves this mat! He is usually very fussy when he is left alone for play time in his swing or on one of his other mats. When I put him on this, however, he will stay about 10 minutes (sometimes longer!) giggling at the musical star. Its great because my older son loves to \\"read\\" to him all of the animal names. Its the first toy they've played with together! Like most of the other Einstein products, this one gets Kudos!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST GYM","review":"My daughter has been using this gym since she was one week old. She is now three months and will play underneath it as long as 30 minutes. This has been her favorite toy and everyday she finds something different to explore and entertain her. Excellent buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"We have this product for our son... he likes it... and loves to kick and hit at the items. Esp. the items that rattle.... he is still to young to be able to enjoy the other toys. This product is top of the line for interesting toys, and stimulation. However, I do find the repetitive nature and the choice of songs used on this product to be some what annoying.So... a tip for other parents... what I do is.. place my son on the mat to play... and play baby einstein cd's or dvds at the same time... so that I don't have to deal with hearing the same three annoying tunes over and over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MY DAUGHTER GIVES IT ALL HAPPY SPIT BUBBLES","review":"This is a great toy. My daughter loves the hanging toys. They can be moved around,and toys can be added. I bought mine off of ebay for half the price including shipping and was in PERFECT SHAPE. No matter the price it is well worth it. The musical star has many settings, lights up and my daughter loves it and laughs all the time.She has been on it since 2months and she is now 5months. It is nice and soft, as well as the toys and pillow.She is able to pull and twist herself around on it using the dome like bars,I have no worry of something falling on her.She responded to the bright colors very early on.I could go on and on, I wish this was around when my now 7yr old son was a baby. I think this item beats any of the FisherPrice toys in this catagory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pillow useful","review":"My daughter enjoyed this gym for several months, and it is now being enjoyed by a neighbor. It comes with a pillow somewhat similar to a small Boppy. It is great for tummy time. I did not purchase this gym, it was a gift. It is quite pricey for what it is. Most babies I would think would be as happy with a less expensive alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for motor development","review":"My daughter is now 6 months old. She started using the gym at about 2 months. In the begining she couldn't touch anything, so she was more interested in the star. This started to blink and sing when we would stimulate the gym. We attached some link-a-dos to make toys more accesible to her. She started to bat at them. I watched her grow. From batting, to reaching and cross-reaching with her hands. We took the link-a-dos away now, because she can actually reach the toys. This is one of her favorite toys. Lately, she started to pull on the bars and pulls the toy over her. It's not hurting her, but we need to be around so she won't get scared of being hidden under the mat. I think she outgrew the toy :( I would recommend this toy to anyone who wants some piece of mind; to a mommy that wants to do somethings for herself while the baby enjoys her or himself. Anyways, great toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for our lil' one","review":"Our baby loves this play gym! When he was younger, he used to love looking at the lights on the star. Now that he is older (7 months)he loves to play with all the colorful toys dangling from the bars. There are cute little creatures that make noise when squeezed and rattled. This gym was a good investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"My problems","review":"My baby loved this play yard. It was the only toy that would keep her attention for more than 10 minutes. The problem is we went through 3 in less than a month. The star and lights device kept shorting out. Sometime is would just keep two seconds of music over and over or sometimes you would hear it shorting out and then just quit. My baby would get upset and just stare waiting for the lights to come back on. I ended up finally just returning and getting something else all together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"This is one of the most moving and best books for children about Buddha's life.

It was informative and hilarious! Of course my husband didnt read it unless I made him or read it to him, but it was something funny for him to relate to and to follow along with the pregancy. Every chapter dealt with the phases of pregnancy and informed him the reasons behind the cravings and to obey the hungry prego, too funny! I HIGHLY recommend it to everyone and it is a great gift for anyone that has a sense of humor!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My kind of book","review":"I love What To Expect When You're Expecting and all those books that get technical and super detailed but Pregnancy Sucks is a nice something else.

I never even heard of these cats until I bought this joint. So after that I checked out their website...www.BroughamRecords.com.... and found more on this label and the cats on the website. All these rappers are from Canada except 1 group from Seattle (which really don't do justice for the album... but what ever) and these rappers were tight!! Better than I've heard come out of the US lately... Anyways, I've done more research on these cats and now im more into the Canadian hip hop scene and these cats are makin' a name for themselves.

It can get a little annoying, but most of the toys he loves can get a little annoying to adults. On the 'old macdonald' setting it says the names of the animals and things like \\"I like mud\\" when you press the pig. One the 'mary had a little lamb' music setting, if you press the cow it moos the current song inseatd of singing the words. Cute and creative. I think this is a fun and great learning toy.

I honestly figured it was just a fluke, but decided to hold off on letting her play with it until she was a bit older. At 13 months I brought the toy back out and let her play with it again. A few days later her hand got so stuck where the pig swings and I couldn't get it out!!! She was hysterical, and it took quite a bit of wiggling to get her little hand free.

So I was looking for something similiar that he could grow into. I found it with the farm he could play it was at 5 months, but around 8 months and now at 10 months still enjoys playing with it. I like it because he teaches colors, music, vocabulary of farm animals and musical instruments. My son likes how there are buttons to push and a book to flip.

Also, What were they writing? This book printed duirng the 90's successfully answers and is still the definitive book on the subject of female poets of the Harlem Renaissance era. From Angelina Weld Grimke, Helene Johnson to Georgia Douglas Johnson's famous poem, Heart of a Woman, to some of the poets who are not well known, such as Mary Jenness and Ruth Dixon, this book explores the themes of the notable and less notable in poetry. This book is divided into three sections, Protest, Heritage and Love & Passion. This book gives a wonderful taste of poetry with little or no commentary. This is a must read and must have for anyone who has ever contemplated the question, who were the female writers of the period and what did they write?

The connectors on the back are exactly the same as Canon branded batteries.- Cheap - buy 3-4 of these instead of 1 canon branded one - and get more battery life as well.What's not so good:The battery cap on canon's batteries is a little too big for this one, it 'fits' but falls off extremely easily.

I literally could not put it down.The story of Rubin Carter, who began his early adulthood as a violent predator in the ring, learned an ever-increasing lesson about power, injustice, and ultimately, humility. This is the predator's tale of learning what it feels like to be the hunted one, and is one man's journey to self-actualization, albeit at the hands of an inhuman society.While the movie gave a semi-authentic account of the legal transpirations, it gave very little detail as to the actual dynamics of the Canadian commune, particularly as to Rubin himself once he had gained his freedom. This book fills that void, particularly as to Rubin's relationship with Lisa and her domination of all in the group. What stands out in my mind is Skeet McClure's statement to Rubin about his relationship with the group -- \\"You've traded one prison for another.\\"This book is dynamic, moving, and unforgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"The More you read about Rubin Carter the more Compelling he is.the odds he overcame&the way he stayed Mentally Strong when it seemed he had no hope.this book is very Honest&detailed.his story will have you Hooked for days.it's very sad.How Many times does this still happen today?

I could not put the book down! This is a GREAT book. And very well written. The story of his life will touch anyone. I mean this guy went through hell.As far as how correct the info is....who is to say. I only have what is in this book to go by as far as guilt or innocent is concerned. Obvisouly, the info about his case that is provided in the book makes him look innocent. And if the evidence in his first trial is in fact what we read about in the book, then this guy was innocent. Again, without having other details, there is no way of knowing if they selectively ommited more incriminating facts.Buy this book! You won't regret it. Now I have to go rent the movie to see if it can even hold a candle to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Journey to Rubin","review":"I loved this book almost as much as I loved the movie. For me it was one more step to tracking down the man, the legend. This is a wonderful book for anyone to read, from juveniles through senior citizens.

In fact, this book pointed out the much less glamorous and hard side of Mr. Carter. The movie romanticized a person the book reveals to have been a rather unloveable, sometimes mean, ugly human being.I came to love Mr. Washington's version of Hurricane Carter, I can only fear the one in this book.Did your mama ever tell you, \\"I don't know what you did but I know you did something.\\" Did you get spankings for things you may not have done, only to know that you really had done something even worse? Well, I think Mr. Carter served time for a crime he didn't commit, but in all probability deserved to serve time for crimes not discovered by the authorities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Slanted Book","review":"This book, while well-written, is a factual travesty. Hurricane Carter was convicted twice for these murders, the second time by a racially mixed jury.There is plenty of evidence to indicate that Carter was absolutely guilty, and the book is at variance with many known facts of the case.I strongly suggest that anyone who reads this book also read some of the other, well-researched works that offer a contrary view.Frankly, I prefer to reserve my compassion for the victims of evil, rather than its perpetrators."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"This book was pretty good.

(what happened to the different players, who were the cops responsible in NJ, did Rubin and the Canadian lady have anything more than a friendship, what happened to Lazarus ...etc).I couldnt put the book down and found the story even more disconcerting in book form than the movie; since actual names and people were portrayed (in the movie for instance the changed the evil cops name...).In the book there is also an update (since the movie) to what has happened to Rubin et al, although, curiously, no mention of the movie itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Detailed Account Worth Reading","review":"James Hirsch depicts Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter's legal battle quite well in this nicely written biography. It is obvious that Hirsch did countless hours of research to complete it.The detail, whether it is on the actual cases, his life in prison, his encounter with Lezra, or just the background, is incredible. I liked the fact that he took this overabundance of meticulous, detailed information and spewed it out into a very cogent and readable format.Carter's story is one of perserverance, courage, and inspiration. Hirsh captures this perfectly in this well-written book. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the movie instead","review":"I really wanted to like this book because I was so intrigued by Rubin Carter's story.

Plain and simple. She is no national treasure. She is no pillar of the press.

Their bias against the current administration is so great that they have lost credibility with main stream America. For far too many years, Ms. Thomas considered herself the pom pom girl of the press corps.At eighty-six and relegated to the back of the room and mostly ignored she has raised the only voice she has left to once more vilify Bush and castigate the other members of the press corps for not being even more outrageous than they already are.The Lefties here apparently love the book. Let them waste their money on it. Save yours."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's going on in Washington DC?","review":"The lady in the red suit scores again with this cogent comment on the Washington press corps. Ms. Thomas, who pitches hardball questions during press conferences if she is allowed to do so, has very coherently and successfully produced a well-reasoned text about why the press corps failed the American people by not investigating the shenanigans surrounding the present administration.

This seventh set doesn't really seem like a unified whole and one of the most interesting songs is buried after the horrid \\"Faye Tucker\\" as a hidden track. Why the hell do artists create hidden tracks and then announce on the cover that there's a hidden track?So, overall, I would say that I'm waiting for the next album, because when I'm in my car, I have absolutely no desire to pop this one in the CD player.I'm seeing them on Sunday, December 5th.

The Madd Rapper had annoying repeative choruses that remind me of the highly dissapointing new Puffy album.

The story is set in the West Indies and is divided into 3 parts. The first is about her childhood, written from her perspective, the second details her marriage to an English man (who is never named, but who is assumed to be Mr Rochester) during which she begins her descent into madness, told from the perspective of Mr Rochester and the third is during her time locked up in the heights of Thornfield Hall from Jane Eyre with her carer Grace Poole from whose perspective this section is told. It was a great read, short, but very well written. Jean Rhys certainly had a talent for beautiful and sensory descriptive language and this was definitely what I loved most about this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for anyone studying the Caribbean","review":"This book is a real gem, which can be analized on many levels. This is not simply a passionate love story. It is a wonderful description of the Caribbean plantation society of the late 1800's, and an excellent account of the relationship that existed at that time between the new class of Caribbean Creoles and the members of the metropolitan European society. The author brilliantly uses the unequal relationship between a man and a woman to symbolize the historic colonial relationship. In addition, the novel is an important contribution to Caribbean literature in the sense that it was able to take the European classic Jean Eyre and bring it into the Caribbean context. A wonderful book for anyone studying Latin America or the Caribbean"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone who loved the classic Jane Eyre will hate this book.","review":"Takes the character of Mr. Rochester and turns him into a monster. Cheap rip-off of a great classic. Worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Descent into madness","review":"Wide Sargasso Sea is a reworking and reanalysing of Jane Eyre's contrast Bertha. The style is careful with every line potentially meaningful. Antoinette, Bertha's real name, is a worthy character to mould and examine. Rochester is worth having a dig at. After all, he is an aristocratic, morally obstinate, brick in Jane Eyre so he's no different in Wide Sargasso Sea. The dig is aimed at the British Empire and the problems that slavery brought.As some other reviews state Wide Sargasso Sea is a modern classic, with modernists twists and turns and psychological analysis. It's not depressive but realistic and a valuable expression of the author's intentions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great.....if you're into masochism","review":"I did not read this book out of choice...it was cruelly forced upon me by the board of education.

Jean Rhys is definitely not Charlotte Bronte and should have left the character of Bertha Mason alone.I enjoyed \\"Jane Eyre\\", but this book was sub-standard at best. The author even had the effrontery of changing the character's name. Okay, so Edward Rochester is not the best person in \\"Jane Eyre\\", but he does not deserve to be portrayed as a manipulative mongrel in this novel. If he truly was that bad, then Miss Eyre is hardly a good judge of character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Chore","review":"Generally when I pick up a novel I expect to get something out of it. Having to read this for my English class I found it to be a chore. Rhys expanded on a character who was ment to be a mystery. Although it did have it's moments (the uprising of the slaves) it lacked in the delopement of Rochester of Antionette (Bertha). I cannot say it was not teh worst piece of litureture I have read for nothing compare with Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, but I did feel left a little empty as to why some of things happened the way they did.

While some books have something for everyone, this book has something to disappoint almost everyone. The writing was O.K., but it is nothing special. The characters are thinly developed. The plot is scanty and of little consequence. Ms. Rhys also set the book in time so that it could not align with the plot of \\"Jane Eyre.\\" I can only assume that the linkage was a notional attempt at PR.While the novel is short, so is life.

It drags on and on, employing multiple narrative perspectives, shifting from one to the next and back again. Very atmospheric with strong pathos throughout, I just didn't enjoy the story. Don't expect to be uplifted. The plot just dragged on towards the inevitable. Rochester was not at all a sympathetic character. If Jane Eyre created a wronged madwoman and left her in the attic after a brief visit, Wide Sargasso Sea creates an absolutely mean Rochester whose behavior seems too manufactured as a feminist revenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhys humiliates Bronte! Great stuff.","review":"The silly idealism of Jane Eyre is brought harshly down to earth with a work that forces its reader to view the characters as human beings rather than plot devices. It defends the characters Bronte marginalized and attacks those she portrayed as heroes, making the state of the universe more balanced, confused, and real.This book does not blame Rochester for the failure which takes place; nor does it blame Antoinette; it blames the cultural divide which made the whole conflict inevitable. Its ability to portray a tragedy without guilt dumped on a villain's shoulders is admirable. It is not a comfortable book or an easy read; it turns a fairy tale into a biography, a painting into a photograph."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"Meh. Just meh.

Jean Rhys should never have touched Jane Eyre, a classic, to begin with. First of all, she ruins the character of Rochester. In the original he is a hero, and a wonderful person. In Rhys', he is an evil, evil man. This made the book almost impossible to read. Second, there were all these changes of point of view without any notice! One page Bertha is telling the story, the next Rochester is. Horrible. Thirdly, Rhys uses fragmented sentences, bad grammar, and no punctuation in some parts when Bertha is telling the story. The only thing this accomplishes is it makes an even bigger pain in the butt to read. No one cares about Bertha or Antoinetta as Rhys calls her in her version, and the book is a complete waste of time. So, unless someone is holding a gun up to your head, do not read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some things aren't meant to be known","review":"This book was a horrible piece of literature that I was forced to read for my school. It completely wrecks the book of Jane Eyre. Some things are not meant to be known. The mysterious of Bertha (Antoinette), added to the quality of Jane Eyre. Wide Sargasso Sea did nothing to add to Jane Eyre but rather take away from it. Rochester believed to be a great man at the end if Jane Eyre. After reading Wide Sargasso Sea, this is not the case. Maybe Charolette Bronte did not want the reader to believe this, but Jean Rhys comes in and just about recreates one's beliefs about Jane Eyre. I would reccomend that this book should not be read. Rather, it should be burned."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was more tedious and painful than chewing glass!!","review":"Due to the sadistic nature of the Board Of Education we were forced to read this book for 3 unit English. After studying Jane Eyre we were thankful for the shorter book, after reading it however there must be something said of someone who must stoop to stealing a classics characters and mutilating them reducing them to self centred, psychologically impaired,suicidal beings. If it were possible I would have given negative stars for the time I wasted from my life forced to read this book. Im hoping that in the afterlife Charlotte Bronte is teaching Jean Rhys a lesson about plaguarism by stabbing her repeatedly from the inside out while quoting Jane Eyre."},{"rating":"1","title":"provides a clear and coherent argument but lacks interest","review":"I had been told of this book and was eager to read it, but was disappointed by it. It gives the tale of Antoinette Mason (Rochester's wife) in *Jane Eyre*, and in describing the background and life of \\"the madwoman in the attic,\\" argues against the values implicit and explicit in the Bronte novel. But these characters are not compelling. The book is an argument, not a vivid novel that pulls the reader into its vortex. If I want an argument, I can read literary theory or criticism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best \\"Fanfiction\\"","review":"I generally have an enormous problem with authors writing spin-offs on books such as classics, simply because they're essentially writing fanfiction and being praised for it. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and at first I was upset at this book. However, it's joined Jane Eyre as one of my favorite books. It is extremely well written, not to mention all the literary devices the author uses very effectively. I like her premise, that she felt it was unfair of Bronte not to give Antoinette Mason a story. In Jane Eyre she is simply depicted as an evil madwoman, whereas in Wide Sargasso Sea the author forces the reader to see her as a complete human being who has lived a complete life. By the end of it I had the greatest sympathy for her, though as a fan of Mr. Rochester I did feel she was a little hard on him, considering what he had to go through. All in all, though, this is a magnificent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting and Powerful","review":"This is a wonderful classic that captures a time and place better than almost any other short novel written during the period. It is dark and captivating, a terrific novel on nearly every level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Racism, madness, and an exotic backdrop","review":"The gimick is known: this novel tells the story of Antoinette \\"Bertha\\" Cosway-Rochester before her inprisonment in the atic as depicted in Charolotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. Rhys has managed to bring a previously undeveloped character to life and to return her dignity to her. This novel examines race issues in the Carribean while it depicts the romance-gone-sour that lead to Rochester's brooding, tormented personality from Jane Eyre. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked the \\"idea\\" of the book, not the actuality","review":"This book was \\"almost\\" a very good book, but something was off. What Rhys did well was portray the sensual atmosphere of Jamaica and the paranoia/confusion/disjointedness of mental illness. Attempting to understand and identify with the characters can almost make the reader feel as if she herself is mentally disturbed. While this is an original attempt in writing, I felt unconnected to this book. I didn't feel I truly understood either Antoinette or Rochester's motivations or personalities, and as such I did not really care what happened in the book. I liked the \\"idea\\" of the book -- i.e. examining a character made famous in literature through another perspective. If you also like that \\"idea,\\" then I recommend the book \\"Wicked\\" by Gregory Maguire which tells the story of the Wicked Witch of the West through another perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-read Jane Eyre instead","review":"Will somebody please tell me what the appeal is? Yes, I know it's a classic. But it's a really, really boring classic. The prequel to Charlotte Bronte's, Jane Eyre, is the story of Bertha Mason's childhood whose literary conceit is to tell us why Bertha went nuts. It's also a didactic dinosaur relic of the 1960s that traces the source of her madness to the fact that they didn't like little French girls in Jamaica. Racism, sexism, and classism drove Bertha \`round the bend. There. I've saved you the trouble of reading it. Now re-read Jane Eyre instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"glad to have read it","review":"i had to read this book my senior year in high school and i'm glad i did. this is a novel about the strength lost by a young girl the same as her mother did. it end in much unhappiness and misery. but for some reason you walk away with not only a sense of justice but of happiness. happiness for the young girl because she finally got some peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"One of the most overrated \\"classics\\" in literature. This \\"prequel\\" to JANE EYRE does little to illuminate the insane Bertha. Okay, so Rouchester is a terrible, awful, vindictive, Euro-centric pig . . . Didn't we already get that in JANE EYRE? Just because he's the \\"hero\\" doesn't make him, well, a hero we should look up to.Supposedly, Rhys spent YEARS writing and rewriting this curiously weak, empty, underwhelming novel. I'll stop short of suggesting that she wrote it simply to capitalize on the popularity of JANE EYRE.One of the book's saving graces is Rhys' vivid decriptions of the Caribbean setting: the colors and textures and culture. But it isn't enough to justify this novel's label as a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"a poor defense","review":"Okay, so Bertha Mason was treated awfully in Charlotte Bront?'s Jane Eyre. Point taken. But Jean Rhys does an exceptionally poor job at defending Mr Rochester's first wife, who she christens Antoinette Cosway. In Wide Sargasso Sea, Antoinette/Bertha can hardly be called a heroine. Instead she comes off as a spineless young woman who is only too eager to become a victim of her English husband. He in turn is convinced that he is actually the victim of their unfortunate marriage. With this, Rhys creates two exceptionally unsympathetic characters, who you wish would just get up and do something about their situations, instead of wallowing in self-pity and rum. I'm sure there was actually a strong woman behind the raving lunatic that Bertha Mason became, but Jean Rhys hasn't shown her."},{"rating":"1","title":"far out","review":"I bought this book upon recommendation of a friend, but I didn't have enough background knowledge of Barbados to understand the bias and bigotry that the characters were involved in. Interesting style of writing, though, and a clever premise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I hoped","review":"Years ago I read \\"Jane Eyre\\" and enjoyed it quite a bit, more than most Victorian-era fiction I've read. I came to \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" at a recommendation from a college professor who praised the book highly. I am also very fond of fiction based on established literary, historic, and Biblical characters (such as Anita Diamont's \\"The Red Tent\\"), so I was looking forward to gaining some insight into Mr. Rochester's wife. When I finally read it, though, I ended up hating it. I got no insight whatsoever into the character. It just skimmed the surface. I like adapted fiction where I can start to understand who someone is, but this book left me no more the wiser. Plus, the introduction to the version I had (printed 2002) is very misleading. It said parts one and three are narrated by Mrs. Rochester, and part two by Mr., but the second part switches POV several times, and I wasn't able to follow along. I do NOT recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not up to the mark!","review":"The book is amazing, although a little confusing. A difficult read if not enough secondary sources to refer to. Many wonderful and contridicting themes involved. The movie was also not very badly done and is quite close to the book.

But the narration jumps about and it isn't told in three distinct voices: Antoinetta is in Rochester's section, and the voices are so similar that it is impossible to tell who is speaking. And it is very contrived because you know (or at least those of us who read \\"Jane Eyre\\") how it is going to end. It's much ado about something we already know about. I gave it two stars because Rhys can really capture a setting, and the scene that foreshadows the fire at the end of Jane Eyre was wonderfully written. It's an easy read, so if you loved Jane Eyre and want some more of it, go ahead and read it. Just don't expect to be as moved as you were by Bronte."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly romantic story","review":"I watched the last five minutes of the \\"PBS version\\" in '89 or '90, and it was so beautiful that it haunted me for years. Once I had found the book, I had little patience with the text's \\"accent\\", and I couldn't read it. A couple of years later, I was determined to conquer the book. I finally came to the realization that it's a love story. The dialect became easy, and I couldn't put the book down. Although the subject matter can be heavy at times, it's a must read for true romantics. Jane Eyre, eat your heart out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read","review":"Precious Bane is one of those books that stays with you. I've reread it numerous times and thought of it frequently between. I don't know why it is not better known and used in literature studies.Being written in the dialect of its time and setting may make it less easily accessible than other novels but it takes only a little effort to sink into the world of Precious Bane. Somewhat like reading Jane Austin and as rewarding. The ending makes me cry with joy every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorites","review":"This is one of those rare stories that seeps into your soul and leaves a lasting impression. The language itself, while a bit difficult at first becomes a song you want to sing and long to hear it spoken. The story, sometimes achingly sad and violent is ultimately triumphantly romantic - with a sequence of events that leaves the reader breathless and yearning for more. Shortly after reading Precious Bane, I was lucky enough to discover a small theatre group in Chicago performing the stage version. My husband and I were in a packed theatre of about 30 people, where I sat front and center with the actors not more than two feet in front of me. Knowing the story line as I did, I made a spectacle of myself sobbing through the second half of the play. I'm sure the actors were gratified that they had such a strong effect on their audience. Suffice it to say, no one who picks up this book will be disappointed, nor will they ever forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks to my mother!","review":"When I was a teenager, this was a book my mother recommended as one of the favorites from her youth. Since then, it's ALWAYS been one of mine, and I'm glad to be able to buy a copy, as my mother's is, alas, long gone. Anyway, this is a story I've remembered all my live (I'm now 60), and just reread. It remains powerful, and beautiful, and romantic and, well, a treat that should be better known. Please, amazon--make this available as a freebie for kindle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I really enjoyed this story when the BBC production aired many years ago. The reason for the 4 start rating is the dialect used for much of the conversations can be challenging at times. Some words are so odd I had to take an educated guess about the meaning. However, other than that, it is an enjoyable book with an upbeat ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"One for Margaret","review":"My Aunt, who is now 86, read this book in England, when she was much younger. She mentioned it to me, as I use the Web, and I purchased it for her. She has told me that she very much enjoyed reading it again. She also said she had watched a BBC TV series on the same book, but I can't find it for her. Can you?Yours sincerely,Peter E Bradley"},{"rating":"2","title":"DEFINITELY HOT!","review":"I braced myself for the 2000 Grammy Awards, justifiably so: Britney Spears for Best New Artist? Christina what's her face? I was truly disappointed Macy Gray did not win. My only consolation is that Mr. Bennett won his ninth career Grammy paying tribute to a friend, as he has done on most of his past 8 albums. His torch voice is raspy with age, endearing, and as usual, it feels like he's singing just to you. Mood Indigo is a stand-out, as is I'm Just A Lucky So and So, but what I find to be the highlight, if only briefly, is the vocal on It Don't Mean A Thing ... subtle and warm. The samples of Take The A-Train blew my mind ... while others may be annoyed that the cut was not included on the album, I can only take my hat off to the person who decided to tease me and leave me wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prime Bennett/Wonderful Ellington","review":"This is an exquisite combination of the best musicians, one of the all-time best singers, and some of Ellington's finest popular compositions. Bennett's voice is sheer perfection. Controlled and true, he brings a depth of emotion and even humor to these literally golden oldies. It's rare that a singer can hang on to his voice as long as Bennett has. Better still, he imparts great musicianship to the rendering of these tunes. And in between are fine featured solos by the extraordinary musicians who contributed to this album, among them Wynton Marsalis, Ralph Sharon, and Al Grey. The arrangements are wonderfully appropriate to each song, complimenting both the singer and the song.An absolute must for Bennett fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bennett In Too Deep","review":"I purchased this album with great anticipation. I was familiar with, and enthusiastic about, what I think of as Tony Bennett's signature Ellington Piece --\\"Take The A Train\\"--and thought that this might be a multi-track dose of the same. Instead, I found Mr. Bennett in not-too-good voice, swimming not-too-effectively through arrangements that I found to be soupy and predictable. A couple sounded more like Basie --much more appropriate for Mr. Bennett's limited range--than Ellington. The album picks after the eighth track as Mr. Bennett settles into several saloon tunes that he does so well but the hope of a big payoff fizzles as a swinging version of \\"It Don't Mean A Thing\\" is almost totally handed over to a drum solo which, while impressive, is hardly the reason I purchased the album. I also found it cloying and disrespectful of the listerner that snippets of \\"A Train\\" were scattered throughout the CD and the full version was never delivered."},{"rating":"1","title":"More funereal than a Mozart Requiem","review":"Surely I can't be the only one who has bought this album to feel that it's a complete load of tosh. If Bennett can not do better than this then it really is time for him to head for the old folks home in sunny Arizona and idle away his remaining years with his paints. Anyone expecting the wit, verve and excitement of Duke Ellington band to show through in this collection is going to be sadly disappointed as Tony meanders through the songs without any sign that one's spirits, or the overall tempo, will be fired up and lifted.Thank goodness that in the same delivery was a Dino album featuring \\" Ain't that a Kick in the head\\" with Nelson Riddle and his orchestra which thankfully did lift my spirits. If TB really wishes to do a jazz album he needs to engage the likes of Johnny Mandell to select arrange and score it for him with the emphasis on jazz.Sorry fans this one scores a big 'nil points' (As they say in Eurovison Song Contest circles)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best of KRS-One...No, Not By A Longshot!","review":"First off I really like KRS-One and I think he's one of the ace ministers of Hip-Hop: a culture that's going to hell in a handbasket depending on who talk to. But this particular cd was nothing more than a diss-Nelly session. I mean I don't particularly care for Nelly but I am not going to hate on him just because I don't happen to care for his lyrics or his style I don't personally know him.That's the problem. KRS-One on this particular cd spends too much of his time and talent crying and whinning about Nelly. If I was Nelly, I'd buy this cd just to have something to laugh at. I don't think the whole legion of Nelly fans will switch over or start listening to \\"real Hip-Hop\\" because of this cd. And KRS-One fans who have heard better from him will be shaking their heads in disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"Waited two weeks after ordering to receive the wrong CD.

Good grief does this man not have any excitment or emphasis in his voice when he celebrates Chrismtas? Toby Keith is an original \\"Johnny One Note\\" on this CD. It's the first Chrismtas CD that I will never play twice - what a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I am a country fan, but baffled at how this man ever became a superstar. It's the beer slugging drinking songs he markets is all I can figure, certainly not his voice of a 3 note range. This CD (actually selling as 2 CDS if not the MP3) is boring, uninspired and unless you are a not entirely sober redneck, probably not worth your time or money. He ruins classics such as White Christmas, Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, and I'll Be Home For Christmas. There is not an ounce of emotion or conviction in any of these recordings, simply awful. If he is not singing about drinking or pick-up trucks he is lost!!! There are outstanding Christmas collections by country artists like Faith Hill and Martina McBride, get those, stay far, far away from this mess!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have For any Christmas Collection","review":"I love this CD collection, it is one of the best I have heard in a long time. Love Toby Keith. Great job with these CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless","review":"Toby Keith should be ashamed of himself! Making this a 2-CD set smacks of Garth Brooks' attempt to outsell the Beatles by packaging 6-CD box sets for $25 and calling it six units. Neither of Keith's CD's is over 33 minutes long, so they both could have easily fit on a single CD, saving packaging and production costs. Dividing them into secular and spiritual sets may given him a rationale for packaging it as 2 CD's, but that doesn't make it right. Here he records simplistic, uninteresting versions of songs we've all heard a million times and counts on his fans to make him lots of money for no work. Toby's fans deserve better."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic christmas","review":"classic Christmas was everything i thought it would be.

A must for anyone who likes guitar music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the same book","review":"The book I read is not the same one reviewed by some others. I read the 2003 edition, which has only about 200 pages. It is beautifully produced on thick, glossy paper and lavishly illustrated. There are no episodes in which Dickens meets his characters or dead authors.I read the Edgar Johnson bio years ago and loved it. Ackroyd's book, at least this edition, doesn't seem to go into as much detail. He does, however, gush (as a previous reviewer said) and presents Dickens as a tormented soul who could not be still and neither a loving husband nor a loving father."},{"rating":"1","title":"This will not do.","review":"I read only the first 100 pages before abandoning this. Ackroyd writes in an irritating punchy style with many 1-word sentences to show emphasis. This aggressive style was offensive, and at time condescending. It also was distracting. The story is supposed to be about Dickens, after all. The author is prolix, self-indulgent and more interested in establishing his own originality than that of Dickens. Less rhetoric and a steadier narrative are called for, with much less high-flown speculations. Can anyone recommend a good biography of Dickens?"},{"rating":"1","title":"BASK Album falls short","review":"The album musically is a great effort from the band members. The album falls short however, in production quality. The album was recorded partly in a studio environment and partly in a live setting. This is highly noticeable as one track sounds very well produced and then the next track will have a very \\"live\\" sound with poor production and no mastering. The songwriting is very unique and really pulls all of the different flavors of swing into one album effort. The bottom line: if you can look beyond the terrible production quality and focus on the songs themselves, you will probably be able to enjoy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yarn alternatives!","review":"I notice many people had difficulty replacing the requested yarns with ones more common.

These are simple little pieces but I had more trouble doing them than a collector dress from Paradise Publication (which have very enarmorate and fancy outfits).After many unsuccessful starts and restarts I sat down and rewrote all the patterns (except a few like the bikinis or blankets).

However, I found the story uninteresting and the cat's contribution to solving the mystery more supernatural then feline.

His reliance on examples nobody remembers is interesting, given his insistence on their powerful cultural influence to this day.

Still, it's good fun watching the various pieces of the strip fall into place: the supporting characters, the splash pages, Eisner's developing technique, etc.If you're looking to sample The Spirit to see what all the fuss is about, you might want to skip this one.

REM seems to think that adding gimmicky over-dubs and sound effects will help these dreadful songs. The result is boring, repetitive noise.

My brother thinks this album is really good, but then again I think he's dumb. This is a band that used to lead the pack and now follows all the indie rockers around in the hopes they can mine some golden droppings. I'll be honest with you, I've only listened to this album a couple of times but that's all it deserved. It should receive ZERO stars, but I'll give it one for Peter Buck goin' ape on that airplane.

Man, that almost deserves two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fire Is Gone","review":"My two faves from the 80's, still going: REM and Echo & the Bunnymen. REM has drifted into sythesizers and a drum machine (ironically there is a song on _Reveal_ called \\"Beat A Drum\\"-- pretty song, but fellas, could you beat a drum for me?). EATB started with a drum machine, replaced it with real drummers, and are still rocking. EATB's _Flowers_, also just released, is vastly more satisfying than _Reveal_; I still get to enjoy Will Sergeant's guitar work. Where is Peter Buck, and what is he doing? Mellowing out at a Mellotron, I suppose, and making the occasional cameo appearance on an REM album. It _is_ better than Up, though. Maybe Michael Stipe should try an Ian McCulloch hairstyle..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"There are some good reviews posted on here, and most of them are accurate. Reveal is a beautiful album, and clearly their best in years. I would go as far as saying that it's better than Automatic For the People, but that might be too controversial to some. But it is an amazing album...the depth and intricacy of Automatic for the People combined with some of the electronica influences of Up. The band sounds energized, the album is consistent, and it boasts one of the most beautiful and cathartic songs I've ever heard (I'll Take the Rain).In summary: an amazing album by an amazing band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"Being a long time REM fan, this CD/DVD-Audio is somewhat dissapointing. It is a very flat sounding album with little dynamics. That was my first impression anyway.The surround mix is also lacking. Very little center channel and surround channel use with next to nothing in the bass channel. If you really like the vintage REM, you may be dissapointed with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reveal is Revealerrific!","review":"REM continues to surprise. First they they relese \\"Murmur\\" which I wasn't expecting AT ALL! (I'd never heard of REM then, so I definitely wasn't expecting their album.)Then, they come out with \\"Fables of the Reconstruction\\" with all kinds of songs!!!!Then, when everybody said that REM was over after the brain aneurism death of Michael Stipe, they come out with Automatic for the People which brought them back to their original acapela (sp?) stylings.But, now...Reveal (if that is the album's real name)! I look at the sleeve and see that, sure enough, on \\"I Love You\\" that IS Ozzy Osbourne!!!! And he sounds great with Michael S.! (Michael died a few years back, but he's on this album which is confusing, but, if you can get past that weirdness, this album rocks!!!)The only thing I wasn't huge on is the 8 minute instrumental which advocates killing people: \\"Pow! Pow!\\". But, maybe I should be more open-minded.Anyway, get this album. It is something!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Totally Different REM These Days","review":"The consensus seems to be that some people prefer the electronic trio of REM over the former college rock 4 piece known as REM, and fair enough. The same people are writing gushing reviews of Kid A and Amnesiac, but i have to say that at the end of the day i prefer some human warmth and conversation, the style that made REM who they were to begin with, than ultra-produced tuneless tracks about the weather. It's crazy to think that it cost many thousands to make something so ultimately (and it seems, deliberately) disposable when Adventures in Hi-Fi could be recorded during a soundcheck.There are some good tracks but nothing that would ever make a Best of REM CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad mockery to a once great band","review":"As Kenny Rogers once wisely remarked, you have to \\"know when to fold 'em\\". Unfortunately REM does not appear to have this knowledge. This syrupy uninspired mess of an album makes truefans wonder how this could be the same band to produce Fables of the Reconstruction and Reckoning. I wonder if the peoplegiving the 5 star reviews are listening to the same album as me, because this album fails to succeed on any levels whatsoever. I tried to give this album a chance many times, as I have been an REM fan for years, but this is a hopeless, uninspired mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be honest--how often do you listen to this CD?","review":"I read all these glowing reviews, but I think I'm reading those of a different album. This band is frequently great, but these songs from \\"Reveal\\", show only another sad step towards boring obsolescence. I was excited by the \\"return of REM to the fore,\\" but this is, unfortuately, not it. Keep your cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"By Far, One of the Worst Albums I've Ever Heard.","review":"I've been an REM fan since 1986 and, in my opinion, they haven't released a good or even decent album since New Adventures in Hi-Fi.

The only thing it might be good for is putting oneself to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing revealed....","review":"REM...one of the greatest bands to grace this planet. A band that has had huge influence on a number of bands. Unfortunately, this album is nothing but lackluster music. There is no real drive or energy to these songs. I was completely shocked at just how bad this CD was (ok, not BAD, just not nearly as good as any of their other albums). Maybe REM needs to hang it up before they burn out...because this isn't music that entertains the mind or makes one feel good. REM needs to bow out and let their legacy stay intact just as The Replacements, The Police, The Pixies, Pavement, etc. did. This album is for die hard fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Boys From Athens Are Back in the Lime Light!","review":"By far one of their best albums ever. It takes you back to that safe, comfy place they carved out for us so long ago. While the experimentation on Up was nice and different Reveal does a much better job of showcasing michael's lyrics and the 'jangle' we missed for so long. An album very characteristic of their past gems, this is sure to become a treasure in the hearts of fans everywhere although the unforgiving media and era we live in may see it otherwise. Reveal has the flowing continuity that Automatic and Out Of Time provided making each song a piece in the puzzle but at the same time allowing it to stand strong on its own. Absolutely Brilliant!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...They're Back!","review":"Having been a diehard fan of boys from Athens since '82, I'm happy to report that REM is finally back. Reveal is argueably their best work since Life's Rich Pageant and unquestionably superior to their past 3 albums (since Automatic For The People). REM has come back full circle to what made me a fan originally - the compelling and beautiful harmonies found in their initial offerings. Thankfully, this album offers temporary relief to all the ... music out there today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 Stars- A beautiful recording","review":"I love reading reviews because it shows how diverse people are. I won't go on and on and bore you with a blow by blow of every song but I will tell you that in my opinion, this cd is similar to Automatic for the People, kind of morphed with Up. I definitely think it's better than Up, which, for the most part, leaves me yawning (no flames, remember \\"diversity\\" ;-). And no one has mentioned the song \\"I'll Take the Rain\\". Folks, this is one of the most stunningly beautiful songs they've ever recorded. It's worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fat Lady Has Finally Sung","review":"It is hard to believe these guys created 10 perfect albums in a row. Up and Reveal and just aweful. If you have missed any one of their first 10, you will not be disappointed. This one is for the bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better disbanded","review":"There's Imitation of Life and then the entire rest of the CD for which the strongest coffee is no cure. How they stayed awake to make it is a mystery. Listless. Like many groups, after a while their songs sound like bad parodies of their old songs. Probably because they're bored or their lives have gone far away from whatever their original source of inspiration was and so now they make songs the way a cow chews its cud. Oddly enough, the songs remind me more of a bad parody of old Genesis than Rem. If you like this alblum then you'll love old Genesis. Unfortunately, it isn't true the other way around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moody and Intriguing","review":"Anyone who enjoys radio-friendly rock will enjoy the hit of this album, \\"Imitation of Life.\\" Aside from it, much of this album is an exploration of a similar mood. \\"Reveal\\" is definitely a summer album, with a distinct Beach Boys feel. It's actually quite refreshing after listening to the miles of morose radio-rock that permeate the airwaves. Still, it's not for everyone, especially fans of REM's previous work. REM, in this album, does an excellent job of providing a cohesive unit.It's been said that the songs are not distinctive, and this is true to an extent, making it hard to pick great tracks. In a pinch, I would say \\"Reno,\\" \\"Imitation of Life,\\" \\"Disappear,\\" and \\"Summer Turns to High\\" as the highlights.The only trouble with the album, in my opinion, is the fact that the mood is very mellow: almost too mellow. Aside from \\"Imitation..\\" there is very little excitement. Thus, I'd say it's best as a lazy-summer-day album, and a good one at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...It just keeps getting worse.","review":"What a terrible record. I feel sorry for REM fans everywhere who like me continue to purchase each and every bit of drivel that the boys put out. This record is worse than monster. That says plenty. To the other reveiwers here that praise this record i simply ask..\\"Have you ever listened to anything REM did before Out of Time?\\" Evolution is a great thing in music...this record is mor deevolution. Please do not buy this. The guys are out of songs. Retirement is due. Bill was right to get out when he did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reveal: REM's Worst Release Yet","review":"It is evident that Bill Berry's influence on the band was greater than we had realized. After losing him a few years back, \\"Up\\" was a feeble attempt at life without Bill. \\"Reveal\\" is even worse. Gone are the rock songs, guitars and upbeat melodies. \\"Reveal\\" is elevator music at its worst. I am a long time fan, have been to their video shoots, many a concert and have even met the band personally countless times, but guys, hang it up already. I doubt I will ever listen to \\"Reveal\\" again. Well, maybe if I need to listen to something to put me to sleep....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly excellent","review":"After the disappointment of \\"Up,\\" I was expecting a similarly self-involved outing with REM's latest, \\"Reveal.\\" After a few listens, I'm pleasantly surprised that Stipe, Buck and Mills have turned out a very nice album full of great songs. I don't know how many would agree with me that their best work was realized on \\"Hi Fi,\\" but to me that's the standard of excellence for REM's later work. In \\"Reveal,\\" I hear a band comprised of master musicians and songwriters who don't have to prove anything anymore and are making the music for themselves; that we fans dig it too is just icing on the cake. I thought REM was a band in decline, ready to put out to pop's pasture, but with \\"Reveal,\\" I can't help but believe there's still some gas in that creative engine."},{"rating":"1","title":"REM disappoints","review":"I'm a long time REM fan and bought the album with much antisipaction.

So what if the radio doesnt play them, just because most the people in the world are running after low below par music doesnt mean we follow them. Listen to this album a few times, if u dont like it then u shaould not bother listening to REM or radiohead as a matter of fact. \\"Live ur life on a high\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Revealing a tired once great band","review":"I don't understand why this album got such good reviews in Rolling Stone. Its their worst album ever. I thought it was OK on first listening, but it feels tired and I feel tired listening to it. I want my money back!

REM is one of those bands. They could fart in a pickle jar and people would applaud, which is essentially what they did with \\"Reveal\\".\\"Reveal\\" dissapoints because it comes on the heels of \\"Up\\" which, though not great, was a step in the right direction. \\"Reveal\\" isthe worst thing they've done since \\"New Adventures in Hi-Fi\\"Please... REM is (or was) a good band. All of you who keep saying this kind of work is great, please stop. You're only egging them on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already","review":"How bad have things gotten? Well, Stipe thinks there's a point in writing the millionth song about the phony lives Madison Avenue and Hollywood are trying to sell us. Thanks for the warning Mikey. And I don't know if there have been a million nods to Brian Wilson in the last few years but we don't need two more to add to the pile. The sad irony is that REM used to make music that was so good that people wanted to sound like them.I'm guessing that Reveal will be to REM what Pop was to U2 -- the failure that brings the realization that gimmicks won't do when you've reached the limits of your talent. Hopefully though, they won't take the coward's way out like U2 and start rehashing the schtick that made them rich. Be brave boys. Say goodbye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful album","review":"I must confess that I really bought this album after seeing the band's performance in the Celebrate South Africa Concert in London, and for the first single. But the rest of the album is really deep and hypnotizing, you should listen to it not only with the ears but with the heart as well. Great and mellow songs like \\"The Lifting\\", \\"I've been high\\" and \\"Beat a drum\\" show us how the band needs to evolve and REM is doing it in a beautiful way. These tunes are the essence of the record and although they don't have the same classic sound of their big hits, they're great. Buy this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Distortion?","review":"Has anyone noticed the horrible distortion at the beginning of Chorus and the Ring? Did REM forget to edit this? Is this an instrument?

I'm a longtime R.E.M. fan, dating back to '83. I've enjoyed their varying stylistic incarnations over the years and have been amazed at their ability to spin unforgettable melodies and complex lyrics. The new album is simply dull. The first two songs have promise, but when you hear \\"All the way to Reno\\" there's a foreboding sense in the air. \\"She Just Wants To Be\\" might be there best song in years but it's a bit muddled in the production. I've heard a live version of this song from the Rock In Rio concert and it towers above the album version. After \\"She Just Wants..\\" though, we're lost in a swirl of cluttered keyboard songs and some of the most banal lyrics Stipe's yet written. I liked \\"Up\\" and thought it was an uneven album, but there were some gorgeous songs on there that grabbed from moment go. R.E.M. continues to push their musical ideas but this time the songwriting really doesn't support them. A disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"1. I'm Ready2. Yellow Kid3. The Banana Question5.

Some people don't like that; they like their bands to churn out the same formulaic stuff CD after CD. If this describes you, buy something else. You will miss the exquisite beauty and dreamy quality of this album. I like the guitar-rock REM, but this is the album that I keep pulling out and never get tired of. Best tunes: All The Way To Reno, Beachball, I've Been High. This is the CD to pull out when you want background music for insightful, reflective moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Album","review":"In my opinion, this was the BEST album of 2001. R.E.M. released this album to mixed reviews, but i belive the album is the best R.E.M. album since 1994's \\"Monster\\". Michael Stipe's vocals are beautiful . It is a very easy album to listen too, although fans of the older R.E.M. sound consider this the weakest album the band has released, I for one think it shows the maturity of a band not afraid to go different directions. I belive \\"Imitation Of Life\\" is the best song the band has done in a very long time and it is worth the price of the album alone. It may take a few listens, but eventually, this album will grow on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"REM's Gentle Side = An Enjoyable Disc","review":"As a long-time fan of REM who has always appreciated their quieter, more contemplative pieces (i.e. my personal favorite REM songs are \\"Perfect Circle\\" from MURMUR and \\"Star Me Kitten\\" from AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE), this album is a pleasure...and each listening is more pleasurable than the last.While the keyboard-heavy, percussion/guitar-light trend begun on UP is still present, the focus is on melodic, relatively brief pop tunes...there are no sonic experiments as found on UP, such as \\"Airportman\\" or \\"Hope\\" which I thought sidetracked that otherwise enjoyable disc. (I always surmised that UP was, in some ways, REM's response to Radiohead's OK COMPUTER...they toured together in the late 90's and Stipe always speaks of them in glowing terms...)Is REVEAL their best? No...but it is an enjoyable addition to their catalogue. Pick it up, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than \\"Up\\" but I still miss Bill Berry","review":"Let's face it. \\"Up\\" had some good tracks but was not nearly as good of a record as earlier work. Bill Berry's absence is definitely noticed in the two records following his departure, including this new title \\"Reveal.\\" I'm all for REM trying new things with their sound, but I noticed that with the absence of drums, the band is using more synthesizers than ever before. The REM of old was an excellent acoustic and electric band. Thankfully, the songwriting still holds up. I think without Bill, REM's glory days are gone, but I hope they prove me wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"R.E.M. continue their success","review":"I thought the Amazon.com editor said it well when he said that R.E.M.'s new cd sounds like drifting on a hover craft in the rainforest. There's a fair amount of electronic gadgetry going on behind the scenes of this cd, but it doesn't overwhelm the music. Songs that are particularly good include \\"Imitation of Life\\", \\"Disappear\\" and \\"Summer Turns High\\".If you liked \\"Up\\", then you'll like \\"Reveal\\" as well. There's no question that R.E.M. have abandoned the sound they formed so well during the '80s and early '90s, but the 'new' R.E.M., which I date from the incredible \\"New Adventures in Hi-Fi\\", is in full force here, and they are just enthralling as they ever were in their early days.I highly recommend this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"REM REVEALS THEY HAVE A NEW SOUND AND ENERGY","review":"REM is finally back with \\"Reveal\\". A new sound and energy that the band desperately needed.The album is more upbeat, and the songs not so deathly depressing.Michael Stipes vocals are in strong form and the band shows some refreshing new qualities in this album.The strong cuts include \\"Beachball\\", \\"Reno\\" and \\"All I Want\\". A really good album, though not as good as \\"Green\\" my REM favorite this CD has a lot of new material and refreshing new sounds.A definite buy for the REM fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another terrific effort!","review":"R.E.M. seems to keep successfully reinventing itself. Though I'm sure many people will draw comparisons of this album to some of their previous ones, I feel it really stands well on its own. Just as \\"Monster\\" differed from \\"Automatic\\", and \\"Up\\" from \\"New Adventures\\", and so on, this is a fine CD that sounds different from previous releases and, just as the other did, it sounds great from the first listen. And I'll also let others tell how much they like \\"Imitation of Life\\"...I'll take \\"Summer Turns to High\\" and \\"Beachball\\". These guys always save the best for last!

You keep singing 'em, I'll keep buying 'em."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summer sounds","review":"I respect upcoming bands as well as the established although I recognise that the scene is under the Warhol flag.R.E.M.'s 2001 offering, Reveal, comes just in time for summer and it might well be our last summer... The words and moods are beautiful, if slightly melancholic, and the musical experimentation works...If your musical ear has been crying out for anything resembling music I would strongly recommend Reveal as one of the best albums in a considerable amount of time and a step up from the beloved yet limited previous offerings."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was worried...","review":"I realize that as I get older and as my bands get older most will hit a point in their careers where there is nothing left for them to say or write (take Depeche Mode for instance).Bands like R.E.M. and U2 seem to be the exception and this is probably because both were founded on the restlessness of experimentation and exploration.I was worried that REM, with all their identity crisis's and hair loss had lost the energy to push the boundaries...NOT SO. Imitation of Light threatened an album full of pop hooks and shiny happy people.When you dig deep and realize that NewOrder plays back up on Imitation of Light you realize the bands desire to truly keep innovating.We may never hear the edginess of \\"Green\\" again or hear the Stipe specific rap of \\"Murmur, or the free association lyrics of the earlier days, but the melodic tunes of R.E.M. in their third decade are as strong as anything I've heard.Get this album; it will give you many hours of melancholy enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, except for \\"Imitation of Life\\"!","review":"I heard \\"Imitation of Life\\" playing in the record store, loved it, and bought this cd immediately, but except for that one terrific song, I'm very disappointed. The first 6 songs are slow, dull and sleepy and never get off the ground, and Stipe's singing is VERY flat and off-key in places, especially where he's reaching for high notes that are out of his range. There are a couple of other good (though slow-tempo) songs besides \\"Imitation,\\" but if you like their earlier, uptempo stuff like \\"Losing my religion,\\" this cd may put you to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stay Strong, Be A Star","review":"Are you really comparing r.e.m. to the cranberries?

This is easily the band's worst album. The trend over the last three albums seems to have been \\"put it all on there, it doesn't matter how long it gets.\\" Their greatest efforts over their career have run under 45 minutes. The filler on too-long \\"New Adventures\\" and \\"Up\\" distracted from what might have been great, cohesive albums. But nothing is saving \\"Reveal\\". I literally cannot let the CD run past \\"Reno.\\" Why bother? It blows my mind that the band that seemed to be having so much fun playing \\"Wolves, Lower\\" live on the last tour, and who so recently recorded the terrific \\"The Great Beyond,\\" would have let this album see the light of day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meager revelations","review":"2 1/2Its R.E.M. at their middle of road most.

Average at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reveal(altions of a stalled CD)","review":"I listened to the single, to the pre-release hype, to my longing for the REM of old and bought this CD. Capital M mistake. I respect the professional, talented abilities of the band, but I'm sorry, this CD just doesn't do it for me. With the exception of the radio single, I found the CD as a whole meandering, bloated, and self-absorbed. Michael Stipe's dissociative lyrics become tiresome track after track especially when they're backed up by one-size-fits all strings, uninspiring guitars, and flat tempos. Like I said, I respect their talents, but the CD is an example of the occassional disconnect between critical acclaim and good pop music. This band has lost its edge, and this CD shows it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, whiny","review":"What is the big deal about Reveal? This is just a continuation of Up, which was a pretty lousy album. It's a bit better than Up, with slightly better melodies (notice I said \\"slightly\\"), but it is still tedious and boring. And is it just me or does Stipe's voice get whinier-sounding on every outing? I know that voices do change with age, usually for the worse, so perhaps that is what happened here. But in Stipe's case, his style has gotten progressively more annoying. Compare the current high-pitched nasal whine with the earlier albums where he usually stayed in the lower octaves and had much more presence, albeit through mumbles. There is no contest. For a dead-on parody of the whiny, oh-so-precious and lyrically obtuse and vapid Stipe, check out the Corky And The Juice Pigs song \\"REMember.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops, they did it again!","review":"For the second time in a row I've been suckered into buying a new R.E.M. CD because I heard a single that sounded like early, great R.E.M. but ended up sounding like nothing else on the record. It happened last time with \\"Daysleeper\\" and now with \\"Imitation of LIfe\\" -- Be Warned-- There are maybe 3 and a half good songs on this CD, the rest of it blows and this is coming from someone who owns their entire catalog. Do yourself a favor and just buy the single for \\"Imitation of Life\\" because that song is great. Better yet, download the MP3 here and stay away from the B sides (I can't imagine)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reveal Nothing","review":"What a disappointment! This CD is one top 40 hit and - not much else. It is difficult to understand all the breathless media raves. Listen to the CD before Revealing your credit card number."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proves once again that REM died in 1986","review":"Like (insert any REM album of the past 15 years) Reveal is bland, dull and tired. Buying a new REM record now is like buying a '90s Rolling Stones CD or the newest Star Wars movie on DVD. Why go for the work of artists so far past their prime? If you're into REM go buy the EP and their first 5 albums. And stop there."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious!","review":"as a long time REM fan (since 1983 in fact); i have to admit this is their lamest attempt at an album. as one reviewer stated, there was a time when alot of bands tried to sound like REM. now THEY are trying to sound like the beach boys/brian wilson. \\"summer turns to high\\" sounds like michael stipe singing on an ENYA backing track (ugh!) any buyers out there for a used copy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE ALBUM from a once GREAT band!","review":"The only good thing I can say about this album is that I didn't actually pay any of my hard earned money for it. (I checked it out at the library.) As a long time REM fan, I have to say this album is not for ANY fan of REM's music - neither die hard fans of their early stuff, nor those who thought \\"Losing My Religion\\" was their debut hit will find much to enjoy here. The songs are overly ethereal and BORING! Mr. Stipe and the musicians even sound bored. (It seems that Bill Berry left the band just in time.) If I could give this album a half star I would. This would be a good album to listen to only if you are planning on joining some sort of mothership cult. Otherwise stick with pre-Reveal REM albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for long time REM fans!","review":"I have been a REM fan since the mid eighties and have stuck with the band through many different artistic directions. I began to loose interest in the band with each album since \\"Hi-Fi\\". \\"Up\\" was different and the three man lineup didn't work for me. On Reveal, REM has offered a boring collection of keyboard-drenched pop. If you were a fan of this band when they actually produced some of the best music in the country....BEWARE, THIS ALBUM IS NOT FOR YOU. If you are into keyboard [stuff] and just got into the band after they broke out as a threesome, you'll love it! The album is depressing as well. The only thing I can figure about REM's demise is that the music has gotten worse since Stipe shaved his head. Grow your hair back and get off your ... activist soap box.....as for me, I'll just listen to the earlier albums!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst REM Album Ever","review":"Sorry all you supporters of this mediocre effort .... have been an REM fan since Murmur and this is the worst they've ever done. I've never found myself skipping this many songs to dull the pain since the Chili Peppers' \\"One Hot Minute\\" (Saturn Return acutally made me sick to my stomach). No offense to the band, we all make mistakes - this is your first and I'm glad to see you're human. But all this, \\"better than all of the 90's\\" has got to stop. Those of you who are with me know who you are - 90's-wise \\"Up\\" blew this album away, and \\"New Adventures in Hi-Fi\\" (extremely under-rated) is a close second. Let's stop being nice because we idolize this great band, people. REM, gladly see you next time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"REM has officially gone down the [drain]...","review":"It's so sad to see a GOOD band such as REM making...music like this. I'm sure they will say that they are trying something new, that's a nice of saying that they don't really care anymore. Do yourself a favor, if you are a TRUE REM fan, bypass this catastrophic flop of an album, for your own sake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Their Worst Album Ever","review":"I've been an REM fan since Murmur was released, but I can say without a doubt that this is their worst album. Almost every song sounds the same and every song is dull. Reading the five star reviews below makes me wonder if we listened to the same album. Unfortunately, after the brilliant \\"New Adventures in Hi-Fi\\", REM's recordings are just not that interesting anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go buy \\"Up\\" instead...","review":"If you want to hear a truly great R.E.M. album, but you also want to hear something newer, listen to \\"Up\\".I was excited about 'Reveal' and maybe I built my expectations too high. But after hearing 'Up', and then listing to this CD, I may never really be able to listen to new R.E.M. again.'Reveal' is not terrible; terrible would make me think there was something I missed. It's just mediocre, which for any band is something to avoid. For this band, it's bewildering."},{"rating":"2","title":"R.E.M.....Still rocks after all these years!!","review":"Okay... I may be a little bit partial because I AM REM's biggest fan, but this album is TRULY AMAZING! You've probably heard \\"Imitation of Life\\" on the radio, which is a great song, but it only gets better from there. \\"The Lifting\\" which opens the CD Rocks, and is probably the most up-tempo song on the album. Some of my other favorites are, \\"I've Been High,\\" \\"She Just Wants to Be,\\" \\"Disappear,\\" and the amazing Country Feedback-esque \\"I'll Take the Rain.\\" I highly recommend this CD to old and new fans alike and I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I do!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best in several years","review":"I've been a big R.E.M. fan for many years, but after \\"Up,\\" I was really worried about the direction the band was going. Not anymore. Gone is the melancholy gloom that pervaded the past couple albums - \\"Reveal\\" shows that R.E.M. is back.I picked it up this evening on my way home from work, and was fully wrapped up in it. I haven't been grabbed like this since \\"Automatic For The People.\\" In fact, \\"Reveal\\" sounds and feels to me kind of like a cross between \\"Automatic\\" and \\"New Adventures in Hi-Fi.\\" It has the same laid-back, harmonious feel of \\"Automatic,\\" while adding more synthesized effects, a la \\"Hi-Fi.\\" Several little riffs sounded like R.E.M. was sampling some of its earlier songs.All the tracks are generally very good, with an occasional bland spot here and there. Right now, my favorites would have to be \\"All I Want,\\" \\"Imitation of Life,\\" and \\"Summer Turns to High.\\" Catchy and melodic - a nice comeback trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"R.E.M. grows on you","review":"R.E.M. is back with Reveal. It's a great album if you are patient enough to let it grow on you. i can imagine that one thinks after one or two listens, that it's a rather dull album. Though after three or four listens the melodies are not just flat but very subtle and intelligent. For example \\"The Lifting\\" is one of those songs that has something magical in the melody. You can only hear it after three or four listens. Take some time and find out why this album beats U2's All that you can leave behind. It's a great album, but Reveal has certainly a lot more to Reveal."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Triumph of Disappointment","review":"I'm an REM fan - a major, following, adoring, supportive, buying, humming, recommending FAN.With that out of the way, I wish I had broken my \\"Buy Now One-Click\\" finger the day before I purchased this. I'm fairly certain that REM was hooked on Nyquil during recording. This entire, boring, faceless yawn-a-thon is tragic and disappointing. I'll save any more slamming to say this...If you liked \\"old\\" REM's jumpy, quirky, exciting music, it is extremely likely you'll hate this. However, if you like Enya or underwater recordings of whale love songs, you'll love it.Mine is for sale. I'll trade you even for a scented moon-shaped candle, or $4, whichever you prefer."},{"rating":"1","title":"What have I done to deserve this?","review":"I have been a big, big, big fan since their early stuff. Back then they were like a breath of fresh air on the music scene. Now, it's like they aren't even trying. I hate to rate any album of theirs this bad, but I was so disappointed with this one. I resent spending my hard earned money on something they obviously spent no time or thought into. I'll hold out hope for one more decent album but this one surely is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't reveal much, except ...","review":"... except I ought to sometimes think twice about shelling out my hard-earned money on what was once a fantastic band. Not just a waste of money, but of time as well. An embarassing dip into mediocrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Michael and Co. phone this one in?","review":"After the beauty of \\"UP\\", I was expecting greatness from REM.

The true test for me is what stays on my CD player, and frankly this one just doesn't make the cut. A few interesting songs, interrupted by long periods of uninteresting \\"muzak.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"major disappointment","review":"I have loved R.E.M. since my college days back in '84, but other than Stipe's voice I would never guess that this cd is them. This is a collection of slow paced dirges. Stipe's voice cannot carry an entire album, but that's about all that's there. Do they not play guitar or bass anymore? I will continue to buy R.E.M. cd's as soon as they come out in the hopes that they have another gem left in them, but I'm not holding my breath. One star is probably too generous. I have no idea what some of the other reviewers are listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"IF YOU LIKED R.E.M. BEFORE YOU\`LL LOVE THIS!","review":"I've seen mixed reviews here about their latest effort. I think I can call me a fan of R.E.M. and liked their latest albums very much so I keep on buying them of course.When I first put Reveal into my cd-player I heard it would take at least several listening til I would begin to like it. And that's so good about R.E.M.; it's not easy to melt it! But when it came, I loved it. There are no fillers here, only true R.E.M. gems. I'm not going into every song, just buy it and see for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Automatic + Up = Reveal","review":"Mix equal portions Automatic for the People's lyricism and melancholy with Up's daring arrangements and simultaneously forward-and-backward looking sounds and you would come up with this, yet another great album from the most consistent rock band of the last 13 years or so. Highlights include the great first single \\"Imitation of life\\" (and it's been awhile since R.E.M. released a decent single, for what it's worth) and \\"I'll Take the Rain\\", but the whole thing has a sustained ebb and flow that begs repeated listenings. Me, I'm waiting for my wife to give it back so I can further scrutinize it on headphones - one of those albums with alot of sonic detail to focus on. In short, while not the best album they've ever done (thus the 4-star), it's still better than 99% of the dross being played on radio today."},{"rating":"2","title":"R.E.M.'s best album since 1992","review":"REM is back with this very fine cd. The lush, experimental sounds of 1998's 'Up' have evolved into more accessible pop-songs on 'Reveal'. The songs are catchier, but still keep you interested after repeated listenings. I think this is REM's best album since 1992's 'Automatic for the people' which many consider there best work to date. But 'Reveal' certainly comes close. I've been an REM fan since a long time, but kind of lost interest in them after 'New adventures in hi-fi' and 'Up', but they're back! I'm really happy with this album. My personal highlights of this album: I've been high, All the way to Reno, Dissapear, Summer turns to high.If you like original, melodic pop-music then you won't be dissapointed by this album. 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT COME BACK FROM REM!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"REM is back to the old drawing board, they are returning to the roots that turned them to a super group."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great ALBUM","review":"This record is a great choice if you like listening to entire albums as opposed to just picking out one or two songs a listen. 'The Lifting' is a very good intro - sort of lets you know where the band is right now. 'Imitation of Life', 'Reno' are traditional well-crafted R.E.M. jangle-pop songs. 'Beat A Drum' is a beautiful ode to nature with a magnificent chorus. Other highlights include the bittersweet 'I'll Take the Rain' (again with a soaring chorus), 'She Just Wants To Be' and the haunting 'Saturn Returns'."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it...","review":"I've been an R.E.M. fan for many years, and although I'm partial to the earlier stuff, I've also really enjoyed some of the more recent material. But I simply don't like Reveal. It doesn't grab me like their other albums have. I get the feeling that they're just going through the motions, grinding out another multiplatinum bestseller. Yawn. Where's the passion? It may grow on me--I've only listened to it half a dozen times--but in my experience, the best albums *don't* have to grow on me: they appeal immediately, suck me in, and demand repeated listenings. Not \\"Reveal\\", sadly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed... again","review":"As an avid REM fan going way back to the early years at UGA in Athens, there is always great anticipation with each newly released album - always hoping for the spark that made our band a worldwide phenomenon. Have these guys lost that spark? This album would definately rate as one of my least favorite. Except for Imitation of Life it's just not there anymore guys. At least I have my favorites on standby - anything before Green."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Biggest Band in The World","review":"When i first heard UP (1998), i did not love it. It took time and i had to listen carefully, before i really \\"got it\\".I heard \\"Reveal\\" , and was inspired. it is quite simply, better than Automatic For The People. The lyrics are pleasurable to uncover, and the melodic, moving sound of Mills and Buck really finding themselves again.REM have had some tough times, if we are honest, since Monster (1994). I was desparate to return to the genius we first saw in Murmur (1981). But with the Band becoming Father-like figures and Stipes foray into movie production, it was bleak for time.Now, with Reveal, they have made an album truly trying not to compete with Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach, or any contemporary american band.The are simply better than anyone else, the biggest band in the world, reflected and revealed again."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite REM","review":"I love this cd, and I think it would have done a lot better had REM not made the let down cd, Adventurers in High Fi before it... alienating fans. This is a return to great song writing. I enjoy every song on this lush recording. Every song notes a lot of time spent into them to make them sound good, and it shows. songs like ALL THE WAY TO RENO and SUMMER TURNS TO HIGH are just examples of great music, just like the other songs on this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little past their bedtime","review":"R.E.M.'s latest nearly produces an effect that matches their name - inducing sleep. There are some moments of sparkle and musical warmth, but most of the release feels cold, distance, almost trite - even by R.E.M. standards. Even the best numbers sound recycled: \\"Imitation of Life\\" sounds like an admixture of \\"Drive 8\\" and a couple of cuts off of \\"Fables\\". \\"Beachball\\" will remind you of the Beach Boys \\"Sunflower\\" period and it's one of the strongest contenders here (it must be the jingle bells). This new CD barely impresses even after several listens and will be remembered as one of their weakest releases. Oh for the days of \\"Radio Free Europe\\"! Recommended only for die-hard fans and completists. Suggestion to the band: get a new drummer and stop relying on scores of studio musicians."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should have called it \\"Down\\"","review":"because that's the musical direction they're heading after the brilliant \\"Up.\\" I've listened to this thing several times and it just continues to disappoint me. I'm a way-back fan...bought one of the original copies of \\"Radio Free Europe\\" at Wax'n'Facts the week it was released (I still have it!), and I've fallen in and out with these guys over the years. With \\"Up\\" they seemed to have really broken out and cruised into some new territory, but this new one just feels like a retreat to safety...almost formulaic, if you will. Sorry, all you 5-star guys, this one just doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE FORGOTTEN JEWEL !","review":"I've found this forgotten jewel some time ago. What a record ! What a musician! What a band! TOny MacAlpine, Tommy Aldridge and Andy West teamed-up with VInnie to make an astonishing instrumental rock album, much better than Malmsteen, MacAlpine solo, Satriani and others (I do not include Vai albuns here, because they're the supreme guitarrist masterpiece -nobody can reach him). This Cd is full of pashion and life, and it is well played, you can really hear the notes flying without getting bored to death,. All the songs are intelligently composed, the rhythm section is simple but well structured. If you are trying to be one of these \\"guitar-Gods\\", look at this CD for inspiration. You will see what an Ibanez well played can do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music, but not a masterpiece","review":"When I first popped this CD into my stereo, it kicked of with \\"In Control\\" and the fast shredding. Just what I've been looking for!! Vinnie's got some great ideas. He's got a brilliant talent about mixing some great neo-classical chops with powerful rock rhythms. Furthermore, the guy is a fast player but the prblem is after a while the album sounds like as if its repeating itself. This is especially the case with \\"Daydream\\" and \\"N.N.Y.\\" The lead melody sounds like the same thing but only played a little faster on \\"N.N.Y.\\" Mind's Eye is a great debut album and it could be a good buy, but I would recommend \\"The Maze\\" from Vinnie. It's much more better"},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this record","review":"years go by... i forget about this and then one day go \\"Ya know.. i'd like to get that mind's eye record again\\". I buy it used and remember why i dug it so much. 15 years later, the pictures are laughable and sure, the style is a little dated but... i dont care! this is his best record. I still love it and his playing is still totally mesmerizing. Tommy Aldridge rules, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS ALBUM","review":"Generally speaking, instrumental rock albuns are boring. But this one is great, Moore is at his peak with a sesoned band (Tommy Aldridge on drums and MacAlpine on keyboards)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vinnie and MacAlpine = Perfection","review":"Mind's Eye is one of those gems of an Instrumental album. Along with Tony MacAlpine's Edge of Insanity and Maximum Security, Mind's Eye is one of the best! With Vinnie playing the guitar and Tony MacAlpine playing the keyboard for those of you who are Tmac fans, you will notice this has the same feel as a Tmac album but with less of a Classical shred sound. I always said Mind's Eye is a mix between Tmac, Andy Timmons, and Joe Satriani. Very melodic but not overly Neo-Classical in the Yngwie/MacAlpine sense. Great album with two of the best guitarists of all time playing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pizza game","review":"Great tool to help kids learn fractions.Wish pieces linked together somehow.

He drops his pants again for the camera, reminiscent of Starship Troopers, so girls and guys can drool once again. But aside from the eye candy (including Casper in jeans a tight singlet throughout - costume department must have had fun), the script is also very funny and enjoyable, for a reasonably lower budget movie.

Who is this?\\" They can barely believe it when I say it's the California Raisins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for Christmas","review":"Christmas with the California Raisins is one of the most entertaining and refreshing music cd's we've owned. We own the original cassette from 1988, and have nearly worn it out. If you need to get into the spirit of Christmas, like it a bit jazzed, this one's for you!! Kids love it! Don't be surprised if you'll end up loving it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still can be found under Buddy Miles","review":"For everyone still looking for this it is note for note and word for word on Buddy Miles Greatest Christmas hits. That Cd can be found almost everywhere and a more normal cost then purchasing these. If you can do without the album artwork then purchase Buddy Miles Greatest Christmas hits its the very same thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Christmas Recording Ever!","review":"The California Raisins capture the spirit of Christmas with their lively and exciting music, expertly sung and played. If there is one Christmas recording every lover of the holidays should not be without, it is this one. You have my personal guarantee you will not be disappointed....rather, it will be far more than you expect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Curiosity","review":"This DVD is a good way to see what Houdini looked like. That's it for the positive side of this review. The story is ridiculous, Houdini does no magic and only one escape. That escape is so poorly photographed, however, that it appears as he is doing nothing more than rolling about on the ground to escape the \\"wet sheet\\" tie that was used in insane asylums at the time. This film flopped at the theatres, and it seems obvious why - this is a vanity piece, ignoring the magic and escapes that made Houdini famous."},{"rating":"2","title":"best thing ever for winter","review":"I love these socks!! I am so happy with these Fox River socks because they are warm, comfy and they come in my size (6.5 shoe size). Having the right size woman's sock is important, because most other socks heel ride up my calf. These socks are perfect with casual pants and jeans. they reach about 1/2 way to my knee, so they overlap well in cold weather with silky longjohn pants under my jeans. These socks are so warm and soft that my feet feel instantly warm with them on. I sleep in these socks in wintertime as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"is Faux River using artifical sheep?","review":"These are NOT Merino socks - they are HALF (55%) Merino wool; the rest is man-made materials. The front of the label makes no mention of the fact that these are only partially wool - nor does this ad. This isn't the first time I've found Faux River falsely representing their products, they have another pair that with a label that says \\"Merino Wool\\" in a large font on the front, and \\"17% Merino / Wool blend\\" in a small font on the back.Nor am I impressed with the build of the sock itself. Most hiker socks have more padding on the heel, and toe seams that are better hidden.They're comfortable enough for use around the house, and I'd give more stars if they had more honesty and a lower cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Amazing Play Ever","review":"This is the most amazing play I have ever had the opportunity to read and work with. It follows the character of Alan over about a 6 month period in his life where more happens to him than happens to most people in a lifetime. He learns that his relationship with his father will never be what he wants and these experiences help to shape his future, which is where he is telling the story from. This is basically an autobiography and has some of the most amazing visual images. It is comedy and tragedy all rolled into an amazing piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unable to use","review":"Unfortunately, I did not get a chance to use the product. I bought it for my cat, but he died before it came in. My cousin used it on her dog and she saw remarkable results."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"A very good organization, I recommend those for whom security is important, but who don't want complications."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book for both Linux and Windows","review":"First, I write software professionally. I write software, I am not a Sys Admin (which is hard work I might add; System Administration is for hardcore people.) This book saved me money by giving me answers to problems that would have taken me days to find the answers to by searching the internet.I would have said 5 stars but this covers Unix, Windows and Linux and I was just looking for a Linux book. It is good none the less.Time is money in this business and this book save both time and money.Also the book is a \\"good\\" read. The authors write well and that keeps you reading. Not a dry manual.If you are doing Linux for fun or work you need will need to buy this book. It allows you more time to sleep at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meaty Bach-rock","review":"Macalpine plays heavy and fast with lots of classical flash and writes better melodies than Malmsteen. Having Billy Sheehan on the bottom end is always a plus and who knew Steve Smith could play like this? Solid production, too. Blast it when the girlfriend is gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast for Fast Sake","review":"This album was something to talk about back in 1986, but now it's utterly forgettable and almost unlistenable. The production sounds even worse than it did back then and the guitar sounds harsh and abrasive. Highly NOT recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Older version better","review":"Limited play variations make this game inferior to earlier CD Rom versions... Grafix slight upgrade over older version, audio can be a bit annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks as no 2 player LAN games possible","review":"I bought this game for me and my wife to play, only to find out after installing it that LAN play requires THREE players minimum. The cover and documentation says \\"UP TO 8 PLAYERS LAN\\", and FAILS to mention this little drawback. Not to mention the screenshot in the LAN setup instructions have a picture of the single player screen, so it LOOKS like if you can add computer players too. Very misleading. I had to go their support website to confirm 2 player LAN is not supported. VERY DISAPPOINTED. DON'T BUY IF YOU WANT TO PLAY 2 PLAYERS."},{"rating":"1","title":"little dissapointed","review":"if you're a risk fan you'll like this game, but i'm not sure how much better it is than the many free versions of the game available around the net. some cool features, but no online play, which is ridiculous with a game like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"About as fun to play as it is to download","review":"The first few times, sure the game was kinda fun, giving a refreshing feel to the good ol' risk game. But after a few times of playing against the various 'a.i.' or number generators, i began to realize that the 'skill' of the pc wasn't based on their tactics as a leader, but on the amount of dice roles they'll win. If thats what passes for an impressive 'a.i' then its a wonder that the programer can even type his name into a computer, let alone be able to write any sort of respectable tactical program. Also the pc players will go out of thier ways to attack the player, often completely avoiding breaking up other pc's continents or picking a player's strong point over a pc's weak point. This is a cheaply designed knock off of risk and doesn't deserve to hold the same name. (and i'd like to run into the a.i. programer in a dark alley someday)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic game, yet very questionable AI.","review":"Like all great classic games, Risk is challenging and addictive. But even though this game comes with an excellent graphics and many customizable elements, its AI is extremeley questionable. I've played countless games where the computer rolls 4's or higher 70% of the time, while my 4's or higher barely reach even 40%. I've also seen the computer conquer territories with an army half its size and only two or three losses (the AI just conquered my entire continent of South America, which I had garrisoned with 21 battalions, with an army of 12 and only two losses). These bots seem to have no notable skills other than cheating on their rolls. If it weren't for the questionable dice, any intermediate player could probably win the default classic match almost all of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"We mainly use this product for smoothies and pureeing baby food.It's a powerful tool, and easy to clean. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music, peerless talent","review":"This record is the best instrumental guitar album I have ever listened to. I have quite a lot of them at home but nothing compares to this one.

Please listen the blues solos at the end of \\"Eleven Blue Egyptians\\". Perpetual burn isn't a real rock album.Jason Becker's style is \\"strange\\" and different from rock. So, if you want some rock, DON'T PURCHASE IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd changed my life","review":"I first discovered jason becker through Marty friedman, former guitarist in megadeth. Friedman was talking about him in one of his videos and said he was a true composer of beethoven status. That seemed laughable to me at first, and at that time i couldnt think of a better guitar player than marty friedman. But i did my research and started downloading becker songs and i was blown away. The first song i heard was altitudes and my mind couldnt comprehend the sheer technical, structural, and melodic aspects of his guitar playing. It was unbeliveable. I'm a guitar player myself and becker has been 90 percent of my influence. The work on P-burn is nothing short of genius and if you dont buy this album your just lazy, cuz i know you want it, and you know you want it. BUY IT"},{"rating":"2","title":"why we believe","review":"Book is interesting and I wanted some science on why we believe. Nice thing is as a christian is you believe in the Creator of our magnificent brains and He put all these amazing abilities into our bodies. Good science and these authors aren't christian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The author, Mr. Newberg, seems to jump back and forth at times, as if unclear what the final point is he is hoping to make. His book seems at times a new age spiritual reflection yet ends up a soft science. This disappointing read is a re-hash of other prominent and earlier books in the field. The author seems to have jumped on the band wagon of \\"cognition,\\" yet adds nothing new to the study. The style of writing is chopping, and unfortunately, makes for a disappointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great looking and comfortable","review":"Just got this shoe and I'm very happy with it.

They are VERY summery so I will have to put them away until next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Tales- Not To Be Skipped","review":"If you read Husain Haddawy Arabian Nights then The Arabian Nights II is a must since it contains stories he omitted from his Arabian Nights Translation. While many may feel his translations are incomplete I still enjoy them. These and many other original Arabic stories give us a glimpse into a long forgotten time constantly diluted by their Disney counterparts. This book includes Sinbad the Sailor, Ali Baba, Ali Al Din ,et Al. I would not recommend this book as a nightly reader to children as some of the content proves extremely lewd however I found it hard to put down once started and would recommend The Arabian Nights II to anyone seeking a unique and adventurous story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lavellas \\"Cherish\\" a must have!","review":"The Lavellas \\"Cherish\\" was recommended to me by a friend who is the only person that has the same taste in music as me- so I checked it out and am very impressed! This album has everything from experimental to poppy/ radio friendly songs. The feature song \\"Cherish\\" brings out a different, unique aspect of rock with spacey guitar effects flowing throughout it. The voice of the lead singer is capturing and is complemented by the backup singer's harmonies. \\"Valentine Girl\\" is also a favorite and is definitely more on the catchy side with an unexpected, experimental ending. However, if this song doesn't get you, then the more mellow, relaxed songs like \\"Coming Home\\" and \\"Going Away Letter\\" will. Essentially, there is a song for everyone on this CD and it is a great album to have around. I highly recommend it and look forward to new material by the Lavellas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot be worn because they don't screw in far and hang","review":"I wanted gold studs with a screw back so that I could wear them all the time without worry. They do have screw backs, but the screw apparatus does not have a back opening for the post to pass through, so the earrings cannot be made to snugly fit. Instead, they are balls on posts that stick out in front. I wanted the screw back, so I paid three times as much as similar earrings with a push back, but these do not look right. By the way, the backs in the photo are not what I received.I would love to contact the seller for different backs, however I don't see how I can do this, as this is not one of the \\"available actions\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"shoddy","review":"these took a long time to arrive and when they did one of the screwbacks wouldnt go on all the way and the company has been unresponsive regarding this. can't use just one earring so ended up being a waste of money.

He had no problem switching between the wide neck bottle and the breast. Now my husband can feed him when he gets home from work. So far, my son hasn't experienced any gas or spitup. As for the extra effort to clean the parts, it only takes about a minute longer so it's really no big deal to me. I'd recommend these to anyone who is breastfeeding and wants to introduce a bottle in addition to the breast.UPDATE: Got sick of washing all those parts! I felt it was worth it in the beginning to make sure my son didn't get collicky. But once that passed, I quickly switched to the Playtex drop-ins."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Bottle of All !!!","review":"My son used to wake up crying in between his every nap because of gas pain, and spit up after every feeding. I have tried the avent bottle. It didn't solve the problem until I tried the wide neck Dr. Brown bottle. My son doesn't spit up or wake up crying any more. Like the all other reviwers said, it is a pain to clean but it is worth it! BE AWARE: The narrow neck Dr. brown bottle could still cause gas problem because the nipple is so small that a baby can suck in some air while feeding. (My son did have gas problem when I used the narrow neck botlle)"},{"rating":"2","title":"We LOVE these bottles!","review":"I breast feed our son, now 3 months old, and have pumped my milk from the beginning. We started him out with Avent bottles and had nothing but problems. The bottles leaked and the nipple, even the smallest size, tended to release too much milk. For the first few weeks of our son's life he had milk all over his face when he ate and he looked like a drunken sailor! He also had a problem with gas and spitting up and we went through a gallon of Mylicon. We tried other bottles, Evenflo etc. and once we used the Dr. Brown's bottles our problems were solved! We have not used a drop of Mylicon since we got them! There are no probelms with gas or spitting up. As for cleaning, I prefer to hand wash all bottles just to make sure they are really, really clean so I don't mind the extra pieces. These bottles are worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, I can sleep!","review":"I switched from Avent to these and it was the best thing I could have done for my child. My child no longer has such a fussy time sputtering, gagging, gassing on leaky Avent bottles.I disagree with the people saying they are hard to clean. Actually, they require effort to clean them! Putting bottles in heat above 140 degrees or a dishwasher releases the chemical in the plastic called Bisphenol A. So handwash your bottles anyway!That would be my criticism, I with these were made of the same material the Baby b Free bottles that HandiCraft has in Europe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked wonders on my son!","review":"I love this bottle. My son was very fussy and gassy. I was using Avent bottles at first, and he couldn't latch onto the nipples. Then we tried Platex disposibles. He would gulp and scream and leak milk all over.As soon as I tried Dr. Brown's, most of his feeding problems disappeared. He didn't leak nearly as much. He spit up less, and most importantly he had MUCH less gas and slept better.Yesterday, my husband tried the Avent bottle again. My son screamed all night with gas pains. NEVER AGAIN. We are sticking to Dr. Browns from here on out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bottles!","review":"I switched to Dr. Browns after having registered for Ventaires b/c I thought they would be good enough for relieving bubbles in the bottle to prevent gas. NOPE! The bubbles were awful but once I got the Dr. Browns my sons gas got much better. There are never any bubbles for him to swallow. Great bottles! I love them but I will admit that all the parts do get annoying to wash. It's all worth it my son not having gas and reflux!I'd recommend them to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't want to buy becuase of extra parts, but it's GREAT!","review":"I'm a twin mommy who is now on her THIRD brand of bottles. My boys have a lot of gas, acid reflux, and severe spit-up. They also get fussy during a feeding - except when I use the Dr. Brown's bottles. I started with Playtex nursers, then Avent, and I finally gave in and bought these. I wouldn't buy them originally because of the extra parts to wash but it really takes NO TIME to do (and I'm a multiple Mom and say this with confidence). My advice to new Moms is to ignore what you think are \\"negatives\\" about bottles (i.e. extra parts to wash), buy a couple of different kinds in the beginning, and find out what helps your baby(ies) the best!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way overated!","review":"My baby was having terrible gas problems so I after trying Avent and Playtex, I decided to give Dr. Browns a try. I saw no improvement in the gas problems my baby had, in fact, I can't stand these bottles now!!! They are the BIGGEST hassle to travel with (you can't clean them well without extra cleaning devices), the leak like crazy, and they are basically confusing for babysitters/family members who watch the baby. Unfortunately, I bought 12 of them and I regret it terribly - they are a waste of money and time (they take much longer to clean). I've read the other reviews and it's strange that there are so many positive reviews because I personally know at least 8-10 other mothers who also cannot stand them for the same reasons I mentioned. Another problem is that the replacement pieces come in 3 packs but one generally doesn't misplace 3 of an item?!! Take a pass and save your money!!! Stick with Avent!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Bottles","review":"We purchased the Dr. Brown's bottles for my son & I had a lot of trouble with them because they leak! When feeding him we would have to wrap a cloth around the bottle because of the leaking. Eventually, after paying a lot of money for the bottles, we ended up switching, now we are so happy that we have. I would not recommend these bottles to anybody!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No real difference","review":"We bought thse bottles thinking, as everyone else did, that they would help the spit up and the gas. Our other two kids used Avent with no problems. This little guy has reflux, so we were looking for anything that would help. After 2 mths of use they started to leak and were always a pain to clean. We switched to the Platex nurser and have seen less spit up and less gas then when he was on the Dr. Brown's. Conclusion... I don't think the high tech bottle makes a bit of difference. It is a matter of what works for each individual baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated, over priced, poorly made, hard to clean...","review":"I am so sorry we wasted our time and money on this product. They LEAK all over the place! For what they charge for these bottles compared to the others, they should be of better performance. I didnt see that it helped with gas at all. If you lose the brush it comes with you can not clean the long inside piece, and will have to boil it. The nipples dont seem to fit well around the ring either, I have lost more formula because of how poorly these are made. I am currently arguing with them for my money back. Avent is much better, the nipples are better quality, and bottles themselves dont feel so cheaply made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money!","review":"My son spits up a lot more with these bottles!! I read all of the reviews and people seemed to think these bottles were great, but we have had a bad experience. I didn't even mind spending the extra time cleaning the bottle, but my son began spitting up after every feeding! We are now using Playtex nursers with great results!! No spitting up and no bottle leakage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many pieces","review":"I am a mother of twins and one of them has reflux. Since we have to put cereal in her bottle and cut the nipples, using a cheap bottle does the trick for us.

The nipples is big and hard(she was breastfed for the first three months and only took the bottle sometimes at first, now she is on all bottles). I think air was getting in around her mouth b/c milk was always leaking out of her mouth too. Next......they are a MAJOR pain to clean even with a dishwasher. I started using playtex nursers during the hurricane because we had no power to run the dishwasher to wash those awful things and found that the nipple is soft, smaller, more like the breast, they don't leak like Avents if you use a playtex drop in, easy to clean and most important, her gas problem was greatly reduced. The downside is the cost of the liners. I would buy these bottles as a last resort if all others have failed to help your child's colic problem"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Brown's Bottles","review":"The bottles have many parts to clean, but they are worth it. The bottles have helped reduce my baby's gas and spitting up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good bottles","review":"We tried the Avent with our first son (now almost two) and then with our newborn. Our first had so many problems with spitting up and gas, I wish we would have known about these bottles ahead of time. They seem to cut down on the bubbles and therefore, alot of the gas.

They are the only worthwhile bottles on the market and are well worth the extra price as well as the extra time to wash. They really limit the gas intake and we never had an issue with leaking bottles, like so many other brands. It is a bit of a hassle to get all the pieces in the dishwasher. I like the wide neck bottles because they are closer to breast feeding and when my son got older, it was easier for him to hold the bottle on his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works wonders for gas","review":"We purchased these bottles for my 2nd child. She had gas from day 1. She was fussy all the time. You could tell her belly was hurting her. We switched to these bottles and she has been a totally different child every since. She is much happier.I have to add that what works for one child may not work for another. We tried these with my 1st child who had acid reflux and they did not work for him. We used the bottle 2 times and both times he through up every bit of the formula we fed him with it. The first time we did not know it was the bottle, the second time we made the connection. We switched him back to his old bottles (Gerber triangle shaped ones) and it stopped.I would suggest buying one and trying it because it did help my daughter. We have been happy parents that get sleep at night every since we started using them for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would give these bottles more stars if I could!","review":"I have about $100 worth of Avent products that did not seem to work for my daughter. My cousin told me about Dr. Brown that she uses with her son (8 days younger then my daughter) and they are the best bottles! They are definitly worth the money. They are not as difficult to clean as they look, (Which is why I originally went with a different bottle!) Also, something I wish someone would have told me before I had my daughter, find a bottle your baby likes before buying everything compatible with those bottles. It was a very expensive mistake for us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the ONLY bottle that should be sold!!!!","review":"I have a 2 month premature baby who could only be bottle fed. He aslo has baby reflux. It seemed impossible to feed him, until I read a review about Dr. Brown's and tried it for myself. It was instant gratification for me and my son. He was able to eat quicker, less gas, and was much happier to eat. Even the nipples for thicker liquids worked awesome. I used Advent with my daughter, which worked fine for her, but didn't help me at all with my son. Also, they leak a lot. So, take everything back and get Dr. Brown's."},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby is even preferring these over all other bottles","review":"The nipple is soft and goes about the same distance as a mother's breast while breastfeeding. When, after some serious prior problem with nipple confusion, I was able to breastfeed my child consistently, she started to prefer the texture and flow of these bottles over even the Avent. They were most like breastfeeding for her. They had a slower flow from the Avent. Avent will stream out, even on the lowest stage nipple, these make her work a little more for her dinner, but more similar to breastfeeding.2nd point: What would put Booger from the Revenge of the Nerds series to shame on any other bottle, was barely audible after these bottles. That has been their most impressive point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good bottles","review":"I love this brand of bottles but, buy the thinner bottles.

I was, and still am breastfeeding, but she had a hard time with gas when I used the other brands. I was searching online for an alternative when I read others had discovered and used the Dr. Brown's. I ordered a 3-pack and used them right away. She took to them well, which was a concern of mine since she was primarily nursed, and she didn't get gas. I ordered several more and have been happily using them since. It may not work for all babies, but if you're struggling, it is worth a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bottles we have tried!","review":"We were having to supplement our son with formula starting at the age of two weeks. We tried using the popular Avent bottles and noticed, and heard, the amount of air bubbles entering the bottle (and ultimately our son) while drinking. Shortly after starting the bottles he began to have symptoms of colic. We then tried the Playtex Ventaire bottles, which leaked every time they had any amount of liquid in them. My son also could not latch very well with the narrow nipple. I heard about Dr. Brown's bottles from my sister-in-law and decided to research them. From what I read, I decided to try the bottles and we have been extremely happy with them. Our son is now 9 weeks old and still has some spit up with the bottles but the lack of air intake is definitely worth it. I wish I would have tried these from the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look no further! These bottles are GREAT!!!!","review":"My son (who's now 6 mos) had MAJOR tummy issues right from the start. We tried Avent, and they sure didn't help any. We also have to use Nutramigen formula (lactose intolerant). Then I did some research and these bottles take the air out of the formula, so it doesn't end up in my sons tummy! The shrieking of before had ended and he smiles all day long! Hint- Don't warm up the bottles with the top cover and nipple on, it traps the air in the formula. Once the formula is ready, so are you! And the extra parts to wash are nothing compared to the peace and quiet we get from using them! Completely satisfied, I will not use any other bottle for my future kids too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WORTH THE MONEY","review":"I BOUGHT THESE BOTTLES OUT OF DESPERATION AS MY SON HAD SUCH BAD GAS. WITHIN ONE DAY, THE GAS WAS GONE AND MY SON HAD A 100% TURNAROUND. THESE BOTTLES ARE WORTH THE HASSLE OF CLEANING, WHICH REALLY ISN'T A BIG DEAL. MY TIP TO YOU THOUGH, IF YOU ARE SWITCHING TO THESE AFTER USING THE AVENT BOTTLES, GO WITH THE WIDE NECK BOTTLES AS THEY BABY MAY HAVE TROUBLE ADJUSTING. I RECOMMEND THESE BOTTLES TO EVERYONE. THEY ARE A LIFE SAVER!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't bother with any other bottles","review":"After a lot of trial and error with other brands of bottles (VentAire and Avent, to name a couple), I finally found a bottle that really delivers what it promises. My daughter has problems with excessive and painful gas, and I have found that these bottles really eliminate the bubbles that form in other bottles. She still takes in some air from her mouth not forming a good seal around the nipple, but that's not the bottle's fault! Any gas she does still have I know is not from the bottle.

I finally tried these bottles and love them. No more spit-ups, gas and no more colic. They leak only if you fill the bottle to high, but besides that they are the best bottle and not expensive at all. Others that have wrote their opinion about leakage and the cleaning are crazy. You have to clean all bottles and don't fill the bottle to high if you don't want leakage. You will love this bottle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful:)","review":"Anyone who cares about their babies comfort needs to buy these bottles!! I just bought them today after five months of using the avent bottles. These actually stand up true to their purpose...less gas, less spitting up, less colic!!!! My son has never enjoyed his bottle more than what he did when I fed him using this bottle earlier. He had the tinest burp and he hasn't even spit up all day!! My son used to be \\"THE KING OF SPIT\\"!! I am so happy we found the perfect resolution to that problem. A few extra pennies for an immediate fix is worth it and the cleaning isn't a biggie, especially if your baby's health and happiness matters to you!! BUY THESE BOTTLES!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No great results here...","review":"After talking to my daughter who had tried everything she knew to do about baby's gas, I looked online for some solution she had not tried yet.

Once we switched to Dr. Brown's he was much better. He was not able to blow bubbles into this bottle because of its design. My only complaint is that the tall 8 oz bottles and the wide neck bottles do not have the same nipple. One is much longer and skinnier and it took my son some getting used to.

It is NOT designed for walking nor standing. If used in bed, the bag WILL fall towards your heal, leaving your toes and top of your foot cold. The outer bootie will eventually fall down also. There is nothing to keep the bootie portion above your ankles. Overall this is a very poor design and a waste of time and money. You are better off buying a good pair of heavy socks, heating them with a blow dryer or putting them in a clothes dryer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warm-up booties","review":"I purchased the Herbal Concepts Comfort Booties after my previous pair \\"sprung a leak\\" on one of the booties and needed to be replaced. I based my purchase on a 4 star rating which was better than most of the other brands displayed. My first surprise came when i tried on the delivered pair. It seemed very tight, but I managed to put them on after warming them in the microwave for a little over 1 minute. I noticed that the seeds tended to bunch up in the middle under the arch of my foot and needed to be manipulated to warm the toes, where they were most needed. Although I am used to this procedure, I am not very satisfied with the ultimate result. I think the booties need several smaller compartments to distribute the warming seeds around primarily the the front part of the foot and not in the arch.Since returns involve authorization, repacking and mailing I am living with these booties and derive some (albeit not enough) benefit.Alfred Fischer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, my feet are warm!","review":"Love it! I'm very happy with this purchase. Well, I would be even happier if I got them for under $10 (as someone did back in 2007 from earlier review), but still, it's a very good solution for my cold feet. I'm warm and happy!Well, I shouold mention that it's not a good idea to walk in them, but it's not a problem for me because I only wear them when I work with my computer. They do stay warm for about 30 minutes, which is a pretty long time. Also, I should mention that people with small feet will probably be disapointed, because these things are pretty big. I have size 9.5 and they fit me okay, but they wouldn't go so great with tiny feet, I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, POORLY made!","review":"First of all the biggest strike against these is that they are constructed of polyester and despite the warning on the package that they should not be heated for longer than a minute or two the fabric will ultimately melt. The herbs and flax retain heat to the point of ultimately burning their way thru thru the cheap and highly flammable fabric.Mine developed a hole after one two minute heating.Had these been made of cotton or wool or a natural fiber this could be a decent product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"While these booties do warm your feet, the heat pack inserts are a rough uncovered sack that comes directly in contact with your feet and are uncomfortable to me since my feet are very sensitive to texture. Also, the fit is loose with no way to tighten the cuffs around your ankle so it's awkward keeping them on. I'll probably end up getting something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie stinks","review":"I thought there was a potential of Evil Twins wreaking havoc on a community. But, the acting by these twin unknowns, is terrible at best. The Direction is weak, and the plot is thin. Add that with terrible acting, and you have tossed several bucks in the toilet, not to mention the 20 minutes or so to realize how bad this cheap-ola production really is. And, it doesn't get any better. I have bought hundreds of Horror and Sci-fi movies, so I believe my opinion is based on volume of movies watched.

Beginning with the African civilization of Egypt and Nubia, Davidson explores all periods of African civilization from antiquity to modern times. Though at times he adds his personal perspective, he relies primarily with presenting the reader with documentations written centuries ago, by Africans, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, and Imperialist Europeans. Not so great for someone unfamiliar with African history, but a great add for those of us that are. Essential for a complete library of World history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tone, Taste & Drive","review":"This CD offers a fine mix of driving, up tempo Bluegrass along with inspired choices in '60's cover tunes such as The Beatles \\"Yesterday\\" and The Turtles \\"Happy Together\\" - a resophonic tour de force. Phil Leadbetter's style has great drive, and a nice arpeggio-based style that combines ideas reminiscent of Mike Auldridge along with the snappy pull-offs that defined Jerry Douglas' style. A fine addition to the CD collections of both Bluegrass fans and fans of guitar-based instrumental music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great BlueGrass!","review":"This cd is a great mixture of blue grass and country gosple.

My sister is a devoted fan of Ms. Vale Allen's works, and I've tried to share her love of Ms. Allen's plotting and characterazations. However, Ms. Vale Allen's improbable views towards parenting and the role that parents play in the lives of their children, leave much to be desired.Yes, there are flawed parents out there, and children who are far wiser than their family units. I'm all for realism in literature, but in eight novels, read at random, all with the protagonist being a potential victim of at the hands of a \\"stupid\\" mother and a \\"brilliant but psychotic\\" father; I'd have to say enough already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"A long time reader of Charlotte Vale Allen, I was excited to see a new book by her on the shelves. I couldn't wait to begin this title shoving away others which were waiting. By about page 60, I found myself sadly disppaointed. Yes, the book and its various plots had all of the elements long time readers of Allens are familair with but for some reason this time the book didn't appeal to me. While the premise isn't an entirely new one, there was nothing special about this title which made me want to continue reading it. As a matter of fact, in the face of some terrible problems which should make one care, I found Allens characters to be wooden and never felt as though I knew them or wanted to. And the medical portion of the book was a bit much for this type of book, I thought. All in all compared to one of my favorite books by Allen, Leftover Dreams, the end of this book was a welcome parting gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockabilly with a hard edge","review":"This is a great CD. The Kings of Nuthin are a high energy live band that really capture an audience. They basically are a rockabilly band going full force fronted by a Boston punk/hc guy.

Before I bought a digital camera I would take maybe a roll of film's worth of pictures in a year. Since I got the S20 I have taken a couple thousand. It's truly liberating to take 10 pictures of a scene and pick the best one, everyone's eyes are open, the dog is not in the way, etc.The S20 produces beautiful pictures, is simple to use and feels like a solid camera. I have dropped it twice and it still works like a charm. With a spare battery and a 128MB memory card I can take pictures all day long without a second thought. The camera is a breeze to use. My wife (who is not a technophile) easily thumbs through the menus and shows me the pictures of our baby that she has captured.My only regret is that I waited until I could afford it, I wish I had put it on a credit card a sooner and gotten more pictures of my child's first few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality and terrible customer service","review":"If possible, I would have given the camara some negative stars.I was glad when I first got the camera.

It also takes 2CR5s but eats them up in a hurry.Very good image quality, works well in macro mode. One thing I wish it had is the ability to review the image right after you took it.

I had bought a pair similar to these years ago and ended up getting rid of them. But once I tried them on I was a quite surprised at how well they fit. I was worried at first that they might be a loose around the calves (the problem with the other pair). But these tightened very well. Other comments were posted that the material was too stiff and caused blisters on the ankles, etc. I do not think the material is too stiff and should break in rather quickly. The boots look a little shinier than in the picture, but that won't last with extended use. I really think these are going to work out in the long run and I would recommend them. Good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Killed a Cow for THIS?????","review":"I chose these boots because they looked cool and because I figured that they'd be more comfortable than Heeled boots. WRONG! The reinforced seams in the back make the boots extremely durable, but also tore through the skin of my ankle. The leather is very rigid and difficult to walk in, and the tongue of the boot is cheap, narrow (so that it slides to one side as you walk), and does this weird bubbling thing when you try to lace the boots up that looks SUPER tacky. These boots are NOT worth the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"A $20 Lightweight Chinese-made Tablespoon--shame on Rosle","review":"I am very disappointed with this product.

This product is not in that category and I will now think twice about buying a Rosle product. If you do buy one, make sure it is made in Germany and not in China.

Somewhat difficult to install - filter box is located above right front wheel. Either turn the vehicle's wheels all the way to the left or access from underneath the vehicle. My filter arrived with a lot of excess oil on it which had saturated the instructions page, not that I needed the instructions. It comes with a gasket which has a backing that must be removed to reveal the adhesive to stick it to the filter. The filter was so oily that the gasket adhesive would not stick to the filter and the gasket kept falling off when trying to install. I used some \\"super glue\\" to get it to stick and from that point, installation was a breeze. Excessive oil on the filter can lead to causing the mass air sensor malfunctioning and a resulting check engine light. I'm hoping this excess oil doesn't cause this in my motor home.

I found the short story in the library, but the movie was better. It's an unusual sci-fi time travel romance. As an ex-Pan Am stewardess, I related to the modern day portion of the story. I found several bootleg copies on the internet, but I never thought it would be produced on DVD since I felt the market would be limited to the few people who know the movie. It's definitely a sleeper! I also loved the soundtrack, which I would buy if it was also produced on a CD. Buy the movie!

It passes all understanding that the author believes that anyone other than his nearest and dearest care about his traumas in taking French lessons or being snubbed by his fellow scholars in Paris (or being stung by a yellow jacket in the good old U.S. of A., for that matter).

This scene is CRITICAL to understanding why Scrooge's life ended up so bitter in the first place! And Meredith, the actress, performed it beautifully, as did Caine in the short duet sequence. Those who disliked the song are probably those, like columnist Roger Ebert, who were unmoved by the classic Dickens story because, in essence, they just don't get it - the theme of a repentant heart.This movie is a Christmas Eve tradition for me and my daughter,Rebecca, who also appreciates great filmmaking and classic music scores. \\"We're Marley and Marley\\" and \\"It Feels Like Christmas\\" are all-time greats!Neal J.

I love the kindness, and love, and warmth in these movies, even if they aren't about Jesus Christ. It helps to show that people can be good, and kind, and caring. That's what the whole season is about, to my mind. Christmas movies show us that. And this is a great movie, because it is very much a perfect Christmas movie. The songs are absolutely perfect (\\"It Feels Like Christmas\\" is probably one of my favorite Christmas songs now), the acting (both human and puppet) is great, and the story is very true to the actual novel by Dickens. The dialogue is both funny and touching, and it makes a lot of points that you both wouldn't expect in a Muppet movie, and wouldn't see the first time around.

I cringed every time the first strains of that song were heard on my VHS version and am greatly relieved that it's been removed. I love this movie even more than ever without that awful song! It was far too sappy, much too long, and I doubt anyone viewing the movie for the first time will notice any kind of continuity glitch.This is my favourite version of A Christmas Carol and I'm so glad to have the special anniversary edition. The outtakes are quite funny, even though there aren't many of them. \\"Pepe Profiles Presents: Gonzo as a Young Wierdo\\" is amusing, but the \\"Christmas Around the World\\" section is lacking depth and I doubt it will hold the interest of most children.

I am tired of Disney's marketing department making bad decisions that Ruin art. My years old LaserDisc will continue to be played each year in December until they are Fired and someone who cares about film comes in to makes Smart decisions. If Disney wants to release a bland Christmas Carol, they should buy the rights to the 'Family Circus' and animate it into the ultimate white bread, politically correct travesty.

This is a song that not only is the heart and soul of the entire movie, but it was at one point added back into the film BY THE DIRECTOR, Brian Henson. Nobody involved in the production wanted the song removed -- it was taken out by the studio because they felt little kids would get bored during it. As it is, the film still has an awful cut where that song was supposed to be...and the intended, full version of the film will remain sitting on a studio shelf because Disney wants it that way.

I, personally, will not purchase this film again until Disney restores this scene to future releases of the film, starting with the Blu-ray.I have given this a 1-star review so that studio will recognize the disservice that they are doing to fans of this film - but the film itself deserves 5 stars.

It was a major disappointment to me. I seems to me that most DVD producers put their special features with a wide screen edition.

It's called full screen and this title was originally released for movie theaters in Widescreen. The only widescreen version available is on Laser Disk. This title is not worth the one star I am forced to give it. Don't be fooled by all the 5 star ratings who watch all their movies on a TV set, the original movie is great, but this DVD release is bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Muppet Christmas Carol - Kermit's 50th Anniversary Edition","review":"It's a DVD, that's good, but it omitted an entire scene for some unknown reason. We watch this every year around Christmas time and very familiar with the movie. The scene missing was the singing of \\"the love is gone\\" not sure about the title. For this I gave it one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing :(","review":"Love this movie and always will; it is a masterpiece, however, Disney still insists on cutting \\"when Love Is Gone\\" from the movie. This is really frustrating! With the movie released in 3 different formats and bonus features, one would think Disney would have at least one of these formats include the song. I love this movie, but I REFUSE to buy it until the scene is put back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I was originally looking for A Muppet Family Christmas but I passed based on the reviews. Then I stumbled upon this classic and I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Incomplete.","review":"True fans of the movie who want the widescreen complete version, should seek out the Laser Disc. It's the only LD we watch, but we still bust it out every Christmas because it's a film worth watching in its entirety. I'm very disappointed they did not think to include the (beautiful, meaningful) missing song on the Blu-Ray.Saying a sweet song about love lost is \\"too sad\\" for a film based on a *Dickens* novel, demonstrates a real lack of understanding of the source material. It also nullifies the refrain at the end of the film (\\"The Love We've Found\\").Come ON, people. If parents don't want their kids hearing \\"When Love is Gone,\\" I'm sure they will have the wherewithal to hit the \\"Skip\\" button, or stick to a lesser Christmas film for their precious little slowflakes.Please, someone release a widescreen high-resolution COMPLETE copy of this film in Blu-Ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment with song cut","review":"It is a family tradition of ours that no Christmas is complete without a viewing of the \\"Muppet Christmas Carol\\". My husband and I bought this movie for our children when the VHS first came out. We all have pretty much memorized this heart-warming movie. We feel bad when the bunny gets decked with the Christmas wreath, and for the mice who get \\"no cheeses for us meeces\\". So you can be sure we were disappointed when we watched our new DVD this evening and saw that the song \\"When Love Is Gone\\" had been cut. Our kids are now grown and have small children of their own. I would have liked for my grandkids to see the movie the way it was meant to be seen. Our VHS copy is worn out. It is so very sad for whatever reason that Disney has cut out one of the best moments of the movie. Bad decision, Disney."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"If I would have read the reviews first I wouldn't have ordered it.

Many 5 star ratings are NOT for this edition.","review":"For 20 years this has been my family's favorite Christmas movie. We watched it every year on our trusty VHS tape. This year I was excited to see the 20th anniversary edition. My kids are now grown and we got everyone together to watch the new edition.We were stunned when the song between Scrooge and Belle was cut from the movie. This 4 minute song demonstrates to the viewer why Scrooge was so bitter about Christmas. Why cut it now? It's 4 minutes! Without the song, the reprise at the end of the movie makes no sense.Also, Disney remastered the movie and completely lost the cold grey London feel of the movie. All the color chromo is turned to full bright and it looks like it's summertime on a cheap plastic movie set. Someone with a creative eye should re-remaster this embarrassing mess.Finally, Amazon should pull the star ratings on the previous edition. It is very misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light hearted and entertaining","review":"This is a surprise - a good one that works very well for both adult audiences as well as for children.

The song was simply cut. It made the film miss something."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy the blu-ray Muppets","review":"The blu-ray version is missing the duet with Mr. Caine and Bell.

See the other DVD versions, reviews, forum threads, wikipedia page and other assorted dots from the corners of the internet for information on what, and in particular, why there's a problem. I don't often write reviews but it's ridiculous that this is still an issue and that they'll put more effort into covering their tracks and making the cut less obvious rather than simply using the full, true version and giving the fans what they want. We'll just have to wait and see what the intend to do to the twitching corpse that is the Star Wars franchise... on a topical and mildly related note... Disappointed but not surprised but beings of this manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Version Of A Christmas Carol","review":"There have been so many movies made based upon \\"A Christmas Carol\\" but this one is the BEST one to own. Who could have guessed the muppets could be in such a heartwarming and endearing version?It's a movie that kids and grown-ups will both enjoy to watch on Christmas Eve with catchy songs, and cute little muppet figures you see \\"A Christmas Carol\\" which could be described as a rather dark- story into one of heartwarmth and sentimental feeling.Kermit plays as Bob Crachitt in this movie alongside Michael Caine who IS Scrooge. Michael Caine perhaps giving his best performance as Scrooge- who becomes changed over the course of one night...The movie is simply joyous and TIMELESS- the muppets are delightful and fit in well with the story. This movie is ADORABLE and the best muppet movie ever made. If your a muppet fan or simple looking for a good Christmas movie to watch definately BUY this movie- it will not disappoint!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally found it","review":"This story became an instant holiday tradition in my home.

It is great entertainment for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb! Awesome! Wonderous!","review":"There aren't enough words to describe how wonderful this movie is! You watch the movie and don't think that you are watching a bunch of puppets, you become engrossed in the classic Dickens story in this totally wonderful retelling. The songs, oh the songs, they are wonderful too. If I could own only 1 movie, this would be the one I pick. I watch it over and over as if watching it (in awe) for the first time. I would gladly pay an outrageous sum of money for a DVD or a CD-soundtrack of this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a funny movie!","review":"It was a great purchase for someone who is a Muppet's fan and can't find a copy of this DVD in stores anymore.

It wouldn't be Christmas without it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey! Light the lamp, not the rat!","review":"This chestnut is re-told with a sarcastic and skewed attitude. So much the better. Caine is the redoubtable Scrooge and the Muppets do their wonderful thing, as usual. The scene not to be missed is when Beaker flips off Scrooge after turning them down for a charitable donation. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVE THE MOVIE! HATE THAT THEY EDITED IT!!!!!!!!!","review":"How do you take out the main part of a movie???? I canceled my order before it shipped.

It should be part of everyone's Christmas collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muppet's Christmas Carol Review","review":"An excellent festive version of the Dicken's novel.

Great movie, right? Of course it is! So WHY cut it UP??

Director Brian Henson couldn't even get it reinstated! So, before you spend the bucks for this blu-ray, you're NOT getting the true movie. You want an UNCUT version? You'll have to get alternate DVD or VHS version. OR get a laserdisc to get a prestine WIDESCREEN version WITH the song intact. Disney!

We enjoyed the clarity until the video skipped \\"When Love is Gone.\\" That song so clearly defined Scrooge's life, and they threw it away.

Sacrificing love for money.We dont know what Jim Henson was thinking when he edited it out!The quality of the recording is not super sharp but better then the VHS version we have.

I own every previous version of this movie and it was irritating that my family could not watch the movie in wide screen with the full content of the standard version. I had been waiting to buy the Blu-Ray version knowing they couldn't possibly make this mistake again. Well I guess I should have known watching Disney's actions of the recent past that they would fail once again.In my case the butchering of the movie means though I have bought all the other versions I will pass on this one. It's a shame that they have blown it again. If they ever put the movie back together in Blu-Ray I will purchase it, but until then I will put up with the butchered wide screen DVD that I already own."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"Michael Caine is a terrific Scrooge to the crazy cast of Muppets.

Aside from all the other complaints about this missing song (which I won't go into), the picture quality of the movie does not appear to be much different from the DVD release.

The film deserves \\"5-stars.\\" However, Disney chose to release \\"pan-and-scan\\" only for the DVD. Since pan-and-scan chops off the sides so that the movie is the same aspect ratio as a standard TV, we're only seeing half of the film. Therefore, I can give this \\"VHS with chapter stops\\" version of the film no more than two stars.Disney should be ashamed of themselves, ... ruining such a wonderful film with a sub-par DVD release. I was really looking forward to seeing this film as it was seen in the theaters (i.e. in WIDESCREEN). Maybe another year.Perhaps Disney is letting art imitate life.

I wonder what you guys had in mind. One of the most beautiful film ruined by someone without brain. They' ve even cut some scenes!!!

You can always rely on the Muppets for some entertainment, but this is one of the best. Now, you would think such a classic would get decent DVD treatment, right? Wrong. Disney has decided to release this movie edited. That's right -- 25% of the picture is cut off from the sides to fit a standard television. If only the correct Widescreen version had been offered. Forget about black bars -- with widescreen, you can see a movie the way it was meant to be seen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray is an edited, cut version","review":"I stand with the other fans who refuse to pay for this edited, badly cut version of this great film. Disney, stop pushing these amazing films out just as silly fare for children and consider the adults who pay top dollar for them.(We want complete, unedited, beautiful transfers).

There is no option in this release to view ANY version of the film that includes the song \\"When Love is Gone\\" that is so important to the plot development.

I am not buying the blu ray version unless it is the original version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased the Blu Ray edition of this movie. Muppets Christmas Carol has been one of my family's favorite holiday movies since it was first released on VHS. We have never seen the movie without \\"When Love Is Gone\\" and did not even know the theatrical release did not include this song until the invention of imdb many years later. I understand that song could seem \\"boring\\" to some children, so why not have the option to watch the movie with or without that scene? Like so many other movies with extended editions and deleted scenes included on the blu ray? The pacing of the ghost of Christmas past just seems so short without that song included and the scene seems to end so abruptly.In conclusion I probably would have been just as happy with my pan and scan DVD version because the better resolution doesnt make up for the fact that \\"When Love Is Gone\\" is missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"Watching this movie is a Christmas Eve tradition in our home.

We watch this every year and the humor and wit never fail to entertain. Our family is now composed of 4 teenagers and we still delight in the catchy songs and the funny interaction between Rizzo Rat and Gonzo (aka Charles Dickens). Much of the dialogue is straight out of the book. Michael Cain did an excellent Scrooge, though a so-so singer. There's really nothing not to like about this movie. We had it previously on VHS, so when we found it on DVD, there was absolutely no doubt about getting another copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flick","review":"I love Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, and the Muppet version is actually one of the best film depictions of the story.

It's still the same story, same dialog, same area and saddest of all, same plot.Ok. I am a new fan. All the games are similar--from blue to red to yellow to gold and silver. Quit whining.

Real gamers and hardcore RPG gamers would think that the level of diffulculty in this game is a joke. This first game was an pretty good RPG only because it was a kind of new thing but the theme in a sense of a video game got old fast.

The games and TV show were there before this became a worldwide phenomenon. If you were just an observer to the fad and didn't understand a bit of it, but want to see what it is all about, this is a good game to try. Also, if you thought the other few games to be great, this one is for you. Almost every portion is updated, including the color. (yes!) There are new Pokemon, new badges, and new areas in addition to the original ones. This is a very much improved game, and you should get it if you are interested in the Pokemon fad."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fun Of Pokemon Silver","review":"I thought this game was confusing from the start just like my Red version of Pokemon. I mostly got confused at the first route and I think you will agree with me that it is hard for you to guess if you should keep walking in the same direction or if I should go north (up). But once I got to the guard of the pokemon leage I knew I was going the wrong way. I think Gold and Silver are more challenging than Red, Blue, and Yellow. It's mostly becase they have codes to get infinite items and thats what makes it so easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Blue/Red, long-lasting, awesome","review":"Yes, it is true that if you are in a normal middle school like me, pokémon is very unpopular, but I am not in a normal middle school, am I?

Power means everything! All bad things in pokémon blue, red, and -*scoff*- yellow have now been made far better! Hassle-free bike (and set it to select, too)! Better animations! New pokémon bitmaps! No pixelated close-ups! You even get to conquer the entire map (Kanto) from the other versions along with a whole new one!

Then in seeing the film I was delighted with the visuals which accompanied these already familiar songs. Sometimes it can be a disappointment to follow this route, but not here.The only drawback with this CD is the fact that is an exact replica of the original LP.

In a way, it is, but never attempts to mirror it. If anything, The Crush is a much more modern piece which only contains only a taste of what a viewer would get from Lolita.It's certainly an interesting setup - Man moves into apartment, 14 year old girl takes an interest, man gets scared, bad things start happening. Beyond that though the movie itself isn't all that great. Aside from the character Adrienne (the young girl) everyone else is dull. Adrienne carries the movie and I found myself watching only to see what devious scheme was coming to fruition in her mind.Some people will probably find this to be an excellent film but there's certainly better in the genre. If you enjoyed The Crush and want something similar in theme check outPoison Ivyor evenFatal Attraction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut by Alicia Silverstone!","review":"Contrary to what others have had to say about this movie I do not find the connection between this and Fatal Attraction. This movie involves a 14-year-old who has a crush on an older man. In Fatal Attraction Glenn Close is a grown woman who has a crush on a man. I felt this movie was much more exiciting and not as predictible as Fatal. Alicia Silverstone does a wonderful job as Adrian, and makes the viewer really want to label her a nut. If you enjoy a movie with some twists and turns and like Silverstone you will enjoy this. I felt the ending was a total surprise and not as predictible as other reviews have stated."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the deal with her name?","review":"In the movie the girl's name is Darian. But when it's on TV they call her Adrian. You can tell their lips are saying Darian though. Why did they do that? I just thought that was weird. I mean is there some reason you can't say Darian on TV or something, or did they just decide they wanted to change her name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Destructive Obsession","review":"It is a story about an obsessive lover Adrian with her tenent. All the characters have protrayed superb performance.Most of the moves in the movie are a bit unpredictable - will keep you guessing on whats next - to what extent can someone go when they are obsessed.Alicia Silverstone is a star performer - the first time I had seen her on the the screen was in one of the Aerosmith videos (I think the video for the song 'Crazy').If you like this movie - do not miss to watch the movie 'Misery'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did you see the scene where he punched her across the room?!","review":"I found that damn funny. In fact, it was the high point of the whole movie. It was the only reason I gave it 2 stars! Tacky early 90's clothes (okay, I know they wen't so tacky then, but now...)

I saw it in a bargain bin last Christmas season, and picked it up. It wasn't as thrilling as I remembered, but it was still pretty good. Beautiful, brillant, rich, charming, and a psychopath sets her eyes on the renter of her parents guest home. She's one that never hears the world no. Okay, some of the plot, especially at the end is really far fetched, but besides that, it's a movie I can still enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"clone of past movie greats","review":"This film tries to be something thrilling and touching, like Adrian Lynn's Fatal Attraction, and Stanley Kubrick's Lolita, but portrays young Alicia Silverstone as a teenage brat with a bad case of PMS, ultimately making her come off as nothing more than a moster movie cliche'. There is nothing original here when Silverstone torments Elwes with bees and keying his car, but you can't blame Silverstone for what is a bad script altogether. Just as bad as the 50's and 60's horror films about femme fatale's, except those might be alot more fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Inspiring Book For Little Minds","review":"This is the very first book my oldest son has memorized word for word.

Really wanting to join his other brothers who has ventured to another tree, he dared to get to the same tree even when confronted by every obstacles on the road. (He did it by running, jumping, swimming,...) His brothers were so impressed. In the end, he himself was encouraged by his own accomplishments that he was able to brave to try flying for the first time.

However, I can say that her skin did not react in any way and it had a pleasant smell.The real test was when her dad used the sunscreen one day (we had run out of adult sunscreen).

If a student showed me this work, I'd encourage him to keep going in the hope that he might eventually find his own style. He once did a Famous Monsters of Filmland cover that wasn't too bad, because he was copying from photographs. Boris is another one that has built a career scavenging from Frazetta, but at least he has slick craftmanship. Kelly is an incompetent draughtsman and his compositions are awkward.

With objects drawn from the prehistoric period to the nineteenth century and representing every major art medium, the book serves as an excellent survey of Japanese art through the ages. The catalogue describes in satisfying detail each of the 168 objects pictured and provides as well short background essays on different genres of Japanese art. The prose is always accessible and precise, meeting the needs of both beginning art history students and the most demanding of specialists.

Very engrossing. I will say this, the heroine is a bit too whiny at first, but I warmed up to her as the character developed. My only real complaint is that the 2nd characters were introduced rather fast and I kept getting them confused. Nevertheless, I will definitely read the next in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we into bestiality now?!?","review":"I really don't know how to rate this book. It didn't feel like a book. The characters lacked character; they were creatures of some sort, shallow, in pursue of needs alone, and with no depth to speak of; they weren't silly or annoying, just nothing to write a review about. The story felt like an underdeveloped kids' tale that I have read or heard a thousand times before only without any meat in it (no pun intended): a beast is released from his jail after centuries, goes after his woman, abducts her, and they live happily ever after, gorged on each other's blood and sex. Actually, I don't think the author intended for the story to take up much space on the pages. It was just the setting for the bestial sex scenes, which were not erotic or shocking or remotely sensational, just... pawing and growling and blood sucking. Oh, and smashing walls and furniture along the way. Fine literature for discriminating readers. I understand why this book sells so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is genre RAPE fantasy horror","review":"Books like these should really have a \\"RAPE FANTASY\\" genre label emblazoned across the front of them. I'm on page 42, and I want to cry and throw up from this book so far. I can't read it anymore. Maybe if I thought it was a horror book it would be barely tolerable, but I was looking for and expecting a paranormal romance. I really find it awful that this thing is masquerading as a romance. I hope the rapist dies an awful death, and that the victim recovers. I can't read any more to find out though because I am guessing from the other reviews that they wind up together.

When I first read a sample chapter (on my Kindle), I decided to skip it because it seemed like there would be rape involved between the hero and heroine. Then I read on these reviews that no rape occurs, so I downloaded it and whew... I'm glad I did! The tension and conflict between the hero and heroine was sustained throughout the novel (almost too long, but not quite) - making this book very hard to put down. The plot was fast-paced, with plenty of sizzle, and the author built a wonderful world to immerse the reader. The only drawback was the occasional childish dialogue of the heroine. It wasn't often, but it was jarring when it happened, taking me out of the story. It wasn't enough to lose a star, though. It's a keeper, and a reread for me, earning it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the book","review":"This was the first book I read from the author kresley cole and I haven't looked back.

I am SO glad I finally swallowed my pride and gave it a chance! Unlike most other \\"romance\\" books I've read, this one was a fantastic mix of steamy tension and entertaining dialogue, and the characters (both primary and secondary) were GREAT! Loved it and I look forward to reading the rest of the books in this series (even if all the covers ARE cheesy!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Over the top, super-sexy and very enjoyable","review":"I loved this book! Paranormal/supernatural stories are over-the-top by nature, of course, but this one was very well written. Kresley Cole does a great job of making you fall for these characters and to root for them. The suprenatural stuff is interesting (he's a werewolf, she's a half-valkyrie/half-vampire) but it isn't overdone and distracting. She also writes some fabulously hot sex scenes! It's also quite funny at times and very action packed in others. Check it out if you are into the whole shape-shifter/vampire/other-worldly creature romance stories. It is a fun, sexy, exciting read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Assault by any other name","review":"I put this on my Kindle because I recently got into PR and saw that it had such a high rating from an established author. Big mistake. Should have read the reader reviews more carefully. Make *no* mistake. What happens within the first two chapters of this book is sexual assault. No \\"sort of\\" or \\"almost\\" or \\"close to\\" as suggested by other reviewers. Take it from someone who has worked in the system: what the so-called hero commits is flat-out kidnapping and sexual assault. If that's your thing, proceed. If not, turn away from this one. Shame on you, Ms. Cole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish","review":"I didn't make it past the beginning where the main character is abducted and sexually assaulted. She is practically raped by a guy who can't seem to form an articulate thought.

Near rape by the hero is not my idea of a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I'VE READ!!!!!!","review":"This is the first Kresley Cole book I read. I just loved it!!!!! It's the best story I've read in a while. I loved the hot male lead. The way she wrote this character surprised me and made my toes curl. Very steamy and a page turner, I was never bored and couldn't put it down. I also loved all the female characters. I have read the most recent two books since then and loved the too. I even ordered the books I missed from Amazon and are waiting for them to arrive. This is the first series I have been excited about in a long while. Please don't let it end too soon. I'm hoping for at least a dozen stories. With so many great characters I could see this series going for a long time. I know there is supposed to be a war at the end but I hope it doesn't come too soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS is romance?!?","review":"Perhaps I'm expecting too much from a romance novel, but I was very disappointed by this book.Lachlain nearly rapes Emmaline several different times. She flat out tells him that HE IS MAKING HER UNCOMFORTABLE. He doesn't leave her alone. He forces her into sexual situations that she is not comfortable with, and I DO NOT find this to be an appropriate and loving romance.He hates her because she's a vampire and he continues to tell her this. He insults her and her heritage. This has all the signs of an abusive relationship.THIS IS NOT an okay relationship to be presenting as \\"good\\" and \\"romantic\\". I'm sorry, but I cannot read anything else written by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Sorry I Waited So Long","review":"This one had me from the first chapter. It has all of the elements I enjoy in a paranormal romance. I was a little shy to start because I have a problem with werewolves in steamy romances (the yick potential). None of that here. What it has is an alpha-alpha hero who comes on too strong and jerkish (not that it's his fault, all things considered), discovers the error of his ways, and earns his way back. It also had a heroine who starts out very meek and frightened (again, understandably) and grows to become a force to be reckoned with. The heat and tension between the two is relentless and scorching, the romance develops slowly and thoroughly. And then there's the whole new world of vampires and werewolves and demons and valkyrie, witches, etc. One thing to be aware of, this isn't actually the first book of the series; there's a novella \\"Warlord Wants Forever\\" that precedes it (which I didn't read and can't say that I missed)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Page Turner!!!!","review":"This book is a page turner!!! I just could not put it down. I enjoyed the story and look forward to the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something A Little Different for Vamp Lovers","review":"I've read a ton of vampire related novels and didn't think this would to much different from \\"what I like\\" in a good vampire romance. But this series is a little different, because it involves the major character being a werewolf. So its really a werewolf/vampire romance.Recently released from a very long imprisonment by a vampire, this werewolf has recently smelled the scent of his mate and comes looking for her with a vengeance. Needless to say, he isn't happy when he finds that his mate is a vampire as well.He's not so nice to his mate in the front part of the book, which is what some readers didn't like -- but it actually makes total sense based on the history of the character. So hold out - it gets better. And you need to read this book in order to really get the full benefit of the rest of the series, which is really a great read. I'm looking forward to the next release in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!","review":"When I fist began reading this book I dreaded it was going to be an excuse for sex, because it begins in sucha a hot manner... But then you go on on reading, waiting for them to get it going, and when you realise that, you're hooked on the book! (no pun intended).The characters turn out to be great ones, Lachlain is simply amazing, how she carea for her is great, and Emmalinne is just... so sweet and dangerous!A great book in its genre! ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read books 2, 3 and 5","review":"I have to agree with Erskine, Emma drove me nuts until I wondered why I was reading the book. By dumb luck I had bought the second book in the series, No Rest For The Wicked, and it WAS the best book of the series. My heart ultimately belongs to Cadeon Woede, he gets his own book, the fifth in the series. 2,3, and 5 are GREAT reads, but this one was mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough to keep me hungering for more","review":"Guess I'm in the minority but I didn't like this book at all and the only star I'm giving it is for the excellent cover art. IMO, the only great thing about this novel was the cover. Intrigued by a review in a magazine, I purchased this book and was more than willing to give it a try. I read several chapters, attempting to get involved in the story, but none of the characters appealed to me. I skipped forward in the book, hoping it would improve, but it didn't. The hero and heorine weren't likable and their actions and situtations were a cross between boring and disgusting. The heroine was weak and the hero was a slavering, violent monster. I understand all about him being imprisoned and tortured which could make anyone half-mad but I just didn't feel anything for him, and if I can't at least like the hero, why bother. I definitly won't be reading any more of this author's paranormal books. Ugh! Not my cup of tea at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh... Could hardly finish","review":"so boring! I bought it because of the great reviews.... Yah, not hot at all. The guy is barbaric, the girl is timid and mousy. Tooooo many back stories and side stories. The whole flow is hard to follow. Action begins, and it takes me a min to realize its even happening. To many weird charactors, ect... Blah blah blah..... Sorry. This was deff a thumbs down for me. If you like sexy warewolfs, try the mating series by nicky charles, much hotter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not going to buy the next one....","review":"If I wanted to read a book for the soul purpose of some good sex scenes, then I would have rated this book higher. However, I don't think good sex scenes alone makes a good book. I like to appreciate the characters (at least the main ones) and I simply did not. Lachlain was okay, I felt like I understood him, even if the Scottish accent was very distracting. My mind doesn't do a very good Scottish accent and he often sounded silly in my head... ya I know that is my own personal problem but it added to my difficultly in bringing these characters to life. I couldn't wrap my head around Emma... her characteristics seemed to change a few times while the book progressed and I never saw what brought these changes on. I hate being so vague on why I couldn't appreciate these characters but I don't know how else to explain that they just didn't jump off the page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not the best vampire story","review":"When you read the book's prologue you'd think that you'll read a spooky book. So if you like eerie readings this could be it. The problem is that since the first chapter KC tried to make antic after jest and that only makes the book boring. If you really like to read a vampire love story, read \\"Out of the Night\\" by Robin T. Popp. That book has a really spooky love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, overrated, weak character, boring story...","review":"I honestly don't understand why this book has so many 4-5 star reviews, because it was really yawn worthy, and the main female character was weak and foolish. 70 is plenty old enough to be wise, yet she was not. The plot line wasn't very appealing either, and there was a lack of \\"good\\" love scenes. I skipped many pages of boring dialogs between other characters because the back story just wasn't exciting.There are better romance authors out there, ones who actually put an interesting plot inside - please avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"This is one of the best vampire / warewolf romances that I have read in a long time.

I love that it has a happy ending, just like all books in the IAD series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Lore","review":"This is how a series should be written where all the loose ends get tied up. I love the way the dialogues are very witty and hysterical. It is very easy to be involved and really immerse yourself in this world K. Cole has created. This story, which turned out to be book 2, leaves you fullfilled at the same time wanting for more parallel stories...which she has:No Rest for the Wicked (The Immortals After Dark, Book 2),Wicked Deeds on a Winter's Night (The Immortals After Dark, Book 3), etc.Don't forget to go through the glossary of terms which is kinda funny in itself. Id like to group the books into Lyckae Clan (Lachlain-Emmaline, Bowen-Mariketa, and Garreth-Lucia), Forbearers (Nikolai-Myst, Sebastian-Kaderin, Conrad-Noemi, and Murdoch-Daniela), and Demons (Rydstorm-Sabine and Cade-Holly) so far. Highly, highly recommend the IAD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hunger for More Immortals","review":"First of all I want to say that this is the second book not the first. This first book introduces Myst the coveted one and Nikolai Wroth.It's called A warlord wants forever. I have the copy on word, if anyone wants it.So, a Hunger like no other was another winning series for me. I wasn't that connected with Lachlain due to the fact that his personality fell a little flat for me, but I still enjoy his part. His mate Emmaline was a little feeble at the beginning but proven otherwise at the end. The story is told from both Lachlain and Emmaline POV and a little snippets here and there of her Valkyrie family POV as well. I love Nucking Futs Nix, she is just too hilarious. The story builds more and more each chapter and will have you wanting for more. From sexy werewolves, vampires and other supernatural beings, Kresely Cole's series will not disappoint at any moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like No Other? No Doubt.","review":"This book has probably replaced Jude Deveraux's masterpiece A Knight in Shining Armor as my favorite romance of all time. Kresley Cole's writing is seamless, the sexual tension builds to a fever pitch, and the love scenes?Oh-my-gawd.There is just so much to love in this book (and the whole series for that matter). Complex and loveable characters, a fascinating universe that begs to be explored, sharp and witty humor that employs the most hilarious pop-culture references, and...did I mention the love scenes?I am thoroughly obsessed with the Immortals After Dark series and can't wait for the next volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT READ!!!!!!","review":"I absolutly loved this book and the whole Immortals After Dark series.

After just coming off of a very disappointing read of Christine Feehan's new Carpathian series, I was feeling let down. Until I read, A Hunger Like No Other. I couldn't put it down and in fact have read it twice already. Kresley Cole so blew Christine Feehan (one of my fav. authors by the way) out of the water. You go girl!!!! I will be reading all of Kresley Cole's stories now. Thanks a million."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had potential, but the non-con just ruined it for me","review":"I liked the story at first. The heroine is young (for an immortal), and this is part coming-of-age story for her. She starts out with a reputation for being easily frightened, and weak. Once she meets Lachlain, she finds her inner strength. That's the good part.The bad part is all the constant non-consentual touching and kidnapping of the herione. It got to the point where I just really wanted her to escape from the hero and never see him again. I lost all sympathy for him or his situation, and wanted him to be alone and miserable.There was never any emotional connection between them. It was impossible to believe she fell in love with him at any point in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Uneven","review":"There's no question I'm a Kresley Cole fan - I loved her MacCarrick brothers Trilogy - If You Dare - If You Desire - If You Deceive, but this new series of \\"A Hunger Like No Other\\" just doesn't bring it into life for me. Obviously reading the many great reviews, I know I'm in the minority here, but although Lachlain is a sexy alpha male, something is missing from the other characters - no one seems to fill the page with any depth, or interest except for Lachlain. I can't help but remember being spellbound by Anne Rice's \\"The Vampire LeStat\\" series many years ago. All of the characters came to life on the page and worked their magic on you and you were drawn into a world of unknown mysteries. I loved Lachlain, but the rest of the characters felt like filler and not real characters. Let's hope Kresley Cole goes back to her Highland Warriors."},{"rating":"2","title":"best of the series","review":"So many reviews already, just want to add my rating to overall score.One of those that I hate to admit to liking because it is just total romantic smut and so enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing start to a really fun series","review":"I read this book about 2 years ago after seeing this series compared to other paranormal series' I enjoy. After reading it, I had no desire to continue on with the rest of the books in the series. (Thank goodness on a whim I recently picked up the 2nd, No Rest for the Wicked - now I'm hooked). I just really didn't like the heroine and I found too many of the sex scenes forced (in more ways than one). It just didn't click for me at all. I realize (based on the reviews) I'm in the minority, but if you are like me and didn't care for this book give at least the 2nd in the series a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"Why is this book getting such high ratings? The prologue is great, I wanted to read more. Unfortunately, the rest of the novel can't compete. I was trying to find a new series after JR Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood; should have saved my money. The writing is amateur. The author jumps perspective multiple times a scene making for a disorienting read. The characters are generic and unlikable. He's tall, dark and brooding. She's fair, delicate and naive. What characters aren't these days? But that is all there is to either one of them. Personalities? Not so much. And I'm still not entirely sure what the plot is. I would hate to see the rough draft. Save your money and time, read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dinna ken what yer on about","review":"If you like some story with your book, this is not the book for you. This was just one long, dragged out will they won't they and I didn't really care if they ever would. I am not a big fan of the word 'shaft' and it appears far too many times in this book. Just for the record, being married to a Scot (albeit one who is not a werewolf like chap who has been burning for 150 years) I can confirm that they don't talk like the guy in the book.....who's name I have already forgotten. Fans of the BDB series would like this I'm sure (I thought that was just as bad), but if you fancy a good read, try Briggs, I Andrews, Mead or Frost. I've just recently read Chloe Neill and really enjoyed her books. This book was just bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"A lycae (werewolf) tortured for for a very long time breaks free only to find the mate he smells near. Now with a mate that is all wrong for him, one of his enemy no less, he must convince her to stay with him. Emma starts out a timid half vampire/half Valkyrie, and soon grows into her own skin as her love grows for her mate.I started this book like most others, expecting it to be just alright, I would read it and then put it on the shelf and forget about it. Nope, didn't happen. After the first chapter I was so hooked I skipped dinner and continued reading in one straight shot all the way through. There is so much going on in this book, but it is amazing. It has a sweet new twist on the whole mythological creature genre. It also has a bit of the Carpathian feel with the bonding and mating, but that's ok...it wasn't the same at all. It was a wonderful book...oh, and so freaking hot there is practically steam coming off the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"a hunger like no other imortals after dark series book 2","review":"This is the the second book in the series( first book is in an anthology tittled playing easy to get) and one of my favorites. if you like to laugh as much as you like passion and down right steamy sex senes, you will love this book.(as well as the series)a brief desciption of the story..lachlain is a lycke a.k.a werewolf who has been trapped and tortured for over a 100 yrs. when he smells his mate from his dungen, he breaks free to find her. only to realise she is one of his most hated enemies, a vampire.this book is fast paced, funny and very sexy, can't say enough about how much I love this series. I gave this book 5 stars, but I'd give it 10 if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"this was soooo good!!!","review":"i loved this book and could not put it down -so amazing! i got another book by this author and am almost done and i want to read all of her books now if they are as good as this one and if you desire! highly recomend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Reading","review":"wow, what's up with my life that I love paranormal romance? I read this book in less than 2 days, I would have read it quicker but felt silly taking that cover outside of the house. But it was really fun, loved Laichlan , I'm trying to figure out how to mold my husband into him....It was totally a fun, steamy read, this book got goofy at times, but I throughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes please!","review":"This is not really a review on this book only ... it's more of an encouragement to get this book as a start to a great series.I have read five of the books so far and love them all. (was a bit iffy on the ghost thing but it ended ok!)I love all of the characters. They have different qualities (both good and bad) and I can imagine them so clearly and feel a kind of connection to them. I believe that feeling only comes from great writing.Each book has a unique storyline but with a deeper backstory to embrace and more of the Lore being revealed. There's romance, action, adventure and a WHOLE lot of laughs.I think it's just a really good series and can't wait to read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"TO DIE FOR!!","review":"Have read all of the books in this series, they are all amazing! All extremely engaging, well written and exciting!! This book had me hooked within the first 10 pages and I couldn't put it down to save my life! Cole is a very talented writer and I love her style! This book is in my list of top 5 favorites and that is saying something as I usually read a new book every week. The series as a whole is my top favorite Paranormal Romance Series. Buy this book, you won't be disappointed!! I have given this book out as a gift to many of my friends and have only heard glowing reviews back! I will continue to purchase any of Cole's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great in Theory, Disappointing in Execution","review":"I enjoyed the concepts and ideas in the plot of this story. I felt the development and backstory was well-thought out. But when I finished the book, I knew I would never re-read it. It had a mary-sue/fanfiction after-taste with the very random video-watching scene. And there wasn't much depth to the conflict. Maybe it just needed more time in production or to have gone over one more proof-reader's desk. I'm glad I read it, and I did chuckle here and there, but that's about all I can say for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT READ","review":"Worth every penny. Could not put it down. This is one hot and steamy book. Loved the characters and the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I absolutely loved this book! I'm currently reading the 3rd in the series \\"wicked deeds on a winter's night\\". I enjoyed the 2nd and I am enjoying the 3rd with plans to read all in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!","review":"This author is in the group of my all time favorite authors. I love her stories, but this one is what started it all in my love for her characters. She has a way of drawing you into the story and getting you hooked and begging for the next one. I had came across it for so many days that the cover haunted me and made me curious. I could not put it down as much as i tried. Even once finished I have gone back and re-read the story, even though I had memorized it the first time. It is a wonderful story to start off on (though there is one that is before this one) and all the rest to date are as wonderful. I suggest it for any who like the supernatural world and like romance, but I do not advise it for people under the age of 16, that is my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"light, fast read, fun & forget","review":"Brooding man is irresistably drawn to shy woman, yet problems keep them apart. Classic plot, nicely done but not spectacular. This is a fun \\"read & sell used\\" book. The sample pages provide a good representation of the book. My biggest beef is that the leading lady is yet another vampire when the author has far more interesting human-variant race ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"This is a great book. The character's are so well developed. You really feel like you know these people."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Love","review":"This was a great story; a cover to cover read in one night. All of the characters are well developed but not to the point where they lose the thread of the story. Even though the idea of falling irrevocably in love with someone BEFORE you even know who they are is a bit creepy I still fell for the Hero, sexy, sexy SEXY even if more than a bit Tormented and Tortured. I cheered when the heroine popped Mr. Sexy in the jaw for \\"all the times she couldn't\\". This girl gives as good as she gets and her growth into a confidant woman is one of the best plot lines. I'm going to be sure to read the next installment...and the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually 4 1/2 stars","review":"This is one of the best paranormal romances I've read in a while, actually, at the moment, I can't even think of a better one. I don't read these books looking for an incredibly sophisticated plot or well developed characters, I will settle for ok and good respectively, when it comes to those parameters, but it's gotta be hot. This book delivered, I'm satisfied, good job.The only reason I wouldn't give her 5 stars is that there is a drag at the end. I have noticed that ending these books without bringing on lame cuteness or being incredibly obvious is difficult, it's almost as if they can just chop off that last chapter, so I'm saving my 5 stars for the paranormal romance with a satisfying ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Different kind of love song\\" is GREAT. These mix's aren't.","review":"\\"Different kind of love song\\" is GREAT. These mix's aren't. I like the mix's where you make the song better, you inhance it, make it go faster, put in a few beats, extend the chorus at the end, mess with the voice and your done. This, this is techno with \\"different\\" blurted out every 30 seconds. Give me a frekin break, why take such a good song a ruin it 7 times over?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistitled and Annoying as A Loud Squawking Baby on a Plane","review":"This is the most misleadingly titled cd of all time. I will speak truth: The love song is the same as all the others and this music would actually be better without Cher. Avoid this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cover Tells All","review":"I have not seen this picture, but I didn't need to. The incredible error on the cover tells me everything I needed to know about the quality of this production. The cover shows a reverse image of Chad Lowe playing guitar apparently left-handed, with a wedding ring on what would be his right hand. I'm amazed no one else mentioned this already. If the producers are this careless with their cover art, how careful -- and from other reviews they were apparently not careful at all -- could they have been with the facts?"},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW! I REMEMBER THIS MOVIE!!!","review":"A couple of things I remember about this movie are: John Denver looks like he's got a stump up his butt as he grimaces all the time. Perhaps he was the inspiration for Kristen Stewart.(?) He whines and is about to have a heart attack when he returns from a long tour to his house in the mountains and is more concerned about the trees the wife had the have chopped down so that the builders could expand the house than his wife and her loneliness. A classic in white man's graphic expression of pain!!! Then there's the part when he tries to resolve every problem by singing a song until one funny scene when he begins to sing one to resolve yet another problem and his wife forces him to stop. Millions of viewers were grateful for that scene. HAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA!!!! Feels more like a comedy than a bio pic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I bought this item a long time ago, and didn't realize I could review. Nevertheless, it was exceptional.Thanks,Barb"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Terrible","review":"Completely inaccurate. If you are a true John Denver fan, you will hate this movie. You will get mad while watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"So not right!","review":"I'm a huge fan of John Denver and I purchased this from Amazon almost two years ago. I was very excited to watch it, but as it started to unfold, I knew there were so many discrepencies of fact and the timeline of his songs with the events that happened were so off. I'm sure Chad Lowe could have done a much better job but maybe he was directed to act that way. I found the rest of the cast ok and Kristen Davis was the most believable. I so wanted it to be a wonderful movie about a wonderful man and entertainer. All I got from the movie was pretty bad acting and not a lot of correct information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"This movie is not a good representation of JOhn Denver. Chronologically many facts are wrong. Chad Lowe does a terrible job of acting and imitating John singing, its embarassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Of The Worst!!!!","review":"I have to say I was extremely dissapointed in this made-for-tv movie on the life of John Denver. The acting was miserable and although I do like Chad Lowe, this was not the part for him. Gerald McRaney was nothing more than his \\"Major Dad\\" character and there was hardly any mention at all that John even had a brother. In addition, I stopped counting the number of mistakes and mis=information after the first 10 minutes! This was a real embarassement to the memory of this incredible human being and although we all appreciate any media coverage, this was one of the worst! Perhaps some lessons could be learned from the exceptionally beautiful tribute done by ESPN's Fly Fishing The World!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Take Me Home","review":"What a slap in the face to John Denver. This is a terrble production of John. It makes him look like a whimp (which of course he was not). Most all the facts are wrong and it's just not John Denver in any sense of the production of this movie. Besides you won't want to buy it just by looking at the cover of the DVD. They have John playing guitar left handed, I don't think so. Don't waste your money on this DVD, it's not Rocky Mountain High that's for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"This \\"biography\\" is FICTION with BAD acting!","review":"From the first minute of this so called biography, the facts have been tossed out the window. (They've got John singing \\"This Old Guitar\\" a full 10 years before he wrote it).The list of inaccuracies is too long to list here (anyone who only saw this Movie would be shocked to learn that John has a brother! and a manager named Jerry . . . and TALENT!)Hal Thau had a whole lot less to do with John's success than his manager Jerry Weintraub.Flying for me was written for the Challenger Crew in 1986, not before his father died in 1982.Geesh folks, how hard is it to check facts?John deserved far better.Note to Chad Lowe: John did not whine all the time and he did not writhe around on stage when he sang.The only thing mildly amusing about this abomination is the whle 14 seconds devoted to his second marriage.If you wanna know about John Denver, read his book, listen to his music, and watch The Wild Life Concert. THAT is John Denver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one by","review":"Chad Lowe's portrayal of John Denver comes off like a Saturday Night Live skit. The fake singing and phony guitar playing are very apparent. He is not believable as John Denver at all. He whine's throughout the movie. Kristen Davis is better but she can't save this disaster. This movie make's John Denver look like a total boob which he was not. Save your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Deserved Better","review":"This movie was an extremely poor attempt to chronicle the life of one of the world's foremost environmental/humanitarian educators of our time. John used his celebrity to further his beliefs and his passions and through his many admirers, those visions are being continued today. The inaccuracies are far to numerous to mention as well as mundane portrayal by Chad Lowe.If you want to see the REAL John Denver, I suggest you purchase \\"Let This Be A Voice\\" and/or \\"John Denver: A Song's Best Friend.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Take me Home (the john denver parody)","review":"I recenty viewed this film, and the entire time I was waiting for something realistic to happen. John Denver is sadly portrayed as a whimpy fool, with no strength,brains, passion for nature or writting, and no integrity.I Think this film should have been called Annie's story, as Annie is shown as the strength behind, and dominator of his life. Not suprizing, considering the film was made after his death, and she was the chief consaultant. The film serves as a mockery of john Denver under the disguise of a dramatized biogaraphy.To sum the film up it was poorly casted, poorly directed, presumptuous, and produced in the style of a Lifetime original movie. It might be good for a some laughs at John's expense, if you don't mind throwing away some money."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Was my Friend","review":"So speaking as someone who knew him, this movie is total crap. Points to the producer who uses John and still does: \\"didn't think you get could get any lower but you did!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible \\"Biography\\"","review":"This movie is trash. Chad Lowe's acting is pathetic, and the entire production does a terrible disservice to the most popular performing artist of the 1970's. John Denver had his faults like all people, but he was a gifted musician, singer and songwriter who used his fame for good all around the world. This terrible \\"biography\\" paints him as a shallow, airheaded dork. I understand that his family attempted to take legal action against the producers of this movie for all the inaccuracies throughout this \\"story\\" and who can blame them?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but could be better...","review":"Overall, I'm pleased with the product. I keep it in a ziplock bag in my freezer and use it when I want to destress or shake off a killer headache. The material is soft, and the pac is just the right weight to put the perfect amount of pressure on my aching eyes. My only qualm is that it isn't as fragrant as I'd hoped it would be, and it's only getting less so (despite the fact that I always store it in a sealed bag, as indicated in the care instructions)."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of Temple's best","review":"THE POOR LITTLE RICH GIRL is one of Shirley Temple's most delightful offerings. She plays Barbara Barry, the daughter of a rich soap manufacturer (Michael Whalen). While being taken off to boarding school, her governess is run down by a car and in the confusion Barbara wanders off into the city. Taking on the persona of her favourite storybook character Betsy Ware, she moves in with a pair of vaudeville hoofers (Alice Faye, Jack Haley) and joins their act. Hilarity ensues when the troupe is employed by a rival soap company, and Barbara's other life is exposed.This movie is a real charmer. Shirley sings \\"Oh My Goodness\\" as her dolls come to life and dance for her, as well as her classic \\"Spinach Baby\\" and \\"When I'm with You\\". The finale dance of \\"Military Man\\" is another highpoint. Alice Faye sings the delightful ballad \\"But Definitely\\".With Gloria Stuart, Jane Darwell and Sara Haden."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking, intelligent textbook","review":"This textbook for International Economics is a rarity.

It's a great reflection on what the 80's had to offer musically recalling other fads and memorabilia(like \\"members only\\" jackets). The production alone is an interesting amalgam of new wave, early and late 80's r &b, old skool hip hop and hybrids. The album closer the Beauty of Machines even harkens Herbie Hancock's \\"Rock It\\" while 'Romeo is Bleeding' samples the late 70's early 80's \\"Rude Movements\\" with finesse. A horn-laden cover of the Nu Shooz jam \\"I Can't Wait\\" solidifies the 80's ethos. This LP serves as an interesting point of reference, showcasing how the 80's had a definitive sound and how all of those genres in the 80's drew from each other.

The song writing is a bit choppy and uneven at times but the solos are unreal. That sphincter MTV rocks is pulling your legs, as evidenced by his comment about Jason Becker being so lazy that he doesn't play guitar anymore. Becker has Lou Gehrig's disease and can't play guitar except through a special keyboard device and computer programs. An uncool comment by MTV sucks (oops!) rocks. The comment about Cobain is also clearly intended to provoke, since comparing these three guitarists is like comparing a steak and cheese sub to a filet mignon (everyone knows that Cobain was one of the sloppiest three-chord guitarists ever; I think he sucks for unleashing Courtney Love upon the world)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"The title of the album descrices exactly it's content. The speed of Friedman and Becker is making all the money and the songs seem to be written just for the instrumental part.

It did not disappoint. I thought the events fell well, one conflict right after another. Derfel's new appreciation and respect for Guinevere and his continuing relationship with Ceinwyn were highlights.The battles were detailed and interesting. As always I enjoyed Merlin's wit and humor with Derfel and was moved by his sad end.I highly recommend the whole triology to any fan of Arthurian literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I loved this third book. Though all the three books of the Warlord Chronicles are not historically very accurate, as the author himself says at the end of each book, I loved reading of Arthur and Lancelot. This book, and the previous two ones as well, made me imagine to be in the ancient Britain and I couldn't stop reading until I reached the end of it. I think a book is great if you can't stop reading it until you reach the last page of it. And \\"A Novel Of Arthur\\" is a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"I came to Amazon prepared to write a glowing review, deeming this book as perhaps the best book I've ever read. Imagine my surprise when I saw the previous two posts had the exact same words in them!Cornwell is a phenomenal writer. He takes the Arthurian legend in fantastic different ways. His depiction of the brutal warfare was breathtaking. I couldn't put this book down. A+ I hope we delves into this era of history again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting adaptation of an old myth","review":"Good solid read from the master of historical novels, puts a new twist on Authurs journey through early Wales and England"},{"rating":"2","title":"historical fiction","review":"always a great story teller, Mr. Cornwell continues to impress with his books!

I thought it was confusing (characters and places) and unclear about plot. It was also too wordy and drawn out (400+ pages). It didnt really catch my attention. After all, I had to read this book for a book report so that might have something to do with it. This would have been a mediocre book if you were into all that medival arthur stuff, which i really am not. So I wouldnt reccomend this to someone who likes a quick and easy read. Also it had a bit too much gore for my taste, so dont read it if you dont like bloody, graphic battle scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not deliver","review":"The company did not give me the correct book and I couldnt find any way of returning the book for the correct one.

Recommend them all -- second one may be the best, but this one is very good. Cornwell is a great story teller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"An amazing conclusion to an incredible series. Cornwell's Arthur is like no other, with a believable story that is brilliantly written."},{"rating":"2","title":"The magic ends","review":"Sadly, this third volume of The Warlord Chronicles marks the end of the saga of Derfel, Arthur, Merlin, Nimue et al, just as it marks the end of magic. In the previous volumes, magic was portrayed with a light hand--a mist that appears when needed or a line of heads on lances that keeps enemies at bay--that could be due as much to luck or human psychology as to magical abilities. In this third volume, however, the gloves are off, and Nimue and Merlin are revealed in fuller power.The theme of the disappearance of magic coincident with the ascendency of Christianity is not new. It has been explored in other books and movies (see Dragonslayer, 1981, with Patrick MacNicol, Caitlin Clarke, and Ralph Richardson; set in the same era as this book). However, Cornwell does his usual masterful job in juggling this theme along with the Arthurian legend, character interactions, and brilliant combat depictions. This is a great end to the series, and well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another top-notch political thriller","review":"This is another in Cornwell's series of well-written political thrillers set in fourth-century Britain; it is not the Arthurian legend that everyone's familiar with. As such, it's a fitting finale to \\"The Warlord Chronicles\\" trilogy. As in the previous books, Cornwell takes some Arthurian legends from different eras and mixes them together, adding his own touch of historical realism. The portrayal of Saxon-Celtic conflict as well as Christian-Pagan conflict is very well done. The best of the series, this is an excellent book, though one that will disappoint some by painting a vision of Arthur that clashes with their own. As always, Cornwell's storytelling is top-notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Enchantment","review":"\\"Excalibur\\" is the third and final installment in Cornwell's Arthur trilogy. All three books are excellent. Cornwell has taken the mythical Arthur and put him in what is perhaps his true historical setting -- 5th century Britain. In so doing, he brings Arthur, Guinevere and the rest of the characters from the Arthurian legend to life as real people caught up in the events of the time. He does a masterful job of bringing these people to life against a background of war, intrigue, and the crude manners of the period, while adding in a touch of the old magic of the druids and keeping close to the familiar events depicted in the myths.If you are ready to read this book, though, then you should know all this. You should have already read the first two books. If you liked them, this one will not let you down. These books will bring Arthur and his companions alive again in the imagination of anyone who reads them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arthur's story in a different perspective","review":"Bernard Cornwell's outlook on Arthur may be surprising but is actually not of his own invention. Mary Steward started depicting Arthur as a Roman-born boy, but still made him a king. Bernard Cornwell- true to history, only makes him a warlord. In this way he does take away the fairy-tale like existence of a king of Brittain, but the history lovers cannot but applaud this. B.C. is not a romantic novels writer, hence probably his success with the male readers, but can be awfully realistic within a frame of romance, which one can only admire. B.C. does not give superstition and spiritual ways a big chance in his Warlord books, (Merlin is mostly a 'quack' etc.) but then he never does. Different but admirable, truer to history than any other Merlin and Arthur book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close, but...","review":"Excalibur is a wonderful conclustion to Conrwell's Arthurian trilogy. His shield wall descriptions hit new heights. Nearly all the pieces carefully built up in the earlier books come neatly together. My only complaint is that the ending was a bit flat. A few details go unexplained and the tale just ends. A couple of pages closing some loops would have been more rewarding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I really liked the TV series, but this DVD has a lot of needless verbiage about gays that I found bordered on the vulgar.

While most cats will happily drink from the Catit by licking the dome, our cat attacked it on several occasions, beating it with his paws and eventually popping the dome right out of its frame.I bought this product based on rave reviews from friends who have been using it for many months and in hopes of finding a method to water my cat without all the water ending up on my kitchen floor (he likes to empty all water bowls in the house by batting the water out with his paws).

Although it isn't that classic Outkast beat and music, Floyd The Locsmif stills gives you an original and creative beat with a smooth feel to the classic lyrics of Big Boi & Dre. The album is similar to a live performance album if Outkast were to produce one. The Locsmif use of strong percussion, piano, guitar and woodwind sounds will suggest a smooth jazz vibe throughout the album. The Outkast classic lyrics that are on this album would include Elevators, ATliens and Ms Jackson to name a few. Even Cee-Lo has a couple of tracks on this album; and yes it is really Outkast on this album and not some clowns imitating their flow. I gave this album 4 Stars because it isn't 100% Outkast, but yet it is still the Mighty \\"O\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTICE: this is CD 2 of 2!","review":"the first one is even better, u must find elsewhere! paste on google \\"Outskirts (The Unofficial Lost Outkast Remixes) (CD 1)\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"OK reading not great literature","review":"This book is very much consistent with quality of other books in the Chintz n'china series. It is a nice quiet read for slow evenings or sitting on your porch. It is not great literature , but doesn't pretend to be.If you are not familair with series you might be happier staring with earlier books to familiarize yourself with the charecters.The chintz n'china series is not rolicking excitemtn, nor as much fantasy with demons and elves as the authors moon sister series.This book is more female romance mystery type novels. It is about witch and therefore might be viewed as normal fantasy reading. But the fantasy and magic plays second fiddle to a more classic murder mystery type of novel.so if you like murder mystery's, with strong female heroines and a little magic thrown in on the side go for it. If expecting a scary horror film, a demon war, lots of elves and unicorms look eleswhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and Authentic Page-Turner","review":"Ms. Miles has done a superb job of capturing the atmosphere of early America - furthermore, the images of New England fall ring wonderfully true. Those images of leaves turning, cool nights and harvest end offered some small relief to this reader suffering through a blazing hot Kansas August.Charlotte Willett, the main character, is intelligent and self confident, without undermining the realistic treatment of her place as a widow in colonial society. I was much impressed by this balance as achieved by the author.The developing political pressures between the colonies and England are present, and offer hope for additional volumes set in increasingly turbulent times. All in all, well researched, convincingly written and with well paced plot turns. I am seeking out the additional volumes immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like dying embers","review":"The premise of this book--a wealthy stranger arrives in a Colonial New England town and then apparently bursts into flames--sounded intriguing. Sadly, it did not fulfill its promise. Absolutely nothing in this book ignited my imagination.To me, the characters seemed one-demensional and formulaic: the brave little widow, the potential love interest next door, the spoiled sister, etc. The period detail was generic and didn't give me a sense of \\"being\\" in 1763. The mystery itself, while not riveting, was interesting enough to get me to finish the book, but I won't be reading the sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows Promise","review":"This Colonial mystery set near Boston in 1763 shows some promise as the first in a series of historical mysteries. In this book we meet the widow Charlotte Willett and her interesting bachelor neighbour Richard Longfellow. Strange happenings are occuring in the tiny town of Bracebridge. A stranger newly arrived in town appears to disappear in a puff of smoke and flames. There is a lot more to this tidbit of entertainment as Charlotte and Richard discover plots and murder within their usually quiet town. I like the period setting, and the characters are interesting. Certainly, I will read further in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Based on a True Story","review":"Stay away from the dull update, the original Amityville Horror is the best haunted house story ever made. The evil horror lies in the ghosts of past residents, who had a hard time upkeeping it amidst the slur of bogus houses in a styx town, made bogus to try and keep the legit residents safe. It's not that scary any more. In the 90s it was scary as hell. But if you like old fashioned horror you can't go wrong. This was the fourth and final of the Big 3 horror films that scared a whole country into going back to church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely lovely detective short stories","review":"I'm not much for gory, long-winded mystery stories. As a lover of Ellery Queen and Issac Asimov short stories (puzzles, play-fair-with reader plots), this collection by Julian Symons is a real gem.

I can't remember the last time I watched a horror flick that had *zero* suspense and atmosphere.

You could seriously let a raccoon with rabies loose in the building and I'm willing to bet that would offer more in the way of actual fear than what this poor excuse of a film provides.I simply can't recommend it to anyone. You'd have to be the most desperate person in the world to watch it.I'm talking about someone who's been on a deserted island for over 15 years and once they came back to civilization, they're absolutely dying to see a horror film more than anything else.

You can virtually feel the humidity of Florida from the screen.Woody Harrelson is at his least annoying. Elizabeth Shue is a pleasure to look at, and is actually a quite good actress (Notwithstanding \\"The Saint\\"). Gina Gershon is her usual sultry self.The joy of this film is, in my opinion, the cinematography. The picture is gorgeous to watch.That cinematography makes up for a forgettable, far-fetched plot which takes far too long to develop.

If you buy this film, buy it for Shue and the cinematography."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll be disappointed","review":"This movie has the requisite moods and plot for a film noir.

Good Cast with nothing to work with. If it was to be satire on traditional noir films it missed the point. If it is trying to be a noir film than it is ridiculous.Shue is particularly bad. Unbelievable as a screen siren. Laughed everytime she tried to be seductive or coy.Plot completely implausible and even at the end did not tell us who Shue or Sevigny really are. If Harry was really that easily pulled into seduction, the plot would have had him do Odette. The movie copped out in plot, dialogue and scenes.

The theme here is Minimal, with every track from \\"MrI's - To be Honest\\", \\"SCSI's - Middle of the way\\", \\"MrI's - Human Patterns\\" have a technical perfection that fuses the grooves of house music, with the minimalism of Detroit Techno, moving smoothly across the genres, and blurring the distinction between them, until all you are left with is just truly glorious music.

This book and series is recommended only for juveniles. It did not hold my interest. The characters' misadventures weren't all that interesting nor compelling. Anthony does bring to closure some of the personal issues that each character has developed in the first two novels. It seems obvious at the ending that there will be another book in the series to settle the events started in the DoOon Mode in Virtual Mode. Since we haven't seen the next installment as yet, one can guess that either the series didn't do all that well and is not a high priority for Anthony to continue or that he frankly has no place to go with the storyline. The next book could actually be the best since a hopping mad Dwang could once again pursue his plans to invade the other modes. It would be up to Colene to thwart his plans once more, provided she survived."},{"rating":"2","title":"When's the next one coming out?","review":"This series has been so good.

Typical maps of the entire reservation portray it as mostly empty space.The legendary AAA map that Leaphorn uses in the mysteries is excellent, but more detail than you need if you just want to follow along with the books. It also doesn't include fictitious features like \\"Short Mountain\\". (The \\"Guide to Indian Country\\" is free for AAA members.

This band has some attitude. I remember band photos with this funny clown guy in top hat but now it's shining leather in the generic Cradle of FIlth vein. Ah, The prior to this release had some woman with flapping wings on cover but this one is slightly more entertaining old man's child rip-off; a naked whore with silicon breasts(wasn't playboy mag made for that stuff?) How misanthropic! and what about the music that the most innocent christian fool would appreciate?!? It's fast and polished with all the circus keyboards attached. Cheesy indeed!I know that music has it's side of creativity but it just comes to the point of being stupid.

Then call it black metal. This is about as metal as Cradle of Filth.

Popped right put after 5-10 mins in the freezer. We filled some of our frogs with blackberry jam, coconut, peanut butter or placed a cashew right at the head of the frog so when the person took that first bite it would crunch.The only thing I would say is make sure you dont get air-pockets in the eyes of the frogs or they come out looking a little odd.

Geez, it would have been really dull without it. Originaly, Rama was the awesome subject (RWR), then it became the setting for a soap opera. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind the odd human drama, I actually watch and enjoy Melrose Place, but at least it doesn't get all PREACHY like this book does! And another thing, Clarke and Lee were obviously feeling a little down on humanity when they wrote this. Two stars instead of one because the original was soooooo good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Garden of Rama was a darn good book, deserving of a 10!","review":"I hate to say this, but a lot of you people have bad taste. I read this book last weekend and I must say that it was probably one of the better two in the series. I thought it was suspensful, provoking, and just a good book. I also think that drawing parelells to life today (the Aids like disease, the dictatorship, and the war) simply shows that human nature is about the same, time isn't neccesarilly going to improve it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked by the good reviews","review":"I agree with those that panned this book, and I also have to agree that I thought I was getting a book written by the esteemed Arthur C Clark. Either Sir Clark has lost it, or it was written by someone else. The book has a lot of promise but squanders it, and resolves nothing. Also, the plot (especially regarding the extreme stupidity of the colonists) is not believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear...","review":"The only good thing about this book is the sense of wonder you get through thinking, 'how can Clarke have let this happen?' and how Gentry Lee, possibly the most inept writer working in fiction today is allowed to be released from 3rd grade Eng. Lit classes long enough to write this monstrosity.300 years is an astonishingly long time for nothing at all to happen. Nicole Des Jardins, sheesh, I half expected her to develop the powers of flight, and heat ray vision by the end of the book.This book is really quite dreadful. Read it as an example of how Clarke's unwillingness to write more than a few scrawled words on the back of a napkin and then pass it over to someone else has transmuted this once 'master' into a name publishers feel will sell fourth rate tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"God this is a bad book....","review":"I have just reread the whole series, book one is a very good book but each book after is geometrically worse.

Read and keep book one, burn the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rama II and Rama III are awful.","review":"Rama II and Rama III are awful. I'm embarrassed to see Mr. Clarke's name associated with these so-called sequels. They reflect nothing of the science fiction wonder and imagination seen in Rendezvous with Rama and most of his other stories. Rama II & III are completely polluted with political, sociological & religious nonsense and modern emotionalism. Not worth reading. Certainly not worth adding to a fine collection of Clarke books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, oh please don't waste your time with this garbage!","review":"With only one or two exceptions, everybody seems to agree that this follow-up series is the biggest waste of time of our lives!Like another reviewer wrote: What I wouldn't do to get the time back!If the setting were entirely different (ie.

When the human settlers of Rama become \\"more human than human\\" by engaging in those aforementioned atrocities (racism, AIDS-ophobia, destroying the environment in the name of short-term wants), I will admit to feeling frustrated--Hey, what about the happy future, utopia, etc.etc.?!?! Unfortunately, we cannot escape our genes. A thought provoking and entertaining read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes, little substance","review":"I have to say that I found the whole Rama series to be a bit disappointing. I expected a series with the quality of Clarke's \\"Odyssey\\" Novels, but they just didn't live up to expectation. There was too many sub-plots and mysteries left un-resolved, events that were over emphasized but never clarified. And to be honest, I found many aspects of the book to be totally unrealistic. Overall this series was quiet a let down. If your going to buy this book, buy if used!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gardens of Rama is disappointing","review":"I read the first two books and liked them especially the first. This book is a waste of the series. Genuine mystery gets replaced by mundane explanations and deliberate omissions. All the characters seem to get stupider and one dimensional. Rama gets stupider and its motivations go from unfathomable to arbitrary and shallow. There are sloppy inconsistencies with the first two books. Overall, this book is not worth the read even if or especially if you liked the first two books. The Rama in this book does not exist in the same universe as the first two. On top of all this there is some vaguely nauseating sexual themes involving incest, polyandry, the extremely old and the extremely young."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring Me the Head of Gentry Lee!!!","review":"Who told Arthur Clarke that Gentry Lee could write? Why was Lee allowed to come near the master of science fiction, much less co-author a book with him?

The gardenof Rama was especially bad... full of the worst crap I ever read. I'm pretty sure Aruthur did'nt write most of it if not any of it and it's this'Gentry' guy who did most of the work..and turnedthe original idea ( which was great ) into one long unbelievable soap-opera.MEDFAZAHM,Bahrain,26-6-1997."},{"rating":"2","title":"another brilliant work","review":"This is just one more fantastic work by one of the greatest science fiction writers ever.

Clarke fan. However, all books following the first book are written by Gentry Lee, not Arthur C Clarke. The text supposedly was checked by Sir Clarke. I know this from an online interview transcript I read.The book focuses excessively on the emotions of the heroine Nicole. Her characterization seems to have little relation to any serious cosmological or theological issues or Science Fiction science. It becomes a drama, not a sci fi book.I say, skip this book. Its a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Continuing the downward spiral","review":"Ever so gently this series is starting to drift. GET BACK ON FOCUS!!! Much of the writing was about mundane people doing mundane things, petty conflicts, a lot of wondering and wandering and not much continuity. Once again, as he has done in the past over and over, Clarke comes up with a superlative idea but his literary talents - or lack thereof - are not up to the task. Only rarely does he succeed with character development and this is not an uncommon occurrence among scifi writers.I found myself staring into space several times and even peeking ahead. The best parts were all the creatures in the Garden. It is an axiom that the really memorable science fiction stories do not center on the unworldly aspect but on unforgettable people - Contact, Stranger in a Strange Land, Dune. This series could have been really remarkable but it has been dithered away. What a waste of time and energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!!!","review":"What a let-down!!!This is an unbelivably poor, hashed-together, novel with a few points of interest (hence 2 stars, instead of 1) but mostly pathetic and unbelivable. The first section of the book, containing extracts of \\"journal entries\\" from Nicole's journal (it's obvious now that Nicole is going to be the main character from here on out) which serve to send forward the plot about 13 years (and entangle the characters in some cloyingly obvious sexual \\"misunderstandings\\"). The remainder of the book is a description of the \\"colony\\" from Earth chosen to inhabit Rama, and the disastrous choices made by nearly everyone -- from the politicians on Earth, to most of the colonists.To paraphrase B.B. King, \\"The Thrill of Rama is Gone\\". I'll give \\"Rama Revealed\\" a chance, just because so many loose ends are left hanging.A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"more of the boring same","review":"This continues the continuation. It gives details of the ship, keeping its purpose a mystery and developing the personalities in depressingly predictable ways.It is not bad, but it simply fails to meet the mark of Clarke's solo works, which means either that his powers are failing or the co-author is doing the work.If you are a purist and serious sci-fi fan, don't bother with this. But if you are looking for a pretty good read that continues a story without surprises, this is OK. But it is only OK.I was profoundly disappointed with this, as with all of Clarke's sequels (with the exception of 2010 Space Od.) It is simply an insipid logical extension and you feel contantly that the author(s) are groping to extend it in an interesting way. I wish they didn't write this. If you are after real quality, don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happen to Clarke!","review":"It was like a bad car wreck, I could not look away.

(Remember, things are pretty sorry on Earth by then, after the great Chaos/depression, so it won't take much.) Oh yeah, her younger daughter learns how to masturbate while they enter orbit around Mars. If it sounds stupid, it is. I fought to preserve my memory of the beauty of the original story.

The first 200 or so pages of this book are among the best science fiction I have ever read. Unfortunately, as some other reviewers have pointed out, the last half of the book has an over-density of smut (thank you so much, Gentry Lee) and ridiculousness.I would recommend it. If you suffered through Rama II, you shall find this third installment in the Rama books to be somewhat more rewarding.Plus, the cover's cool! The scene depicted on the cover actually occurs in the book, precisely. That's a nice change...so many books in this genre have cover art without any real application to the text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Dreadful","review":"Tedious, boring, endless. This book goes over and over the same agonizing territory, and it can do that easily because it is impossibly long.Nicole, the heroine, is an impossible jerk.

Horrible.I wish this book were alive so I could cause it pain. Yes, that horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not just bad but astonishingly bad.","review":"It's hard to overstate just how bad this book is. Thin plot? Check. Dimensionless, predictable and stereotypical characters? Check. Outlandish and hard to believe behavior? Check. What makes this even worse than your typical bad book is that Arthur C. Clarke's name is on the cover. Obviously Gentry Lee did most of the writing and story development (or lack thereof). One has to hope he's a better engineer than writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time","review":"Gentry really messed up a good franchise. Throws in a lot of mystical feminine feelings and fantasies.Way too much time wasted discussing the protagonist's and her children's relationships. I really don't need a description of an episiotomy and bad sex in a SciFi story and certainly not polluting Clarke's name. I wound up skipping whole pages at a time hoping to get to some resolution to Clarke's original vision but the last pages just left you hanging with no desire to read yet another sequel. vapid and pointless.I actually thought Gentry Lee was a woman from the writing style and gender of the protagonist but when I looked the author up to see what other books he/she wrote I found it was actually an old dude writing as a woman. That is just flat out creepy. I do not recommend any books by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is bull!","review":"It's not more Hard SF!

Fine. But Gentry Lee has them communicating by bands of colored light around their heads, because--get this--sound doesn't travel well under water, but light does. Uh huh. That's what he said. Apparently, he never heard of whales and dolphins.So, the octospiders have no words for anything. Yet, later, Lee makes up octospider words for their system of measuring time (the smallest unit being about 20 seconds, as I recall). Yep. They have no speech, but they have names for things.That's just for starters. As I forced myself to finish reading this dreck, I began to wonder if it was a hoax, a challenge to the readers to find as many inconsistencies as possible. It just made me feel angry and insulted."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring novel","review":"In my opinion, Rendezvous with Rama and Rama II are very good novels. This sequel though is dreadfully boring. I really wanted to read it and like it. I bought copies of Rama II, The Garden of Rama, and Rama Revealed at the same time planning to read them all. I have tried maybe five or six times to read this novel and I fail every time. The first half of this novel is 'Nicole's Journal' and I think it was a really bad style choice. There is nothing compelling about the journal. It reads like a diary, but that isn't up to the caliber of a novel with a novel having many characters, plot and subplots, story. Being trapped in the alien spaceship really isn't that exciting anyways. It should have been much better.What I ended up doing is skimming this novel and its sequel, Rama Revealed. That way I found out what happened to the characters and was able to 'fast forward' through the dreary garbage. But I shouldn't have to do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"This novel is two books, only Half is the real A. C. Clarke","review":"What a major dissappointment ! The first half of the book is true A.

People say say they can't believe things would be a lot like they are now 300 years from now.

If you've read Rama Reaveled then what I think the whole series is tring to tell us is that although we may be an intelligent race If we continue to fight omust ourselves and keep hating people because of race or sex or because of a deases we will never advance to our highest potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's the definition of insanity?","review":"Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.And for all intents, since i am going to go for the sequel- I must be insane.Or not, since I don't really expect it to be better- just some closure.Garden was better than the the soap opera that was Rama 2 (hence 2 stars), but still a total let down from Rendezvous.It really bugs me that the people chosen to populate Rama by the government included convicts. I would really think in reality people would be willing to cut off their right arms to be part of something like this and would chosen from the best and the brightest. (And if the analogy is the New World- well, a look at the punishments of colonial times would tell you that the death penalty was a popular punishment for any number of crimes including theft. The colonists took it into accounct that their members incuded criminals.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another trip to the Well","review":"In this second sequel to Rendezvous with Rama Gentry Lee takes us to a hint of the origins of the Rama spacecraft. Unfortunately, the answers are not very satisfying. The \\"Rama Node\\" is said to be huge, but the characters never get a sense of it. And the existence of dozens of other Rama type vessels and an even larger space station diminishes the awe of the original Rama craft.I read this, but I wouldn't ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucked","review":"The first book--just by Arthur C. Clarke--was awesome. The second--with Lee--was decent. I just hope that Clarke didn't actually write this because otherwise he needs to give up writing.The only thing that kept me from being depressed that I had wasted my time with this book was the description of the ant creatures--that was decently creative.I didn't think the \\"sex manuals\\" another reviewer wrote about were annoying but they definitely were not interesting. The politics were like a lecture on how people today should act with no flavor to them whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"We have come to expect better from Clark.","review":"If I want a season ending cliff hangger, I'll watch prime time soaps. This book starts in one direction(good)in a RAMA tradition. It then turns into a morality play unworthy of the author, and then stops, as if it were a weekly serial. I love a good series, but each book should stand on its' own. This one just wants you to buy the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suck-o-RAMA","review":"Ok.... I admit that I have enjoyed reading the RAMA books, but not in the same way I enjoy reading other books written by Arthur C. Clarke, a man I consider to be one of the greatest writers ever. These books, except for the first one, are just action adventures/soap operas. There is nothing deep or anything that will make you think in these books. Reading this series is like watching Pro-Wrestling: you know it is ridiculous, but it keeps you entertained, so you keep watching/reading. For anyone who is not really into Sci-Fi, and is not looking for original ideas, but is looking for a bunch of pointless sex, this is a great book. I am really bothered that Clarke sunk to the level of writing a series with pathetic cliffhangers at the end to sucker a reader into buying another book in the series. He should leave that up to Diane Carey and Peter David who think that writing Star Trek novels is the same thing as writing Sci-Fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the first two.","review":"After being entranced by the first two entries in this series, I was severely disappointed by the third. Except for the very beginning of the book, the traditional sci-fi aspects fly right out the window. Instead, you're left with a socio-economic lesson and subtle-as-a-jackhammer comparisons to our current society. This was a snore and a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garden of RAMA","review":"I think this book is above all others. I read a rewiev here that said that Nicole de Jardin was a very extraordinary character. Well, how about Richard Wakefield? He figured out how to program the computer in the Humans nest, and he builds robots as it was nothing. He gotta be very intelligent to make such things... I dont know. Anyway, Garden of RAMA is a very great, fascinating and astonishing and awesome book, real but unreal.... always the mystery: who invented RAMA? and where do the octos and \\"birds\\" from? And all other strange things happening... Clarke rules.I give it the highest rate"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I purchased this whole ensemble for my son's room and was very disappointed in the quality.

No chemistry at all between the two main characters. The story dragged on the entire way. The romance was as rated G as a Disney cartoon and even more. There was no passion at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold Fusion is too easy","review":"Development in Cold Fusion is easy. It took me 4 days to develop the same site in Cold Fusion that it took me 8 months to develop in Cold Fusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly, superficial heroine, condescending, pious hero.","review":"...I am a very great fan of Mary Balogh. So much so that I am tracking down her out-of-print backlist and buying second-hand copies at large multiples of their cover prices. Therefore I would not usually write negative reviews of one of her books. This time I have to.On other occasions, a Balogh book has hooked me right from the first page. I'm sucked in and can barely put the book down. A Gift Of Daisies felt nothing like a Balogh book. Reading the first few pages, I actually had to look again at the back cover to check that it was actually Rachel who was the heroine, not her much nicer and more interesting friend Celia...I can't recommend A Gift Of Daisies in any way, and will probably hide it at the very back of my Balogh collection so I'll never be tempted to read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bland for me","review":"I really feel Balogh missed an opportunity to come up with a classic angst-ridden love story, which she writes so well. Instead, I felt this story was bland with wishy-washy characters that did nothing to capture my sympathy. I just felt that everyone was 'playing' at being 'good' - in the end, I didn't care what anyone did. Give it a miss would be my advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"a gift of daisies","review":"Pleasant, but not as involving as Balogh's others. Lady Rachel Palmer is the toast of London society, until she is introduced to the Reverend David Gower. He's the new minister of her country parish, and a friend of her childhood sweetheart. She immediately falls in love with him, and decides that her life in London is artificial and unfulfilling. She has her work cut out for her, however, to convince David that she would rather be a minister's wife, than married to some powerful, wealthy aristocrat. The story is as much about her spiritual awakening as it is a romance. The romance, frankly, is rather tepid, and not all that interesting. People who enjoy Christian romances will probably like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a low quality video where the picture was eratic","review":"The content of the video was satisfactory, however the quality of the video was poor.

It also was ratty looking like a used stuffed animal gets when it has been played with. It had the tags but so does some of my daughters stuffed animals, but it doesn't mean they are new. This one isn't that cute either."},{"rating":"1","title":"May not be what you expect!","review":"If you're like me and have seen these mini-movies featured on the Golf Channel, you may be disappointed by the fact that the story lines have been cut out of these tapes. The charm and humor evident in the original films is all but gone, save the low key and warm delivery of Jones. It's too bad the producers of the video versions chose to drop the very thing that made these films worth seeing. While some of the instruction is sound (even for today's modern game) without the actors and storylines intact, these videos offer nothing that isn't in any other run-of-the-mill golf instruction video on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"An oldie but goodie","review":"The title of this video is should be \\"The Bobby Jones Swing Analysis\\". This video breaks down Jones's graceful swing in slow motion, grip, backswing, downswing, impact and follow thru. Bobby Jones's swing (in my opinon) is just as sound as those of any of 2002 top pro golfers. I've taken lessons, read golf books, watched golf instructional video's. From this video I was able to improve some facets of my game. I'm definitely a Jones's fan now."},{"rating":"1","title":"impossible to get through","review":"I'm a Rutgers student, and I had to read this book for an anthropology class which was taught by Ramos Zayas. While she is an engaging lecturer, and I thoroughly enjoyed the other readings for the class, veiled sentiments in particular, this particular book was extremely difficult to get through. She is a very smart woman, but this book is more written for a graduate level anthropology class rather than an intro course. The vocabulary and sentence structure she uses is very tricky and you pretty much have to have a general idea of anthropology to really understand it.I am an anthro major but I read this book for my first anthropology course and was like....huh???? in every other paragraph. What's even more shocking is that my TA for the course told us that she had to read this same book for one of her graduate courses and had trouble with it!I'm an avid reader of ethnographies but this one was just too tough."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book ever","review":"A disgrace to Puerto Ricans she hits us with vocabulary that she thinks will make her smart but it is a jumbled mess.

And actually has a decent rhyming voice, but she needs new writers and producers. \\"If I Could Go\\" I will admit, I always found myself (not wanting to though) huming the beat and chorus. But that's because it's one of those purpously catchy sappy songs. And in there lies the problem with this album, and releases like it. It's made and marketed as if it's going to be the artists only chance to have a hit. In 15 years you won't hear this durring rotation on \\"old school\\" radio shows. They knew they could make a quick hit and did it. Formula-matic music is made to be disposable and thrown away and forgotten after about a year.

My mistake. After reading Andersonville I have to agree with him. Does the author really expect anyone to believe Wirz is a good guy because he once let a prisoner pick up a knife he dropped or a couple of other so-called acts of kindness? Or because clerics and ladies found him \\"courteous and accommodating\\". He even captions one photo as \\"...the judge advocate who railroaded Henry Wirz\\". Hardly objective, especially in the absence of anything to support it. He devotes only 4 pages to the trial, calling witness testimony exaggerated, imaginative or pure invention and referring to Wirz as deprived. I would think that if you're attempting to revise history, you need to make a better argument than the lame one put forth here. Too bad.

He entered a board and care facility weighing 111 pounds and was losing weight no matter how much he ate. He spent the entire day in bed and could not sit up unassisted. The doctors shrugged and told him it was old age. The caregivers at his facility began a food regimen that came from this book. (They did not discontinue his only medical prescription, which was for high blood pressure.) Two months later, he has stopped losing weight and is able to get out of bed and eat at the table. He enjoys the food he eats, has gone off daily laxatives, and can sit up by himself for longer and longer periods of time. Even his speech, which had been slurred, has improved, and he is more alert and less depressed.

Without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen.

Calling people by incorrect name. Including character referring to someone by her own name. In so called suspense scene giving incorrect number of people in the room - quite confusing. The ending is absolutely awful - it just beggars belief. The editors also have a lot of blame at their feet - should of edited better (or edited at all) - and sent back to get inconsistencies sorted out.

This approach was not only badon all trees that were felled but also deceived the reader with insertions of flaky and immature implementations.

Thank God I didn't watch it in real time. I was over it after 26 minutes. CB radios do not work like that. You cannot interupt someone when they are talking. The very nature of a CB radio is to talk to people at a looong distance, so his comments that you must be close since I can hear you are completely stupid.

This one had more techy stuff (camera, phone, CB radio, annoying red LED clock) and had the more elaborate plot of trying to extort information from it's (How did I get here?) occupant. Just like a person in a box not knowing what's going on, this viewer felt like they were in a box in being mostly clueless and bored 90% of the time while watching just a person in a box with only increasingly predictable dialogue to keep from dozing off. To make it worse the writer & director tossed in two twists at the end that not only were stupid-unrealistic but made the preceding 91 of 92 minutes seem even stupider."},{"rating":"1","title":"brake","review":"One of the most boring movies I have ever seen in my life.

He is a Secret Service agent with information about where the President goes in case of an emergency.

They should show the movie to a handful of movie goers, and then ask for suggestions before it is released. Especially ask for ideas on an ending. It gets old quickly.

Michael is getting back in good graces with the agency thanks to his friendly handler, Max. When the handler gets murdered, Michael, Fi, and Sam get hot on the trail of the killer.

The video randomly stops and downgrades quality, despite flash being allocated unlimited cache space. Which brings us to the underlying problem- flash. Maybe my i7 processor is not sufficient, perhaps 16gb of ram is not enough, ssds in raid might not have the speed, and 50mb might be insufficient Internet bandwidth. Of course if any of these are the case then it just goes to show how inefficient flash is.

After four years we see Weston back in his spy job but with a new set of problems that will also get thrown his way too. It's also great to see the cast have stayed strong with this show as well as the newcomer from last season Jesse who added a nice touch of fresh blood to the show. The video and audio are clear and sharp with this set as expected and with some added bonuses to the set too form some commentaries to a few gag reels. After being saturated with so many clone shows on CBS and NBC(CSI/CSI:Miami/CSI:New York/NCIS/NCIS:Los Angeles, etc etc) it's nice to see one of the few shows that isn't following that trail.

I primarily watch for the developing and amazing relationship between Fi and Micheal. I agree Jeffrey Donovan's hair is a distraction this season. At least they aren't dressing him like a nerdy golfer as much. He was edgier and cooler in the first season, and is acting more like Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory in the last few seasons. I hope they make him cool and more suave towards Fi in the next few seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Hemingway","review":"With \\"The Big Two-Hearted River\\" parts I and II, and \\"Indian Camp,\\" there's a lot to like here.

The reader finds all of the usual denizens of Hemingway's world: anglers, ex-patriates, toreadors, soldiers, men and women who are in love, and those who have fallen out. And, of course, Nick Adams. In these tales, Hemingway demonstrates the superfluousness of semicolons and the superiority of spartan sentences for which he is famous.While it isn't my favorite of Hemingway's works, it makes a good sampler for those wishing to get short doses of Hemingway, especially for those whose only exposure to Hemingway was reading The Old Man and The Sea in high school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hemingway is Amazing in \\"In Our Time\\".

Joey has Tony MacAlpine on keyboards to lend him a hand, and Wally Voss pounding on the bass in the back. But the spotlight is definitely on Joey. His sound is nothing new if you are famaliar with the more prominent guitar virtuosos, but he still has lots of talent and there is a definite heavy metal sound to him. Neo-Classical shining with a bit of Thrash thrown in for good effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joey rules!","review":"Even 12 years after Joey gave me this CD as a present at the GIT in Hollywood I am still a big fan of his playing!

My toes still curl over the top, just not as much. The thong digs into the space between my big toe and next little toe, and actually broke the skin. They were extremely uncomfortable to wear and I always felt I had to move my foot awkwardly to keep them on. I am guessing, though, that that is the nature of any flip-flop.

It is a hokey premise about the discovery of mysterious alien artifacts, \\"Malkus Artifacts\\", which are the last vestiges of a power-hungry ruler and a civilization dating from 90,000 years before the 24th Century. The first half is a somewhat engaging look at the discovery of the third of these artifacts, featuring Captain Robert DeSoto of the USS Hood and Lieutenant Tuvok from USS Yoyager a few weeks prior to Voyager's ill-fated mission in the Badlands. It also includes some riveting scenes with members of the Maquis. The second half is a disappointing reunion of Colonel Kira Nerys, Ambassador Worf, Ambassador Spock and Admiral McCoy as they fall under the spell of the fourth artifact, found on the Klingon colony world Narendra III. This was a quick diversion on a long New York City subway ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than book one of the series.","review":"Although I have rated each book of this series at 4 stars, I have to say that this one was noticeably the better of the two; while book one was closer to three stars than five, this is just the reverse. If you're going to read just one of these two books, it should definitely be this one rather than book one; entirely aside from the fact that one can much more easily do without reading book one, and treat the events there as \\"offscreen\\" background to this book than one can deal with missing the ending provided here, this is just generally a better-written book with better plots. I dock it a star (barely) for the fact that the success of the heroes seems a bit improbable given what they were facing; the power of the opposition should, by all rights, have been insuperable. The explanations as to why this was possible seemed a stretch. Still, the story was a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Double-Sided Recording of Luck of the Irish and I'll Never Forget You","review":"This 1948 version of the Luck of the Irish is a great movie.

Played with burning ferocity by Swedish actor Lou Castel, Alessandro is a loose cannon of teeming hate who seemingly has no qualms about pushing his blind mother off a cliff or penning incestuous verse to his sister Giulia (Pitagora).

His fine writingbrings out the french pompousness that lead to the franco-prussian war; the siege of Paris; the state of denial thatheld to the last days among the upper class; the state of terrorand famine of the lower class; and the ultimate collapseof the commune and eventual slaughter of the communards.As one who has lived in Paris, I highly recommend it even ifyou don't traditionally read history books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of the Commune itself","review":"I found this book lacking. The author spends an inordinate amount of time on a murder which was okay reading but way too long. I read on and on and on... I became very annoyed as I kept reading about the sensationalist murder.

Quite a surprise let me tell you! If any of you bought and were completely disappointed by the model kit that was released depicting this ship then this sequence is a godsend. It clearly shows the front of the attacker (detail clearly missing in the model kit). So, if you have that model kit sitting around gathering dust on a shelf then buy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working Watch for show","review":"I needed a working watch, and this one, besides the good looking appearance, is easy to read in bad light, hopefully will resist some minor bumps and will endure many servicing years.The shopping service was simple and efficient.

Within 3 days there was obvious healing and within 3 weeks the wounds were all closed.I have used it many times since then, most recently on an alpaca with an open, draining abscess on his jaw.

Travis and Aldrete bring the whole thing to light as they form one of the most formidable rhythm sections in the history of heavy music. Too bad there's only 2 classic studio albums and 2 by-the-numbers live albums.

As I'm sure you know, Anthony is an incredible actor and musician but I was still skeptical. Needless to say, he totally won me over. His writing was sensitive and intelligent. He drew you into the story in an incredible way, making you feel as if you had met him for coffee and he was telling you the story of his life.Instead of dwelling completely on the story of Rent, Anthony gives you a look at his life, the people he loves and his struggles.

While \\"RENT\\" becomes an hit, Anthony's mother gets better, Jonathan Larson (RENT playwright and composer) dies unexpectedly on the eve of the off-Broadway debut of the show, and then his mother gets sick again. Between dealing with all of the trappings of becoming a broadway star, flying home to take care of his mother, and dealing with family he's trying to come to terms with his mother regarding his sexuality. It's an emotional wrenching, cathartic, bitter-sweet love story and also a testement to family and life. It's been a long time since I laughed *and* cried while reading a book!

I strongly suggest the audio recording, especially for fans of Rent and of Anthony. Hearing him read the story himself (particularly for the small and poignant personal moments, like the frequent \\"Hi, Mama\\"--\\"Hi, Tonio\\" exchanges with his mother--it broke my heart every time) was an intimate and powerful experience, and when I finished I felt I had just had a long and passionate conversation with a friend--which i was very sorry to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story of history","review":"I was inspired by the author which I had read before on the same subject.This book is really well documented and very well illustrated.All in all a well rounded book that gives an overall picture of these hard and difficult times in history."},{"rating":"2","title":"not listed clearly","review":"Be sure that you only want volume I.

However, None of the chapters flow easily, and jump from the west to the east, from the thriving univeristy concept to what is seldom said about popes at this time. Important information is discussed with limited detail. Large text and frequent large pictures take up much room in the text which could be used for more text.

Martin has his own skeleton in the closet and has left the fashionable world for the shadows of the ton. He resucues Amanda and finds himself drawn to her against his better judgement.Amanda and Martin's story is typical Stephanie Laurens tale and there are plenty of characters that make a reapperance in this story.

The main characters are one-dimensional (she: blond, blue eyed, porcelain skin, he tall, dark, handsome as sin (yawn) and of course haunted by past injustice). She has no character at all, we only know about her that she tries with blatant come-ons to seduce him, he - of course - resists (yawn).

She was pretty conniving, but I don't fault her for that. If I met a handsome rake at a gaming hell I might try and snag him too. But she snags him in such a BORING way. There's no pizzazz to the way she goads him into escorting her to all of these supposedly scandalous outings. There was so much potential for sexual sizzle at the various outings, but instead they were really boring.Stephanie Laurens is always wordy, but this book was out of control. The sex scenes were so boring and incredibly painful to get through. There's so much fluff that you can barely tell they are having sex!

I'm not sure what some other the other reviewers were expecting, but when I read a romance--especially historical romance--I expect some light escapist reading, and this is exactly what you get with Amanda Cynster's story.Laurens primed readers for Amanda's (and Amelia's) story in the previous Cynster books. The twins both decide it's time to make their match, and each devise a plan for achieving that goal. Amanda decides to search the places young misses are never allowed to go. And while this is not realistic, it is truly entertaining how Amanda manipulates Martin, Earl of Dexter, into courting her.I loved this book, and I look forward to Amelia's story."},{"rating":"2","title":"On a Wild Night","review":"I recommended to anyone who hasn't read Stephanie Laurens work.

I never thought Id say this, but this book had too much sex! It got boring after awhile, usually when Im reading a book and the tension is building, Im dying for some of the intimate scenes...but in this book, I actually found my self flipping ahead to read something besides all of this meaningless sex. Also, how in the heck did Amanda get away with such behavior back in the day? I think what got to me the most was..when I started this book..it began so well..I was immediately hooked into the fast pace..only to later be disappointed..all in all...not horrible, but it could stand to have about 150 pages knocked off."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish this was better...","review":"After reading the other Cynster novels, I had high hopes for Amelia's book. Even though she had seemed shallow in the other books, I figured she was young and would grow. I was disappointed.All of the Cynster novels are anarchronistic, then almost all regency historicals are. But this one WAS too anarchronistic for me. She runs around without a chaperone. She has sex in public places and she goes to a gaming hell. Hello!? In addition, she acts like a 15 year old high school freshman who desperately wants the senior quarterback who's not sure that she wants him. And to top it all off, she stamps her pretty foot like every chapter and announces that she won't marry him until he says he loves her.I'm so happy I got this from the library.

It seems like S. Laurens wrote 20 pages of storyline & in the rest she copied the love scenes of her previous novels with some find & replace to change the surroundings around them. The book goes on & on about how he doesn't want to say I love you & how she needs him to say so & I don't know how Stepanie Laurens manages to write page after page saying the same premise. The love scenes are so boring, just way too wordy & without any build up to them so it is the same scene over & over again.

Both books seemed more like a catalogue on the different ways and places the couples could find to make love. I do like sexy romances but when chapter after chapter is devoted to sex,it does become rather boring.At least pump it up with a good story and interesting characteters - but even that fell short - disappointing for a author of a stature of Laurens.Also I just don't fall for the idea of how both Martin and Luc can't bring themselves to declare their love. It seems that in trying to bring out the strength of character of her heroes, Stephanie Laurens has compromised on their sensitivity.

I mean SERIOUSLY? I bet I can find many other books the fill this exact outline.

As the previous reviewer stated, these episodes are in Japanese with English subtitles and NO English soundtrack; no big deal to me, but it will irk some viewers. Language issue aside, this is a truly outstanding series that any anime fan should enjoy, and learn a thing or two about modern Japanese society in the process. Some new characters have been added, and existing storylines kicked up a notch...for me, the most amusing moments center around the rivalry between Super Gal Ran Kotobuki and the cute-but-prickly debutante/Gal Mami Honda...but, trust me, there is plenty to love about this series, and Right Stuf's DVD quality is fine. So, don't wait for an English dubbed version that may or may not ever be released.

It is one of the most frequently used office items in our house, it has become absolutely indispensable. It is quite easy to use, and the manual is readily available for those people who have challenges. Reliability has been stellar. The quality of labels is outstanding - I have some under my car, labeling a few key items for mechanics (Google Panzer Plate if you're curious and a VW or Audi owner and want to preserve your car), and those labels have lasted for years. Several font sizes and styles can be printed, from large, covering most of the 12mm tape, to tiny. Don't believe those on Amazon who may rate this a 1, if they read the manual, then perhaps things would become clear to them.Read Dave Allen's Getting Things Done.

The labels it creates look nice, though they are a bit small for most uses. HOWEVER, it is a battery hog, making it a pain to use, and not very good for the environment or the pocketbook. As an example, today I put in 4 fresh-from-the-box AAA batteries (that don't expire until 2013). I set up the functions, made 3 labels, then started getting the flashing battery message. That 10-minute process had drained all 4 batteries. So ridiculous. This is supposed to be a handheld labeler used for organizing projects. With such a short battery life, the labeler is more hindrance than help.I am very disappointed in the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constantly blinks needs batteries","review":"It's an ok labeler it blinks needs batteries all the time. It is not as easy to use as my last labeler I don't like how the size feature works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but very annoying, as it does not remember settings.","review":"The actual printing on this labeler is fine.I was looking forward to trying it out due to its QWERTY keyboard, which is an improvement over the ABC keypad I was using on another cheap Dymo labeler I've had.It has all the standard features - fonts, sizes, 2-line printing, etc - and I suppose you might call its date/time function a special feature.Unfortunately for whatever reason, it cannot save typeface formats. I like to print smaller type to save labeling tape, and this means that I must manually set the type size every time I use the labeler. This is an unacceptable flaw to me. Clearly it can store memory, as it uses batteries, and already saves the time and date (until you change the batteries, that is). So why would it lack something as simple as a memory for type size?It's braindead. Just like whoever designed the thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Low Problem","review":"I've had this label maker for over a year and I was (pretty much) happy with it except now it has a problem \\"Battery Low\\" problem. New batteries work for only a little while and it stops printing labels when the battery voltage measures less than 1.4V for each battery (I tested each AAA battery with a meter). I'm not sure what is causing it and there doesn't seem to be a workaround for this problem, that I can find a solution for, on the Internet.So, I guess I got a year out of it which is good but now I'm in the market for a new labeler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a couple of months of light use","review":"Really, save yourself some time and money and do not buy this product.

I bought a couple of Brother products before and both were mediocre. Try another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after about 10 labels","review":"You get what you pay for, I suppose.

I began to organize and label everything, but as I got going every time I printed a label, the thing would shut off. I cannot figure out why! I have to adjust the batteries and turn it on again. Every single time I want to print a label! Besides that fault I would love everything about this label maker, but it was too late to return it once I got around to using it. My fault.

Makes a ticking sound, like an old mechanical watch, constantly as long as the power is on. Also, the m-type tapes are very difficult to use because it's hard to peel off the backing. The Tz tapes have a slit down the backing to make them easier to remove, but Brother has designed its Tz label makers to create ridiculously wide margins on labels to force customers to use more of the tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great boom to an organizer","review":"I broke my other labeler and could hardly wait for this one to come. I use it constantly for organization in my home"},{"rating":"1","title":"Craig Finishes The Act!!","review":"This album's concept is really a great idea. Too bad it is not very well done. The young man has a nice voice; but for the most part everything is overdone. The arrangements are too busy. He strains for drama on almost every cut. Some of it works; most of it doesn't!His version of Climb Every Mountain is pure corn. There's Always One You Can't Forget is so forced and overly dramatic. Anything Goes is done as a torch song. If one is a torch singer he/she might be able to carry it off. The Impossible Dream is a dynamic song, but here it is cheesy in his interpretation. The rest of the tunes are merely OK. There is nothing really engrossing on the album. You're Nothing Without Me and the medley with Catherine Hickland, Andrea McArdle and Alice Ripley are the best cuts.Some of the overwrought renditions are tough to listen to more than once. If hetook everything down two or three notches, he might come up with a good album. The voice is sure there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful concept but horrible execution","review":"Doing an album of first-act finales is a terrific idea, but Craig Rubano doesn't trust his material. His readings are done very arch and self-conscious. ''Anything Goes'' is performed with a Latiny flavor; part of ''The Impossible Dream'' is sung in Spanish. There are too many gimmicks. Rubano sounds like he's always ''on''; each song comes across like an ''acting exercise.'' He can't seem to sing anything simply or directly. The arrangements are too busy, and he pushes to sell a song. He blasts away the endings, especially on ''My Own Best Friend'' and ''There's Always One You Can't Forget.'' So much for any subtlety or vulnerability. Too bad. Rubano's got a nice voice (if not distinguished), but he performs as if he knows that all too well."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the same book reviewed below, Executive summary","review":"This is the executive summary 64 pages.

It is well designed with a carrying handle and a cover to prevent dust when not in use, and it turns out crisp and clean laminates each time. I use primarily 3 and 7 mil pouches and it works fine for both. (Though sometimes I have to run the 7 mil through twice, especially if I'm using a heavier card stock paper.) I also like that it's wide enough to laminate the 12\\" x 18\\" pouches. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I have put this machine to the test in my in-home childcare and preschool. I've used both 3 and 5 mil with no issues.

Next time I will buy a GBC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Does It","review":"This is the epitome of laminating simplicity. Plug in the laminator, move the switch to the left or to the right and let this bad boy warm up. When the unit alerts you that it is ready to go to work just drop down the guide that covers the entrance, and which also acts as a dust protector, and slide your project into the slot. The first time or two when you drop the guide it wil act somewhat reluctant but it soon learns its role and cooperates rather nicely for future uses.The handle is convenient for relocating the unit. All in all a handy and satisfactory device for your laminating needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for!","review":"Needed a laminator for crafts and business laminating--something that could hold up under multiple laminating jobs. I've had it for about 2 years now and it is working in tip top shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"The only reason I am giving this item 4 stars is because I originally got a defective one shipped to me. The warm-up light would not progress from red to green. I had to ship it back. However, I was extremely satisfied with Amazon's customer service. I got a brand new laminator in 2 days.The one I have now does work fine. It warms up in about 6 minutes. The lamination is fast and easy. I couldn't be happier with the results. Every time I laminated, it produced clean, smooth results. I would recommend this product to anyone who does laminating on a day-to-day basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fellowes Laminator","review":"The laminator arrived within a few days the order was made and worked very well. I found it to be an excellent product. Previously I had purchased one from the Purple Cows brand at a local craft store and it malfunctioned on the first try. It was exchanged for another laminator and the second one chewed up the paper as well. Purple Cows Customer service was extremely poor so I researched and came across the Fellowes models . . . and it worked extremely well. I'd recommend this company (Fellowes) and it's products because the merchandise performs as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Big Jobs","review":"It's a very nice looking product and easy to run out of the box. Unfortunately it doesn't stay hot enough for continuous action. I ran 12 laminates and by the 4th one, I had to run each item two or more times to seal completely and clocking in at a tortoise-like 1:02 per sheet, it's very, very slow. I finally figured out that if I needed it to stay continuously hot throughout my entire job, I had to run 3 mil laminates on 5 mil heat. Even then, I sometimes had to flip my sheet because the leading edge was still bubbling. I even tried another brand of laminating sheet to no avail. Also, clocking in at a tortoise-like 1:02 per sheet, it's very, very slow. The bottom line is that this product is meant for a casual user. It's not suited to a busy office."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bang for your Buck!!","review":"I borrowed several different laminators before purchasing one for myself. This is BY FAR the easiest and most reliable machine in this price range. Cold laminators didn't achieve the effect I was seeking. Although one must be patient when using this machine it works consistantly. It rolls the paper through at its own speed reducing errors, but beware the lamination envelopes aren't cheap. Definately a worth while purchase if you have a lot of documents to protect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me!","review":"This laminator works really well -- relatively fast warm-up times, glitch-free document feeding, picture perfect lamination seals with no air bubbles, oversize document capability (up to 12.5\\" wide) -- I can't think of anything more I'd want or need from a laminator. The only thing I question is the cool-down time -- the manual says to give it 90min, which sounds a bit excessive given the laminator barely feels warm to the touch. But no biggie. This is a really great laminator and I'm quite happy with it. And the laminating sheets aren't very expensive either. It even has a nifty carrying handle and wrap-around cord storage that locks onto itself -- nice touch. If you need a laminator, this is a good one to get -- go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for personal or light office use","review":"In the past I have always used single-use laminating sheets which work great but can be a real challenge at times. This was my first time using a heated laminator and I was throughly impressed at how easy it was to use. The instructions are simple and the end results are free of defects/air bubbles. The machine seems reasonably durable though I wouldn't consider purchasing this as an \\"Office\\" laminator. I don't think it's really intended for heavy duty use though I do plan to bring this into the office to share. I'll probably ask our administrator to keep an eye on it and only lend it out on an 'as needed' basis as I can't see this product lasting more then a few weeks on its own in an office setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"dustbuster replacement filter","review":"Very happy to find this product at Amazon.

Discs are cheap.I was at the Niagara Falls show a few nights after this one, and I was disappointed that so many of the songs I heard didn't make it onto this DVD. While the Montreal set list was somewhat different than Niagara Falls, the overall concert length was similar.There are a few shots throughout this DVD where you can freeze the image and clearly read the entire set list for this show. I compared the set list to the DVD, and exactly ONE THIRD of the songs have been cut from the DVD! A full THIRD of the concert is missing.That's a real shame.

It is a real chore to get past the first 3 songs.I am frankly stunned that he would allow such a poor performance to be released, as I think it will surely hurt his credibility.

I find the author's attempt to make the book long enough to be qualified as a text book down right PATHETIC. He adds way too many \\"big\\" words and unnecessary sentances. I'm sure he has some good points. But his endless babble will completely throw you off the trial, it's not worth the effort. It is a very difficult to read book, and even my professor admited that each chapter has to be read about 4 times to actually understand that point. Why my professor still uses this book is beyond me. By the way, this book is rediculously priced. I have to take this class for my environmental sustainability degree, but if that were't the case, you couldn't pay me $70 to read it.

First of all, it's a great writing source back. It has lots of great tips and suggestions. There's a section on grammar, and it actually uses humor to make it more entertaining.

I like a fresh sound that comes out of NL, and that doesnt happen too often. They work well with Snoop, like in tracks 11, and 13, where they make fun of \\"Cant Nobody Hold Me Down\\" by Puff Daddy. They sound much different from the regular watered down No Limit sound and thats refreshing to me. The guest appearances are weak (Snoop is the exception), which lets Billy Bavgate and Crooked Eye shine, which is good, considering most NL albums are heavy in guest appearances and dont let the stars be heard. Overall, good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steady Mobbn' is straight dope","review":"Steady Mobbn' is a great duo of rappers. Their cd is really tight.

THIS BOOK is about interpersonal linguistic styles.I found this one a revelation -- little differences in loudness, pause length in conversation, the meaning of \\"polite apology\\" -- make all the difference in understanding people from different cultures, or even from different families in your own culture.This book helped me at work, in travel and at home, and I can't recommend it highly enough.For some reason the two titles are hard to distinguish -- quite a few reviewers seem to be referring to the later book. Again, \\"That's Not What I Meant\\" is NOT primarily about male/female communication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for both genders","review":"I had to read this for my college Sociology class.

Couples, partners and individuals should read this to gain a better understanding of relationships and individuals within conversing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A blueberry muffin with all the blueberrys and no muffin","review":"The basic information in this book is invaluable, but the Author's style resembles that of high school student. The book is written in a classic outline style (I'm going to talk about this now), it's impersonal and has cold examples. Dr. Tannen doesn't seem to give much if any of her own realizations, instead she consistantly refers to other experts. I constantly felt as though I was reading a report written for a social psychology class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tannen proving her point my missing the point","review":"Tannen believes that men comunicate only in a report fassion. 'Only the facts, mame.' Women normally converse in a raport fassion, talking to build relationships. Tannen (a woman) doesn't understand that men build raport by talking the facts. How to overhaul an engine, sports stats, politics, etc. The condenced book form of this book would be a best seller and would go like this, \\"Men and women misunderstand each other all the time. It is worth the work and time to admit this and ask for clarification.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Then why did you say it?","review":"Too often today vested interests present inane theses encouraging support of the subjects that provide their sustenance. The thesis of this book, that individuals should take advantage of metamessage concepts, results in deception. That there is an effect created by tone of voice, language style, speed of speech, etc. etc. cannot be denied. Those interested in communication, however, attempt to eliminate these effects, not take advantage of them. Tannen's information might be put to use to eliminate the dissimulation commonly encountered today, but the more obvious use is to encourage non-verbal misdirection. The most obvious example is our president. I have never seen such sincerity supporting a provable lie. Would that this area of expertise sink without a trace."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to listen","review":"This is my favorite of Tannen's books. It makes some simple but important points about why people have trouble communicating. They talk differently.My favorite comment was about people having different tolerances for pauses after the other person stops talking. For some people it is 10 seconds. For others it was nano-seconds. I wanted to encourage a quiet friend to talk. I found that by counting silently to ten after I finished talking before starting again, made him realize there was a gap to be filled there. An easy trick but I learned a lot from him and Tannen.This is the book to give to friends and relatives, rather than her others that beat the differences between men and women into the ground. Simple but with a sweet and useful message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generally good advice","review":"This book addresses a problem that is common in troubled relationships and offers some very good advice on how to deal with it. The only drawback that I really see is that the book addresses only that one problem in relative isolation, and troubled relationships often suffer from other problems as well. But, so long as you keep its somewhat narrow focus in perspective, and don't fall into the easy trap of believing that solving this one problem will make everything all right, it is a marvelous tool for improving communications in relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reliable","review":"We tried this a couple of times and bought it based on customer review but it didn't work right at all.

Otherwise, don't waste your time. Evolutionary science has advanced dramatically in the last 50 years and has discredited many of the views presented in The Naked Ape. Several are even laughable, such as the explanation of homosexuality in the chapter on sex.Further, while promoted as a zoological study, the presentation is psychological, focusing on behavioral issues and their explanations rather than biological evolution. It is filled with the \\"he-man hunter\\" psychobabel that was preached in 1960's university Psych courses.Simply, this book was a waste of my time and money.

So hip. So chic. So ultra cool. If only more people could experience it! It deserves 10 STARS. Every song (amazing!) is so PERFECTLY arranged, cleverly written, and perfectly performed. Brilliant musicians, singers, compositions, and arrangements. And enough electronic pops & crackles to fill five albums. It is so definitely a guilty pleasure: much too much Pop to qualify as Jazz, but full of jazz overtones and written from a jazz state of mind. Did I mention the ingenious lyrics? And so listenable: I could listen to this for days on end ... and sometimes I do! There are a handful of albums that you can say that about.

The only problem is that the songs, while peppy, sound a little bit too much like one another. A jazzy trombone here, a soulful vocal there -- I'd like to see him develop his sound further, rather than staying in the same groove. Also, some of the lyrics can be less-than-profound. It's fine when it matches the mood of the song, like \\"Something Special,\\" but how does it help \\"On-Line\\" or \\"Jim the Jinn\\"?

I'm a synth pop DJ and very little of this album is Synth Pop. While SPOCK is a wonderfully brilliant band... this album lacks the brilliant lyrics, synths, and pop structure that I like about them. For better songs, check out \\"Alien Worlds\\"(album #2) which is available on Amazon or if you really want an awsome album check out \\"SPOCK 1999\\"(album #4) which you can find on adifferentdrum.com or some other CD importer.

At the end, you wonder how so many people survived as long as they did under such conditions. The story is told from the point of view of a child (which the author was at the time.

Apparently DesMaisons decided to pick up on the weight-loss market and rewrite PnP for losing weight. I felt her style of explaining how I feel now and how I'm going to feel after doing her plan, little more than the common weight-loss testamonials you see in every second-rate diet advertisement. By the way, I have eliminated sugar from my diet and it has not \\"changed my life\\" or solved all my problems.

I also developed Rosacea because of not having adequate HCI to handle overload of protein. I am now supplementing with amino acids, and only need a normal 55 grams of protein, a day.

Thought initially I was hearing T-Bone Burnett's latest with Daniel Lanois producing. I can't wait to dig back into Paul Kelly's earlier catalog. Really quite a lot of talent.

The author says so much about herself that the reader begins to doubt if her \\"new found career\\" is part fact / part fiction. For the novice, I'm sure they go goo-goo over this book. But for anyone who has gambled or flown even once, we should have been told not to spend the money on the book.

Her \\"refinements\\" are outlandish, especially hanging out in airports to get bumped and digging in garbage cans to get coupons. If you are looking for THE book on casino gambling and comps I recommend Frank Scoblete's \\"Guerrilla Gambling. It is loaded with valuable information. Jerry Patterson's new edition of \\"Casino Games\\" is also a very worthwhile book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good info for video poker newcomers.","review":"If you have no background in the wold of video poker and casino comp policies, this book is a decent place to start.

Ms. Hickman presents these observations through a mature, clear, and well-focused eye. The arrangements are rich in complexity yet hummable. Repeated playings yield previously hidden jems of melody and bittersweet irony. Sadly, this is another remarkable artist that you will not hear on the radio (unless you call your local public radio station with a request). Buy the record (or buy two and give one to a good friend)and see her live if she plays anywhere in your time zone. I promise you will be richly rewarded with an unforgettable experience on both counts."},{"rating":"1","title":"not original; laden with typographical errors","review":"Pretty much the title of this review says it all.

Minimal knowledge of aircraft both rotary wing and winged, nearly know knowledge of military ground tactics, equipment, organization or techniques.

However the reader cannot rely on humor, wit etc. which may be found in Bill Bryson style of writing.This is not drama but informative, curious probing and achieves a balance of excitement and enquiry. This is not for the reader looking for entertainment. If you dream or wonder about these extreme places (e.g. coldest, driest, etc) then this book is the next best way to experience these places.

That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think about bleach. Actually it's the second. The first thing that comes to mind is that their lettering for their name is just about exactly the same as the lettering blur uses. They even use a lowercase \\"b\\" on their name like blur. This probably isn't an issue with blur fans (except me) because most of them will never know who bleach is. I could rant about how not cool it is to use another band's (especially one that has been around for so long, such as blur) sort of signature visual. But visuals have little to do with music.This can be very simple: This music is similar to a Good Charlotte meets Rooney type thing, but they maintain a semi-original edge.

I came away with a very enjoyable reading experience, and I will probably read other Miss Marple books in the future.This book is an easy pleasure read. The story is easy enough to follow, and it isn't too long winded.

When I re-read it on my Kindle, I thought it was a much better story than I remembered. There is a lot of humor in it. Miss Marple admits in the book that her habits of snooping on her neighbors, thinking the worst of their behavior, and gossiping about them have made her unpopular in the village.

Because my teen \\"reads\\" were based mostly on what the Bookmobile had \\"in stock\\" at any given time, I'm not sure that I actually did read this one. And I should have! The writing is delightfully wry with biting comments that barely graze the surface adding pithe as well as subtlety--a welcome respite from the in-your-face approach seen in much contemporary writing. Today's teens might even take this leisurely read as a couch-potato approach to SAT prep. Where else could one find such saucy terms as defalcations, shemozzle, and inamorata used correctly and in context? The bigger draw, of course, is the lovely logic and attentions of Miss Marple herself. After all, there really is, \\"No detective in England equal to a spinster lady of uncertain age with plenty of time on her hands.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to Serving in the Restaurant","review":"This book, page after tedious page, serves the writer--whose bio includes that of restaurateur--rarely the reader. The main character's intended strength is forever applied in his words to others, and these statements are more air than action, so that strength comes out as weakness. One gets the feeling the author, through his main character, is telling off everyone who has annoyed him. What little story there is--a drive-by shooting and the family's life that follows--could have been told in a dozen pages. Sorry, but this book is nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fab Five Collection","review":"This was a REAL disappointment. The initial Amazon review gave the impression that I was buying the show since I live overseas and only see recordings from time to time. I was looking forward to seeing all the shows back to back. These DVDs were clips and outtakes from the shows and if I had opened this before leaving the US I would have returned it. For me, it was a big waste of money and the producers of the show should know it. I'll avoid any offering that comes out in the future based on what they turned out this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"love the show--hate the DVDs","review":"This group of DVDs is mostly a collection of themed montages. A clip here, a bite there all around a single individual. You jump quickly from spot to spot. To me, it was like watching hours and hours of an introduction. That said, I live overseas and have limited access to American TV so it was better than nothing. Glad I borrowed it and didn't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"That's entertainment!","review":"I've been a QE fan since the beginning...impatiently waiting for these DVD's. I wasn't disappointed! Just as with the show itself, I giggled, laughed, snorted, guffawed.....and learned some valuable lessons along the way. The Fab 5 are amazing! Snaps to Thom, Ted, Kyan, Carson and Jai. This set of DVD's is an excellent collection of episodes and snippets from season 1. The out-takes alone are worth the price.

The retailer told me to contact Timekeeper for warranty service. I have emailed and called repeatedly over the past 3 months. On the first call it sounded like the problem was going to be resolved. After a couple of weeks, no replacement. I called and again they said it would be taken care of. After that I cannot get anyone to respond to email or the phone.Their clocks are cheap and if they fail, you can just expect to toss them in the trash and find another.

I loved her first full-length film, Loving Annabelle, and I thought that there was no way that Waking Madison could ever be as good. Thank goodness I never checked IMDb before watching this movie because it gives away the entire plot! I was completely taken by surprise by the movie's end. This is a rich, dark film about a life-or-death struggle that is still very human and touching at the same time. Katherine Brooks takes her directorial skills to the edge of glory and beyond."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Compelling Trip","review":"Most films I will only watch once, yet Waking Madison is one I would watch more than a few times, for sure. The journey that this film can take a person on is truly a spellbinding one. When watching films I like to be transported to another reality. I want to be absorbed in the characters, the story and the scenery. I want to be in awe and touched emotionally. Waking Madison gave me all that and then some. The twists and turns of the plot are masterfully captured; they flow beautifully. If you like gritty dramas like 'A Beautiful Mind' or 'Girl, Interrupted' then for sure you should be loving this one. But don't get me wrong, this film is definitely an original! Sarah Roemer was amazingly multifaceted and intense in this role, which she totally owned and rocked! And Frances Conroy, who I loved from her role on Six Feet Under, embodies quite the haunting presence. She was perfectly cast as Madison's mother. The entire cast was great, actually!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind blowing!","review":"Brooks has taken her talent to a whole new level with Waking Madison. As you relive the life of a young girl with multiple personalities, you can personally identify with one (if not each) persona.

More exciting than John Krakauer's \\"Into Thin Air\\" (even I find that hard to believe), more eyewitness accounts than in Sebastian Junger's \\"The Perfect Storm\\" and overall more gripping than Robin Knox Johnson's \\"A World of My Own\\".

If you get the chance I also recommend you watch the documentary on this incredible ordeal. It is on the internet, about an hour and a half long, and really helped me to visualize the descriptions in the book as it has some footage of the actual voyage spliced in with more current footage of the same area.

Lansing is an excellent story teller and has done a tremendous service for the remembrance of these men who fought back and won.Shakleton's leadership and the men's determination to survive and overcome all challenges as one, proves the depths of bonds in the depths of the human heart. It is a study in human character to observe how different men behaved and how Shakleton and the others learnt how to deal with each other yet remain committed to the preservation of each other's life.

Simply amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves more than five stars!","review":"308 reviews and I am adding another? Incredible. Yet I cannot resist. The is an account superlatively well-told of an impossible story which simply bowled me over. I could not stop reading it and read it in less than 24 hours. One's admiration for the super-human feats which Shackleton and his men performed and endured, capped by the events on South Georgia Island, make for a fantastically exciting and memorable read. I doubt I will read as good a book again this year. I can find nothing negative to say about this book and will look if there is anyone who gives this book less than five stars--after I post this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book, Read this book","review":"The author has assembled details from all reliable sources to create a picture of the adventure complete in every detail.It is a great story, if you don't know it, your jaw will drop while reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great reading experience","review":"Why this gets 5 stars1) A subtle, but remarkable thing is that the author has done such a good job with this that he is actually not noticed at all. That is the mark of both exceptional talent, and of exceptional maturity. Lansing is wise enough to know, and mature enough to accept, that this story is so compelling it is best told quietly and calmly. The conditions endured are so extraordinary that a simple recounting of them takes the breath away. Only a very good author would trust his material enough to become essentially invisible.Secondly, what these 28 men endured beggars description. I happened to read it during a 24-inch snow storm which added greatly to the intensity of the experience.This is a compelling and worthwhile read and I recommend it to anyone. I read it in a library book club and am very grateful to my fellow librarian for introducing me to it. It is not something I would ever have picked up on my own."},{"rating":"2","title":"The adventure by which all others are compared","review":"I read \\"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage\\" just before travelling to Antarctica. While it was a great way to kick-off an unforgettable adventure, it was also humbling to realize that Shackleton tackled much worse conditions, without the benefit of modern equipment.

It's a short read (only 276 pages), but is just enough to tell the story with detail. Anyone who can read should read this book; you'll realize how good you have it.

Unbelieveable story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EPIC","review":"I just finished reading this book and I'm just in a state of awe and amazement, and with full respect for these men.

In today's interconnected world of data and voice communications, man is not called on to rely upon his own skills and initiative as were these gentlemen. There ability to maintain hope and patience through all the difficulties they faced makes me wonder if today's adventurers could face such tests with the same kind of spirit. Very inspiring and more dynamic than fiction. I went to a service academy and I wish I had read this in school. This book defines leadership and teamwork."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun to Read.","review":"An incredible story that's impossible to put down. I would highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in real life adventure, exploration, leadership, or the outdoors. My only criticism is that it all ends too abruptly.

I found the story of Shackelton and his men an engaging and awe inspiring piece of literature. I have read Jon Krakauer's novels and although I find Krakauer a more accessible and exciting writer, the story of the Endurance is far more jaw dropping than anything in Krakauer's books.

Extremely inspirational and told in such a matter of fact kind of way, that you are left trying to fully grasp the situation on your own. This may sound like bad writing, but it's actually great writing. There is no way the author could have accurately captured the essence of the situation, so he just tells the story and it's not very hard to fill in the blanks.Just incredible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific","review":"This really is an incredible story.

The author manages to weave the survivor's accounts into a tale so gripping that it will have you feeling cold and hungry right along with the survivors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best single Shackleton book","review":"There's been a seeming flood of books and movies about the 1915-6 Shackleton polar expedition in recent years, but this 1959 account is probably the best and most concisely written. Great pacing, and character development throughout. The agonizing slowness of the disaster, the recovery and the almost two years it took for the crew to escape the Antarctic are nail-bitingly well done. If you only read one book about Shackleton, this should be the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderous Story","review":"I was looking for something different to read and decided on this. The Good: Well written with a good pace. Filled with diary ertries, and very factual information which I found amazing since Shackleton's journey was almost 100 years ago. The Bad: Some nautical terms I was not familiar with. Character development was not strong, but with a story as momentous as this, I understood. I recommend this book even if you do not think you would enjoy it. The 3 books I read prior to this were Robocalypse, The Night Circus, and a Sandy Koufax biography, just to give you an iddea of where I am coming from. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leadership at its very best","review":"This true epic story captured my mind, body, and soul by placing me in the gripping tale the crew and heroic leadership of Shackleton.

Anyone who loves tales of adventure, exploration or courage should read this book. I was so in tune with the crew's plight that I read the book in early March with the windows open, fan running and only lit with guttering oil lamps. Read it and realize man's weakness in the face of nature.

No one can begin to believe how they made it through this ordeal until reading Alfred Lansing's 1959 chronicle. Mr Lansing has written in a very fluid and descriptive manner. He allows readers to feel the sub-zero winds, the icy ocean spray and see the endless expanse of ice. But only for a little bit because you know you really aren't there. And these men endured this for...how many months? You wouldn't believe it; this book simply must be read to appreciate what man can endure when they must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing journey. Incredible leadership portrayal.","review":"I hardly put this book down. I had read small parts of Shakleton's voyage before, but I wasn't ready for the overwhelming content of the expedition and its sense of drama.

Do I seem like one who would care how many seals you killed? The book could have been shortned by a lot if the details were removed. Don't get me wrong some parts of the book did provide for some good supspense, ie would they make it to South Georgia?,but I just didn't enjoy it.Another problem with the book was the point of view the book was written in, Who was the narrator? You could never tell who was talking, and the diary exerpts just simply needed to be removed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"No doubt the voyage was INCREDIBLE, however the author lacked so much discription and ACTION in the writing, that I have not been able to finish the book.

I enjoyed this book immensely, yet was turned off by the off-base foreword and afterword by Dr. James Dobson. It seems he's adapted Lansing's amazing account to suit his own needs, and in the process, edited the content of the story for the \\"Christian\\" audience. I strongly urge that you read this book, but stick to the Lansing paperback rather than the doctored Dobson version. To Dobson's credit, however, the included map is helpful and adds to the reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Cow!","review":"Before reading this book I had no idea who Shackleton was and what he accomplished during this extraordinary journey. With this book, I was treated to a saga of extraordinary courage, optimism and leadership. It doesn't matter who you are and what you do for a living, this is book is a required reading for every human being. It shows you what can be accomplished with optimism and great teamwork and leadership. Now when I begin to run out of steam while running on treadmill, I think of this book and Shackleton and that helps me go much much more distance. Even after a five mile run on the treadmill (which is a big deal for me), I feel so humbled when I think of this book. Very intriguing, adventurous.

Took this book to read on vacation, and finished it by the 2nd day - couldn't put it down. In my opinion, this has got to be one of the greatest stories of survival and determination in modern history, and the author keeps you hooked the entire way through. Details of emotions and struggle become that much more profound when you realize the extensive research that was done in crafting this book.

One star.What I didn't find interesting was Conrad's writing style. His descriptions contained far too many confusing similes, his run-on sentences and three-page paragraphs were tiresome, and his sudden switch from third-person to first-person narration was a bit bewildering. No stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame! Vampire Romance","review":"Ugh. This book was bad. I knew it was going to be bad when the ex-vampire hunter, Regan, is walking toward her car after dark in the park (where vampires roam free) and is afraid. Afraid? I'm sorry, but if a heroine is going to be billed as an ex-vampire hunter, I don't want to read within the first few pages that she's scared to walk to her car alone in the dark. I must admit that I only made it half-way through this book. There was no believable reason for Joaquin to feel so strongly toward Regan. The whole story just seemed flat, underdeveloped, and shallow. And then when the werewolf bite happened and she was all, yeah, let's go to South Dakota on a whim, I was done.I had read another Amanda Ashley vampire romance (historical) and thought it wasn't bad.

Then I was recommended the Helping Hands cream and I hesitated at first, because it is a bit pricey. I walked into a lush store and picked up a small container of it to try and I was hooked instantly.

Tolstoy was a far greater artist than a theoretician of Art. His resentment of Shakespeare is a misreading, and his favoring one particular kind of Art shows him somehow striving to be ' hedgehog ' when he is truly the fox.

A mixed set of mostly black oxide (some bright) UK & Chinese with a few from Japan & USA. Lengths vary erratically. Many bits were shortened from longer ones then resharpened & reblackened. The resharpening was poorly done producing improper point geometries including points not being centered. A drill bit's web thickens along the length which also affects a cut-down bit's resharpening. Several bits had bent ends that would actually wobble the part in the drill press. The company kindly replaced the wobbly ones but bits that are stepped every 0.1mm are bought for precision metal work which would be hard to achieve with this set.

The music of the original recording will make any effort you take to find one of the older vinyls well worth your effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE ITEM FOR THE ON30 MODELER","review":"Shop around this item is available for under $50 on some sites and in the $60-80 range at train shows!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blitz 33700 nozzle for gas can","review":"This nozzle fits and works fine for the older model 11833 5 gallon can.

This book covers the writings of Clement of Rome, Igantius, Polycarp, Justin Martyr, Athenagoras, Diognetius, Ireneaus and the Didache in a author-by-author context introducing the background, authorship, and texts of each writing. The book is introduced with a good but brief overview of 2nd century Christianity and the development of its thought up until that point.The translations are very readable and the footnotes, while sometimes distracting, help to keep the context in mind. For me, however, the introductions to each writing is almost worth as much as the actual translated letters as it provides the whole theme of the letter in concise and simple treatment.

Would his leveraging plan still have worked? I don't know.. Maybe I'll have to read his new book.All in all, it's only 10 dollars. There are a lot of good things he does say.

When I reached the point in the book where the author made his first real estate investment purchase in the summer of 2002 I paused to consider the housing market he succeeded in. With a copyright of 2006, the author must have generated the bulk of his successes between 2002 and late 2005/early 2006 - heady times for the real estate market. His claim that the book will \\"... teach you how to duplicate my achievements...\\" is questionable given the present housing market. If he were starting out today would he have achieved so much so fast?The book is easy to read and I like the way points are summarized at the end of each chapter.

Purchasing several appartment buildings using one secured line of credit off a condo? I don't think so.As mentioned in other reviews, this is not a credible system for puchasing investment/revenue real estate, but rather a story about an individual who either got very, very lucky (of which there are many in real estate) or is padding his jacket.There are many, many better books out there.

First, it only offers HDMI and analog VGA inputs. The adapter for DVI is provided. The speakers are not of high quality and if you are looking for acceptable sound while watching movies you'd better have your own external ones. The monitor displays nice pictures with good brightness and contrast and sharp text. One downside of this monitor is that it has a lot of backlight bleed. It is very noticeable in a dark with a black screen. On the other hand, under normal computer condition using windows its not as bad.

No dead pixels that I can see. Stand is sturdy and monitor seems well constructed. Price! Hard to beat the performance price ratio.

I'm going to use crude, deconstructive criticism. I don't want to do it, but watch this movie and you will totally understand. To sum it up; this movie really, really, really stinks. Carrot Top, atleast once in his life, has turned out better stuff than this piece of trash. What could Beau/Jeff Bridges possibly see in Amy Madigan's character? Hmmmm, lemme see; she has a face like John Denver and a chest that's as flatter than an ironing board. (For more references on the word, \\"ironing board\\", see \\"acting\\" under \\"Bridges,Beau\\" in that rebellious smash hit, \\"Love Child\\".) Among the many sad notes is that this was Rhea Perlman's big shot at an illustrious film career. And even sadder than that, she was the BEST actor in the entire movie. Well to finish up, if you like torturing yourself by watching bad movies, rent \\"Love Child\\". Trust me, it's an utter piece of crap. You'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too cartoony for my tastes.","review":"I suppose this book is good for someone who is new to drawing. Most of the pictures are a little on the cartoony side. It explains basic drawing concepts like perspective, proportions, line width, etc. which is good for the beginner.I'm a seasoned artist and I guess I was hoping for a book with more diagrams and better explanation of the various parts of a chopper for more technical-oriented book. I bought this book on Amazon because it was cheap even though I've never seen the book before. I guess that's my fault."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me the original instead!","review":"I thought this tribute album would be quite nice because the original is the best rap album of all times and the rappers featured here are of the tightest today.That's a nice start for making a great tribute album, I thought. I've never been so disappointed as when I listened to this CD,ever! It fails on every little detail that made Straight Outta Compton so great. Where the original hit you in the face so hard that it left you bleeding this tribute doesn't even tickle your nose.The only track here worth mentioning is Compton's in the House, because that one is performed by MC Ren & Dr. Dre. I guess when you haven't heard the original you'll like this CD, but when you compare with the original....don't waste your money on this album. Go buy the original instead. Rappers doing cover versions of other rapper's tracks... Cover versions is for unoriginal pop singers and worn out rock groups, not rappers that have such skills as the ones featured here."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"This CD is an insult towards N.W.A it doesnt really have any major emcees (with the exception of Big Pun) i strongly reccomend not to buy this CD the only reason i boought it was i was going to buy the original but i was [not able] to tell which one was which and i picked the wrong one up. Sillk the shocker made an obismal effort on the classic track exspress yourself that was really a let down. i strongly advise you not to buy this CD you might as well go out and... listen to some snoop dogg.

Thank you"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tribute????","review":"This Cd Is A big let down to all N.W.A fans. Instead of the orignal songs, the tight beats, and the lyrics that make you run for the hills, this cd is full of new age rap stars that think that because they can rap, they can copy the greastest rap group in history, N.W.A. What the hell is Big Pun is doing on this album? He's latin! What the hell does he know about Compton.THIS ALBUM IS FULL OF RAPPERS WHO DON'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO THE LIKES OF DR.DRE, ICE CUBE, MC REN, AND EASY E.THIS ALBUM ....!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"My students love this puzzle.

He has fun working on it over and over again. The size is perfect because it is similar to him. I like how they labeled the names of the bones on the backside so that he can now learn the names. It comes with a couple of game suggestions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome home Mr. Bones - a member of the family","review":"My 3 1/2 year old daughter saw a skeleton while accompanying me to the Physical Therapist and called him Mr. Bones. She was very interested in the bones and loves puzzles so this seemed perfect.She is too young to appreciate the name of every bone but we make a point of taking each puzzle piece and matching it up to our own body part before connecting to the puzzle. This helps to make a nice game out of it too. It is a lifesize puzzle and has good detail. Like any puzzle, it is pretty sturdy if you don't abuse it. My daughter is a bit rough and Mr. Bones has withstood her abuse.After seeing her interest in the puzzle I picked upThe Skeleton Inside You (Let's-Read-and-Find-Out Science 2). We've just started reading this and with the 2 products she really enjoys seeing the bones and matching them to her body. A fun educational puzzle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for an older child....","review":"I bought two of these, one for a 10 year old and one for an 11 year old. It was too small for them to really handle and play. They played with them for a few days, but it wasn't exactly what they needed for their age and size. They broke easy too. Would be nice for a younger child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Built in amp did not work","review":"I purchased this guitar for my 7 year old daughter. When I received the guitar the built in amp did not work. The power light came on as normal but it had no sound at all. This guitar does come with an amp cable though and does have the hook up port for an amp, so I went and bought an amp for it, and it worked great with the amp I bought. This guitar is a real electric guitar for beginners. It's not just a toy. It is ideal size for a small child. Just don't have high expectations on the built in amp working!!! If the amp had worked I would have given this item a 5 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, spare the platitudes Karla","review":"I recently heard Clarkes Essential Mix on Radio One, which spurred the purchase of this album. I must say, Merriam-Websters description of Devil's Advocate is most adequate--\\"it draws liquid into the mouth!\\" Those who enjoy this compellation might also enjoy Moby's \\"\\"Early Underground\\"\\", which is most likely the reason he surfaced into main stream music, rather than waisting his time falling short of a truely mellifluous underground sound. I'm not insinuating Clarke is inept in this genre of music, for his style is most unique and demands reverence of even the most fickle dance enthusiasts, I'm only stateing my opinion of this production. All-in-all I do not recommend this to listeners, or even lovers, of techo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apt Subtitle...boring as a Filibuster","review":"I purchased this for use in my American Gov't class.

She was looking for something to teach her teen girls class and has found some very good ideas in the pages of this book.

It may say, Becoming a Woman...who listens to God - but we men could use some of these points to get close to HIM as well! Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Agree with PROCEED W/CAUTION","review":"I must strongly agree with this last person's review. I also found that she talks about things from the Bible out of context. For example, she talks about Aquila & Priscilla teaching Apollos about Jesus. This author gives credit only to Priscilla (pg. 86) & not Aquila. If you look at Acts 18:26 it clearly states that Aquila & Priscilla (BOTH OF THEM) took Apollos into their home to teach them about Jesus. I have to agree that this author does not have a firm understanding of the Bible & its teachings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fingerlickingly Good","review":"This CD shows clearly what Michael Lee Firkins is made of, which is an exceptionally gifted guitar player with a fabulous fingertechnique. Furthermore, he also shows that he is able to play an amazing variety of styles of music. He knows how to write songs that will leave you breathless after first time listening and will keep on lingering in your brain forever. A must for anyone who likes guitar music. By the way, this CD is totally free of long winding, egotripping guitar solos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Lachey has found his own voice","review":"I LOVE THIS ALBUM! By reaching deep into himself, Nick has found his own voice. This album is strong and his vocal quality is superb. I believe his heart is really in every song and the musicality of it is terrific. I especially love the simplicity of Resolution. Bravo Nick!I always enjoyed him in 98 degrees but did not feel Soul-O was really reflective of Nick - it felt more like what the label wanted him to sing. I am so glad he has been able to have a second chance. Congratulations on a wonderful album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but a downer....","review":"I really like Nick Lachey's voice so I bought this CD. He still has a good voice and I like most of the songs, but really a whole album about his split with Jessica? A few upbeat, lighter songs to mix it up would've made it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is zero stars an option","review":"I have a lingering suspicion that most of the five star reviews for this catastrophe of an album are being written by his record company executives who are desperately trying to boost the overall rating.Are the five star reviewers on crystal meth?,it looks like it.Anyway this album is really,really bad,so please avoid it.Thanks for reading my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is as bad as SoulO","review":"I really cant think of any worse sounding cd than this one.Nick Lachey is very annoying and just cant sing.This album is awful,disgusting,vapid,soulless,pungent,repulsive and sick.This is as bad as any Backstreet boys album.Give this a miss and purchase the latest album from The Vines which is miles better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh GET OVER IT!","review":"Jeez, I almost vomited when I heard that he was coming out with another CD. He has some of the worst vocals I have ever heard, and plus he needs to get over the fact that he split up with Jessica. What's Left of him? NOTHING.And sorry for making my review so short, this is all I can say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is the Divorce a Publicity Stunt?","review":"No, probably not, but it sure makes you wonder. Nick was always in the shadow of his wife. His first solo album flopped miserably. So now, after she dumps him, he releases this. \\"Oh, I'm Nick Lachey. Nothing's left of me cuz my more popular wife left me. All of you fifteen year old girls should pity me and buy my album cuz I look so sad on the front.\\" Gimme a break. Does Nick have a good voice? Yes. But he is sickening and using his divorce to get a high profile....yet again, he is still using his wife. He'll probably thank her for divorcing him after this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justin Timberwho???","review":"Congratulations Nick!!! I know this came from your heart and soul ... and if you should happen to find success along the way of this new journey you're on ... that's okay too. New doesn't mean bad .. it means new. And as for your resolution ... Resolve to continue to be the best Nick Lachey the world has ever seen. Continue to love, laugh and cry and never let anyone make you feel that you don't deserve what you want. Only you knew what was in your heart ... and now so do we. BRAVO!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick finally delivers!","review":"Wow...what an incredible album. I just can't believe how good it is. Every song is beautifully crafted and it all came together so well. I really enjoyed the first single and the more rockish songs are great aswell and it really suits his voice! Congratulations Nick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Album! Four and a Half Stars!","review":"Only reason I gave it 4 and a half stars is that all the songs sound somewhat the same...but I really like the formula Nick's using, which is the current teen pop-rock style employed by the producers of Lindsey Lohan, Kelly Clarkston, and Avril Lavagne. Here's to hoping this and future career milestones help establish his name outside of simply being Mr. Jessica Simpson, ex-newlywed cable TV star. Who knows? Perhaps Nick Lachey might outlast his 15 minutes of fame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked His \\"Soulo\\" CD Better.","review":"His 1st CD was so much better, this is all ballads and he seems angry, maybe about his divorce, I enjoy his upbeat CD a lot more.

Nothing of Quality","review":"Anyone with cable could watch Nick Lachey and then wife Jessica Simpson as they started their life together on the MTV reality show Newlyweds. Then anyone with a US Magazine or an internet connection could read about it falling apart. And then could see the couple participate in a \\"who can hook up the most people\\" contest. Nick definitely won if you are counting in terms quantity (quality can be debated though). But if his album, What's Left of Me was any indication, he still wasn't quite over his reality show co-star. I did give it a listen when it was released and marveled at how sad the dude was. Every song was about how he couldn't go on and they all just sounded the same blending into one uber-long excruciatingly long song."},{"rating":"1","title":"WE GET THE POINT ALREADY!","review":"we get it nick. you and jessica broke up. doesnt mean you need a whole album about the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whta's the big deal !","review":"OK I kinda do feel sorry for Nick for marrying that spiled little blond bimbo. But at the same time it doesn't justify the lack of real depth on this album. Yes it has soulfull lyrics about brea ups and all that mushy stuff. But let's be honest , cheesy love songs like these we hear before. All the producers of N'SYNC, Backstret Boys, and countless other teenage pop music producers spit dozens of these in a week.It is simply the same old tired stuff. Nice mellodies to listen to but really not much besides that."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"What's Left of Me\\"--Not much...","review":"...after the divorce, nonexistent career and has-been, done-fad status. But still Nick keeps trying. I guess I can admire him for that. (pause) Mmm, actually, no, his music sucks, so I can't admire him. I COULD admire him if he started learning an instrument and actually tried to make music that doesn't cause auditory cancer, but that won't ever happen.His former band had, what, two, three studio albums that came out? Gee, I wonder why they had so few and broke up so soon.... Probably because they realized the market/fad for boybands faded out? Yeah, seems likely.Well, it goes without saying this is nothing but MTV garbage to appeal to the lowest of the masses. If you're looking for a good solo artist get Yngwie Malmsteen. Yngwie's a real musican. Nick Lachey is a wannabe singer who's more suited to be a model/fluffer."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICKS BACK HOTTER THEN EVER !!!!!!!!!!!","review":"FIRST OF ALL FOR ALL YOU HATERS OUT THERE THAT THINKS NICK WOULD BE NO WHERE WITH OUT JESSICA SIMPSON IS NOT TRUE !!

Nick Lachey has Arrived!","review":"This would normally not have been a purchase I would make, but for whatever reason I decided to go ahead and give it a try because it wasn't that expensive. I am so happy that I did. He has been able to step out of the shadow of his ex and has shown he is a star in his own right.This album has a lot edgier of a sound than his failed previous attempt and completely leaves behind the sound of his boy-band days. It's an excellent collection of music. My husband, not realizing it was Nick Lachey, asked me who I was playing because he wanted to put it on the iPod. He was competley shocked when I told him.I've really enjoyed listening to \\"What's Left Of Me\\", \\"I Can't Hate You Anymore\\", \\"Shades Of Blue\\", and \\"I Do It For You\\". The other songs are also really great, but the ones I listed above are my favorites for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good CD!","review":"I really like Nick Lachey's voice and love his personality as well.

Well think again. It's just 1998 all over again, except this time even worse. Mr. Jessica Simpson decided that to to sell his album, he needed to sell out Jessica and make an entire album about their relationship.Better luck next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"In your face Jessica Simpson","review":"Nick Lachey is better then his ex-wife now cause his solo ablum sounds so amazing. It i sad to see that it's takes a break up in order for him to make his own cd cause if they were still married Nick wouldn't have this big success.

While this documentary is far from perfect, it will get you thinking about how and why things have changed for the worse for so many people in America and why even those WITH insurance have problems getting reimbursed by their health insurance companies, have to fill out reams of paperwork again and again and get denied coverage for care that is critical for their survival, not \\"experimental\\" procedure, but good, decent care.

This certainly isn't his best CD, but it is still a solid outing by a fantastic guitarist. Also of note is the bassist, Tony Franklin, who plays a pretty killer fretless bass. This gives a somewhat warmer feeling to these songs than Tony's earlier work, and the new, sharper sound is welcome.His first couple were the best (Edge of Insanity, Maximum Security); Evolution is also excellent.

I like how it covers up the Micro SD slot on the side of the Sandisk E280 MP3 player.I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a cover for your MP3 player and don't want to be tied down to one method of attaching it to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Quality!!!","review":"Horrible QualityAll told, I paid 25 bucks for what seems to worth 25 cents at best. It doesn't fit properly, it leaves glue residue on my Sansa and the \\"hole\\" to turn the thumbwheel is way off center, rendering it almost useless! Really bad product! I think blind folded pigmies with their hands tied around their backs made these. Do not buy this overpriced piece of garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the runner","review":"After finding a gazzilion different armbands on amazon I am unhappy that I bought this arm band in the store. The case makes it hard to operate the buttons. The wheel slips around in the case. The design is silly. The velcro closes on the bottom where you insert your player into the case so if it opens you are screwed. The armband is horrible. You need to use the belt clip to attatch it tot he band. It's flops around when running and sticks out to far. I am hoping the next band I orders is better and more of a lower profile. Hopefully the customer reviews were right."},{"rating":"2","title":"DLO Action Cover For SanDisk Sansa e260.","review":"This is a combo Arm/Belt pseudo leather jacket/case for my Sandisk e260. I really have not tried the arm attachment yet. The belt option works so well I use it instead. I find no problem adjusting the controls with my e260 in the jacket. When I am at the gym running, weight lifting, even on the mat doing my abs excercises, the jacket stays put. Very good alligator clamp. Besides giving a secure non-slip clamp on my workout shorts, slacks belt, speedo swim suit, & the same for my boxers & briefs. As you can see the e260 and the DLO case follow me everywhere. I hardly remove the e260 from the case. There is no need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, serves its purpose, but a little pricey.","review":"I purchased this action jacket as an accessory to go with my new Sansa e200 mp3 player. I bought the mp3 player mainly to take with me when I go walking, so I thought the action jacket would be perfect. It is really nice for when you go walking or running, because it's adjustable for your arm and it leaves you free to swing your arms without the earphone cord getting in the way. The jacket, however, is a little snug and I have trouble getting it out. It definitely serves its purpose, but I thought it was a little expensive. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for action, disappointing","review":"This case does not work well for running or other vigorous activity. Case attaches to armband with belt clip, the result is high profile and unstable and looks way un-cool overall. Maybe not bad to use with the belt clip while walking. Adds a lot of bulk to what is already a bulky player. Note that case does not look like the main photo on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Snoozer","review":"I order this one because I like model railroads. I still like model railroads but this video was a wasted 20 minutes of my life. It has little to recommend it.Basically, it is just a series of shots of the large scale (G Scale) electric train layout from the Living Desert in California. There is no narration. There are just views of the toylike trains going about their rounds.Some of the model structure are impressive, particularly the double track wooden trestle, but it was not interesting enough to keep my attention. Only in the last minute is there any voiceover to overcome the \\"soundtrack\\" but even that is just an invitation to visit the park.As advertising for the park, this is singularly ineffective. As entertainment it is even less so and I love trains.Save your money and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"AutoCAD 2002 Complete","review":"I thought book will throw some light on new features of AutoCAD 2002. But, it contains few randomnly selected articles for AutoCAD 2000. If you have some previous publications for AutoCAD 2000 from Sybex, you need not buy this book. Because, this book speeks more about AutoCAD 2000 and speeks very less about new features of AutoCAD 2002."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outside of Prydain, but still great","review":"The Castle of Llyr mostly has events occuring on the island of Mona, not Prydain. This book has a different feel than the previous two. It deals with Eilonwy leaving Prydain to \\"act like a lady\\". Knowing her from the other books, she'd rather be doing what the guys are doing. Also Taran becomes aware of his feelings for her. Although they're usually arguing, I could see this sort of thing coming from a long way off. The main surprise is how someone(I'm not saying who)wants revenge and wants to exploit the unknown magical powers of Eilonwy to rule Prydain. The book, while simple like the others, gives great detail of how Mona is supposed to look like, and the actions of the heroes are easy to imagine. In this third book of the Prydain Chronicles, the main issues with Taran are jealousy and wanting what he seemingly can't have. If you read the first two Prydain books, this one won't be a disapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love The Castle of Llyr!!!","review":"The best book of the five!

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book in the series","review":"I thought that \\"The Castle of Llyr\\" was the best book in the series. I enjoyed the interesting and exciting adventure with Taran, Fflewddur, Gurgi, and Prince Rhun to rescue the Princess Eilonwy from Achren. The book was very catchy, and it went the fastest. I also liked the ending of the book, but I won't give it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER LLOYD ALEXANDER MASTERPIECE","review":"This is an EXCELLENT book! All of the Prydain books are for all ages. This was the first (and not the last) of the Prydain series that I read as a kid.

Finding these books in my school library, I read the first one over winter break. I couldn't wait for the break to be over so I could get the sequels. This book turned out to be my favortite out of all five, though The High King was a close rival. The enchanting story about how Princess Eilonwy goes to Mona with Taran and Gurgi is facinating. All of the characters are unique in there own way, no matter how odd the character is. I love the character Prince Rhun. He is really funny. The ending of this book surprised me. I thought that Eilonwy would come willingly, happy to be rescued, but the ending is far from that. It is truly a worthy sequel to the first two books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Castle of Llyr (The Chronicles of Prydain)","review":"This particular installment is a little darker than previous Alexander books I thought. I liked the story line development and characters, as i have read this now at the age of 12 and 40.

It makes you stand back a minute and think of how your child might percieve our parental actions. Often it is hard for an adult to see through the eyes of a child. This helps a bit. It is not something that you need to strictly adhere to, they are ideas that you may try to incorporate into your style of parenting. Whether you are going the Waldorf route or not, I think many parents can gather insight about parenting from this...(A side note to the tub cleaning reviewer - try biodegradable cleaning products or give your son a bucket full of soapy water and a sponge, or a spray bottle filled with plain water, he doesn't need to know that he doesn't have the same cleaning solution that you do...it's the fact that he wants to clean with you...someday he won't want to do all these things with you...and you'll fondly look back on the times that he did - that we all need to remember.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"This is a good book. Slow, but thought provoking. The footnotes and endnotes are big help and enrich the experience. Interesting info at the beginning and end of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very readable and insightful philisophy","review":"Dostoyevksy has the ability to wrap plot around philosphy as few authors can. The Brothers Karamazov is more philosophy than plot, more ideas than action. Anyone who thinks that he or she is a stubborn, immovable atheist should read this book. It shows the imperfectness of humanity and the search for a life with meaning which is one of the most important foundations of religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great novel, the Signet edition is unreadble however","review":"Ironic that a novel by a writer who despised penny pinching and greed would have his novel published in such a way that to make a few more bucks the publisher makes the book literally painful to read.The text is simply too crammed on the page, following lines of text is awkward and the lack of spacing simply makes the book painful to read.Theres other editions of the book that are cheaper and properly spaced. What a disappointment this edition is. Shame on Signet for this ridculousness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overrated","review":"Rather overrated book. I wouldn't recommend it unless you are particularly interested in Russian history or the Eastern Orthodox church. This book should had at least 100 pages edited out of the end, as it slowly and tediously summarizes the plot up until that point. That said, the book does have its merits. It contains some very memorable scenes described in excellent detail by Mr. Dos. Also, despite its long size, it is a rather easy read, because the language is quite straight forward, the philosophy is rather simple, and the plot progresses at a casual rate. It also has some very exciting moments and keeps the reader engaged most of the time, with only a few very boring sections. It's a good book, I just don't feel that deserves to be acknowledged as one the greatest books of all time as it so often is."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brothers Kuramapoo","review":"The book can be held by two hands but the paper can get wet so be careful if you sweat profusely. Dostoevsky was a great Bulgarian writer, unfortunately, The Brothers Karamazov is not included in that canon. The Brothers Karamazov is about an old woman who hatches a plot to kill a young student. I couldn't finish it because the translation from Romanian was so bad that I had to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A master-piece but you need time to go through it!","review":"The Brothers Karamazov is with no doubt the most accomplished of Dostoyevski works, rich of both fiction and philosophical reflexions.

There many many errors and typos throughout this book. They are (perhaps fortunately?) concentrated in the first half with a very frustrating section about 10% through which is barely intelligible for all the formatting and typographical issues. I read the full book before posting this review so it is ultimately readable if annoying. Unless price is the major factor, I would consider another edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite book, okay translation","review":"\\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" is easily at the top of my favorite-books-of-all-time list.

One grows very fond of sweet, compassionate Alyosha, crazed, heartbroken Dmitri, and cynical, intellectual Ivan, despite all of their flaws. This book is not exciting or engaging in the modern sense. No car chases or gun fights, but it is a very revealing novel that will leave you feeling inspired, broken, and everything in between. I wish I could adequitely find the words to describe how important this work is, although it does start rather slowly. By the way, I'm not a 40 year old uptight russian scholar. I'm a twenty year old punk rocker in a small town. Dostoevsky is just that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formatting renders it virtually unreadable","review":"My first Kindle book was Anna Karenina, and it was terrific.

It has great scenes and lines, beginning with the smack in the mouth Kirk receives from Kang, to the ending scene of Kirk, Kang, and company all making merry to drive out an evil alien that thrives on hate.Special FX were also quite good for the day, and this episode features a Klingon Battle Cruiser getting blown to bits by the Enterprise (the only episode showing this).

Where shoe hits the ankle is stiff and digs into the ankle when the foot is flexed. Because the lacing is off to one side, there is no tongue like a typical laced shoe. So you can't fold back the rigid piece that hits the ankle. If not for the shipping cost (7.99 to ship and 5.99 to return) and that fact that my growing son will out grow these before the next indoor soccer season, I would definitely return. I will never buy a shoe online again unless all shipping costs are covered by the return policy or I have tried the shoe at a brick & mortar store first. This is not a bargain at $29.99.

This may be of interest to students of Mexican film, and those interested in the development of the official ideology they seem to have of \\"indigenous Mexican stuff is good\\", or whatever it is, but it really ain't a very gripping film, and in technical terms, it comes across as quite old and primitive. Don't expect \\"The Gold Rush\\" or \\"Grand Illusion\\", either, which continue to be enthralling films despite being presented in flickering black and white with static camera work.The female lead, Dolores del Rio, who plays the virtuous, suffering \\"india\\", is as white as they come, which, I suppose, might be regarded as amusing in so far as the wicked shopkeeper, who keeps calling her a dirty no-good indian, is a Mestizo.Doubtless I missed some subtleties given the absence of subtitles, and it's probably a better film if you can get all of those. But in generall I recommend this only for Mexican patriots or serious students of film."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN ALMOST UNWATCHABLE DVD VERSION","review":"I've been eager to acquire this film on DVD because it's one of the masterpieces of the golden age of Mexican cinema, with outstanding cinematography and a marvelous, romantic story; however, after purchasing it, I was very disappointed with the overall technical quality of this particular DVD version, but that's just my opinion as a consumer who prefers more pristine versions of great motion pictures. This movie won the Grand Prix in Cannes in 1946! It deserves a much, much better edition on DVD.

To put it simple: It's one of the best of all-times! Brilliant in any aspects - the direction by Emilio Fernández, the black and white photo by Gabriel Figueroa, the score by Francisco Dominguez and not least the great acting by Dolores del Rio and Pedro Armendáriz. It's absolutely something for lovers of Classic Movies. I think this is the top peak of the career of Emilio Fernández, even if he made other unforgettable films like \\"Enamorada\\", \\"La Perla\\" and \\"Flor Silvestre\\".

That means more ballads about notable events and people in Irish history, all from the slant of a devoted anti-British republican. Warfield has a decent voice and his passion comes through in every note. True, he sometimes comes off like a one-trick pony, incapable of throwing a fun party song into the mix (the way the Wolfe Tones usually did on every album). But don't let that discourage you.

My top two favorite ones are \\"Pobre Juan\\" and \\"Mariposa Traicionera\\". I do not necessarily agree with all of their viewpoints, I think they've made a genuine attempt at opening some eyes and getting people to talk about issues that are still a major problem in Latin America; however, Maná is a sign of the good things happening in my beautiful México. ¡Viva Maná!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lo Mejor","review":"Mana always comin up with new songs, this time they are sure to make you cry with their songs in a good way"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tremenda Decepcion!!!","review":"I am an incredibly big fan of Mana.

Instead, with songs like Fe, Sin Tu Cariño, and ¿Por Qué Te Vas?, one might wonder if Fher's niece was behind all the writing, it's child's play. Musically, Mana's songs lack innovation. They still think that playing the same notes over and over makes a hit. Best song however: Sabanas Frias, guest-starring Ruben Blades, who was also the writer for the best song in Mana's MTV Unplugged, Desapariciones (hmmm...I see a pattern).

EN fin, pero si te metiste a checar por esta musica es que de plano oye pura caca..... NO COMPRES ESTE DISCO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive, pointless...","review":"Mana recorded 2-3 very good albums in their beginnings and thereafter they have continued to rip the glory out of those first great works. Nothing really innovative has come out of them in their most recent productions. \\"Revolucion de Amor\\" confirms that, plus adds the fact that Fher's voice is no longer what it used to be (or at least doesn't sound as well as before). Not even the presence of some of music's most respected figures, such as Santana and Ruben Blades, save this album from sounding like \\"good ole\\" Mana, with nothing new to bring to the table. Sorry, Mana fans: you know this is true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mana #1","review":"Well there's a lot to say about this great Album. Mana is the best Rock Bands nown here. This Album has great songs. It also have Romantic Ones. Este cd es lo maximo.

As a musician I have always loved them, they are amazing. This cd is different because it forces you to listen to what is said. For those who think they dont grow you dont know much. Its very easy to change your style and make it seem like you grew though you never did. Mana is a band that grows within their style which is very hard. This is a different cd from the others regardless of what others think. Buy this and you will appreciate great talent and musical content. Mana is Mana and that is what makes them great. If you are jealous because your fav band is not so big it is probably because they suck. So stop writing hateful reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ...","review":"A very disappointing and souless effort by Maná. As soon as you hear the opening track with Santana, \\"Justicia, Tierra Y Libertad\\" you know right off bat that this is not the sharpest they've been. The 5 year lay-off might have indeed hurt them more than expected, as they probably should have written a new follow-up album to \\"Sueños Liquidos\\" as soon as possible while they were on a roll. Everything on this album is so predictable and deriritive of their past albums it's not even worth buying. Unfortunately, they have struck out under the pressure of coming up with a follow-up to their last album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ya cambienle, ¿no?","review":"Mana va que vuela hacia el decline. Nada de su musica despues de \\"sueños liquidos\\" me hace \\"tilin\\" a los oidos. El album viejisimo en donde sale la cancion \\"buscandola\\", buenisima, y \\"rayando el sol\\" son clasicas, pero despues de eso, la voz del vocalista harta, la musica es la misma, y la verdad es que todas sus canciones caen en la misma tonada que cansa. Me encantaria que este grupo evolucionara su musica o de plano se desintegrara. El album \\"revolucion de amor\\" no tiene nada de re-evolucion. Creo que se les subieron los humos al tener tanto exito con sus primeros albumes que se confiaron (ellos mismos declararon que eran el mejor grupo de rock en español y que otros \\"tratan\\" de igualarlos sin exito) y ya no se esforzaron para mejorar su musica."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Years is to long a wait","review":"After five years Mana returns with an un-inspired album that lacks focus. I am a die hard Mana fan but after listening to this album I was fairly disapointed I only liked 4 of the 11 songs. You can actually hear Fhers voice breaking down...and Alex should stick to drumming. Best songs on the album are Mariposa de Amor, Pobre de Juan , and Sabanas Frias..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Their Best","review":"I've been a long time Mana fan and I always pick up their new music. Ever since album's like \\"Falta Amor\\" and \\"Donde Jugaran Los Ninos\\" Mana has been running rock en espanol. It's too bad that this album isn't as good as past ones. Although it does have a few good songs, it doesn't seem to have the energy that past records have had. \\"Justicia, Tierra, y Libertad\\" is probably my favorite, mainly because of energy. When I saw them live in Santa Barbara,CA and in New York City they rocked the house and there wasn't a dull moment for the entire set. When ten year old songs like \\"Oye Mi Amor\\" are played at Latino clubs people still go crazy. But this album makes me want to go to sleep. There is definitely some musically interesting stuff, but I'm sorry, I want some energy, some rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"My two-year old loves this book!

The only issue i had was the book has a lot of characters, i found myself writing down each new character that i can across, there title, and if the died how they died. Most probably wont do that but it really helped me keep up with the characters of the novel. I like how most of the characters life decisions would affect another characters life further in the book, if you don't follow along, you can easily get lost.

All are made up of stereotypes, promoting such yowlers as 'all Whites think this way, vs. all indigenous people think that way...'; drawn-out complaints without substantiation, such as 'all non-native professors use gatekeeping to keep out indigenous scholars', and the like.The book is for truly hateful, bigoted people who wish to foster an environment of fear in the academy and for those interested in engaging in senseless, time-wasting, essentialist arguments.Save your money and time and work for justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wooooh","review":"This is the sound I get with my Beemer now and it's just incredible.

The book is well organized, not as a barrage of information, but as a series of well developed stories that have a common thread. Corporate globalization is presented as the race to the bottom by which capital moves freely to wherever cost is lowest, leading to investment where environmental standards are the most lax and exploitation the most severe.

O is the only one good song in the entire CD so DONT waste your money !!! albums like this one is exactly what makes people get bootleg copies, at least you dont waste an entire 15 to $20 dls on such garbage! well what else can I say REAL R&B is really hard to find these days, what ever happened ? I remember back when we had 112, Joe, R-kelly, Keith Sweat, Avant, Bryan Mcnight etc. etc. Well the search to find good enough quality r&b material will continue for me but my advice to those who like Good music and are even contemplating getting this one here is just hold off cause im sure you can find something much better than this EVEN now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is Heat","review":"From the first time i heard the cd i was excited. You can really tell that Omarion has grown up to be a grown a$$ man. The things he is talking about on this cd are way more intense and mature than what he was singing about with B2K.

Cop This Disc!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Cd","review":"When I first heard this cd on the Leak, I thought it was completely mediocre, but after giving it a second listen I see that its straight fire! Every song is hot! My fav. tracks are I Wish, I'm Tryna, Growing Pains & of course, Take It Off! Mila J killed that verse! The only song I'm not really feeling is Drop That Heater, because its nothing compared to Take It Off, even though both are really great tracks.

I think that will probably work against him here on this CD.With the whole B2K thing aside it is an \\"ok\\" CD. Nothing spectacualar on here to speak of. Filled with slow jams about love and trying to get a girl or get some booty. Kind of something that seems to be WAY too repetitive for newly solo R&B; artists (male) these days. It's not a stand out style by any means. I was hoping for a little more upbeat/clubbin' tracks but, again, mostly all slow jams. They are mediocre at best. He has a decent voice but nothing to pine over. I think this is a CD geared more towards the ladies.The 2 tracks that I feel standout here are: \\"O\\" and the club bumper: \\"Drop That Heater\\"Other than that it does not have too much originality to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Usher Lite-Lite better call B2k back up","review":"Omarion is a good dancer&that is the best thing I can say about Him as a Artist. while He was with B2k the other cats covered up his limited vocal range. he gets over on Mid tempo to soem bouncing tracks,but to make this cat have to sing solo is asking too much. I feel Usher is overrated,but He got a Pass because of some catchy songs here&there. but what got Him over don't work for everybody&most of the time what Usher does doesn't do much for me beyond the Entertaining element. Cats not working on there Craft&settling for Fast food material&also Chop Singing&well too rehearsed material that needs more cook than what they are passing off as Steam.

Then again....maybe you dont."},{"rating":"2","title":"O's First Solo Album","review":"I've check out the album and it's pretty good. The best songs in my opinion are Touch, I Know, and Growing Pains. Touch is a track that's produced by the Neptunes, and I Know is a song that says even though you might love another man, you know you want me too! Growing Pains is a song that is for B2K, he talks about what they went through. Now you know O is a good track but that is the lead single, also Never Gonna Let You Go(She's A Keepa) feat. Big Boi is a good track too! But in my opinion the next single should be Touch then the third single should be I Know. So go buy the album, it's pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it was","review":"I did not like the album at all.

He can sing, as well as dance. But singing he cant do well on his own. Understandable that they (B2K) arent little boys anymore. They wanted to do there own things (solo) but they should've stayed together and supported each other. Him (Ormarion) by himself sucks. Sorry to say... And I heard and saw the video to his new CD, the single is called \\"Icebox\\". Video, and the song is stupid.

I loved it. If it's possible that the phrase 'heart-warming' can be used too much, this movie presses the boundary! If ever you need a good cry, and I'm RARELY eager to accept such an invitation, I recommend it. But rest assured that you'll smile boat loads before the cry comes, and you will end the movie with a smile on your face, and heart.The ONLY reason I give this movie 4 stars , instead of 5, is that it's a little irritating that the homeless people are so cheerful. From our first encounters with them, most are almost euphorically merry; which is a bit improbable. However, this is a Larry Levinson film, which are meant to raise the spirit and leave you with a feeling of well-being, and this movie does accomplish that.

The truth is that too much of the content focuses on sexual abuse. There's paragraph after paragraph about various folks being abused.

It is plainly evident that the author cares about her readers, which must surely be a great comfort to those who are struggling and suffering.While I'm not certain the objective of losing weight by facing one's demons can be universally realized here, the book does provide a useful service in that the reader can come away feeling uplifted and comforted. I know I was. Having suffered ongoing abuse as a child, I became a pleaser and a perfectionist in an effort to stop said abuse - to no avail. The author's statement that even had I been the perfect child, the behavior of the abuser would not have changed was of considerable comfort to me.Whether the reader achieves the goal of losing weight or not, the book is still worth taking the time to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"I started into this book and could already see a change in me.

If you're an adult, well, just take some more crochet classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Run-of-the-Mill Story","review":"This book will appeal to anyone interested in Hollywood filmmaking during the 1950's, and to anyone fascinated by how life experience causes personality to evolve. This is not a run-of-the-mill story of adulterous passion, but an honest exploration of human cowardice, courage, and longing.Like butterflies struggling to escape the chrysalis, the lovers Celia and Ben seek to shed the confinement of their respective pasts and create a future together. For Celia, this is her all-too-proper middle-class religious background. For Ben, it is that dark moment when, fearful that he would never again get the chance to make a great film, he testified against his comrades before the McCarthy committee.The novel charts their personal growth in lively dialogue. Sundry interesting characters wander in and out of the story, which is set in interesting locales such as the South Seas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"There are good songs on this album, however, I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the CD. Makem's voice doesn't ring true compared to other albums. It seems somewhat muffled and the tone is not clear. If not for that, I would have rated it much higher."},{"rating":"1","title":"One man's vibrant is another man's quavering","review":"Tommy Makem is an institution in Irish folk music. He has been playing banjo and singing for many many many years. His early work (1955-1962) with the Clancy Brothers is a delight. Heck, I enjoyed his 1997 memoir/travelogue, \\"Tommy Makem's Secret Ireland\\". His book, along with a stellar review, convinced me to buy this album.Well, the music is beautifully arranged, and the instrumentals show real musicianship throughout. However, I'm no fan of vibrato, and frankly, the artist's voice seems so weak. It quavers in every single song. Maybe this is intentional, maybe not. Bottom line: Makem sounds like he's in his early 80s.Now that I've opened the jewel box, I can't return it to Amazon.com so I'll have to see what I can get for it at the used CD store. Please please please don't buy this album - Makem is a wonderful musician and has many other releases which must sound better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hosebeast riding on the coattails of his ex-wife's rising star!","review":"Triple H: Poor Nick Lacky!

That a man enjoined, as one of the authors was, from digging in Bob Dylan's garbage be considered a serious researcher, much less a target of guffaws, is beyond the limits of my ratiocination. The thesis here is simple: America is evil, led by such right-wing extremists as lead the Brookings Institution (a big surprise to not only them, but also conservatives), and Mr. Kennedy was removed to remove from a path the sane know he himself supported.

David Cronenberg is a director that dares to take risks, but in this movie the interesting concept is wasted by the average and not too surprising or engaging execution. Jeremy Irons is indeed excellent as the two twins and manages to perform two very distinct individuals with similar looks, yet \\"Dead Ringers\\" is slow paced, somewhat predictable and runs out of steam by the middle, culminating in an unsatisfying ending. This just seems like underdeveloped material with a couple of good moments. It\`s also a too dry and cold movie, which makes for a somewhat distant cinematic experience, despite the solid acting, directing and score. Still a mildly interesting effort nonetheless, but not a very compelling or memmorable one.Worth a look yet far from a must-see."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an incredibly depressing movie.","review":"If you want to feel like dirt, watch this movie.

Unless you REALLY go for semi-erotic thrillers, skip this unless you really want to see how NOT to make a movie. Had Jeremy Irons skipped this movie, he probably would have become one of the leading actors of the early 90s. I remember going to see this movie simply because it seemed like his career was on the upswing and some friends I ran into recommended we go see it instead of the cheesy comedy we were going to see. What a waste. Some people on internet boards seem to like it, but most everyone I've ever talked to face to face that has seen this has hated it. This is one of those times I wish Amazon had a negative star rating system. AVOID AVOID AVOID."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfully creepy","review":"Although a little slow at times, this film never once ceases to fill the viewer with a vague sense of unease. The co-dependency of Elliot and Beverly is made frighteningly real by the surrealististic overtones injected into the mundanity.The cinematography and set design complement each other wonderfully, with gloomy, unreal overtones occasionally shot through with brilliant shafts of light.This is a wonderful use of a night. I wouldn't claim it to be Iron's best work, but it does rank up there. It is certainly more captivating than *Damage*, but not as hypnotizing as *Lolita*."},{"rating":"2","title":"very creepy and disturbing movie","review":"This movie would have been nothing if not for the effective, nuanced acting skills of Jeremy Irons. He so convincingly portrays twin doctors (one sick, the other a whole lot sicker) that it brings an incredible life to this cerebral movie.

For being \\"in the top ten, all-time shocking movies\\" it was frankly not shocking. I love the criterion collection but I was dissappointed just for the simple fact there were no sub-titles. This is such a basic feature I couldn't believe it wasn't included. Lastly, the picture is average transfer. there are blemishes that are noticable through out the movie.

This film is infinitely hypnotic, but it is also depraved and repulsive. Jeremy Irons, as identical twin psycho-sexually manic gynocologists (yup, you read that right), is, as usual, wonderfully subtle and creepy, and the real trick is that he gives each character a distinctive personality without changing a whit of his mannered voice and look. The story descends into a maddening depressive, inevitably repugnant vision of obsession, and along the way is littered with some of the most graphically disturing dream sequences put on film since Cronenberg's own squeamishly hideous The Brood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Ringers","review":"This one sounded really interesting but the plot develops really slowly so I had already lost interest by the time it started to get interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devastating","review":"This movie is a superbely constructed piece of cinema and it is Cronenberg at his best.Although the film may seem boring and uninterseting in some parts this is only to add to the overall structure of the film.You slowly let this movie inside you ( not in the sense of videodrome ,ofcourse) until it finally devastates you which is almost certainley what Cronenberg wanted.This film is not for the weak hearted.Ultimatley disturbing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Warner Brother's edition!","review":"Yes, the edition I'm reviewing is a Criterion release, but you should not take that to mean that the sound quality of this disc is even acceptable. I'd earlier bought Anchor Bay's version of the disc, had found it unacceptable, and hoped, rather felt sure, that Criterion's would be better. Well, the Anchor Bay logo appears onscreen at the start of Criterion's disc! Does this mean that Criterion didn't bother to remaster the film? Ay carumba!!The loss of sound fidelity is especially noticable in Howard Shore's gorgeous score. The disc extras are interesting but are no substitute for competently mastered picture and sound, the meat and potatoes of any disc. \\"Boooo!\\" to Criterion on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent transfer of an original film","review":"I am a little surprised at the Widescreen Review's assessment of 3.5 out of 5 for the image on this DVD: I would give it 4.5 at least. It is certainly better than I was expecting for a 13 year old film, and Criterion are to be congratulated on the transfer: the image is vibrant and sharp, with excellent colours. There are no nicks or scars at all.Not quite in the 'Se7en' or 'JFK' class in terms of picture quality, but pretty close.The film itself is compelling, and is a showcase for Jeremy Irons' considerable talents. He is on screen for nigh on 95% of the time as one or other (or both) of the Mantle twins, and carries the entire film. Genevieve Bujold is excellent in the only other role of note.The story itself is moderately disturbing as a psychological drama, but there is a refreshing lack of gore.The extras include an interesting look at how the split screen effects were handled to enable Irons to act with himself in various scenes.Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant film!","review":"This film really places David Cronenberg as one of the best, if not the premier, filmmakers of the \\"body horror\\" genre. His interpretation of the dual psyche of the Mantle Twins goes from soberly sinister to frenetically gorey. I was left baffled as to which is which, caused by the development of the Twins' characters. Jeremy Irons, as usual, delivered another tour-de-force of a performance with his audience-confusing portrayal of the virile Elliot and the gentle Beverly. The surgical tools designed by Peter Grundy reflect the grisly state of mind of the Twins. Overall, a great film, except for some scenes where the Twins were together, where either of them would appear a little bit transluscent and the background showing from the back through the face or the hands. It's good that Cronenberg gave the title \\"Twins\\" to director Ivan Reitman; this could have given the movie an impressionable twist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brand new but with flaws?","review":"Shipping was no problem.

Monolake's signature city-at-night, pulsating-addicted, melodically-minimal sound can clearly be heard throughout previous albums as well as on Momentum.

The opening track, \\"Cern,\\" already combines a driving rhythm with some deep and dark textures, while \\"Linear\\" is as alinear as you can get, delving into abstraction. \\"Tetris\\" is similarly challenging. And though the beats are heavy through many of the tracks (\\"Atomium\\" and \\"Stratosphere\\" are a good examples), it's also leavened by the ambient influences of \\"White_II.\\" The melodics of \\"Excentric\\" add a beautiful atmosphere to the track, augmented by the chittering percussion laying on top.

Clearly, it can be read in a spiritual vein, though it's a work of fiction. The author has done his homework, and has a strong grasp of the phenomena upon which several of the book's events are based.But this story is also wonderfully suspensful. The last 100 pages real fly past as you race to the conclusion, which surprises even jaded readers. It's obvious that Davis' other books have given him a robust writer's toolkit with which to craft his tales.Most impressive to me personally, was the degree to which I sympathized with even the antagonist characters. This is perhaps my strongest recommendation of the book. Davis doesn't draw caricatures just to facilitate his book's movement and pacing.

A guy murders his daughter, wife and a family friend (who had had the out of body experience). The father then committed suicide and the only survivor was his little son. The angel says that they all completed their mission. God sent them to earth to teach the little boy some valuable lessons he will need later in life. (It took 400 pages to say that too.) Anyway, I DON'T AGREE! That abusive father is responsible for his actions. He could have been a loving father but instead he turned on his family and murdered them.

It is little more than a string of regurgitated self-loathing diatribes written to target an already pre-defined and well-established group of readers who scoop books up like this so that they can cite secondary sources to justify their world view. Rather than taking a balanced approach with each of the topics they addressed, these authors rush to a conclusion unsubstantiated either in fact or analysis and little true \\"discovery\\" is ever made.I have much more respect for authors who seek to do some spade work in uncovering a new point of view, balanced and justified with deductive reasoning, not recitations of pre-packaged pabulum already in circulation in dog eared white papers written by disenfranchised college professors.Fortunately, I bought this book used and my personal loss, other than the time I spent reading it, was minimized.Bytes"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Dub Syndicate","review":"This is my favorite Dub Syndicate release: I own a couple.

And in doing so she ushered the church into an intimacy with Christ that I had never experience before and now continually yearn for. When I listen to her CDs I can picture her on the keyboard, with her eyes closed, swaying a little and simply, intensely, and honestly worshiping Jesus in Spirit and in Truth.

James Byrd can certainly play the guitar fast. If speed is the only thing you're looking for, than this is not too bad. If you also like some worthwhile compositions, forget it. If you like an original tone and some original ideas while playing the guitar, forget it. This is cliche metal at it's worst. The \\"COMPOSITIONS????\\" don't even work as framework for solos. Speaking of solos, they are poor at best and never reach any highlights or memorable moments. There is also the almost obligatory accoustic/spanish guitar bit that is meant to add variety to the musik, all it does is show that James can't play accoustic to save his live.

After the first 500 pages, I couldn't read anymore (very unlike me!) - the story was going nowhere - how many times can I read about a banquet! The dialogue between the characters was way too \\"20th century\\" & completely unconvincing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly well researched!","review":"I must commend Margaret George on the amount of research that went into writing \\"Memoirs\\". When I saw this book in the bookstore several months ago and perused it, I mistakenly believed it to be a mostly fictitious piece of work. However, after reading it and reading the author's notes at the end I realized that very few aspects of the book were fabricated. This book gives life to Cleopatra through the images presented to the reader through the dialogue. Although it is a lengthy book, it is definitely a book you can't put down and one that you need to read straight-through. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in Egypt, the Ptolemaic dynasty or even Caesar and the Roman warriors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating history!","review":"This historical fiction book covers the entire life of the famous Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt. The book starts when she is a young child, and ends.....well, I'll leave that up to the reader to find out for him/herself!I'm embarrassed to admit that I started the book knowing next to nothing about Cleopatra. In this case, it was probably a plus that I didn't know much; the book is so huge and detailed that I think it would be easy to get bogged down in if you already knew her story. For me, though, everything came as a surprise, and it made it hard for me to put the book down. I thought the book was very well written, and it was fascinating to read about Cleopatra's time period, and ancient Rome and Egypt. I've added Helen of Troy by George to my TBR list; it sounds as fascinating as Memoirs of Cleopatra was!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush","review":"Lush is the first word that comes to mind when reading this book. The world of Cleopatra is so descriptive that you feel as if you're right there with there eating, walking and seeing the same sights she is. There is a great deal of information about the ancient Egyptian world, as well as the world of Rome. I never thought I could get through such a heavy book without becoming bored, but this is very well written and enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent and entertaining read on Cleopatra!","review":"Margaret George truely brings this time period to life.

How can that be?You would think it impossible to make her story a tedious one - but tedious it is. Banquet upon banquet, frivolity upon frivolity. Surely there was more to her than what she ate, what she wore and how she spent her country's money?The portrayal of Caesar was adequate, though not impressive. Marc Antony... who was he? The depiction of him is so thin he almost disappears.Not one character in a cast of hundreds manages to leave an impression.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read for history buffs","review":"This 900+ page masterpiece is not for the faint of heart -- you'll spend hours every day poring through the story.

Her style is both entertaining and sympathetic. George does a wonderful job of making Cleoptra's life exciting without giving in to the unfortunate tendecy among writers to make her lurid and licentious.Give it a read.

If you like reading about Cleopatra, this is one you have to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical Fiction?","review":"I'm no big history buff or a Cleopatra follower. However, George brings her and the times alive in this book. This book is a fantastic escape to an ancient time. It is a must read for nearly anyone.

George helps answer those questions by an explanation at the end of the book. It's a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Wonderful bio of an eternally intriguing woman.

The only shame is knowing how the story has to end and dreading the last word written, because it means having to wait for the next Margaret George novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A trip into the past to a far away land. Don't miss it!","review":"While this book is large, the time you will spend away, in Egypt, will be all too short. Margaret George gives the reader the human side of her characters. The frailties and the strengths, all contrive to make the reader forge new literary friendships. Cleopatra and Mark Anthony become real. The subtleties of Roman politics intrude into the lives of two lovers, and their office, and the power they hold cannot save them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ancient Egyptian","review":"This book was a great find. I love reading fiction set in ancient Egypt, and Ms. George does a very admirable job. Everything is well researched, and documented in the back of the book. Over 900 pages might seem a lot, but it isn't. I loved the daily life details that were gone into, it COULD have been shorter by deleting them, but the book was so much richer for them.Memoirs political manuvering, intrigue, romance, war, everthing anyone could want in a novel. I didn't enjoy all the politics and war details, but that is just a personal opinion and they were easy enough to skip over.I highly reccommend this book to anyone, even if they have no idea of the history of the times or characters. Memoirs works as a stand alone work of fiction as well as a historical novel with real people and events."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleopatra","review":"This is simply a marvelous book. I enjoy period fiction so when I found this book I couldn't resist even though it's length (at first glance) seemed off-putting. However, Ms.George's attention to detail (historical and otherwise) makes it one of those books you hate to finish. When I finished the book I felt like I lost a cherished friend. I recommend this book to any one interested in any period of Ancient Egypt or any fans of the Roman Legions of Caesar's time or any fan of love stories as that is what it ultimately is. It is long story but well worth the trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing !!!!","review":"I really enjoyed reliving the history of Egypt through the eyes of Margaret George.

When she becomes queen after her father's death, she must fight the regency council of her young brother and future husband.I have to admit my heart sank when I saw the size of this book. I don't have anything against long novels per se, but it is my sad experience that very few authors can maintain an interesting storyline for a normal-length book, much less a massive monster. Then there were a lot of small incongruities that contributed to a jarring effect, such as addressing Cleopatra's pharaoh-father as \\"King\\" and referring to her family as \\"the Ptolemies.\\" Everything I've read on ancient Egypt showed a vast cleft between the god-kings and those who served them. I managed to wade through the first hundred pages, but between the little inaccuracies and lack of a compelling storyline, I gave up."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to Life","review":"As an avid reader I found this to be one of my great accomplishments.

Read this and fall in love with an unforgettable leading lady."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long but good","review":"This book certainly is not a quick read. However, I found it kept me entertained.

I think the entire book focuses way too much on Cesar and Rome though. I actually only read half of it because I grew tired of reading about Rome and Cesar. Was starting to wonder if the book is about Cleopatra or Cesar? If I want to read about nothing but Cesar, I would have bought a book about him only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read all of Margaret George's books & this is the only one I haven't been crazy about. I don't know why but it was hard for me to get into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I find it hard to believe that this book has the same author as Mary Queen of Scots! Two completely different books. The topic of Cleopatra is one of the most intersting topics of all times, but this book is so amazingly boring, I had to skip pages because I couldnt follow endless emotionless dialogs and empty, almost non-existing characters...Very very disappointing (would be a good textbook though since it seems to be historically correct)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing....","review":"Usually I am not led astray by reviews - if the reviews are good, the book usually is too. Unfortunately, that isn't the case here. I always finish my books but I am only half-way through this one, and I've already read many others rather than finish. The writing is immature. The speech is sometimes fake and forced. But, worst of all, the book is unbearably boring. It might be becuase of the way Geaorge writes, or it may be becuase she fails to make me care one bit for the characters. I don't know. All I can say is, if you like the long historical books, try Aztec (Jennings) or Pillars of the World."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like Henry the VIII or Mary, Queen of Scots","review":"After reading Margaret George's The Autobiography of Henry VIII and Mary, Queen of Scots, I was eagerly awaiting her next book--assuming that it would be more British historical fiction. When I discovered The Memoirs of Cleopatra, I was a tad disappointed. Nevertheless, I happily bought the book assuming that it would be as interesting and fun to read as those other two.Boy, was I wrong! This tome was so horribly uninteresting, I was never able to finish it and it still sits only half-read on my bookshelves. Sometimes, I think of tackling it again, but everytime I read the first several pages, I wind up putting it back down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the same book?","review":"I bought this book from a second hand bookstore, thinking I'd made a great find. I love history, history fiction, and biographies, and this book seemed to have it all.But I was wrong. I don't understand how so many people can love this book: The book was terrible. The writing was atrocious. Cleopatra, one of the most clever, cunning and admirable women in history, was denigrated to a simpering fool in the book. The characters were two-dimensional, the dialogue was forced, and at times, just plain stupid. I tried very hard to give the book a chance; sometimes, stories need a bit of time to get going. But this one didn't. By the one hundredth page, I was bored to tears, and I found staring at the arrivals and departures screen at the airport (where I was reading during a long layover) to be far more interesting.I wouldn't even give this book away. I think I chucked it in a bin somewhere and purchased a far superior book : Stacy Schiff's Cleopatra. Now THAT's good writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyable and enlightening","review":"I loved reading this book because I love learning more about famous, or infamous, and mysterious people and the events. We can only speculate today on the events surrounding Cleopatra and her children and loves and politics. That's why I couldn't put it down. M. George really sets an atmosphere in her novels of the times and circumstances and implications going on at the time. Our lives can be enriched by the past and people of the past when we have the benefit of M. George's efforts. She explains thoroughly their lives and world while we struggle daily in our own. I can't wait to see who she writes about next."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Hard to Get Into","review":"I started this book immediately after reading The Autobiography of Henry VIII. The autobiography was so superb, that I found this book a little harder to get into. I stopped reading midway because I was slowly losing interest. When I resumed reading, I couldn't put it down. I am a big fan of Margaret George, and I prefer her books to Phillipa Gregory. I recommend this and all other Margaret George books to anybody who enjoys historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insight into one of history's most (in)famous women","review":"Margaret George, with her usual thoroughness, draws the reader into ancient Egyptian society with all it's color, danger and intrigue.

I learned much while I was completely entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Heavy' Reading, But Well Worth It.","review":"For all those reader's out there who suffer from insomnia, like myself. This is the book for you. Why, is it boring I hear you cry. No not in the slightest, but it is a heavy tome and the sheer weight of it will probably tire you out. Joking apart, as with all of Margaret Geor4ge's offerings, it is well written, well researched and well put together.The book is told in the first person and as the title suggests it is about the happenings in the life of the very young Egyptian Princess and the fights she had with her brother who should take over the rule of Egypt after their father the pharaoh died. Follow on with her dalliance with the great Julius Caesar and ultimately her love for Mark Anthony. A love that finally brought about her death at her own hand.Although the book is a novel,the background is expertly researched and would be of interest to anyone interested in Egyptology, as well as the ordinary reader who will read it simply because it is a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!!","review":"This book was in Excellent condition!!!!

It does drag on a bit during all those wars and names of the kings and generals but most are not that important to the book, just shows that there was a lot of research involved.I am one who looks up words I do not understand and write in the margins ie: trireme, natron, silphion or what the six seeds Persephone ate signified. Fascinating. Thank goodness for Dictionary.com. As I write this, it shows some of these words are spelled wrong. Look them up.Makes me wonder how it was living as an average citizen in this time.At 963 pages (I also read the authors notes), it gets a bit wearisome and I am only on page 633. Not yet finished but getting there.I'll be ready for something lighter. At best, shorter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great research, beautifully written","review":"Margaret George has a way with words. This is my first MG book and what a book to start with! I confess, it took me a while to get into it, though I appreciated what I read I was not pulled in. The book is a staggering 956 pages (if you don't include th authors notes etc.) and while the book read like poetry at times it also got tedious in the explanations of things; such is history though. Though I know that Julius Caesar and Cleopatra's relationship is very much more romantic in the book than it was in life, it was easy to sucumb to getting swept away in a literary crush on MG's Caesar. I felt the frustration's of the Egyptian Queen as well as the swell of love and pride for her children and her Antony. I had before a disdain of Octavian but in the book found myself expressing aloud agreements in finding his cold fiendish actions a neverending well. I don't imagine myself ever reading this for a second time, but I am glad I read it a first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Margaret George is a wonderful researcher and there is no denying that, however, did she have to throw every single bit she dug up into the book?The story of the young Cleopatra was fascinating. I liked the little girl that Cleopatra was and how she had to grow up real quick. I couldn't stand the older Cleopatra.The the first few hundred pages were worth reading, but not the rest. I put this book down several times only returning because I hate leave books half read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment!","review":"This plodding tome, belaboured with endless detail, is a testament to Ms. George's research ability but unfortunately, does not translate into a readable work. It was a real let down, as I loved her two previous works and have reread both more than once. I couldn't put those books down, but in this case, I couldn't pick it up! Cleopatra the woman go lost in the detailed descriptions and history. If you're considering buying this book because you loved her other books - think again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and Boring","review":"Margaret George has painted flat and unrealistic characters with no flaws. She would have us believe Cleopatra and Caesar were wise and benevolent rulers without any emotions. Nineteen year old Cleopatra, too often, speaks in the voice of a 21st century, thirty year old woman. It seems George knows her history however, she papers over her characters' documented bad behavior with made-up excuses and sometimes she ignores historical facts altogether.This book is for people looking for lush and extravagant romance novels with gilded ships, jewel encrusted furniture and silk robes. For those who like good historical fiction, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"This book is MASSIVE and I envy you if you haven't read it yet.

The author places Cleopatra frequently within the Roman pomerium--a place where no sovereign monarch was permitted. It threw me off, but as always, I enjoyed Margaret George's wonderful writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transports into history. . ,","review":"As with all of George's books, The Memoirs of Cleopatra is rich in detail and the characters are well developed. With George I feel transported, like I am there, an actual observer - not just a reader who sets the book down for the night and leaves it for a month! I read this book and Colin Falconer's at the same time. There is no comparison. George's characters seem real - not wooden as Falconer's do. They have depth - their strengths and weaknesses are all there. She makes me think about Cleopatra as a real living woman - if you read one book about Cleopatra make it this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absorbing, well-researched novel","review":"If you're looking to learn something about Cleopatra in the most enjoyable way possible, this is your book.

I was wrong...from the beginning, it pulled me right into ancient Egypt, immersing me in the scents, sounds and life of this legendary queen, who has always fascinated me. If you're looking for a great summer read, a book to get totally lost in , this is the book for you...It is one of my favorite historical novels, right up there with Mists of Avalon...It's a long read, but never boring..Margaret George amazes me---she must have done much research, as I believe, much of the book is fairly accurate in the way history has handed down the story. Don't be scared by the size....you'll be sorry when you've finished it!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic Carpet Ride into B.C.","review":"This book is a challenge to devour in bed, as the book itself weighs about 5 pounds... but it's delicous.

This book spurred me on to learn more about her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful.","review":"I am an avid reader, and this book is on my top 5 list of all time favorite books ever. Margaret George writes Cleopatra as fully dimensional; with faults, compassion, power and full emotion. She had done an amazing amount of research and dispels various myths (coming in to see Antony on a barge, etc.)This is a long book but not to be rushed through. The writing is to be absorbed. You feel as if you are in fact living in B.C. Egypt, along with all of her wealth and friends and servants and lovers. When the end eventually came, I missed Cleopatra. I had felt as if I knew her and experienced her life right there with her. An absolutely amazing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleopatra, Queen of the nile","review":"An incredible book written in the most exquisite taste. I just wish it never ended. A great story about one of the first women to empower the world. I will read it again. I just don't know when! Oh memory, please fail me now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleopatra's favorite biographer","review":"Having managed to avoid reading much about Cleopatra before, I picked this up only because I enjoyed Margaret George's previous novels. As with her debut \\"The Autobiography of Henry VIII\\", Cleopatra tells her own story through George's pen, proving that George is a master of the first-person narrative (which made me wonder why \\"Mary Queen Of Scotland and The Isles\\" was not in Mary's voice--would have made for a better story, in my opinion). Cleopatra is made of stronger stuff than Mary, though, which makes this novel even more enjoyable to read. Another winner from Margaret George!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS TODAY, NO SLEEP TONIGHT!","review":"\\"Fear Itself\\" is an excellent book.I read one or two books per week.(that's alot of books)I can easliy say this is now on the top of my favorite list. I haven't read alot by Jonathon Nasaw, but will from now on. The story moves right along and the characters are unforgetable.

Thus, Ive been waiting for Fear Itself: A Novel like a child waiting to hear reindeer hooves and bells outside on Christmas Eve! omg-- Nasaw did it! Do not begin this book (Fear Itself) unless you have time to totally immerse yourself.

I had put this book down several times and it was shear stubbornness that I made myself finish it. Revealing the killer in the first quarter of the book lost my interest.I experimented in reading the remaining chapters by skipping all sections that had reference to the killer 'Simon'and a really obscure section dealing with his sister. This did not present any problems in following the storyline. I have read many thriller stories dealing with FBI investigations and this had to be the sloppiest. Skipping sections of the book sped up the reading considerably and shortened the story, thankfully.If this killer was using 'fear', it was a poor attempt. Just pick anyone off the street and torture them, you'll get the same results. I really want to give this one star, I'm just sorry that I spent the time finishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of easy, pretty boring","review":"I bought this video at a discount book store and was excited to see a new Method DVD.

The first half-hour is the standing portion and then the workout ends with floor work.I bought this DVD bcz i trust the Method dvd programs and I wanted to feel like I was incorporating more \\"cardio\\" with pilates moves. Doing these movements while standing gave me this experience versus those cardio/pilates workouts that have the viewer doing floor work and then make them pause the DVD to put on gymshoes to do the cardio portion.Those videos make the workout feel broken up, atleast thats my opinion.Now, if a person wants to a cardio/pilates workout without switching between DVD's then those cardio/pilates compilation DVDs are useful.I recommend this work DVD as a happy-medium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Pilates?","review":"This workout focuses on legs, legs, legs.

With a couple of exceptions, the exercises don't bear much resemblance to anything I learned in class. Mostly, they are more like ballet, which is fine -- but don't call it \\"Pilates.\\" There is also a section of matwork that I thought might be okay for people who already know what they are doing, but there is not enough instruction for newcomers to perform the exercises correctly.

The Gourds are my favorite intact and performing band.The variety of songs and styles runs the gamut from Dyin' Diamond or LGO, songs that will nearly cause you to levitate with energy to the sodden, gospel-tinged I Like Drinking. And where the hell else are you going to find anyone this side of Scotland singing about eating hagis? This CD is just chock full of great tunes, the stuff of life interpreted through the haze of smoke and drink and sitting around on porches and eating pot-luck dinners and seeing the sadness and the glory of life.But you better check out the samples first because the Gourds are not your mainstream anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal","review":"I bought this CD a LONG time ago and liked it a lot, but found I couldn't listen to it all the way through because of a scratch on it. Then, for some reason, my new CD player didn't catch the scratch so I've been able to listen to the whole thing.This CD is akin to Images and Words. They are progressive, but don't go overboard in technicality. The music flows seamlessly. Heavy and soft...pianos and synths...but all played to perfection. I think the vocals are okay, and could definitely be better, but they aren't the meat of this by any means.In a metal world of a million progressive bands...I would put this CD along with Dream Theater's I/W cd. Other top bands would be Zerohour and...hmm...I guess that's it for now! lol I don't even really care for DT anymore...their stuff takes too much patience to listen to.So definitely pick this one up.

Every one has a slightly different feel during a shave.I would suggest buying a sample pack of blades made by several companies to determine what is best for your shave.Since I have used a DE razor and blades, I have not had razor burn or ingrown hairs. The few additional nicks that occur are far more acceptable than the day-long irritation that I received after using cartridge systems like the Mach series from Gilette.As long as you use shave soaps and creams, not canned shave foam, with this product, you will be very pleased with the results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent shave","review":"I bought these when I first purchased my saftey razor.

That does not mean that there are not slightly better blades, but it does mean that it established the standard by which others are judged. As in knives, Solingen steel is nothing to sniff at. Merkurs offer the smoothest, least abrasive shave, and they are unmatched for edge-holding.I have used Merkurs for four years, and I interchange them with Astras and Feathers in a Merkur Progress double-edge.I believe the Astras to be inferior (but still very respectable), and the Feathers to be slightly superior (when in a Progress; too agressive for my sensitive skin when in a 1960's Gillette DE)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good all around blades","review":"These blades shave close and do a good job with out being aggressively sharp.

I used the original Merkur blade for a week and then switched to the Feather blades and used them until I finished that box. I was very pleased with the performance after a week for these blades. Then I went back to start using my box of Merkur blades and a new blade serious felt WORSE than a week old Feather blade. More tugging and effort required leaving more irritaion.

If I get different brands to compare to, I will update my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"COMPARED TO FEATHER, THEY'RE DULL AS A BUTTER KNIFE","review":"I tried these when first bought my Merkur \\"Fat Boy\\" razor. I thought they were good, however, that was before I tried Feather blades. Merkur blades are dull and not sharp from the get go, in comparison. They pull your beard and always nick you up. Feather blades from Japan, on the other hand, are THE best. Literally, \\"razor\\" sharp, they cut through a three day growth with ease.

In fact, blade preference is highly personal. The \\"best\\" blade is the one that gives you the best shave, regardless of what anyone else says. I like these blades. I find them sharp without being overly aggressive. They also hold an edge well without dulling quickly.I would recommend these to anyone searching for the perfect blade. These blades are generally considered above-average quality. They are sharp, but not the sharpest or most aggressive blade available, falling right in that range where most people like them a lot. I can't promise they'll be the best blade for you, but I do suggest you give them a shot and see how they work for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sharp enough","review":"These blades are a little too mild for my taste. My facial hair is on the thicker side so when I made a pass with the Merkur blade I could feel it tugging away. I had to make multiple passes in order to get my face nice and smooth.

Blades are a very personal choice and many other factors play in to the result one gets from them, so here are my conditions:- Wetshaving for 2 months at time of writing.- Merkur Classic Safety razor.- My beard is not dense, straight whiskers.- Shave daily.The blades give me close shaves and I have yet to cut or nick myself (knock on wood). The sharpness is very consistent from one blade to the next, and I change blades every week usually. I have read that these blades are not considered the sharpest in the spectrum of DE blades, so if you have a dense or thick beard, these might not be sharp enough for a shave without tugging. But sharper blades also mean more irritation, so you'll have to find the right fit for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey now","review":"very good blades, to bad ARTIE LANGE was not aware of these german made razor blades.

Definitely worth a listen.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good system for 37 bucks","review":"The Satellites are great on this system, they are very loud and hit high's incredibly well. The Bass isnt as amazing but is still good. With the bass's size it cant hit higher notes amazingly. Then again, 37 bucks, sounds amazing and bass i can feel. I enjoy this system. I have it 2 wayed with my Altec Lansing. 4 satellites and 2 Woofers, yes i tested the CA system without my Altecs hooked up. If you need amazing speakers, and some nice bass. Get this, oh and dont use it for your TV lol. They are for PC's, Dude who reviewed this product said cords are too short to have on his TV, i wonder why lol? Oh, they are for a computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"top notch and the greatest deal i ever had in my life on a sound systems.","review":"this is the best system that i ever had and at a very good price. i received it about 4 days and after i received i hook it up the sound is a very high quality not as high as a surround sound system like bose or other top quality stuff but i am very impress on this sound system and at a very affordable price. i even got a complain from the neighbors that my music is too loud that they can hear it 3 house down. the sound system is very powerful and a very good quality for just 40.99 bucks. i will definitely recommend this products to anyone that want to go cheap but a good quality at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Brought this because my laptop speakers aren't very good. It shipped quickly. The sound is amazing. I decided to test the bass by listening to touch it by Busta Rhymes. The bass in this song is extremely strong. The sub-woofer translated perfectly. The floor of my dorm room was shaking. I am extremely impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"compared with other speakers....not so impressed","review":"i own an eagle ET-AR504LR-BK speaker and decided to compare it side by side with my friend's CA-3550WB:in terms of sound quality 504 reproduced very fine details in pretty much all types of movies or music that we played. the 3550 sounded muddy, especially in the treble and mid-range.in terms of sound volume 504 got very loud when we turned the volume up to 40%, there was no distortion until 80% but my friend and i could not withstand the volume already, it was so loud that we could not hear each other. the 3550 got to similar volume level but distortion was much more noticeable.in terms of features the 504 came with full function remote, LCD display and digital equalizer. the 3550 did not have any of those.call me biased but both my friend and i agree that 504 is a much nicer speaker for just about 10 dollars more.your listening experience may be different and the best way to tell two speakers apart is by comparing them side by side like we did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to beat for price","review":"Granted, these aren't THE BEST speakers I've heard, but at $40 they are definitely the best sub-$100 speakers I've ever heard. I've tried some big names like Altec Lansing/Boston Accoustics and these still sound overwhelmingly better. The highs are nice and crisp and the lows are deep thanks to the pounding 8\\" subwoofer. Don't turn it up much higher than 70% with the bass up more than 50% or it'll start to distort. Honestly, that's the only downfall to the system...deep, clean bass at higher volumes just isn't there. At lower to medium levels, these sound awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy.","review":"I bought it, and it was decent but after a day the sub-woofer stopped working. I wasn't even near it when it blew out, all i did was turn it on and the sub-woofer was not playing anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a good value","review":"Overall, for >35$ you can't go wrong. The speakers themselves have great clarity, and look nice.The subwoofer is pretty good, except it isn't too fond of REALLY loud volumes. A few cheap construction materials made me give this a worse review, mainly because there is a flimsy cover on the back of the sub that started to peel slightly. Otherwise the whole system is a bargain. 68 watts is a lot, especially for this price range.It's a good buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I would reccomend these speakers","review":"These are some good speakers, better than all the other ones I bought. The sound is nice and the bass is loud if you want it to be, which I like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Morales club track.","review":"This is the return of the legend that is David Morales. This is the first single off the upcoming 2 Worlds Collide cd and this track is a collaboration with vocalist Lea- Lorien. The song is very classic Morales in that it has the beautiful strings, keys and bass that he does so well along with a straight ahead actually structured lyric driven song. The mixes are mainstream house and for me one of the best cds singles of 2004. Tracks:1- Stereo Anthem Mix (10:35)2- Stereo Dub Mix (9:20)3- Stereo Dub Instrumental (9:21)--- tracks 2 and 3 have the feel of Diddy's remix of \\"Heart Of Glass\\" by Blondie- much more euro sounding mixes.4- Extended Mix (7:48)5- Radio Mix (3:37)A great return for David Morales.

Anthony Dias Blue goes into detail about bar setup, the do's and don'ts of making drinks, and even the history of the different alcohols and liqueurs. My favorite sections are the signature drink sections, where famous bars have their well-known drinks described in detail. There is a large portion of non-alcoholic drinks to boot.I recommend this book to everyone, and even may buy myself a new one, as my current copy is water-stained. :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Would definitely recommend!","review":"This was my first drink-mixing book that I bought and I am happy I did! I love the layout of the book! You can search recipes by what alcohol you have laying around or you can search by type of drink. I love that it tells you the history of the liquors, terms, what glasses to use for what etc. It really is handy for a first-time drink maker! The only thing I wish it would have are drink illustrations/pictures, but that's just my taste! Thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty face but no cigar.","review":"I bought this watch without having examined this model in person. While the sale price was alluring (all Perigaum products seem to have a comically unrealistic retail price), it quickly became apparent that this was not a watch for everyday use. Stylish, yes, but lacking any luminescence in the dial or hands (as do most of their products), so forget about trying to tell time in the dark. Frequent winding required. The instruction manual, if you can read it at all, is unhelpful at best, especially about using special functions. The font size is so small, a magnifying glass was required to read it. Perhaps it is more straightforward in the original German. In short, a very attractive but largely unuseful watch, even if deeply discounted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"I received this caddy for a gift on Christmas and it was broken.

I quit after the first chapter in frustration over the errors. McGraw Hill does not offer an errata for the book. Shame on you McGraw Hill.

It was meant for a preview to my Linear Algebra and Applications class and as an alternative reference. I read through about half of the book before the semester began, but we pretty much learned everything I read from this within two weeks. I gave up on it and it was just sitting there until I decided to further clarify to myself the concept of kernel and image, and all the proof questions associated with them. And guess what, this book doesn't even address these concepts. Now I have no reason to even open this book because real college level courses go well beyond this depth and relying on the information in here for tests is just an academic suicide..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carelessly written","review":"I tried using this book as a review, but stopped reading after a few dozen pages.

There is no geometric or any other interpretation of anything. It already assumes you know what vectors are ?????? It mentions material in the beginning of the book that is explained at the end of it. Definitely not enough solved examples. At the end of each chapter it has a quiz that supposed to have solutions at the end of the book, but only 1/2 of the excesses ( the easier ones) have solutions. for the other have the author rudely tells you to follow the path of some other exercise. I find it unacceptable laziness on his part. I know what I need to follow, but I also need to know the answer so I can check myself and see if I followed it correctly.

For example, on page 13, the number 13 in the matrix suddenly becomes a 19, and remains the same throughout most of the example. On the top of page 25, the matrix multiplication has three typos!

The current Camera/DVD or Video war reminds me a lot of the Beta VS VHS war. It is just a matter of time before the Cameras are all DVD and have almost movie quality.

My primary rationale in purchasing a Mini-DVD camcorder (as opposed to one using another format) was the idea that I could edit and make copies of film on my computer. What Sony & Amazon failed to mention ANYWHERE - in product descriptions, in Amazon reviews, etc. - is the fact that the Sony/Pixela editing software (which many other reviewers have complained about) is NOT Mac compatible. And, from what I can tell, neither Sony nor Pixela have any intent of releasing a Mac version of the software.All of which means... well, it means that I wasted a lot of time, effort and money.

I did a little search on the internet and saw that data recovery companies(Apex Technology Limited UK being one of them) now specify ALL dvd-based Sony camcorders in their advertising. So I probably won't buy any similar camera made by Sony. And their only support is like \\"We regret the difficulties you are experiencing.

Used maybe 5 or 6 times. Worst use of $800 I've ever had. Now it is off warranty and Sony wants $211 to fix it. And no, it is NOT COVERED UNDER THE RECALL AS THE 200 MODEL IS. Same problem according to the website pictures of the 200 model recall information. My camera says it was manufactured in April 04. The recall only covers until MARCH 04. After reading the other reviews on data loss, we will have to seriously consider whether we choose Sony or not.

After losing discs to access error messages (this included my daughters sweet 16 party,an overseas trip and finally a vacation in the mountains) I sent it in to sony. Sony sent it back stating nothing was wrong, but that sony discs had to be used to guarantee it will work (stated nowhere on the box or manual).

I am entirely against books like these being forced onto children. I hated them when I was younger, and I hate them even more now. Kids have overactive imaginations. When I read it I was scared and paranoid at the thought that characters like the ones in the book might actually exist, or worse, I might encounter them. Not to mention the inter-sibling violence. I have a younger brother and I can't ever imagine doing to him what was done to the main character. And all I could think back then and now is how if anyone had done that to me, I would be out for revenge. Is that the kind of state you want to put your kids in?I can't say anything about the quality of the writing. When I'm so struck by the gruesome content, it's difficult to pay attention to prose. The author must have been one disturbed child."},{"rating":"1","title":"An ok read.","review":"This was in my opinion a good story. However it was very slow. Nothing interesting happens untill like halfway through the story and by then the stories super predictable. Also, there was little character development. Paul and his friend Joey seemed to have several different mood swings and weren't very smart. The book was overdramatic. Several little things were made into a big deal big things that happened were brief and confusing.Overall it was a good idea for a story but underdeveloped.

To make things even more boring, writing format is nothing out of the ordinary and seems to have been written by a third-grader. In other words, the writing style in \\"Tangerine\\" will set you to sleep.Character development is ridiculously non-evident. Setting descriptions are poor. Characters are described in a way so that a reader feels no sympathy. In fact, you may find yourself reading words instead of soaking in a nice story. The plot is unbearably ridiculous and you will NEVER find yourself turning a page in high anticipation of what is to happen. This book is not worth your time.

While fearing Erik and his friend, Paul meets new friends and changes schools because a sinkhole that forms right under his school. Paul finds courage to stand up to his brother and lets readers know the REAL reason he is legally blind.I liked this book but if I could suggest any thing, it would be to get a better ending and I hope that Edward Bloor will write a sequel to this to Tangerine only because he kind of leaves the readers hanging at the end.Overall I really enjoyed this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TANGERINE","review":"Stay away from this book!

A reason that I rated it good is because of the descriptions during the games were very good and you feel like you are in the game and almost blind, just like Paul.

Could things be any more hectic in Tangerine? Will Paul's family be forced to move back to their hometown? Paul Fisher is a 7th grader in this novel. I personally think this book is good for anyone between the ages of twelve and fourteen, You have to enjoy a good twisted mystery to want to read this book.

Virtually every character has a life all their own; by the end of the novel I know everyone's history, motivations, and likely next move.However, Paul Fisher, the narrator of the story, seems too flawless. The only mistakes he make seem to be deliberately placed by the author, and hence out of his control. He also has more foresight than any other character and even corrects many of the adults about their mistakes throughout the novel.Besides communicating character, another Bloor writing style I like is his use of suspense. Throughout the last third of the novel, all the loose ends began tying into the central conflict. As more and more begins riding on the one issue, I wanted more and more to know how it would resolve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a fantastic book that everyone should read.

It does not contain layers waiting to be peeled back. It does not include beautifully crafted language. There are no symbols to understand. It has no historical value. This book is graphic violence for the sake of graphic violence. It is engaging and will hold you captive to the end, but you will not come away from reading this book a better person.

This book is always full of action. Paul is either in an exciting soccer game, or is working and solving his problems, like his eyesight and friends.

If you are new to Wiccan studies and instruction books, please pick up a copy ofWicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner (Includes Author's Book of Shadows). There you will discover a much better and more accurate look at history as well as a less biased look at the role that the God and Goddess play.She has reduced the God to little more than a good lay for the Goddess, which is completely inaccurate. Her feminism would do well to duck its head when she works on an instructional text, to say the least.It is however, a handy reference material, offering nicely presented correspondence lists as well as alphabets in the back.

When you get past the intorduction about the craft and get into the rest of the book, such as nature spirits and other invisible helpers, and the book of spells the content is more barible, but not deffinatly not worth the price of this book.

So i bought it thinking best video card for agp. Then i slowly realized that many people were saying it was buring out and that it didnt work well. Well i though i would take a chance on mine. So i recieved and installed the drivers which are xfx. Little did i know that on the same day it would burn out. DO NOT BUY, stick with Nvidia 7000 series or just replace motherboard for pci-e."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was good for the four weeks it lasted","review":"I had one of these. It was a pretty good card -- great for AGP -- for the first four weeks I had it. Then it burned out (literally). I didn't overclock it, the power supply was 470 watts, and the old AGP card worked fine when I reverted to it. So, beware. Maybe it's a fluke, but I'm not inclined to buy another one.There is also some difficulty with the drivers -- you can't use standard NVidia drivers with this card, but have to use the XFX drivers instead. This is supposed to change in a future \\"major rev\\" of the NVidia drivers, but in the meantime, it means it takes a little longer to get updates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"Prepare to spend an hour listening to what I think are the worst aspects of hip hop: recycled drivel, gratuitous self-promotion, and simplistic, formulaic verbalization as the Buffalo Gals go back to some of the most tired banter ever pressed to disc. Taken from the breakthrough World Famous Supreme Team radio show that broadcasted from New York/Brooklyn in the mid-80s, this album manages to include only a few tracks of good listening, like \\"Hey DJ (12\\" Cut)\\", and plenty of deadwood, like a version of \\"World's Famous\\" seriously diluted by an endless recital of thank yous. A better harvest of McClaren's fruitful collaboration with East Cost hip hop can be found on his wonderful 1990 release, \\"World Famous Supreme Team Show\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good book to have fun","review":"This book is upto my expecations. There are very good math puzzles, both educational and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tsk Tsk, what a shame...","review":"My name is Whitney and I have three words to describe the book. Waste of time. This book was by far the worst piece of literature that I have ever read. The dialog was well written but the descriptions went on forever and half the time was using 1960/70s lingo and not being from that era made it rather difficult to decode. I would not recommend this book to anyone and I advise you to pick another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Krokus - 'Round 13' (Angel Air)","review":"So-so 1999 effort by the '80's Swiss rockers we know as Krokus. 'Round 13' isn't really a bad CD, but it's simply difficult to imagine Krokus existing without vocalist Marc Storace. His replacement is Carl Sentance (of Persian Risk, a metal band from Cardiff, UK)) and he isn't all that great in Storace's place. Only tunes here I thought were decent are \\"Money Back\\", \\"Suck My Guitar\\" and their direct AC/DC rip-off \\"Witch Hunt\\" (oddly enough, perhaps the best track of this entire release). Rest of the line-up includes is sole original member Fernando Von Arb-guitar, Many Maurer-bass, Chris Lauper-guitar and Peter Hass-drums. Pretty much reserved for die-hards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Track 2 says it all -- \\"I Want My Money Back!\\"","review":"Oh my GOD, does this album (...)! And with Fernando Von Arb being the only original member on this waste of time, it hardly can be considered a true Krokus album. Although I have to admit when Fernando tried this in 1991 with \\"Stampede\\" the results weren't half bad (the title track CRUSHES!), but this is most definately not the case here. NOTHING is Krokus about the music on this cd! It's not just the sub-par vocals, there is not a riff or hook on this one that sounds like AC/DC -- I mean Krokus. Do yourself a favor and avoid this one at all costs. If you've got a hankering for Krokus, pull out \\"Headhunter.\\" If you want something new that rocks, pick up \\"Seven Hills\\" from the reunited Japanese phenoms Anthem or \\"Killing Ground\\" from the still-kickin' NWOBHM Saxon. Heavy Metal lives, but you wouldn't know it if this were it's only legacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dial calipers","review":"This is a very nice dial caliper for the money.

A WORD OF ADVISE, DON'T GET DIS ALBUM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cube's worst album and a disgrace to gangsta rap","review":"Ice Cube was yet to release a bad album when this came out. I decided to buy it since Ice Cube is one of my favorite artists, but there isn't 1 good track on this entire CD. It is truly the only album I own that I would give a 1 star rating to, and I have some other fairly bad albums. Please do not listen to this if you want to hear good Ice Cube, any other release from him will do, but not this. His lyrics have gotten to be stupid at times, but by far the worst aspect of this album is the TERRIBLE production. I am not feeling the whole rock vibe at all, I mean it's cool Cube is expanding his musical horizons, but this isn't that way to do. Thankfully Cube's nex release, Volume 2 The Peace Disk was much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"War on the Masses","review":"Ice Cube is the embodiment of Gansterism. He's OG now and it shows. He has been a player in the game for over 10 yrs now. I don't care if he's Don Mega or Cube, he's the hardest hitter. Ghetto Vet symbolizes the albums meaning...Still in the game no matter what. With first of two CDs, Cube proves he \\"Pushes Rhymes Like Weight\\".Peace, Damn Straight"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange, Dark, Unorthodox..... But Great","review":"This album is one of the most compelling albums I ever heard in my life. This album has more versitile- It has the track fearturing Korn. The song \\"War and Peace\\" contained a sample called \\"Don't Speak\\" by G. Stephani. Also this album contains the eerie track called the \\"Pecking Order\\". In my opinion the albums best songs were \\"Dr. Frankenstein, \\"Greed\\", \\"War and Peace\\", and \\"Penitentiary\\". Althought this album has many songs affilited with alternative music, Cube keeps it gangsta, but also more concerned about getting his money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Ice Cube's standard","review":"Compared to most other hip-hop albums out there, this CD is good. However, Ice Cube's old stuff is his worst enemy: He can't compete with \\"America's Most\\" or \\"Death Certificate\\". Cube's lyrics used to be about reality. Now there all silly tales about how much loot he's got. I think Cube tried too hard on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ice Cube rules","review":"One I listened to some of the songs over the internet. I ordered it right away. I think that this is one of Ice Cube's best CD's he has every put out. This CD is awesome. It has awesome tracks like: Ghetto Vet from the soundtrack, \\"I got the Hook up\\" and Greedy from the soundtrack \\"Gang\\" Related and several other awesome tracks as well. Ice Cube keep doin your thing. I advise everyone out there that likes rap. To go out and get it. Peace and Love y'all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Cd but not his best work","review":"I just bought War n Peace and i think it is very good and i enjoyed it but it wasn't his best cd. I Still recomed everyone buys it :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly dissapointing.","review":"This album sounds like one continous song with a few breaks. There is absolutley nothing redeeming, entertaining, or original on this album. I believe that Ice Cube's previous endevours have had an incredibley positive infulence on Rap music. This falls far short of that however. Whatever happened to \\"funky\\"? This album almost sounds like Ice Cube sat down with a drum machine, found a beat that he liked, and then wrote some songs, put them all to that same beat, and made an album. Not to mention his lyrical style is incredibly flat. Sounds like he is trying to sound like 2-pac on every single song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ice Cube is the SHIZNIT!!!","review":"Cube comes action packed and strapped with his new CD--War&Peace Vol.1.

After the great Westside Connection CD and Players Club single \\"We Be Clubbin\\" I expected great things from this CD and was highly disappointed. It seems as though Cube tried to go cartoonish ala George Clinton but it didn't work in the least with his character Don Mega. I believe Cube put his best foot forward as he always does but it just didn't work out. He needs to and probably will scrap the Peace Vol. and reevaluate how he makes his come back."},{"rating":"2","title":"icecube and korn","review":"man this cd kicks as it beats all of rap music and all dis tyme i thought icecube was a metal hater but not until i heard KORN play wit him this cd is a ten star YA HEARD ME LATA BIATCH"},{"rating":"1","title":"A great record for a new emcee, but Cube should know better","review":"What happened to Ice Cube's angry style?

The beats are weak and it definitely doesn't rock parties nor can you bump it in the trunk. Its hard for a MC to come out with a album in awhile bacause the times are changing. Like Public Enemy when they were at their peak, stop making songs. Todays age of hip hop is totally different. Our so called old school rappers have lost their grip on the audience. ICE CUBES grip was when he use to grap the audience with beats of the streets and lyrical skills that a have you thinking. .\\"As a fan I wish that he be the best MC and lead because he's been in the game longer than these new jacks and these new jacks need somebody to lead them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, reliable Urban Forestry Information for the NE","review":"This is an excellent review of Urban Forestry practices in general and certainly the permier book for UF in the northeast!

Under the category of \\"Various Artists - International - Africa\\" one finds this album from New Guinea ... last time I looked at a map Africa didn't extend to South Sea Islands or, if you prefer, Southeast Asia. But once you get past the geography, this 2nd volume of Sacred Flute Music From New Guinea is fascinating. The music is played on two large, transverse, bamboo flutes with percussion. The coordination between the flutes is especially interesting as they frequently alternate rather than play in harmony. The notes accompanying the cd are excellent - detailing the instruments and the cultural context of playing them. My first reaction to the cd was mild boredom as there is comparatively little variation in tempo or pitch ... but my appreciation quickly grew to enjoying the quiet, \\"natural\\" and expressive sounds of the instruments."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most talentless of the \\"punk/new wave\\" scene","review":"Coupla good songs - the rest is beneath mediocre.

Somehow, it will miraculously make you feel healthy again.Just try it. Really.

When I'm sick, I grab some Robitussin or Sudafed, and that's that. If this has any legitimate medicinal value, it's just a nice bonus. From my standpoint, this is just a Damned Good Tea!It's got an unlikely minty licorice taste to it, which has really grown on me. I haven't found this taste in any other tea. The aroma is wonderful, and it cools the nose like a subtle eucalyptus, though that's not present in the taste. While it makes a great hot tea, it really shines for iced tea. I use one bag per 18oz or so, rather than the one bag per 12oz I'd normally use for iced tea brewing, and this works quite well. In addition to the refreshing taste, that coolness in the nose and the throat makes a great hot weather refreshment."},{"rating":"2","title":"but this for Skiba's songs","review":"Being a fan of Alkaline Trio I was naturally interested in this CD, and it certainly was not a dissapointment. Matt Skiba proves again that he is one of the best songwriters there are in music, he also proves that pounding drums and distorted guitars don't matter and stripped down his music is just as bone chilling and masterful as it is distorted. Every song on this CD is great, but I especially like in your wake and next to you. For the Kevin Seconds side, it's not good at all and is really not wirth listening to, but because Skiba's songs were so great i'm giving this five stars anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"half of your money","review":"Like previously said, Matt Skiba is worth buying this record for. He makes these heart felt songs that you can truly get into. Kevin Seconds seems to have thrown some songs together, or at least I hope so. It would be a shame for someone to actually spend a tangible amount of time writing terribly obvious rhyming songs to go with crappy music. I've never heard Alkaline Trio but I might have to after this one. I can't imagine Kevin Seconds has a band or one worth listening to anyway. It would be five stars if you could somehow scratch the CD in a way the first five songs are only playable."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars if it weren't for Kevin Seconds.","review":"Let me start off with the good. Matt Skiba blew me away on this cd. I have all of Alkaline Trio's work and Matt Skiba shows he can succeed without his band's help. He plays all the instruments on his portion of this cd. His lyrics are great and he has a great voice to match it. Now for the bad. The songs by Kevin Seconds are horrible. A 3rd grader could have come up with these lyrics. Kevin Seconds's lyrics make him sound like a 13 year old who thinks he is cool by saying mother******. He isn't much of a musician and I get the strong feeling he was holding his nose while he was singing on this cd. Get this cd for Matt Skiba's portion and don't bother even listening to Kevin Seconds's portion."},{"rating":"2","title":"youre wrong","review":"I've read a couple of reviews of this album at multiple websites, and it seems I am the only person out there who enjoys the kevin seconds side of this record a lot more than matt skiba's. Matt skiba's side strikes me as whiny, sad, alkaline trio without the distorted guitar, while Kevin Seconds's side is just great music to sit around and listen to. I can play Kevin Seconds's songs repeatedly, but Matt Skiba's quickly get boring and run together. All in all, i think it is a great album, mainly because Kevin Seconds is so damn good."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"JOY and PAIN\\"","review":"This book has an intriguing tone from start to finish.

In certain way i think there's such a good new direction musical influence, and that is the evolution, fusion. Mr. MacAlpine try to push the boundaries from neo classical to the different style. This album has great mixture neo classical thing and jazz, and the result is just good, not kind of boring album. If you die hard fans of Mr. MacAlpine shredding music, you should listen to this one.

There is some great guitar playing, moments of grandeur, a handful of mildly entertaining songs, and quite a lot of filler. I haven't decided if \\"Funky Side\\" is the catchiest song I've heard in a while, or the most annoying. A lot of the songs (Funky Side, for example) suffer from repetition---after the first 2 minutes you've pretty much heard the whole song. \\"Each & Every Direction\\" is a good song to groove to, but there's not much of a melody. Not bad overall...but hardly overwhelming. To be fair, I can envision myself buying another Donna The Buffalo CD.

For the price it is a good deal. Package was not very big, it is easy to assemble, most parts are pretty sturdy, and we like the fact that we can move it around, and lift it up and out to clean the bottom area. It is roomy for one pet ferret, but two would be crowded. The only parts that are a little flimsy are the doors. We would have liked them to be stronger because our four family members love spending time with our pet so we have made the doors loose and warped from constantly opening and closing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good size but thats about all it has going for it.","review":"The cage is perfect size. My ferret loved the room to run around it in. But first thing to fall apart was the slide. I dont know who they are kidding but it doesn't seem designed to hold the weight of a ferret at all. The slide was no big deal, after about the 5th time of it falling apart I just took it out and my ferret could still get to top easy enough. The real problem is how thin the bars are and how easy they bend. My ferret chewed a corner loose and bent the bar enough that she could slip through. Two times we came home to find the ferret running around our place with the cats. We were thankful the cats didnt eat her."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR SUGAR GLIDERS","review":"I found this cage while searching for a cage for my sugar glider. I was excited when it came.

This cage should not be listed under sugar glider cages.They can fit right through the bars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible cage, a waste of money","review":"This cage is made very cheaply and was a pain to put together . Not only that, it is not good for ferrets as it claims. In order to get to each level, the ferret needs to go through a hole which is tiny. They also have to go up a slide and elbow. This is not very practical at all. My ferret fell many times because he could not get to the bottom through the holes and other obstacles. The slide and ladder were both broken before my ferret had even been in it a full day. I took it back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Our ferret died with this cage","review":"After looking around for a cage we chose this one based on the height to provide more space for our ferret. It is a bit cumbersome to get the shelves to into the cage and to stay latched to the cage. The sides of the cage hook together but are not very secure. Our ferret pushed through the sides of the cage where the sides did not stay hooked together. We were not home and so she was squeezed by the metal as she got only 1/2 way through. Therefore, she died. I would not recommend this cage due to the poor construction and safety implications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not worth the price tag","review":"I bought this cage as a first home for my ferrets. The bars are very flimsy and the doors latch by forcing the latch in between two bars. As you can imagine after a while the bars bend and even break. One broke at the very top of my cage and my ferret was able to climb the bars and escape. So many horizontal bars is a bad design for ferrets. And they hated the slide, would never use it. Would leap from one level to the next instead of dealing with it. I ended up purchasing two more of the tunnel elbows and removing the slide and ramp. They liked this a lot better. I finally upgraded to a Ferret Nation habitat. Hands down the best ferret cage on the market. Ramp covers for safety, removable plastic shelf inserts for easy cleaning, strong bars and dual lock doors."},{"rating":"2","title":"smaller rats can get out!","review":"I bought this cage, I thought it would be good for my two ratties to have a little penthouse. Within a week, Alice escaped. Daisy hasn't figured it out, or she just likes her house. The next week, she escaped again, after I triple checked all latches. I am not sure how she is getting out, but I would recommend this cage for larger rats. I may have to buy another cage for them, which is an expense I can't really afford right now, but it's too dangerous for Alice to be getting out and about.Careful with the instructions, and make sure you have lots of room to assemble. They destroyed the hammock within a week, and some food dish inserts on one of the levels would have been helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cage Doors too small","review":"This cage is plenty large enough.

We just left two stories and the tunnel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for Sugar Gliders","review":"If you are looking at this for a sugar glider beware. The slats are a little too far apart and small gliders can easily crawl through the bars. We purchased this to bring home our gliders and had to come up with something quick overnight because our female just slips right through the bars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rats","review":"Great cage for the price. Retail stores in my area have this around $130. Picked up from Amazon for around $80. Currently housing 3 rats (with a fourth waiting to move in) and they have plenty of room. Added an in cage wheel and some toys.Negatives- the rats pee and poop on the top level and it's a pain to clean. I've added a litter box since this started and it has gotten better. If your rats resist using the litter box, it could be frustrating.- rats can be pretty tough on the plastic ledges, ramps, tunnels if they are chewers. Expect to do some mending if you have a chewer.Positives- It's roomy. Alot of space to add toys.- It looks nice- Easy to move (wheels)- Affordable (I got it for around $80, you'll find a cage at petsmart half as big for the same price)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic bottom is a terrible idea.","review":"This cage is terrible. My two pet rats have lived in this cage for less than half a year and have already chewed a hole about 5'' by 3'' which, needless to say is easily large enough for them to fit through. I covered it with cardboard which they manage to chew off in one day. Another thing is that the ramps and tubes are so wobbly that my rats won't use them. They are also starting to chew through the bars. The first little platform is always covered in poop, seeds, and sunflower seed shells. It is a nightmare to clean because it falls apart and I had to zip-tie the corners together because there was a gap big enough for them to squeeze through. I would not recommend this cage to my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me count the ways...","review":"I bought this as the first home for my two ferrets since it looked like something they would have fun in and it was a great price...*Cleaning the base of the cage is difficult unless you have very long arms...*Cleaning around the tube, ramp, and slide is next to impossible (I removed them after 2 weeks)*My ferrets have taken to using the shelves as their litter box... In fact for two days straight they used nothing but the shelves (those have now been removed as well)*Although they are only 1 and 2 pounds, they have successfully figured out how to get out of the cage and have bent the door bars. I have to make sure it is \\"double locked\\" before leaving the house.I wish I had spent a bit more money and bought a cage that was longer and not taller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice cage for the price for ferrets :)","review":"Although the packaging strategy got the cage here to us with some bangs and broken parts, the actual cage is superb for our ferret. LOTS of room for her to roam and play! I love the easy access doors and it is super easy to clean. You could not find a better cage at this price anywhere! I paid $80 and that included shipping! Perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Good for Chew-Happy Animals","review":"My sister bought this cage for her chinchilla. We put both of our chinchillas (they are bonded) in and I ended up returning my chinchilla to its previous all metal cage after less than a day because despite the chew toys, she went right at the plastic. I had intended on buying one when another shipment came in and then decided against it. While my sister's doesn't chew a lot, we had to modify it by wiring mesh inside the cage to protect against any further damage. They managed to reach the top edge of the base through the original wire.The only other downside that I noted is accessory setup. While it is a decent size, it is hard to place a larger wheel (we use the 14\\" silver surfer) without impeding the shelving. As it is, we had to connect one shelf to the lower front door rendering it inoperative.Overall it is a good cage. But if your chinchilla attacks most plastic in sight like mine does, you might consider a different cage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good at first, but cheaply made.","review":"I like many others was looking for a cheaper ferret cage until I could save up for the FN cage. Don't buy this. While my female kit loves the slide and loves climbing the sides, the bars have snapped twice and I had to return it today for another one. The plastic is very cheap and I find it bending under her, and she's only 2 pounds. The tunnel doesn't fit in the spot it's supposed to, and my ferret is able to take off the secure clips on the side. All in all, it's not worth your money. Go for the more expensive cage. It's better in the long run."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cage is huge!","review":"our rat needed a new cage so i went online and read the reviews and decided on this one. it's huge!! just an FYI- if you have baby rats this will not work because the spacing of the bars is too far apart. for adult rats, it's fine. it was really easy to put together. we had a hard time putting the tunnel and slide together but everything else was fine. our little guy was unsure about the tunnel and slide at first but he figured it out and now he seems to love all the space he has. i love that there is a door on the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard to clean","review":"I have 2 ferrets to house in this cage. Meaning, I have to clean this thing frequently. Biggest pain in the ass I've ever dealt with. My ferrets are also stubborn and refuse to use a litter box and kick out any bedding I use, so all of their urine runs to the middle, so they get to hang out in their own smelly mess all day.When I finally muster up the will to clean this cage every 3 days, I have to fight with this thing.Also, they don't play on the \\"slides\\". They just rip them off the hinges and throw it into their waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap crap and more crap!","review":"We bought this for our ferret and it would have been okay that it was so late if it wasn't so broken. Our box showed up and it was all dented and had looked like it had been thrown around. A wheel was broken right out of the box and we thought we could work around it but then we noticed that several of the latches where broken off. We couldn't even put it together! I'm sure that if it hadn't been broken it would have been a wonderful product but it was broken so it was crap crap and more crap. I hope our replacement is better then this one! Warehouse deals should pay more attention to the quality products they give there customers... Bad first impression and once we get this figured out it will be last!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"I was so excited when I purchased this for my two rats. Unfortunately when I received it, I notice the bar spacing was much larger than in the description, especially where they bent apart due to cheap materials and bad shipping. I tried to put it together anyway, trying to be optimistic that my rats wouldn't try to get out. I could not get the pieces together. The plastic on the slide would start to bend and just as I was about to actually get the pieces together they slipped and I scrapped my knuckle. So much for \\"E-z directions\\". I am now bleeding, though the nice thing was that it was much easier to take apart than put together.I DO NOT recommend buying this. EVER!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No good for ferrets","review":"This cage is a very cheap cage. When we first bought this cage, we had two ferrets. It is very easy to set up, but the plastic is very easy to break. The \\"slide\\" broke while we were putting it together. The ladder was too steep for them to use (the ferrets were still really little at the time), so they just turned it into a toy. The cage itself kept coming undone in the corners. Also, one of the ferrets figured out how to unlatch two of the doors, the one on the roof of the cage, and the one in the middle. The shelves are bent from the ferrets standing one them, and they weigh maybe at the most 2 pounds. I did like the fact that it was easy to snap the cage off the bottom to change it, but the bottom has little latches, and those broke within the first couple weeks. Another thing I liked about the cage is that the bottom was deep enough for them to go to the bathroom and not get it every where.This probably would be a better cage for rats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all!","review":"I've been looking for a good cheap cage for my chinchilla, and this one works very well. I actually found my cage on craigslist for only 15 dollars, but paying 100 for a big cage isn't bad at all. One feature that I like is the fact that there are small groves on each platform so that poop does not just roll off the side of the cage. I also live in an apartment, and tend to move from place to place often, so the fact that the metal part of the cage folds down completely flat is very nice. I also love the wheels so that I can just push it around when I need to vaccum under my chinchillas cage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as Advertised","review":"This is an awesome ferret cage. Both of my ferrets love this thing. Just put a treat for each at every level and they will figure it out.

Chins love to climb and hop, so this is great for them! The bottom keeps the bedding in nicely, and the shelves accessing the doors are really nice to say hello to your chinchilla - mine was trained to come out on the door when I opened it and I could pet him. It is the best cage to clean and to roll around for easy access."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I have replaced the bottom of this cage 4 times!!!! My rats chew through it easily. One time, it only took a day for them to chew through it. I am really getting sick of paying $30 for a replacement piece of plastic! It is really hard to clean too!!! Also, The rat poop and hay is all over my floor. I think it would be better if it was made of metal and had taller sides!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreed: Cheap is Cheap.","review":"As most others have said, (which I wish I had read prior to purchasing), this is made with extremely cheap material. My slide was broken out of the box and I sent it back to the local pet store to replace. The ramp is a joke and neither stays on nor functions as a suitable walk-up ramp. I've had for one week and already the shelves are all sagging (she's just a baby ferret!!) I don't have a problem cleaning it out, but I haven't found a litter pan that fits correctly either. My ferrets just try to climb up to the shelves by vertically scaling the walls. We took out the ramp and slide and just use various hammocks now for them to walk from hammock to shelf to hammock to shelf. Save your money and buy one that will last. I'm already trying to figure out how to stabilize the shelves...after a week. Pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"We have two chinchillas and they love this.

The only plus is that the doors lach good."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good for Ferrets","review":"I brought this home for my fuzzy, and I wish I'd gotten something else. The tunnel at the bottom is too small, so he ignores it, and the windy ramp thing on the 2nd level isn't sturdy at all. I've actually had to reinforce it so it stops wobbling when he steps onto it. Again, though, it's too small; he just uses it to step up to the next level and ignores the holes. I suspect this cage would work well for rats, since they're smaller, but save yourself the trouble if you're buying this for a ferret. I'd rather have simple ramps in the cage between the levels, and I can tell that my little guy agrees with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not built for ferrets at all.","review":"I don't know if this cage works better for other critters but its not built for ferrets at all. The ramps aren't at the correct angle for my fuzzy to walk up them. Its also a PAIN to clean and take apart. (Which happens when your litter training a ferret) I received this cage free from someone else but its not even worth being free. When I upgrade I'll probably just throw this away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing parts","review":"The cage itself is nice, and would be perfect for my ferret. However the package was missing most of the pieces. The sides and pan and shelves were the only thing in the package, no accessories. So we have a stationary cage (no wheels) with no way for the ferret to travel between the levels except to climb the sides and nowhere to sleep. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for rats","review":"Bought to be used with a pair of rats. Took a lot of assembly, wire gauge was \\"eh\\", hammock is tissue thin, and the rats spent the first few hours exploring the outside of the cage -- they fit right through the bars. Plastic was high quality and it's a huge cage. Too bad. The rattys are sleeping under glass tonight."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this cage with a passion.","review":"I am so disappointed with this cage. I did a lot research on different cages, including reading several reviews here. I have 2 rats and do not see what the rat people on here see in it. It's extremely flimsy. How this is supposed to hold ferrets is a mystery to me. The actual bars connect so poorly that they pop apart with little effort, the spacing of the bars where the panels connect is much larger than the bar spacing. The slide broke right away. The tube never quite came together how it should. Its entire design, door placement etc. make it a HUGE pain in the behind to clean or rearrange the shelves. Dont waste your money, I'm thinking the people who say it's great for the price get ripped off a lot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible quality","review":"This cage is horrible. I could go on and on about how much I hate it.-my ferret has no room to play in it.-the ramp and slide broke in about a month.-he has to climb the side of the cage witch makes an awful sound when you are trying to sleep.-my baby ferret that i only had for a few months died because he fell off the top shelf. (horrible safety problems)-they cold easily get out of the doors. I had to go out and buy locks so they didn't escape. (again with safety)-the shelves sag, and they collect food and poop in the little grooves, it makes it really hard to clean.-the tiny doors also make it hard to clean.I just absolutely hate this cage. After ronnie died I went out and bought a quality cage company ferret cage. It was with the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"At first glance, I loved this cage for my pet rats. It was recommended to me by a sales associate at PetsMart. First, my young rats could get through the bars!Second, the shelves don't stay where they're supposed to stay. They pop out of place.And cleaning the cage? Forget it. It takes forever to clean, the shelves pop out of place, and the top won't come off easily to clean the bottom.I promptly returned this cage and bought a Critter Nation Double."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a chew proof cage!!","review":"My rats chewed THROUGH the bottom of this cage. Do not buy it if they are nibblers. I came home to find a hole about the size of a softball in the purple tray at the bottom.I suggest the Rat Manor over this cage any day. Again, this cage is NOT CHEW PROOF!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good size but not very convenient.","review":"I tried the SuperPet cages with ferrets and rats. While SuperPet models do offer a ton of space for your fuzzies, the design is just not user-friendly. The doors are very small and it can be tough getting access to all of your food dishes, hanging toys, and critters. The shelves have a little groove on the inside which tends to collect urine, kibble, and water. They do not unhook from the cage easily, so unless you wipe everything down before pulling it out, you're likely to scatter yuckiness everywhere.The cages are very heavy and awkward. Yes, you can unhook them from the bottom and clean them as two separate pieces, but getting both to a bathroom or outside for cleaning can be a real chore. They do offer a lot of customization possibilities, but the difficulty of moving things around and putting things back in after a cleaning are just not worth it. I'd rather get a Ferret Nation or a Martin's."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"my cage came missing the top piece so i had to destroy their old cage to use piece to make a top myself.

It is very roomy and gives them the ability to actually move around without immediately running into the cage walls. It was easier to follow how to set it up from the picture on the box for an item or two, then it was on the instruction sheet. After a month, they are more comfortable climbing the ramps, slides and tunnels. The only sign of chewing is on the bottom corner of the ramp. You might as well save yourself the trouble of hanging the hammock and let them use it as bedding. Couldnt figure out the \\"safety\\" latches, since the whole bottom of the cage clips onto the plastic base. Would have perferred a metal base, but my rats are more concerned about where to hide the food, then chewing through the plastic. There is ample room for atleast another rat or two, and possibly more shelving to hold toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good!","review":"I really loved this product. i liked how big it was and how many levels it has. This only problem was that i thought it was going to be perfect for my rats. It did work for my rats and they do love it, but one of my rats is kinda small and she can squeeze through the wires very very easily. Although, my other rat cannot fit through the wires because she is way too fat. We were able to fatten up my other rat so she cannot fit now. i would recommend this but make sure, if you have rats, they are pretty big. Rats can fit and squeeze through small spaces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks!!","review":"I bought this product for my rats. They were able to get out through the bars, so I had to cover the whole cage with black screen. Fastened on with 100 tiny black zip ties. That was fine. It looks very good, and the rats love it. It is the largest most luxurious home 2 rats ever had! I also bought a pet tunnel which was recommended and the rats sleep in there. Awesome product but has to be customized for smaller rodents like mine. Absolutely no complaints or negatives. Great! Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Ferrets","review":"I have two ferrets from a prior owner who had this cage and a Marshall cage. We decided to put this one in my boyfriend's house for when I visited. The cage really isn't for ferrets - they are fully grown and too big to go up or down the slide or through the tubes. One of them just climbs up the bars to get up and down. This is probably great for rats and hamsters and such, but definitely not for ferrets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Small","review":"The cage was in great condition and easy to put together for me but the size was really small for just one of my ferrets.

It takes 60 minutes with the warm up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good intermediate workout ;-0","review":"While I like this workout, I certainly have better workouts from Kelly. This one is good though for your abs and upper body. There are two main workouts here and both are about 30 minutes all up. They are tough and leave you feeling it the next day (or two) but sticking to it will definately give you results.The first workout is for chest, back and your legs and the second one is for shoulders and biceps and triceps. I like the music that's used here because I find it motivating. There is also an additional ab section which is helpful and good to do. I feel that this is lacking upper body work like flies and chest presses. It almost seems a little incomplete, yet doing this is obviously better than not doing any work at all.Kelly is encouraging and outgoing but not annoying. This dvd gets it done in a short amount of time but you will certainly feel the burn and yet have fun at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout dvd","review":"There are already excellent reviews for this dvd.

But some days I am time crunched to do aerobics and strength training and I need those active rests. It is awesome they are there! I am going to try other dvds of hers.

I also agree with another reviewer that Kelly and her back-up girls are scary looking...way too masculine for me to strive for that look. Kelly looks angry through most of the workout.

I bought it for the 30 minute all in one workout and it was awful. The woman looked incredibly masculine. The woman that was leading it didn't control her weights properly she was using her body to lift them rather than using muscle control and I didn't like the exercises she used with the leg behind. The girl in the back on the left with blondy/brown hair had much better form with all the exercises. The disc was scratched as well, so I sent it back.

I was a little shocked when the notes started out with Adam and Even and gave a hasty summary of biblical and then mythological characters from the ancient Greeks and Romans to explain that Odin and his kin were \\"real\\" mythological people.

It is a great gift for those who need to travel; it won't take up too much baggage space.

It is a murky film shot in grainy black and white, a jumble of 5-10 second snippets--mostly isolation shots of dancers' feet. This reduces flamenco to nothing more than flashy footwork. The viewer is left with no sense of the use of the arms (very important for female dancers), the choreography nor the interplay of dancers with the singer and guitarists. All we are left with is a confused jumble of very noisy and disjointed footwork. For a real look at flamenco, watch Saura's \\"Flamenco.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great documentary","review":"This is a wonderful vision of the director, which I don't feel must be a full out flamenco concert.

ALL the villainous characters were Christians; ALL the nice characters were Jews or hoped to be converts to Judaism. Choosing to make two characters midwives is a good idea: this opens discussions of conditions for women in a natural way, and assures that some of the characters, because of their skills, circulate at many levels in the society, from low to high. I would have liked more discussion of the contradictions in Judaism between the literate, Torah reading men (that could never have been all men, though) and their illiterate women counterparts, who believed (in common with pagans) in all manner of demons--which would be at odds with the first commandment.a retired English teacher"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as I Expected","review":"After reading such great reviews, I had high hopes for this book. However, it did not live up to my expectations. In the description on the back, it talks about how Joheved must basically choose between her love of the Talmud and martial happiness. That didn't play out at all in the book. In fact, it was pretty minor. She really didn't keep her studies all that hidden. I was kind of annoyed by the style of writing. It seemed to jump from character to character or event to event without me even realizing where we were going. There was a lot of sex that almost bordered on the ridiculous side.

Book I","review":"Historical fiction is my favorite genre of books. I especially like stories involving strong women. This was very interesting to me. I learned that at that period, many average middle class Jewish men and many women were educated. Culturally, the holy scriptures shaped all aspects of daily life, and worship in addition to being spiritual, was a big part of social life and entertainment at the time. The book examines many talmudic passages which becomes tiring, but I think worth the effort in understanding the characters. If you enjoy learning about historical cultures, this would be for you. For those looking for action, they probably would not like it. I for one found it a good read and will read the next books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learned a great deal!","review":"I loved the book because I learned so much about the Jewish faith and the life of people, in particular women, of that period.

While the first 100 pages of Book I held my interest, it deteriorated into little more than a trashy romance novel with little historical value. Book II, however, was AWFUL. Anton makes baseless accusations about loveless marriages and sexual proclivities of real people, without regard for the truth. She admits, in a note at the end, that there is NO BASIS for her allegations. This goes way beyond mere \\"artistic license\\".

All the secret \\"rendezvous\\" and sexual descriptives are highly unbelievable and quite frankly, a slap in the face to all of the religious beliefs and morals that these young woman believed in.

Several times I started to put it down but I kept reading right through to the end. This has nothing to do with it being a good book, but that this is just not the type of book I normally prefer. I found the book a bit tedious but one thing kept me going. The one thing that kept me going was the way the book ties everyday life to the Talmud. As a matter of fact, this may be the best introduction yet to Talmud since it provides little snippets of Talmud weaving it into everyday life. That was a nice touch and as far as I know a unique one.

He came from the group Alaska, and he sings flat. That in itself is not so bad. I like many flat singers: Lou Reed, Ray Davies, Kiera Knightley.But his STYLE here is hideous. Instead of singing, he SHOUTS. So all his vocals seem strained. He is trying too hard, compensating for crummy material. This is the awful style made famous (or infamous) by Kansas and Styx.

He could have made much more of the water, the beaches, the yachting, the sport fishing that give the islands their vibrancy.

He finds himself among other exiles from America and Europe but who seem to float through their lives there while he is buffeted by constant ups and downs. The story has the feel of the late 50s, and does reference 'the new year' of 1960 at one point. One of the charaters, Iris Tramm, is a failed Californian movie star who, it is implied, may have been a casualty of the blacklisting craze of the early 50s.

Numbers on the rule are stamped so hard into a piece of metal - which I'm sorry, if that's 'steel,' they've found a way to make it soft as lead - that the slider binds on the cratering around the numbers. the slider is a combo of cheap metal and plastic usually seen in toys.

He and I both loved words, and so this was a perfect gift for us to enjoy together -- especially since it is so much fun to read aloud.The book goes letter by letter through the alphabet, picking a big word that begins with each letter (starting with \\"Antediluvian\\"), and then discussing the meaning and origins of each word, often syllable by syllable, with plenty of charming digressions. The style is winsome and light, on the order of the Just-So Stories.It's too bad that \\"The Abecedarian Book\\" is out of print now, but it's definitely worth the effort to find -- especially if you're a word-loving grandparent with a word-loving grandchild."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"The Abecedarian Book has proven to be wonderful nightly reading for myself and my five and a 1/2 year old son.

Not only are the often grainy and out of focus but the subject car is often dirty, under poor lighting, or are heavily customized (the author says 'tastefully', I disagree.)

The garden trowel was too weak, and I ended up pulling a back muscle trying to use a miniature pick-axe in hard packed gravel. With the lesche, the tip is narrow and strong enough to dig between and pry up gravel and other hard materials, and makes digging a proper plug in soft grass a breeze.

Meeting her fiance, Henry Phillips, in the first novel, we quickly learn that his deplorable qualities are not at rest.Emily Briggs treats her mishaps with a light-hearted humor that's infectious.

Picked this up out of a bargain cart in Borders and sat down to read it last night. Got through about 4 chapters and fell asleep. Picked up this morning to try and read again? I couldn't get past chapter 6. The worst thing about the book was the nonexisitent plot and characters. Emily Briggs was a confusing chracter, and was spoiled, selfish and vain with no redeeming qualities. Her fiance seemed to be a cad and boring person. Whoever said this book wasn't fluff or about shopping was wrong. Emily spent all her time going on numerous shopping trips around town and wasted chapters doing nothing but complaining loudly. This book was obviously made up of filler material to meet a contract deadline.As others have said, the grammar is appallingly bad in this novel, which made an otherwise bad novel simply terrible.I'm disappointed and will not read anything else from this author.

I picked it up because I was newly engaged and wanted a good read about a character who also didn't want to become a Bridezilla. Well, there's hardly any talk of weddings at all, and Emily turns out to be completely self-centered and is someone I definitely wouldn't want to know. The author spends far too much time talking about products and things, which totally overwhelms any semblance of plot. Also annoying are the \\"profound\\" paragraphs written about topics like 9/11 that seem to either be reactions of the author (not the character) or vain attempts to make Emily have some dimension...until, of course, she goes to get her 2nd Birkin bag (which she can't afford) and pines for another LV bag (which she also can't afford, but isn't it cute and funny that she can't?)

I was desparate for something to while away the hours on a long distance flight. I read a lot of chicklit, and have been very impressed by some of it. And I've been unimpressed but still enjoyed most of it. And then there's this book. It's terrible. The story is poorly plotted, the character seems to be a Bridget Jones rip-off but without having the courage to go the whole hog. But my biggest complaint is that it is so appallingly badly written. In many places I had to read sentences three or four times just to see if it was me or if it was really this badly written. Who knows what the editor was doing.Don't waste your money.

My best girlfriend passed this book on to me with much disgust and I soon found out why. There are actual words spelled wrong in this book, something which I have never seen in a published novel. When I was about to chapter 3, I began getting extremely bored because there was no plot whatsoever. Emily Briggs seems to be a spoiled and selfish character and her fiance is the most ridiculously boring person I have ever encountered in a novel. After forcing myself through more chapters it was much of the same meaningless nonsense and soon I gave up and threw the book across the room.I do not recommend or encourage anyone to read this unless you can find it in a local library FOR FREE.

For readers of the author's novel, The Fabulous Emily Briggs, Henry appears to be Emily's ideal match. Enter J3, a media mogul who has Emily's attention.The scenes in New York are as detailed as a Woody Allen movie, the dialogue as witty and fun.Also, the book is less about a bride's manic wedding planning, more of an account on relationships.

Scott's technique is similar to Paul Gilberts, lot's of string skipped arpeggio's at more than ridiculous speeds. This is not the point of this CD though. He covers styles from blues (Hey Leiato) to fusion (Next) to Bluegrass (Mule Skinner) to straight rock (Sunday Drive) doing each style justice while showing off his blistering lead work.

Where this book stands out, (and how,) is in the wording, which is simply, literally, early Nabokovian.

Apparently he partially wrote it languidly sprawled on a beach sometime during an idle period in his late twenties, and it shows. It is a bright piece of fiction, but lazily put together. The characters do not sparkle, the love traingle plot is tiresome, and even the style seems somewhat deadened - there are some highlights, such as country boy Franz blundering myopically through Berlin without his glasses - but too much of this novel attempts whimsical virtuousity but ends up coming across as sterile.

He doesn't romanticize - he tells everything exactly like it \\"is\\" & makes it extremely real.Very suspenseful at the end, although I see the description on this site reveals the entire ending, so it ruins it for any potential readers!So don't read that, just read the book.

I can even get over the silliness about him being a masked hero running through the streets, but I cannot stand the slander of his early life. If you aren't going to speak the truth about holy men, avoid their stories completely. BTW he was not Greek, he was from Turkey. Getting kinda sick of the Orthodox=ethnic associations that seem to be acceptable.

Wendy is not exactly a feminist, after all, and the Indians are not in any sense Native Americans. The jokes about them are not the sort that would be acceptable today. And it's too late for the dream of a boy who never grows up. We've heard about \\"The Peter Pan Syndrome,\\" and I even married one. That was Husband Number Three, actually.There's also the fact that it's very much a boys' story, and for more reasons than the unrealistic depictions of females: Wendy, Tinkerbell and Tiger Lily. Even as a child, I didn't see the point to the fake combat against the Indians and the pirates. And I considered Peter impossibly arrogant; I still do.I would not recommend this to your children and grandchildren, unless you are prepared to do a good bit of explaining the differences between 1953 and 2012."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peter pan DVD set","review":"The disc was made for eurpeon DVD players and it won't play in the us made DVD players.

I like Wendy and John and (of course) Peter Pan. Captain Hook and Mr. Smee are funny too. I also like the mermaids...they are so pretty! However, this movie is probably least like the book out of all the Disney movies. In the book, Wendy's father doesn't even threaten to give her her own room! The book actually was better than the movie, which I gave four stars because they were so different. My favorite part of the movie was where they were at Mermaid Lagoon, where Captain Hook was dangling off a cliff and Peter said \\"I say Captain, do you hear something?\\" and you heard the ticking of the crocodile. I don't know why that was so funny to me.Anyway, this is a cool movie, and if you haven't seen it you definitely should rent it. : )P.S.What was the DEAL with Peter Pan's voice in the sequel? It is TOTALLY weird!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Advertising!","review":"The Peter Pan cartoon is a classic, but the problem with this DVD is that Disney put about two hours of previews on this DVD set that you are forced to sit through before the actual movie comes on. You can try to forward through these previews, but it still takes quite awhile to click through them all. It's too bad that advertising is Disney's first priority."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many stereotypes and violence for a children's film","review":"I ordered both the Walt Disney Peter Pan video and the Mary Martin Peter Pan video for my son at the same time and the differences between the two are shocking. Walt Disney has exaggerated to the point of stereotyping many aspects of the story. For example, Tinkerbell, who represents a spirit in the story of Peter Pan, in the Walt Disney version is such a flirt and jealous, as well as overly concerned with how big her hips are that the whole meaning of her is lost. The indians in the Walt Disney version are stereotyped as well and I was shocked that as my son now says Indians don't have faces. The Walt Disney version contains much unnecessary violence. All and all the Mary MArtin Peter Pan is so much more heart-warming and magical and fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated and Disappointing","review":"My wife and I are big Disney fans and purchased this movie with a lot of anticipation. We were both extremely disappointed. Almost all of the characters in this film are cruel and unlikeable, including Peter Pan himself. Tinkerbell is nasty and consumed with jealousy, completely one-dimensional, and Peter is a shallow, self-absorbed imp. It's hard to imagine anyone--especially sweet Wendy--liking him. Even minor characters like the mermaids are given a jealous, petty edge.The playful theme that we associate with the Peter Pan tale is almost nowhere to be found in this movie. I can see by all the positive reviews that my view is in the minority, and that's okay. I really wanted to like this movie, but couldn't. I kept hoping that Captain Hook--who had his hand cut off by Peter and fed to a crocodile (!)--could get ahold of bratty Peter and teach him a lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peter Pan","review":"This was a gift for my granddaughter.

Look I know this film has been released in so many different formats before it's hard to count and yes I have owned a couple of those editions but this is the first time I have owned it on Blu Ray and let me tell you this is the best it has ever looked. Peter Pan was released 60 years ago and with this release it looks like it was made yesterday. The packaging is beautiful I love that image of Big Ben and the shadow of peter. The features include some never before seen deleted scenes/songs in storyboard form but still very interesting the rest are mostly carried over from the dvd releases and it also includes mini games whenever you pause the film which is something I have not seen before and might be fun for the young ones very cool.

It portrays the desire of children to fly, have a magical friend, and travel to a world of adventure. Its a simple story with moral lessons. The biggest aftereffect is that it stimulates a child's imagination.Disney brings to life the classic children's story. After watching the movie all the way through I turned on the audio commentary by Roy Disney while watching it a second time.

I grew up with the Mary Martin LP and was IN a performance of it when I was in about 3rd grade, so admittedly I know it better in the musical version and would not tolerate any deviation well, but YE gods. Cartoonish, offensive caricatures of Indians, pirates, busy dads, women and girls, a portrayal of Tinkerbell as homicidally jealous of Wendy, and not even the redeeming \\"Clap if you believe in fairies\\" line - that was completely left out. I do not remember this version from my childhood and ended up sorry that it was my daughter's introduction to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racism","review":"I am a huge fan of the original book Peter Pan, and there are definite aspects of racism toward Native American Indians in the book, but they are not NEARLY as overt or offensive as they are in the Disney edition. I had totally forgotten (since I saw it when I was young) about the terribly racist treatment of the Native Americans in this film. If you're committed to the fight for racial justice, don't buy this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"author hates or fears women","review":"I am an adult who usually enjoys Disney movies, but this is the worst one I've ever seen. The author and/or adaptors into cartoon, portray all female characters except Wendy as jealous and malicious. Tinkerbell is jealous of Wendy and tries to get others to hurt her. The mermaids are jealous of Wendy and mistreat her. Then even Wendy becomes jealous of the Indian princess. The boys have all the fun, and Peter seems to relish the girls sniping at eachother over his attention. Very shallow and disappointing cartoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist","review":"My wife and I were shocked to rewatch this recently. We couldn't believe how generations now have fed this racist, sexist garbage to their children.

This movie fosters so many negative stereotypes about native americans and women/girls that I just can't take it any more. I do not want my daughters growing up to think that native americans are ugly and unintelligent. Or that all women are jealous and malicious. Its really appalling. I love fairies, mermaids and even an occasional pirate but there aren't enough in this movie to make me tolerate such racism. I am sure my little girls will cry when I throw it out. Maybe I will get them a new tinkerbell movie where the girls aren't all vying for one little boys attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"disney racism at its worst","review":"I am sorry to say that the 'new' version of Peter Pan does not leave out the terribly racist scene depicting Indians as redmen unable to speak in complete sentences, willing to make anyone a member of their tribe and hand out eagle feathers to anyone who comes around. I am surprised this flies now a days, but apparently people aren't bothered by racism when those offended are fewer in numbers. It would be interesting to see what the backlash would be if this were another minority group.If you wish to raise tolerant children, pick another movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Movie, but Great Symbolism!","review":"I won't lie. It's been over six years since I have actually seen this movie. Back then I didn't like it. I still don't. But now, I have realized something: there is symbolism in this movie. You see, Peter Pan represents a certain someone. Who, you ask? Come closer. Now, we all know that the character Tinkerbell was modeled after, (or at least drawn to the likeness of), Marilyn Monroe. Coincidence? I don't think so. Can you guess who Pan is yet? Oh-kay, Peter Pan stands for John F. Kennedy- you know, irresponsible, young, womanizing, etc. Don't believe me? Look at Pan! He's dressed in green, the color of the Irish. He associates with not one, not two, but three women in this film. Sounds like JFK to me. Wendy stands as the voice of reason, Jackie. Captain Hook, of course, is Lee Harvey Oswald, and that alligator... or crocodile... thing, is Jack Ruby. Odd, isn't it?Well, I hope you've enjoyed this little essay... or review... or... ah, whatever."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can people rate a dvd not released until march","review":"I do not know how one can rate a dvd not released until March??????

Your heart's in the right place, Charles (fellow Atlantan!) and you're absolutely correct to insist that PETER PAN isn't a widescreen film...but KING & I most definitely WAS NOT the first widescreen movie. That honor likely falls to Abel Gance's 1927 masterpiece NAPOLEON. Even in the modern era, Fox had had their Cinemascope process going strong for 3 years by the time KING & I appeared. The first Cinemascope film was THE ROBE, released on September 16, 1953, followed by BENEATH THE 12 MILE REEF the same year and then dozens of others. It IS true that the first widescreen cartoon feature did not appear until 1956: Disney's own LADY AND THE TRAMP, also in Cinemascope. At any rate, buyers can approach this disc with confidence; nothing at all is \\"cut-off.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Joan work essential listening","review":"'Whatever's For Us' was once a difficult album to find, and is probably why alot of people thought that her career began with 1976's self titled album.'Whatever's For Us' is simply a stunning album with some beautiful piano playing. Highlights include 'Alice' and 'It Could Have Been Better'. The opening track 'My Family' is the perfect choice, and as the inner sleeve notes suggest, very early Elton John sounding.The repackaged CD allows us all to truly appreciate the beginning of Joan Armatrading, who in my opinion is underrated in many countries. This CD also includes a bonus single which was also previously hard to find.If you buy this, then the album \\"Joan Armatrading\\", you will really appreciate this fine artist. Two listens of the song \\"Love and Affection\\" will cement your thoughts on how great she is."},{"rating":"2","title":"lyrical, smooth-flowing album. So happy to have it.","review":"I love Joan Armatrading's early stuff best, and this is my favourite of hers. Her song-writing partnership with Pam Nestor produced an album that has a different feel to her later work. It feels more natural, more vibrant, not as wallowy, with a wonderful edge to it. Quietly rythmic, more lively, but without being too poppy, it's great to dance areound the house and sing to, or to have on in the background. My favourite song on the album is probably 'Child Star', I like the snide, looking-sideways-at-your-peers tone and the clear acoustic guitar, but all of the songs are good, after a few listens, I came to really like the album as a whole. It's incredible, looking back, to think that it's her first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware, the Cliff's Notes Jane Eyre guide is full of mistakes","review":"I'm a college English Professor, and first became aware of this particular guide when a student turned in an essay based upon this guide, without having read the novel. I was unable to account for the numerous factual errors in her essay (including misidentification of characters and major plot events), until I found the Cliff's Notes guide, and discovered the source of her errors.

He ought to keep those vocal chords bathed in warm salt water so he can hang on to his day job because I don't see much of a future as a novelist. This story is about four rather uninteresting characters and the losers they hook up with. It is slow and repetitious. It is also full of typos, spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. The lazy writing and sloppy editing are best exemplified by the Freddy and Justin characters who first meet on the Fourth of July then celebrate their \\"two month anniversary\\" on Thanksgiving! Huh? The ending is so sappy and unbelievable that it is a fairy tale. But, then, maybe that's where Johnson gets it right because this is, after all, a fairy tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and Dull","review":"This guy got a lot of fanfare, but for what? Third is a whimsical, soulless, and downright wasteful span of near 300 pages covering the very same archetypal figures that pervade the Hollywood circuit. Compared with his picture, Third speaks of nothing but flat, dull images meant only to captivate at surface level. A few chapters in, you're swept, but in that rushing-rapids, I forgot the life jacket kind of way because, in the end, you really don't develop a care for meth addictions or compulsive sex -- and just when I thought I really could get into that family of origin, the Muscle Mary falls ridiculously short. Dear Ben, you're a good looking guy, but you should stick to the weights. Stop hawking your bod as a sign of your talent and leave the careful craft to those who hunger for it, not for some guy who needs something to do between electronically digitized voiceovers.

I am basically half way through the book and seriously considering dropping it. It is like a VERY BAD version of Sex & the City but only difference the characters are all gay and the lines not nearly as funny or intelligent. None of the characters, with maybe the exception of Claire have anything interesting or funny to say. Not to mention the countless typos and bad English used in sentences all over the book. For someone who obviously worships his own body, Ben spent way too much time writting about a greasy spoon breakfast place.

You rub it on like a crayon, but it is hard getting the wax to fill the nail hole and as you rub it on, it gets all over the wood - that is step one. The last three steps envolve removing the excess wax. Maybe if you only had one nail hole to fill you would be satified with Softwax, though I find that questionable.

Most problems were related to character's values that make them do certain things. Emotions always seem like plot devices, not something real people would have, especially characters that are suppose to be empaths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great toy, but easy to destroy","review":"Our dogs love tennis balls, so loved the bone when we bought it. It gives to allow chewing on it and squeaks...but our lab/shepherd (who is an aggressive chewer) had the nub torn off within minutes....they still chew on it...but it is not a durable item for dogs who really chew.

When we got the first one (she was about 3 months old) I made the mistake of letting her \\"play\\" solo with it for awhile. She ate most of the fuzz pretty quickly so it became a \\"fetch only\\" toy. 7 months later it has almost no fuzz, the squeaker is gone and the rubber is cracked open (probably because it was lost in the snow for 2 weeks and froze). So I got another which is still intact a few weeks later with almost daily use (outdoor fetching only).

I think that all of Bob's music can make for intersting analysis but the one in particular that never ceases to fascinate me is the 79-81 music.

The camera work and lighting is terrible and the interviews are punctuated by weird pop up art and poorly done computer graffics. Watch it if you want to see Rubin Carter sweat under severe lighting in the back room of some photography studio interspersed with cartoon images of boxing gloves and prison bars. Seriously.There are some redeeming moments in the interviews with Ramblin' Jack Elliott and Scarlett Rivera etc. but you really have to fastforward through so much hokum to get to them that it is hardly worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Bob?","review":"This is a retrospective of Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue put together by people who Dylan knew. Too much about Hurricane Carter, and too many interviews about Bobbie,but NO DYLAN! I wanted to hear his misic at those concerts, not a bunch of lengthy interviews from people who really had little ot nothing to do with Dylan's performance in 1975-76.They intersperse a so called Dylan impersonator.

This is the best of the series and I'd recommend starting with it if you're new to Kathleen Taylor. She fills in the back plot smoothly. I thought the earlier ones suffered from clunky dialog and implausible plots. Her detective, Tory Bauer is an overweight forty-something widowed waitress who has lived and worked all her life in a small town in north-east South Dakota. They go to Aberdeen or Sioux Falls for the excitement of big city lights. There are romantic comedy elements that may put you off if you're allergic to those ingredients. Chapters begin with \\"dear reader\\" type essays that invoke the great ones and ask what Kinsey Milhone or Miss Marples would have done. I thought it was an interesting gimmick myself. It's a few years since the last Tory Bauer book but Kathleen Taylor has a great WEB site still."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contradictions are significant","review":"Normally I truly enjoy the Tory Bauer series, however this book was a disappointment. When the suicide note said the victim was ODing and on what, and the note was read by our protagonist and others, then the note turns up missing and the ambulance driver asks what they thought she'd taken and the author couldn't come up with a better cover than deniability (said info theoretically being able to save a life) this was inplausable. The series frequently harps on how terrible it is to die. This was the first major contradiction. The second deals with the same note and the fact that our protaganists had BROUGHT UP the subject with the chaperone, then when the chaperone \\"found\\" it, it was as if the subject had never come up. No wonder I was able to find the book used and cheaply. The rest of the books, while having their own contradictions, were not nearly so glaring and I could more easily suspend disbelief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring on Number 7!!","review":"Kathleen Taylor mixes a dry wit and enthusiasm for the potential drama of small-town living in the sixth installment of the Tory Bauer mysteries. There were several typos in the edition I read, but it didn't detract from the joy of reading Taylor's latest. This series has become one of my favorites.The characters are appealing and have a way of finding their way into and out of jams while simultaneously dishing up a slice of Midwestern living that even the most cynical of city folk will be able to enjoy.I am hoping that this is the latest of many Tory Bauer mysteries yet to come. She has many more stories to tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful, authoritative--and a beat you can dance to","review":"Frank Zappa is supposed to have once said that writing about music is like dancing about architecture--it doesn't make sense. He might have revised his opinion had he been able read Miller's latest work. Even if you have been weaned on music magazines and think you know everything there is to know about America's preeminent cultural contribution (just an opinion), you're going to get an education. But that's not the real reason to pick up this book. The bottom line is, it's just a good read--entertaining, challenging, provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly fascinating","review":"Until I read this book, I had a shallow understanding of the rise of rock...blues and folk got together, Elvis put a white man's voice on it, and the rest became history. Well, there's a lot more to it than that, and this book fills in the gaps. It reaches way back to the early part of the 20th century and then moves forward, weaving together the various musical influences, technologies, and marketing schemes that came together to give us rock as we know it. It stops at the arrival of Bruce Springsteen in the late 70s, when The Boss \\"saved\\" rock and roll from the disco and bubblegum stagnancy of the era. My one criticism is the author's over-appreciation for the likes of David Bowie, the Sex Pistols, the Doors, and (in my opinion) other overrated acts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"Isn't it interesting that rock 'n roll only seems to have validity to these scribes within certain contexts? Elvis, Chuck Berry, the Beatles, The Stones, The Velvets, Springsteen, Punk and (God help us) U2 all make the grade. As for anything else; You can have The Doors only with the caveat that they weren't really very good. Can't have Yes or Jethro Tull, they're too \\"Pretentious.\\" And Black Sabbath? Steely Dan? Crosby, Stills and Nash? Hey, folks, whether you want to admit it or not, THEY and a ton of other \\"musical pariahs\\" were much more a part of rock n'roll's POPULAR history than any critic's darlings ever were and omitting them calls into question how \\"sweeping\\" a so-called social history of rock really could be. This book is another bloated text along ROLLING STONE's party lines. It tells you nothing that hasn't already been written, shown on VH-1 and MTV and embalmed in the Rock 'N Roll Hall Of Fame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock died when Elvis did...I didn't know!","review":"This book begins with alternating chapters dealing with the creative and business side of Rock in alternating chapters. While interesting, this dry relating of information is preferable to the idea that very little music of note was created after the Sex Pistols, an idea that seems to grow as the book progresses. Elvis and The Beatles get their due but others whose impact was limited to style are favored over true originals. While Little Richard and Jim Morrisson definitely made an impact, were they true musical pioneers or was this a case of style over substance? The author is making a case for this concept and the idea of \\"selling out\\" is bandied about. Were classical composers selling out when they wrote for a fee or circumstance? I wasn't convinced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aussie legend...","review":"Great live recording of the Aussie legend! Title track is class act.

This was a poor choice on the professor's part. Apparently it received all kinds of praise, as can be seen on the back cover, but I don't really understand why. I tossed this on the floor after reading the first five pages, and was unable to pick it up again until the day before we were to have the reading finished. It's like reading something that some high school girl wrote one day out of boredom. The characters are unbelievable, the main character in particular seeming to be a form of self-indulgence on the author's part. It is overly-idealistic and romantic, even for the period in which it was written. I certainly would not recommend this novel to anyone, young or old. It is pure rubbish."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating read","review":"This is a great book for anyone interested in western history. Mr. Bronson gives an eyewitness account of the last Sioux Sun Dance which by itself makes the book worth reading. His eyewitness account of Dull Knife's heroic fight to lead the Cheyenne 700 miles from their Oklahoma reservation, where they were starving, to the nortern plains where they were finally captured ranks as one of the greatest stories of courage ever told.

His lively style makes the reader feel a part of those numerous actions.But the most important fact about this book is that nowhere else one can read such a detailed desription of the most noble, desperate and doomed struggle of a small group of the Native American \\"Indians\\", trying to survive the genocide."},{"rating":"2","title":"For young readers, Arliss and Old Yeller get a happy ending","review":"Typically, when a children's book or film is described as \\"a classic coming-of-age story,\\" adorable animals had better run for cover.

It has dozens of illustrations, going back hundreds of years. The illustrations are fairly well annotated, and the information they contain show the development and art behind kabbalistic principles from the 14th Century to modern times.However, the \\"book\\" portion - approximately 45 pages at the beginning - is a firehose of top level information on Kabbalah. Anyone without a good background it it is likely to become lost quickly, as there isn't enough space to really provide foundational information from which the writing in the book is built. Trying ro cover the history, philosophy, anatomy, esoteric, magical, spiritual and sturctural information in 45 pages just can't be done.Get this book for the art and the history that art represents. It is beautiful.

I found myself screaming as I read the tenth or so paragraph ..\\"when is someone going to say anything?\\"The author is on the faculty of the Graduate Theological Union and I feel that this work is more of a \\"publish or perish\\" article than a readable mystery.

Monkeys trained to use paper and pen? As a Hamptonite, I know that some of their material is dead-on accurate, however the flat prose, tired cliches, and just plain bad writing ruin this supposed \\"behind the scenes\\" book, which is just another soon to be forgotten trash novel.

A HUGE WASTE OF TIME."},{"rating":"2","title":"smart, witty, and fun: a true page turner","review":"The Perfect Manhattan is the perfect summer read! It blends romance, social commentary, comedy, and gossip within the lush backdrop of New York and the Hamptons.

It gave some great insight to what life is really like in the Hamptons, but beyond that, this book was boring. I found myself skimming pages instead of actually reading it, anxious to be finished. Nothing exciting happens. Lame story with no exciting climax. Cassie just goes to work everyday and learns more and more about bartending in the Hamptons. There is no solid ending either. I would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally flat","review":"I'm a little surprised that this book has such a good average rating.The Perfect Manhattan is a very light read, but despite that, it's not fun or quick. It is rather repetitive and drags on far too long. Basically, the same few scenes repeat over and over to cover the whole summer, and then suddenly the main character wakes up from her \\"love\\"-induced coma and gets smart about her boyfriend.The characters are flat. There is absolutely no development behind them, and the writing is really just not that good.I know this review is totally lazy, but just trust me, it's not that great a book. It's not unpleasant -- I finished it. But I kind of stuck with it just because I paid for it.

The story has depth and is well written, and the story stays with one after finishing the book. Perhaps it is not a fast read, but one does not want to read this fast. The reader should savor the excellent storytelling and consider the shoes the narrators walk in. It was a dark time in American history, and the story has a dark side, but there are some glimmers of hope. It is a well-told story."},{"rating":"1","title":"in the fall","review":"Although a first novel, which shows promise, Lent is too wordy and self-important which manifests itself in the prose. The book is depressing. The minute you turn to page two, you know that nothing good is going to happen to the characters. Lent copies too much from recent best-sellers, i.e., Cold Mountain, Beloved and Color Purple. If he would choose his own subject, perhaps his prose would flow better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to stop...","review":"I am a member of an online book club and this was a November selection. I kept reading even though I wanted to stop because the book club usually picks such excellent books. I kept waiting to find some redeeming quality with \\"In the Fall\\", it never appeared. I am amazed at all of the good reviews for this book on this site. The writing was so amateuristic and uninteresting. I have no understanding of how this book is getting an average of 4 stars.

While the storyline was good, the story could have been told in half the pages in the book. I even gave it to a friend to read and she quit after 40 pages. Very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Longest Read","review":"I found this book terribly tedious to read. Every action and statement of every character is dissected, discussed and analyzed ad nauseam. Sometimes a person wears a plaid shirt because it's the only clean one in the closet. I was looking forward to reading this book because the subject sounded fascinating, but I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could love it","review":"This is the third big novel to adopt Cormac McCarthy's style. At times, \\"In The Fall\\" slips over into parody. I'm only about 100 pages into it, and at times the writing is so good it's almost painful. But now it's like a soap opera and I've lost my ability to care for the characters. It doesn't have the story structure of \\"Cold Mountain,\\" which alternated Ada trying to survive on the farm while Inman struggled to get back to her, both powerful narrative hooks. I haven't read \\"Plainsong\\" yet, but I hope it will be better. I doubt if any of them are as good as \\"All the Pretty Horses\\" or \\"Blood Meridian,\\" which is my favorite novel still."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only book I've wanted to throw away","review":"It's not that the actual story is nonsense but they guy has included so much 'fluff' that you get board waiting on a paragraph with real content.

Really, I am. I want to like Norman. Leah, and the children. I just don't. The only character I found that had some semblance of life was Marthe Ballou, and she's dead already. I'm only halfway through the book and I just want to throw it against the wall because I'm so disappointed. After reading all the glowing reviews, I decided to shell out the extra cash and buy the hardcover. I wish I hadn't. Lent wants to be a spectacular writer, and I suspect that he has it in him, but he's trying too hard. This book is in serious need of a good editor. Too much useless verbage and characters with no life.

I mean, if someone can straighten me out, \\"I'm all ears,\\" in the words of Ross Perot. Can someone explain what is meant by these \\"run-on\\" sentences? Or can anyone get published these days?

Also, is all that graphic sex and violence really necessary to the narrative?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling and thought-provoking","review":"This is a book with an interesting premise that makes us look beyond the narrow parameters of our own lives and contemplate the difficulties of a black woman living in a white world in Vermont in an inter-racial marriage. The very act of a former female slave walking from Virginia to Vermont following the Civil War with a Union soldier who would become her husband is the type of prose that makes this book so interesting. The characters are well-defined and the plot flows easily. This was a random selection by me at the library, and I am now a confirmed Lent fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Read","review":"This book was an amazing read I could not put down. Lent is as poetically discriptive as Pat Conroy, and his insight into human nature was offered in a take-it-or-leave-it fashion I enjoyed. I learned from this book -- my personal test of a good book. It created value in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"The author truly keeps you turning the pages until the last wonderful chapter.

However, this is probably one of the most tedious books I have ever read, and I read fiction for a living. I picked up this book after reading interviews with several prominent (male) southern authors who said that Lent should be read by all. However, his prose is so affected that I wanted to scream. Please, God, find a subject and a verb now and again. The CONSTANT fragments ruined the rhythm of the writing and were so jarring that I almost became angrily frustrated as a reader. Lent is no Faulkner, and he would do good to find his own voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwritten good story","review":"One of the worst things one can say about a book is that \\"It was too long.\\" This book could and should have been shorter and what should have been left out was obvious.

Much too long and drawn out - I cannot image any reader failing to get impatient with it. 100 fewer pages would've done nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great in its own right","review":"I suppose the comparison with \\"Cold Mountain\\" is inevitable, given that book's critical and commercial success -- even Tony Earley made it in the New York Times' Book Review -- but it's also unfortunate. Both books start at the end of the Civil War, but that superficial connection really doesn't tell \\"Cold Mountain\\" lovers anything about \\"In the Fall.\\" Lent's themes, beside encompassing many decades beyond Appomattox, are far darker and more profound and the writing is compellingly daring as Lent performs a prose high-wire act with his metaphors and narrative surprises. (Nor is he as obsessed with showing off his command of 19th century detail as Professor Frazier) Take \\"In the Fall\\" on its own terms and you will be dazzled and moved."},{"rating":"2","title":"It deserves more than 5 stars!","review":"I was assigned this book for an AP Lit class. It was one of the best books we read all year. This book captures the Vermont that can still be found if you travel off the paved roads and into the backwater areas where dirt roads are still more numerous than their black-top cousins - right down to the dialect used: the word \\"liddle\\" immediately comes to mind. This book has everything - a plot line that is interesting, with twists and turns, yet is still not confusing; deep characters whose actions work on more than one level; and a good ending.Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"After In The Fall, anything I pick up seems second rate...","review":"This is a novel that has it all: well-developed characters that are sympathetic even when their actions are offensive; the moral question of slavery presented in a very thought-provoking and sometime troubling way; human failure; redemption; and finally, a prose that, once you catch its cadence and structure is truly a thing of beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely pictures, but the information is speculative.","review":"I really enjoyed the lovely paintings in the book. They portray the horse colors in an accurate way. I just would not be too quick to believe the author's explanation of these colors. There really is not much valuable information on genetics which other books explain much more thoroughly. But, even so, I would recommend the book to anyone looking for pictures of solid colored horses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"A friend gave me this dvd to try because other Pilates workout dvds I have not liked.

The best of both worlds. I'm in the military so I am constantly working out. I am always going on long runs but not much seems to tone my thighs.

I can see and feel the difference after one workout and after a week my legs are extremely toned.This is an excellent DVD to have if you want to tone your legs, butt, and thighs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent workout!","review":"I've used this DVD several times and found it to be very toning and a good workout. I just read the other readers' comments and I was surprised to find that this apparently isn't really Pilates. I hadn't done Pilates before, so that's what I thought I was doing. Oh well, it's an excellent workout, Pilates or not. I'm used to lifting weights at the gym and doing cardio, and this puts it all together. It looks deceptively easy, but doing it really works up a glow.I liked the instructor, found the pseudotropical decor a nice break from the usual exercise room thing, and the music was unobtrusive compared to some other exercise videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"This was a little challenging at first, but if you are like me and get bored with videos after a while, this is one to add to the collection.

While accessible, the intricacies and subtlety that lie below the surface will amaze any discerning listener. Like a fine wine or high end audio system only those who listen carefully or those who know will be able to detect the sheer genius in the songwriting on this album. How many modern \\"progmetal\\" bands have aspired to be what Fates was and is, including the mighty Dream Theater, even they could not reach the subtlety of Fates. The drumming by Mark Zonder on this album is beyond phenomenal, the guitar riffs are incredible.

After just ONE day of using this tea, I noticed a very significant increase in my milk supply - so much, in fact, that I had to start pumping excess milk because my daughter couldn't keep up! I drink it only twice a day (the directions say 3-5 times daily) with a little honey and really enjoy the taste. I don't feel that it's too strong, like other have said, but I suppose that's a matter of personal opinion. When I reach my goal of nursing for at least 12 months, I will have this tea to thank. I HIGHLY recommend it to any nursing women out there. I'm so glad I found it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tastes good","review":"But as far as it helping me produce more milk - not sure it helped much. Tastes good though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother's Milk tea, a great product","review":"When my daughter was born, I wanted nothing more than to breastfeed her. So when I was told she was not getting milk from me (that my milk hadn't come in, probably because I'd had such rough labor and too many drugs), I was heartbroken. I continued to nurse her but also gave her a bottle and when I pumped, I never got much. I tried several different lactation support products (fenugreek, blessed thistle, and other supplements) and other than the fenugreek, this tea worked best for me. I am still nursing her two times a day and I drink the tea three times a day. I would highly recommend it to any mom who feels like they just don't produce enough milk for their little on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great taste but no results.","review":"I really enjoyed this tea because of the taste, but I did not see the increase in milk supply as I had hoped.

I made GALLONS of this and drank it all the time....NO difference at all in my milk production.THe pills worked sooo much better. This was a complete waste. My baby also got very drowsy and lethargic while I was taking it so I stopped the tea and went on the fenugreek pills...the result? Happy alert baby and more milk production."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIDN'T WORK FOR ME","review":"After reading all of the great reviews I decided to try this...my baby is 7 weeks old and I am trying to stock up feedings in the freezer so I needed to produce more milk to do so. I tried the tea for 2 days and it actually DECREASED my milk supply so I stopped. So I read up on other ways to increase my milk supply...I read eating oatmeal helps and of course drinking lots of water. The oatmeal REALLY works!! I suggest eating oatmeal if nothing else is working for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"This sucks. It didn't work at all.

This is just not acceptable. I want the other 5 packs to be delivered directly to my Singapore address immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. This did not work and it was gross. I tried it for a week with no results. I was very disappointed. I then started eating oatmeal (my Dr. recommended it) and it increased my supply a little.

Godd luck =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pass the honey...","review":"It's a good thing this tea actually works as it's supposed to... because it tastes so, SO bad! I went from pumping 8 oz/day at work to 11 oz/day by the end of a week, and that was only using the tea twice a day. I'm not a tea fan to start with, and this has a very strong anise flavor... also not a favorite. With enough honey, I can tolerate it. The results are worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for me!","review":"I was given this tea in the hospital (a regular hospital, not anything alternative) while recovering from a c-section with my first child. I could not recommend it highly enough. I wasn't sure what to think of drinking a \\"medicinal\\" tea, but I was converted by this one product. It really did make a difference, at least for me. Used it again after the birth of my second child when I encountered some milk production issues and was pleasantly surprised all over again. It really made me rethink my attitude on herbal remedies- not something I gave much thought to before. The taste isn't great to be honest, but after your first few cups you adjust and it tastes just fine. I paid far less for it than it is currently listed for here, so shop around, not just online but in your local community. My local big chain grocery store stocks this and other Traditional Medicinals tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great for me!","review":"I almost lost my milk due to being sick and this tea + extra pumping really helped me bring my milk supply back.

It worked for me to maintain/increase my milk supply."},{"rating":"1","title":"this did not work for me","review":"dispite forgetting about it and letting the tea bag steep for about 45 minutes, the first night I drank this tea, it did absolutely nothing.

It only irrated my stomach and made me a little nauseated.

I am not sure whether it increased my milk since my production did not reduce after I stopped using it. However, be careful of the side effects! My baby showed diarrea, colic sympton, and stomach upset during my use of herb. All symptons went away after I got rid of Mother's milk. If you read PARENTING magazine of October 2011 issue(page 32), you'll know that ANISE, which is one of the main indegrients of Mother's Milk, might cause dangerous neurological problems of children.

This is one time I think correlation IS causation. Too bad too because I had finally found a way to get it down...drinking it with a werther's caramel in my mouth. Not healthy but it did the trick.

I've been told by lactation consultants that the amount of active ingredient to actually do any increase of milk production is minimal, and is best to go to herbal shops and get 'tinctures' of the fenugreek, but this is much more convenient, and it forces me to drink more liquids as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not satisfied","review":"I really did not see that this product hepled me in increasing my milk supply.

Taran is beginning his journey into manhood. He meets up with a lot of heroes and friends. Flewdder Fflam, Eilonwy, Prince Gwydion, and Gurgi. There are a lot of mysterious twists and turns to the book.

I must of read every single one of his works as a baby and I still love him. He is a rarity - a fantasy novelist for children who doesn't assume they are brain dead! Whether it's the Illyiad or Nausea with Sartre, Lloyd Alexander books are always something to be enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book of Three","review":"Until I reached the seventh grade, reading was boring to me. Then I was grounded to my room for a month(don't ask). I was reading \\"The Book of Three\\" in my english class and with all this extra time on my hands I actually decided to read the whole book for once. I was hooked. Then I got the remaining books in the series from my teacher and read them as well. I have been reading ever since. The book was just fantastic and I still enjoy re-reading them. Lloyd Alexander's books introduced me to a whole other world and showied me how much fun reading is. As a child I felt I could relate to Taran. Everyone I've lent these books to loves them as much as I do. I gave them to my teenage daughter to read the series still remains one of her favorites too. A great read for children and adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then I thought","review":"It was much better then I thought when I started.

The book is about a young boy living in prydain who wants to be a warrior, but is stuck to being a assistant pig-keeper in his small three person town. When a terrible evil arises tyhe pg runs away. In his search for his oricular pig he meets many friends,including the prince of prydain and many other interesting characters. He then finds his way around the magical realm of prydain. He battles the horned king in a last battle to the death. I thought that this book was terrific, and the best part is that it is only one of a series of five books. I would strongly recommend this book to all people who like fantasy and magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just another chidren's book","review":"I don't know how The Prydain Chronicles can be dismissed as a children's book. It contains all the elements of great fantasy. Myself, I am ninteen and have read this series since Junior High. I think it is second only to Tolkien's Middle Earth and is even a step ahead of Brook's Shannara series. This is my favorite book in the series except for The High King. It tells of Taran's first adventure, when he began to become one of the great in Prydain while keeping the humble personality of an Assistant Pig-Keeper.

The main characterm, a boy named Taran, is desperate for adventure. Heck, most boys are at that age. However as Taran learns, one should be careful for what one wishes for because you just might get it!The book is written for young adults and as such is fast-paced and doesn't go into great details. However the story isn't so watered down that adults can't get into it (although I blew through the book in a day as an adult). Gurgey's \\"crunchings and munchings\\" are funny and the romance between Taran and Ellonwy reminded me so much of the girl I had a HUGE crush on in 6th grade! Very sweet and nicely done!

This is my absolute favorite series of books of all time. I started reading these when I was 9 years old and I still go back and re-read them every few years and I am 27 now! I would recommend this series to anyone at any age! I just watched the Disney remake of \\"The Black Cauldron\\" and it was awful. It is a travesty and does not even come close to doing this series justice. Why did they even bother putting Lloyd's name on it? They changed everything anyway and combined parts of the book and basically just blew it!

It is the best!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed the way that I read","review":"Whan I was in the fith grade I did not read at all but when I was reading every one of the books in the series I had to be told to put the book down in class and I missed my teacher explaining long division which is still a mystery to me two years later. I have read more than ten of lloyd Alexanders books including the five in this series. I is writed with such amagination and skill and at the end of the last book 50 different small actions and unsolved mysteries and everything about the book just comes all together and after reading a combined 1500 pages it is the most awsome thing. I have not met a person that has not liked it and now I read a lot. This is the first book and if you want your kid to get into reading then this is the book.

The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings were my favorites, and were the books that I thought defined the genre. I vaguely remember coming across the Chronicles of Prydain in a library catalog while I was looking for something to read, and my take on fantasy has never been the same since.The five books in this series are usually marked as \\"Young Adult,\\" But as a thirty year old man, I have just read them for the umpteenth time and been totally enchanted. Yes, they are written for youngsters, but that just makes an adult voracious to read them faster. What drives these books are the characters, hilarious and tragic at the same time. Alexander's chronicles will always hold a place in my bookshelf as long as I live."},{"rating":"1","title":"an early Tolkien clone, from 1964","review":"THE GOOD:* Good Welsh atmosphere.* Wholesome story for kids: good, clean, old-fashioned fun.THE BAD:* Hard to take the first book seriously because the main characters spend most of it looking for a pig.* Too many names and characters and nary a glossary in sight, save one for pronunciation.* Cliched situations.* Thinly-disguised liftings from Tolkien abound."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book of Three by Lloyd Alexander","review":"This story is about Taran a young assistant pig keeper who is [eager] for excitement and adventure until his pig runs away. While searching for the pig in the woods he gets into great danger for there is evil around in the land of Prydain. On his journey he discovers new friends and fights for good to overrun the evil, he also fights so that his home will not be distroyed.I very much reccomend this book to almost everyone. The author describes what is happening so well that it almost feels like you are in the book. The story is full of adventure fantasy and suspense; when you start reading it you can not put it down because you always want to know what will happen next or how it will happen. That is why I highly reccomend this book. I hope if you read this you will enjoy it just as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the Prydain Chronicles!","review":"I loved these books as a kid and still do as an adult, I recommend them to everyone!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive Ellroy","review":"This is the most amazing book I have ever read, taking me inside the mind of corrupt,insomniac rogue cop and lawyer Dave Klein, the most memorable of Ellroy's alienated hard men. The plot is tight, zig-zagging all over LA and through a map of the darl underside of fifties America. Although Klein has quite rightly been described as a repulsive human being, like all of JA's characters he is true to himself and has the shopsoiled integrity of a true noir character. The jewel of the LA tetrology, as well as the one that ties up the loose ends from the other three books, this is one that you just have to grit your teeth and read. (Not being distracted by Klein's punch-drunk internal monologue or the gore level, which is high even for Ellroy). A classic of the mystery genre, and of American literature as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not his best","review":"Yes, I loved this book. It's got the usual Ellroy hallmark of big plots, dark characters and that obsession with the dark side of 50's/60's LA. Not as good as LA Confidential which is a masterly piece of work, but still a vital read, if only to finish off his classic LA Quartet.The writing style is the test to whether you enjoy any of his books. If you can't get to grips with it then I suggest you get something a bit lighter, but if you feel up to the challenge then I promise you a riveting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Creeps, crooks, perverts, drug fiends and freaks...welcome to the LAPD. If you've never read Ellroy before welcome to his world, a rather dark and disturbing place.This novel, like American Tabloid and The Cold Six Thousand, contains Ellroy's machine gun prose. It is at first off-putting, but ultimately terribly satisfying. His writing style is spare, no unnecessary words at all, brief descriptions that still give great detail. Fantastically drawn / evil characters that collide at the end.In short - bit weird but I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a horrific book","review":"Ellroy is at his most depraved in this story of corruption and murder in the LAPD during the late Fifties. He piles one atrocity upon another until the whole thing sinks into a grisly, self-conscious parody.The plot is way too complicated. Ellroy acts as if he felt that in order to make this book stand out he had to litter the landscape with more perversions per square mile than any city could possibly hold. Then he layers in one of those sad, squalid, improbable love affairs that tough/bad/sick cops are supposed to thrive on and drags us along for what seems like an eternity before he reveals everything. I still don't know exactly what happened, and I don't care.Ordinarily, I like Ellroy. He has an excellent, clipped style that sounds like rocks being chipped from a boulder. But in this case, the sculpture that emerges is ghastly and unbelievable. Try something else, unless -- you're a masochist.EKW"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stream of consciousness - in your face - all happening NOW!","review":"James Ellroy hit a grand slam!!! This stream of consciousness novel puts the reader inbetween the \\"protagionists\\" eyes and grey matter. The style is stream of consciousness which makes every event seem like it is happening now and right before your eyes!The book is full of violence, and racial bias because James Ellroy writes the book from the perspective of a disturbed, yet intelligent cop who himself is a violent criminal and on the make for a particular mobster. One could say the story is about redemption, about a man recounting all of his past sins and the prices that were paid. Either way, it puts the reader into a space he has never been.This book is the best novel I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Ellroy's best...","review":"I am a big Ellroy fan. I have read almost all of his works. L.A. Confidential and the Black Dahlia are probably his two best. So far, I think this is his worst book. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I wasn't bothered by the violence or the plot, or the fact that Dave Klein is not much of a hero for a central character. He's even more flawed than Bud White. What made this book such a disappointment was the writing style. Even for Ellroy, it was too clipped, too abrupt. It was not only hard to read, but it sounded forced; like someone trying to write like the voice-overs in B-movie film-noir detective stories. It just didn't ring true."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bunch of confusing nonsense that makes no sense","review":"Elleroy does a fine job of making me feel like i don't know what's going on. I reafd quite a lot and often have no problem keeping track of who people are and what they do, but Elleroy leaves me in the dark. So much so, that I often wonder if I am on Candid Camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"artificial prose","review":"I really liked his earlier books, but Ellroy has let the reviews go to his head. He no longer writes, he just jots down phrases. It is not a leaner prose this way, just jerky and slow.Hemingway and Hammett wrote lean prose -- in complete sentences"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating writing style, but ultimately a waste of time.","review":"Ellroy's style -- terse, rapid fire, compelling (at times). Like porno, attracting, fascinating, repulsing -- ultimately boring. Bad cops, bad guys, murderers, dopers, low-lifes. Life at its lowest, meanest. Evil with no insight.Who lives? Who dies? Waste 'em! Who cares?"},{"rating":"1","title":"re-hashed characters, annoying prose style","review":"I hated this book. Why? The style Ellroy wrote in made it difficult to follow exactly what was going on; his typical prose is great, but here it's almost like a play script. Except, he'll take away the notice of who is speaking, and it breaks up the rhythm of the read. You have to go back and figure out who is saying what in a multi-person dialogue. It's annoying. This experiment bothered the hell out of me.Secondly, why are all his plots and characters roughly the same? The protagonist: an ethnic German cop or ex-cop, usually brutal, usually corrupt. The main bad guy? Always a mastermind highly corrupt cop. Throw in depraved sicko sexuality to taste. The setting is always L.A., but that's Ellroy's signature and I like that.In short, this is the worst Ellroy novel I've read but I still had to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So long, stinkbook.","review":"This book stinks. Pe--yew. I normally enjoy Ellroy's flashy style, his from the hip dialogue and narration; Ellroy's style tends to attract today's short-attention spanners. But, this reads like Ellroy's normal style hopped on the speed his characters like to pop. You must have to be on meth to be able to follow this garbage. Not to mention unoriginal, un-interesting characters, lame plot. James better watch out or he'll become the john grisham of the \\"90s pulp fiction\\" novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A climactic finale","review":"The final showdown that LA Confidential promised us comes together in this novel. Ed Exley and Dudley Smith finally go at it through a most unusual go between who doesn't know what hes getting into between these two, Dave Klein. Klein is a corrupt Vice cop in every way. He's out for himself. But when he gets drawn into the big chess match played by Exley and SMith he starts to question what hes been doing and who he is. A great finish to the authors LA crime novels. Don't be afraid of the style and prose. You'll get used to it quick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leg piece pulled, door jacked, blood spray","review":"Situation: Ellroy at his most unflinching.

Not much.Progress: time off, eyes refocus. Hammering lets off a bit. Later: return to the scene. Synapses screaming. Masochist: back to playtime.Done. Fadeout: brain circuits, dark. Rest.

Lieutenant Dave Klein is the epitome of \\"anthero\\" and the thought of cops like him both saddens and terrifies me. The love interest is believeable, which is not easy to do in this bleak a story, and the prose style does resemble jazz, and is extremely rewarding after one gets used to it. White Jazz is Ellroy's most experimental and stylish novel to date, and highly recommended for someone looking for something beyond the Leonard/Lehane mold."},{"rating":"1","title":"A string of two word sentences","review":"I truly don't see how anyone can think this is a good book. It reads like a gritty Dr. Seuss novel. It's a string of 2 word sentences that leaves everything to the imagination because it says nothing. The characters are stereotypes and under developed. It is the equivalent of a \\"B\\" action movie that depends on a \\"blood splatter\\" trailer to bait naive movie goers. Horrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"out of tune","review":"Ellroy here asks us to join him in a riff of incest and pornography, accompanied by sociopaths and tedious plot riddles, all written in a bizarre bare style that starts to wear thin after about ten pages. No jazz, just incessant noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"How the mighty have fallen!","review":"This has to be Ellroy's worst yet. The writing is in the style of Dr.Seuss crossed with a psychopath on crank. Subtract 300 pages from this atrocity and you still have a book too long, with no plot and no redeeming value, and mostly, totally unbelievable. In other words, a mirror image of the characters the author tries to develop.Ellroy's obsessive hatred of all of what he considers \\"right wing\\" gets tiresome very quickly.Ellroy scored some impressive successes with LA Confidential and American Tabloid. But White Jazz is almost laughable if it weren't so ugly. But for some authors - anything for a buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, without redeeming value","review":"Before I read \\"White Jazz,\\" I'd never read a book that lacked a single likable character.

What happened in the town of Jenin, in early April, 2002, brought to my mind the wrong doings of Great Britain's Oliver Cromwell against the Irish people, at Drogheda, in 1649. I found the eyewitness accounts, by the local people of Jenin, that survived this tragedy, to be very credible and extremely moving. At least, 63 Palestinians died in the siege of the town by the Israeli armed forces. The military attacks lasted two weeks. It is long past the time, for the citizens of the world, to speak out against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. What occurred at Jenin, in April 2002, should be Exhibit \\"A\\" in their argument for that occupation to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unadultered garbage.","review":"By 2004, all of the actual facts regarding Jenin have been out in the open for quite a while. What are most illuminating are translations of interviews by the Palestinian fighters themselves. Boasting of their exploits, they pretty much confirm everything that Israel maintained all along; i.e. the Israeilis were lured into killing zones, women and children were used as lures, decoys and bomber, Jenin WAS a base for terrorist incursions into Israel, and many, many buildings were booby-trapped to explode by the Palestinians themselves.This belongs in every collection of revisionist history, right next to the books dealing with holocaust denial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arab propaganda garbage","review":"The book has no facts & only Palestinian one sided lies.

Dusted is a load of atonal gibberish; a disgrace to industrial, metal, and music as a whole for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye opening!","review":"My husband was born in Granada NIcaragua in 1978. My in-laws have told me many stories about how difficult those times were. This book has filled in the rest of the story for me. I feel that the auther shares a balanced view of the events that took place. On a more personal level, it has given me a new respect for what my in-laws went through to raise their six children in such difficult situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough but insightful read","review":"This book is excellently written. It gives a thorough history of Nicaragua during the time of the civil war. It is told from the perspective of a US Journalist who was stationed there during the war. The book is well written and gives a very different perspective of the war and the United States interference (and Imperialism) during this troubled time in the country's history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electric Guitar & Amp","review":"For the price, this was my best Christmas present.

If you are looking for ways to get started or for recipies, don't buy this book! Although Mr. Wright seems to have a winning reputation and the book is filled with authentic, flavorful recipies it does not relate to heart-based eating. The ingredients include eggs, full-fat yogurt, cheeses, shellfish such as shrimp, and butter. Choosing and buying this book was my mistake; I just don't you to make the same one! You will find it a complete waste of money if heart-health is your goal. Buy The Mediterranean Heart Diet by Helen V. Fisher instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Craig's Electronic Style Is Still Intact.","review":"Goldy's playing is always amazing to me. The electronic sounds that he finds and incorporates into his music is intriguing. Some sounds annoy my family members, but still, it plays important roles into the songs and makes sence to me. The vocals on this disc are not the best for Craig's style and can be hard to understand at times. If your open to great guitar playing and interesting sounds then give this disc a try. Craig Goldy's Ritual - \\"Hidden In Plain Sight\\" and \\"Insufficient Therapy\\" are better discs in my opinion. He still cooks on \\"Better Late Than Never\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"i never got it","review":"no comment i waited for this product for 2 months i never got it end up getting refund from the store i got charged for shipping and 15% for restocking I'll never use this store again"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD GUN!!!","review":"This gun is probably the worst gun ive bought, it wouldnt even last 3 weeks. doesnt have a hop up, the stock is not collapsable. the laser would easily break and is also not accurate. its gravity fed so it wouldnt have that realistic feel to it. after about a week the gun would often jam than it WILL break. probably the only good thing about this gun is the fact that i bought it for about $15.00. it states on other websites that its about 210 fps, its really about 100 fps. i do not recommend buying this gun."},{"rating":"2","title":"a powerful tribute cd","review":"it's a very powerful and funny tribute cd of Deep Purple band. In this cd you can find malmsteen, glenn hughes, joe lynn turner and so many other artists and fans of deep purple. The track i prefer is Stormbringer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A valuable addition to Holocaust literature about rescue","review":"Highly-readable account of Spain's indirect role during the Holocaust as many Jews sought escape to the West through Spain. There are interesting portraits of both the rescued and rescuers, with additional chapters on modern Spanish Jews and Marranos or Crypto-Jews of Spanish descent. Alexy did a great service bringing these stories to our attention as very few have thought of Jews in Spain beyond the Inquisition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy Duty Clothes Pins- NO!","review":"Same gauge and weight as ones I bought at the \\"Dollar Store\\".

They break when you try to use them. They are too expensive for what they are used for and you can buy them at your local hardware store for about 2.00 dollars. Wouldn't buy these again, not to mention that the shipping was more that the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't deserve even one star","review":"I don't even have to buy these to know they are crap. The dimensions are skimpier than the pathetic ones available in dollar stores. NO ONE makes REAL clothes pins anymore. These certainly would not hold heavier items in place and the wooden parts can easily slip out of the spring. GARBAGE. with the revival of more Eco friendly line drying .. someone HAS to make something better .. and NOT PLASTIC PLEASE... !!!!. My grandmother's clothes pins these are NOT. Not even close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing album","review":"I cannot believe that it has taken me this long to discover Gil Scott Heron. The music and musicianship is amazing and GSH's singing sends chills down your spine. The sometimes politically charged but always very human lyrics are more relevant today than ever. Most soul/jazz music of today pales in comparison in terms of substance. It's a great bonus in this CD-age to get a live version of the song 'Winter in America' not included on the original release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage early '70s rap session with the voice of experience","review":"This driving, bitter and uncompromising indictment of American society may be Gil Scott-Heron's best album ever. He was perhaps the innovator to the present day rap craze, a worldwide phenomenon that has surpassed color lines and national origins and is the voice of the angry, strident and disconnected men and women of today. Scott-Heron and Brian Jackson teamed up to perform some very nice material on this album, especially \\"Song for Bobby Smith\\", \\"H2OGate Blues\\", \\"Your Daddy Loves You\\" and \\"The Bottle\\". Though a bit dated, the music here underscores those turbulent times of many years ago, and the young voices today are as angry now as they were then."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one will creep up on you","review":"After the Mahavishnu orchestra broke up, I needed to hear more from those four musicians. Jerry's music was so totally different from his Mahavishnu work that I put this CD back on the shelf for a couple of months. When I finally pulled it out again [I was planning on giving it away], I marveled at his classical layering of the instruments. The compositions [not songs] are interspersed with odd time signatures that nudge you off balance and keep the dream-like themes from putting you to sleep. This is one of those select few CD's that will force you into small claims court if anyone dares to scratch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use the cruise control","review":"If you play this in your car, you best use your cruise-control or you will be at 80 before you know it. The last cut, Sarah's lullaby is my favorite as it really gets you moving. My only complaint, it ends too soon. I could wish it to go on much longer. If you need to get some physical work done this will keep you going."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good I bought it twice","review":"I was given this on a cassette tape in 1985, then bought it on CD and just recently lost it (after two moves) so I had to buy it again. It is unlike any other album I have and is extremely good. The time signatures are often not standard; the instruments are different than expected, and the music actually makes me want to sing along, even though it is instrumental! I would love to find more music like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"From A to Z","review":"each chapter give you a step to start an online Investmentit give you all small detail.it can be a starter even for the beginner in Trading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper is patient","review":"Two asinine brains got together and wrote fiction of the most sinister kind. The problem is they have faint ideas of historical facts, so they are using a blossoming phantasy. The book is filled with dark energy, and they mock the intelligence of the reader. I combed through the pages, and tried other pages, always the same. Anybody can write a book like this, drink a few glasses of wine and start fabricating. They have a sickening fascination with the third Reich, with Tibet, with Haushofer, void of facts. Their sickening fascination with everything hellish knows no boundaries."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great book to swat flies with","review":"I can not believe people are still being taken in by this book.

I only wish I could give it a minus rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This book is such a complete piece of antiscientific, ocultist nonsense that its continuing popularity in a highly educated country like France is really hard to explain. Only for those interested in cultural oddities from the 60's."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Progenitor of the New Age","review":"This is arguably the book that almost single handedly initiated the 1960's Occult revival and all the various schools of thought for good & ill that came from it. It certainly contributed to the resurgence of interest in Gurdjieff from a insulated teacher of movement & the Work to global mega-star of the consciousness movement. It also served to inspire a variety of \\"ancient astronaut\\" theorists including von Daniken and his ilk.After the seminal works of Charles Fort, this was the second generation bible of speculative thought on a grand scale. Long out of print, it is welcomed to see it back and available to a new generation of readers. Some of it will seem dated no doubt and at times a bit histrionic, yet this is the work that set many psychonauts on the path for the \\"other\\" wherever that may lead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book for Every 20th- & 21st-Century Christian to Read","review":"Here is a book that scripturally explains the saving work of God in Christ Jesus and cuts through the false gospel of \\"ask Jesus in your heart.\\" One gets excited by reading such dynamic thoughts on salvation. This book and \\"Justification by Faith Alone\\" by Charles Hodge break through the unbiblical teachings concerning saving grace being propagated today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design","review":"My main complaint is that the middle space doesn't connect with the back so there's a space for things in there to fall down into the drawer and then the drawer doesn't open easily. Similiar problem with the back compartment (doesn't go all the way down so smaller things in the two sides can go way in the back and be hard to get out.) It just seems like it wasn't designed very well. It is nice looking. Anything else I looked at with a similiar design was plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"quite possibly the worst movie i've ever seen","review":"This movie is worse than my second-grade mother hen play.

This guy is reallytalented... Bill sounds like himself, but if you like John Lennon, Paul McCartney, The Beatles at large, Crowded House, Badfinger and that general flavor of music, you'll probably dig Bill's cd. IN HER EYES opens the disc with powerful hooks and great harmonies. EVERYTIME YOU CRY is awesome,.. great build! I FLY is a cool acoustic track. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN is cool. SOMEDAY I'LL GET OVER YOU is mellow and very cool. MATTER FOR THE WORLD is very catchy. WERE YOU REALLY THE ONE shows Bill is literal and interesting as it recalls many deceased famous personalities... There are some tracks I like less than others, but the really strong ones MORE than make up for it. This cd is a definite buy... DO YOU HEAR THAT, RECORD EXECS...HUH?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An engrossing read, and great value","review":"The three volumes included here comprise a fascinating picture of PKD's later work. Not enough can be said about this man, as a product of the late 20th century. His intellect, command of history and philosophy, and pure free-spirited creativity about the universe are on full display through VALIS and The Divine Invasion; which mix sci-fi, metafiction, postmodernism, magic realism, religious mysticism, humor, among many other ingredients. The Transmigration of Timothy Archer is another great PKD narrative which winks at the cosmic powers at work in the prior two. For the Kindle, this is a great buy and an engrossing adventure for the modern literature fan.And even as an avid reader, my vocabulary got a workout; as did the Kindle Dictionary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Valis is excellent","review":"So far I've finished Valis and am halfway through The Divine Invasion. Valis is excellent and makes this buy well worth it, regardless of the quality of the other two. On its own I give it 5 stars. The Divine Invasion is too religious for my tastes so far, but I would give it 3 stars on its own. I can't speak for the third yet, but this is a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Tiffant hits collection.","review":"This CD is packed with great Tiffany recordings from the '80s and early '90s. \\"The Winding Road,\\" \\"If Love Is Blind\\" and \\"I Always Thought I'd See You Again\\" are wonderful rare tracks and are worth the price of admission. There are a few stinkers, namely \\"Radio Romance\\" (one of the worst Top 40 songs of the '80s) and a haplessly forced version of Exile's \\"Kiss You All Over,\\" but overall this CD is a great best-of, much more thorough and enjoyable than Tiffany's \\"Greatest Hits\\" album released in the United States.Tracks: Close Our Eyes (duet with Tommy Page), Could've Been, If Love Is Blind, I Saw Him Standing There, The Winding Road, Here In My Heart, Feelings Of Forever, I Think We're Alone Now, These Arms Of Mine, Radio Romance, Kiss You All Over, Almost In Love, Hold An Old Friend's Hand, Can't You See, I Always Thought I'd See You Again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Family Pool","review":"This is a great \\"starter pool\\" The diamater is perfect for the whole family to enjoy. The depth isn't scary for little kids, but isn't deep enough for any \\"real\\" swimming by a bigger kid or adult.Set up was easy. Just make sure you have ALL protrusions removed from the area in which you will be setting up the pool. Once we started filling with water we found more, even though we thought we found them all! So be forewarned!Filling took MUCH longer than suggested on the box, but we still swam the weekend of purchase.The filter is worthless, except to disolve chlorine tablets. You will still need to skim and vaccuum REGULARLY even with a cover.Next year we are going to get a deeper version because we love the product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG Disappointment","review":"If you're looking for designs to reflect the special moments of your life, this is definetley NOT the book. Among the designs included in this book are a girl and teddy bear walking together down a garden lane and two different designs of rabbits dressed in Old English attire standing on a country estate. \\"Down Fantasy Lane\\" would probably have been a more appropriate title for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This book is beyond beautiful. The designs are unique; not the same old ones. Beautiful, unique and just so full of colors. I have this book and its a true keepsake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this ring a couple of months ago for everyday wear. At first it was great- cute, unique, etc. Then I noticed the latch getting snagged in EVERYTHING, from my clothes to blankets to my bag... After a while, the very poorly made latch became bent out of shape, and now does not close properly.The ring itself is made nicely enough, and is a very cute design. However, the latch is way too pliant and easily bent. The hook on the top will get caught on any stray thread. I would not recommend this ring for everyday use- maybe as a formal or costume piece to be worn every once in a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"very antiquish looking","review":"I've wanted a poison ring for quite some time now and when I saw this one, well it was just perfect. However when it arrived, the garnet looked a little fake and the latch on the locket part wasn't very tight and the locket would sometimes open therefore dumping any contents I had inside. :(. So with that in mind, I really don't wear it as often as I would have liked to when I ordered it, but it is a beautiful ring to wear and it makes a great conversational piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important book","review":"'Wisdom for a Livable Planet' highlights the incredible environmental contributions of eight people in various fields. It gives a sense of the breadth of environmentalism today, while uniting all eight of the book's subjects in their resolve to fight against the overwhelming forces of anti-environmentalism found in our political and academic institutions today. Why is it so hard to fight to protect our planet? Because most of us see everything through the filter of economics which treats the environment as a commodity. Until leaders (political, educational, and spiritual) understand the importance of defending our environment, until they spread the word of living within the context of our environment, we are doomed to destroy ourselves. Those leaders could start by educating themselves with this book. I think everyone should read it. I even donated a copy to my local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT I REMEMBERED AS A YOUNG TEENAGER","review":"This isn't what I remembered as a kid. For some reason I remember really enjoying this CD and for many years I remembered the name and decided to order it. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hughes \\"Power Soul\\" Voice Rocks On!","review":"An excellent piece of work from Mr. Glenn Hughes that shows his true vocal ability and soulful range. Coming out after what was a difficult era in his life, Glenn is able to express his himself here without conviction. Highly recommended for anyone who was into the 1976 \\"Made in Europe\\" sound (The all-time #1 rock record in my opinion), OR any of the Purple-Bolin transistion albums, etc. Glenn also offers a bonus track here of \\"You Fool No One\\". I believe this was recorded somewhere in Texas, but not sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving","review":"I have followed Glenn since the first Trapeze album and this one moves me. Being that Glenn is a recovered drug user and he tells his story in these songs makes the recording special. Having said that, listen to the songs and be moved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too metallic, too aggressive, too modern...","review":"This is very metallic and aggressive, but not in the same musical vein as Slipknot or even the modern Judas Priest. Personally I'm not too happy with this rather hard and heavy low-key direction, and I believe that both the earlier \\"From now on\\" and the more recent project with Joe Lynn Turner is so much better. But if you like this release I strongly suggest you try to get hold of a copy of the officially unreleased Tony Iommi's \\"Eight star\\" - the follow up the Black Sabbath album \\"Seventh star\\" on which Hughes did the vocals. It sounds very much like this one. It might be rather difficult to get, but Ebay might be of help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size Not Stated","review":"I like this series of books, but they come in 2 sizes and i want all same size, the smaller.

Looks like a very bad scan. Have tried it on my Kindle, on the PC software, and the iPad app - same results. Changing the size doesn't help either. Very odd - have read dozens of books on Kindle, this is the first one like this where the quality of the transfer got in the way.So I am buying the print version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things you always wanted to know about transportation","review":"Mr. McPhee has written an extremely interesting book about various methods of commercial transportation. You can learn about hazmat trucking in the wrld's shiniest truck, a school for tanker captains, maneuvering huge strings of barges along the very tight Illinois River, the mechanics of how the brown trucks at UPS show up at your house with a package, coal trains that are two miles long, and a canoe trip following Thoreau's path on the Concord and Merrimack rivers. With the exception of the last one. I found all the subjects to be fascinating. You feel as if you are there with the drivers trying to safely move enormous loads. The canoe trip just seemed to me to be a recitation of the towns they passd through. However, all in all, the book gives the reader a great amount of information, and I expect that you will learn a number of things that you not only didn't know but probably had never thought about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncommon Reading about Uncommon Industries","review":"Uncommon Carriers is an uncommon book, but then that is what one should expect from John McPhee. This is the third of his books that I have read, and all have been rather quirky. In Uncommon Carriers, McPhee investigates the behind-the-scenes world of transportation. He does this, not by doing research, but by actually participating in the transportation activities. The up side to this is that the reader gets an inside view of the often hidden world and an appreciation of the complexity that surrounds ways of life that may seem rather blasé to those not in the industry. The down side is that McPhee sometimes gets so deep into the vocabulary of the industry that he loses the reader. Because of this, some of the segments are more accessible than others. But all are fascinating and eye-opening."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],R={key:0},N={key:1};function B(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(o(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(o(),b(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",R,"See more"))],8,H)):p("",!0)])}const x=d(O,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-f8a4f1df"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/31.md","filePath":"glossary/31.md"}'),W={name:"glossary/31.md"},P=Object.assign(W,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(x)]))}});export{j as __pageData,P as default};
