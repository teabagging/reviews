They loved the suspense...each chapter had a cliff hanger that made them want to read the next and the next. It is actually better than the 1st Hardy Boys book. I find that since these books were written in the 1940's, they take on a bit of historical context, though originally written as contemporary works. They describe a period in American history that is much simpler (and generally safer)than most kids live in today.

It's great to read to children to get them familiar with a doctors office and talk about what they do, who goes there and just makes it a much friendlier and not so scary place. Who knows, maybe they will want to be a doctor or nurse who works there? A recommended read to get them to talk about what they see and how they feel at the doctors office."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Word: Classic","review":"Classic is the only word that can describe this album. \\"The Low End Theory\\" was an album from A Tribe Called Quest that set the groundwork for a number of great albums to follow from this great trio. Nowadays, the rap albums at the top of the Billboard charts consist of a few \\"good\\" songs that are released as singles, and a bunch of garbage songs in between. Not here. Every track on this album is solid. I just put it in the CD player, hit play, and listen to the entire album without skipping any tracks. The rhymes on this album are ahead of their time, and if you listen to songs today, you will hear a lot of artists spitting the same lines that Phife and Q-Tip spit on this album. The two feed off each other perfectly and have a chemistry that sounds great. While they are not together today, their many albums are still great and I could listen to these two spit all day.My 3 Favorite Tracks:ButterScenarioWhat?"},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst groups ever","review":"I love hip hop and I love jazz, but a tribe called quest has roots in neither. Just because you have some vibes and flutes in the music doesn't make it \\"jazz influenced\\". Their rapping (especially q-tip's) is extremely symmetrical, showing absolutely no relationship to jazz whatsoever. I mean, how many times can you rhyme \\"hip-hop\\" to \\"bebop\\"? This is one of the worst cd's I've ever bought. I'd rather recommend Aceyalone for capturing the true innovative spirit of jazz and using it in his hip hop. I just don't understand why a tribe called quest is so popular...perhaps the only interesting part of the album is hearing Ron Carter lay down some great bass lines, but it can't save this extremely lame cd. I've never heard a more boring hip hop album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"To all of you who are reading these reviews in order to decide whether or not to buy the album, buy it. I don't want to reiterate what everyone else has been saying. However, I was surprised to see that most of the reviews didn't mention \\"Rap Promoter\\" as highlights on the album. This song is dope. The jazz hook is real groovy and the rhymes are just perfect and more synocopated than other tracks. Notice how the scat lyrics at the last part of the song sound very similar to \\"Bawitdaba\\" by the awful Kid Rock. It goes to show you how influential Tribe has been to today's artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Untouchable","review":"This CD is, with the possible exception of Enter the Wu-Tang, the best hip-hop/rap album track to track ever produced. Ever. It combines a jazzy feel with insightful and intelligent rhyming skills. Also, look for Phife truly expanding his lyrical abilities (which were sorta lacking on \\"People's Instinctive...\\") to the nth degree. A classic. If you don't own this album, or are looking for a way to start your rap collection, pick this one up now. It's untouchable. Also, check out Mos Def and De La Soul, both Tribe-esque performers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"Tribe really never got better than this album.

But this book succeeds pretty admirably, walking you throught the tough parts step-by-step. The charts that cover such things as where to find Heart Pieces and Treasure Maps are especially helpful. The only problem with the book is that in a few places, it directs you to use more difficult methods than necessary to accomplish tasks - for example, it might tell you to use water jars to cool off lava to make a footpath (hard to do and usually gets you burned a few times) when you can simply use your grappling hook to swing across the lava with no problem.

I most certainly would not buy this guide again and am actually toying with the thought to get another. I have bought many game guides over the years and this one suites my style the least in the way everything is structured and laid-out. In some areas is too much text to get to the hint needed but in the process I learn plenty things I rather had figured out myself. I also miss the numbered structure for dungeons with corresponding maps that other guides provide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I agree with the other reviewers; the whole point of the game is to beat it yourself, not to get a strategy guide to do it for you. I only got this because I like to have a list of the items and stuff, so I know what they do (all games are usually a little vague on items). Anyway, this strategy guide doesn't have any of that. It has some useless appendixes in the back, and that's about it. I wouldn't waste my money on this again, so unless you really want something that'll give you lots of maps and take your hand and walk you through the whole flaming game, then get this (by the way, BradyGames usually comes out with some of the worst strategy guides, so this might not be a good idea anyway)."},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless","review":"there is no need to waste money on books like this, unless you enjoy collecting them for some reason. all the walkthrough information you could ever want is easily found on the web at a multitude of different locations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Guide!","review":"This strategy guide is excellent. The Legend of Zelda series has a tradition of complex puzzles and hidden items that are enough to drive even the most ardent fan batty while trying to play the game to the end. I long ago decided that I would rather be able to enjoy the game I spent my hard-earned money on than to curse it and its designers for my lack of insight. This guide is especially helpful with the side quests, although I might have asked for dungeon maps that weren't quite as confusing. As a bonus, you also get a complete walkthrough of the bonus Ocarina of Time: Master Quest disc. All in all, a great guide for a superb game. Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading","review":"I can't imaging being able to complete this or other Zelda games (Ocarina, Majora's Mask) without some sort of reference guide like this.

This, in addition to the standard walk-through make the guide a great value. Throw in the walk-through for Ocarina of Time (for those who bought the Windwaker/Ocarina Master Quest set) and it's amazing it didn't cost more.Well worth the investment if you just HAVE to have every single item in the game. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite \\"must get\\"","review":"Now, like most people, I wanted to get Prima's strategy guide.

I mean there are some things that may be hard to understand what it's talking about but it's relatively easy to find out matching the pictures with the area you need to go to. Also, this book tells you the items and enemies you will find before every temple. Personally, I don't care that it tells me what I should be looking for.

Steady B tried to come to commericial in this jon. There was only one track that I liked on the entire album and even it wasn't that great. If you compare this album with his first they are like night and day. His first album is classic. This album he seemed to be to desparate to get paid.

I personally do not want my children running around singing that inappropriate rhyme either. It also bothers me that when the Mother tells Froggy that he should be doing his homework she \\"laughs\\" at his response that he is Count Von Frogula and Vampires don't DO homework. That type of blatant disrespect is not allowed in our house and I do not want it modeled in books for my children either. This is minor, but I also did not like that Froggy cut holes in his Mom's \\"best white sheet\\" while making a ghost costume with no feelings of remorse and without any consequences to his actions. I do not want my children disregarding other's property in such a way either. This book had great potential but all of the inappropriatness mentioned above ruined it for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate!!","review":"I have a three and two year old that have really enjoyed the froggy books.

My five year old daughter has fallen in love with all of the adventures of Froggy, his parents, and friends. The books are just the right length for you and your child to share a nice bedtime story--not too short where you have to supplement with another book or too long where you have to stop and pick up the story the next night.

I especially like the scene where the girl from school tries to kiss him (because he looks so cute in his costume) and he has to jump over his parents to get away.As far as the trick or treat rhyme goes, I say people need to lighten up a bit. I remember saying that rhyme when I was a kid and thought it was funny, but I never actually pulled anyone's pants down. When my son and I read it, I simply took a moment to talk with him about how it may be a funny rhyme but we would never actually do something like that. The recommended age is 4-8.

Yes, Froggy usually mentions his underwear and we all giggle. Fine. This book, however, crossed a line with me. Froggy jokes about pulling down another person's underwear if they don't give him any candy. Not just once, but TWICE. Now, I'm not a huge prude, but this kind of talk is totally unnecessary in a children's book. And heaven forbid if my three-year-old repeated the line to a fellow preschooler. He'd probably be kicked out for sexual harrassment! I took Froggy back and told the clerk about the problem.

If you are familiar with the Froggy books, you already know that the kids usually get a kick out him making references to underwear. In the first book \\" Froggy Gets Dressed\\". It was cute ( \\" You forgot your underwear!) In this book, it may be sing-songy but the part about referencing pulling down someones underwear is highly inapppropriate. It may be a kids rhyme, but it this day and age of sexual misconduct by adults and kids alike, any references to pulling down someones underwear for fun or not, is best left out of the books. It would take just one kid to try to do this to someone at school, because they read that in a book, now you have got a sexual harrassment case going on.

I first saw him in 1990 when he opened up for Ice Cube and Too Short in Indianapolis, and I laughed myself sick and had a great time. That was when it was straight turntables and microphones, no fancy stuff. Ah, the good ole days. This album is great and I will crank it at max volume till the day I'm dead, but if you're a top-forty-listening trendy clone who likes songs like \\"Only God Knows Why\\", then this is not for you.

This is the worst video anyone can imagine about any sport."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good video for any ice hockey beginner...","review":"This video came on DVD or VHS at IceHockeyForKids.com, this site sells it for much less and offers it on DVD. Very good for any new hockey player. It also featured how they make ice, paint the rink, how a Zamboni works featuring Mr. Zamboni, equipment needed to play the game, basic skating skills. The DVD offered unique additional footage such as the USA & Canadian hockey anthems, and other clips not found on the vhs.

I see that the \\"so clever\\" corset pocket on the bodice pattern and the oopsie recommendation to wear your bum roll under your corset still stands. All in all I would not recommend this book to anyone but a beginner or intermediate costumer, and only then if they have done enough research to recognize when there is useless info included.

I looked for conceptual bases here and there and Ascher's book was definetely one of the most useful sources I found. It explains clearly why resource management fails when looked from the implementation of policies logic, with strong conceptual basis. The role of policies is accentuated and it manages to make the reader understand few things can be done if there is not a clear political line behind resource management. Several examples illustrate both successful and failure cases, in diverse ecosystems. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in understanding, at different levels, why the world's biodiversity is apparently lost without remedy.Happy reading!Ximena"},{"rating":"2","title":"The really useful Digital Camera.","review":"I experimented with both ends of the digital photo-technology.

The original one, which is now about 18 months old will only take indoor pictures. For some reason, as soon as you try to take an outside one, the camera goes black. The indoor pictures have lines all throughout the picutes. This one is out of warranty all together. The only one left is one of the two purchased in May. If I were able to get a refund I would. The picture quality on this camera is getting terrible.

What I think is that they know about their poor quality that they put that on the manual. So, if you want a reliable camera stay away form this one.

I was actually searching another artist when I discovered Nina Simone. After listening to a few music samples, I was intrigued enough to purchase it.I love it!

I didn't listen to it right away as I wasn't familiar with Nina Simone, but as soon as I put it in my CD player, it didn't come out for weeks! She is one of the most passionate and evocative singers I've ever heard, and her interpretations of these songs will send shivers down your spine, make you weep, and make you dance.

There are, however, also brief written descriptions and explanations of some of the major sites in Egypt.The pictures are fine. (I wonder, though, if other books don't provide much of the same material.) The writing and editing, on the other hand, are quite poor. The site descriptions are rather dense reading, but strangely fail to convey much information. The writing style, such as it is, appears to change - rather jarringly - on several occasions. Perhaps most troubling in a book of this sort, however, it is often difficult to match the photos with their intended captions. This is not a high quality resource. Though I have not examined what other Ancient Egypt resources are available, I am quite certain you can do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book is a true find! I must say it is not easy reading however. It includes 15 essays (usually 20-60 pages each), each surveying the concept of righteousness in a particular group of Jewish writings.

There is, literally, never a dull moment!Mixed in with the exceptional dialect of this troubled 15-year old are wonderful pieces of \\"poetry\\" that express Julian's inner most intelligence and feelings: his work for Mrs. Pope, the concerned English teacher; as well as his thoughts on \\"U\\" (you), \\"43\\" (he), \\"543\\" (she), and \\"S\\" (Susan). Despite being misunderstood by family and himself, he somehow finds peace through the writings in his \\"NB\\". I picked up this book not knowing what to expect, but was indeed pleasantly surprised.

Deciphering each and every messaged coated with numbers and codes until I cracked each and everyone one of them and recorgnized them once I spotted them.Author James M. Deem is without doubt the most amazing author I've ever read books from. Since this book, I look and look for his books and read them and never I repeat NEVER has he let me down.

The physical and emotional abuse he receives separate him from everyone he meets. The only outlet for his pain is his NBs, or notebooks, where he writes his deepest thoughts and feelings. Afraid of the consequences for his honesty, he writes in a secret code, to some he calls \\"U.\\" Although at first, the reader can not fully understand Julian's code, it creates sympathy for Julian and a need to understand him and with each page Julian reveals a little bit more of himself. Deem treats the topics of abuse and abandonment with sensitivity, and portrays them in a very real manner. The book is separated into three sections, each one a different NB. With each notebook the reader experiences the growth and progress made by Julian through each of his trials. Recommended for all YA collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!!","review":"The perfect table for our 2 and 6 year olds. Very durable.

I finally got rid of the chairs about 3 months ago so we could paint and lay new carpet in the house. So after 20 plus years the chairs had to go. I don't know if they make them like they use to, but it's Little Tikes and they are a great company. If you are thinking about getting this item for your child, I say take a chance.

He rarely eats there. He would much more prefer to sit at the grown up table. I will say that it is durable. On occasion he will ask me to sit there wit him while takes on whatever task. I was a lot apprehensive to sit on one of those plastic chairs. But it held up well. I have sat on it a few time and it didn't cave in. LOL!!! All in all, it was a good purchase.

However, it's amazingly sturdy (we have it against the wall), and I suspect our daughter could stand on it without breaking it. The chairs are also very sturdy, evrything is built with really big posts and thick plastic, so it's tough. We didn't put that sticker on the side, so it looks a little better. There's a slight sloping lip (about an inch) around the edge that stops crayons or pencils from rolling off. It wipes clean and disassembles easily for storage or travel.

Within a week, though, she's managed a method for getting onto the chairs just fine. She's already got crayon on it and it cleans up fine. I'm happy that I don't have to worry about cleaning the paint right off like some of my friends wooden/painted tables.The only negative I have is that I can't sit on the chairs.

In fact, his agenda seems to center upon fostering disunity whenever and wherever he can. Further, his credibility is highly questionable, given his role as one of the chief perpetrators of the Tawana Brawley hoax. This sad, sorry literary effort merely reaffirms that Mr. Sharpton is little more than a posturing, flamboyant, hate-driven windbag whose chief purpose seems to be promoting divisiveness.

I rediscovered many an old friend when I started reading these poems to my own children. Now the book is in tatters (glueback bindings do not stand the test of time, especially not in dry Colorado), and I search for a replacement.

The book written by reporter Ian Mulgrew is a collaboration of hindu nationalist propaganda and outright lies. In fact, years after writing this book Mulgrew himself came to the realization that he had been used by the insidious indian government and repudiated the book's contents.

I have nearly 140 credits & this was the worst book I had ever used until John Bertin's Aerodynamics For Engineers book came along. You can read it forever as I did and not learn anything. I dropped the EE-221 class in 2007 and sold this book back knowing we'd use it again as it is useless except for the hw problems assigned. I used an alternate book the second time as a guide and got through it with a B. Of course my 2nd instructor was very competent so that did help. Along with the Bertin book, this one shares the unique distinction of having no answers in the back to any problems. Just hope for old solutions. Also the examples are very easy and the hw problems are outrageously difficult. Very hardcore and not meant for someone who doesn't already know the material, which would defeat the purpose of it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Engineering circuit Analysis","review":"This book was required of my circuits class. It's explanations are pretty good and the diagrams are good too, but it's hard to mess up circuits. The one thing I truly hate about this book is that it does not have any answers in the back.

Also, the book has no solutions to the odd worked problems. Furthermore, the authors tend to give simple examples in the text and then give extremely difficult homework problems at the end of the chapter. Lastly, the book has a very bad and vague explanation for passive sign convention that will leave you suffering for the duration of the text.If you don't have a good instructor that is willing to fill in the gaps that this book leaves, then chances are you will do poorly in your first circuits class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I have both the sixth and seven additions of this book due to my school requirements. Unfortunately, this book goes through rigorous methods to show proofs for almost every equation. The author wastes a lot of time and effort when you could be shown approaches to analyze the circuits, instead of deriving equations. The book offers a few simplistic examples and then expects you to come up with some serious insight and solve end of chapter problems that they left you unprepared for. Fortunately my instructor had a very straight forward approach to the subject which made the class not so dependent on the book. Otherwise I would have never gotten anything out of my circuits classes. I have also purchased a few supplemental circuit books and although none of them stood out as spectacular every one of them presented the material with more clarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst EE book ever","review":"I've taken a DC and an AC class with this book.

I took a similar class (not for engineers for technicians) and it did a MUCH better job at explaining the material. It was step by step and didn't leave you in the dark. Stupid McGraw-Hill and stupid college and stupid professors.

In chapter two (Ch.1 for practical purposes,) we were so lost that we got the help of a physics grad student I know. Without the solutions, he was lost on several of the problems. We did eventually get through them, but this gives you an idea of what I mean.The book skips many steps in its examples, leaving the student lost and annoyed. They seem to assume that we already know these techniques fluently.We have found so many errors in the homework that I cannot begin to count them all.

Looking at the musicians and producer, you would expect a Joan Armatrading meets Fairport Convention album. They meet, but this is definitely a Joan Armatrading album. I was naive upon listening to the songs. Now that I've lived the songs and know more about the musicians, I appreciate this essential, seminal and influential work more than ever.

Other than that he does not like much. However, I expected my 4 1/2 month kitten to love it. Nope. He will dab at it a few times but quickly loses interest.

I have no idea what it is with this toy, but they love it.It's easy to control with a single finger, making it harder for the cats to tell that you're actually doing anything while you're holding it. But honestly, my cats whap this thing so hard that they can keep themselves busy, while all I have to do is hold the thing! It's been a great way for both of them to get some daily exercise (especially the 2-year-old - she enjoyed a lazy life in her foster home before we adopted her, so she's got a pound to lose!).

I found that if I waited for those times when she got a little frisky (she'd bat my computer cable cord), I could whip out the cat dancer and she'd go crazy playing with it. It was the only toy that she would not ignore. It's erratic movements are perfect to keep here enticed. She especially likes it when I bat it against a wall and it acts like a moth or insect.

This is a great toy, and you can't beat the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly great cat toy","review":"I had one of these years ago and it got bent and no longer worked so good- glad I got a new one- my cats are wild for it. Abbey actually comes over to remind me she needs to play with it- I keep it between two pillows on the sofa and she will start looking around the pillows for it. You get lots of action out of the cat for very little energy expenditure yourself- it bounces back when they play with it and drives them wild. The other cat prefers it to be dragged along the floor but she too is a happy camper when it is out. Get your cats one of these- they will thank you.

Never knew my cat could jump so high until I got this thing.My only concern is the wire. When my cat catches it, he gets really aggressive and starts chewing on the cardboard and I'm afraid that the curved end of the wire will somehow get hooked into his cheek or crack his tooth.

I have to admit, I was a bit \\"underwhelmed\\" when I opened the package - a wire with some twisted cardboard on it...? But, my kids play with the boxes their toys came in - the cats aren't any different! For awhile, I would hold the wire myself and wobble it around. Then I got the idea of fastening one end to a wrought iron baker's rack by weaving it through the wire designs and bending it out and away from the rack. Now the cats bat it around by themselves when I'm doing other things - I can hear the \\"BOING\\" of the wire against the rack all day long - they wear themselves out!! I've ordered 3 more of these to attach to their tree/condo! Fun stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture did not match item","review":"The photo indicates this toy has 5 twist cardboard pieces at the end of it, but mine only had one piece. Not much of a toy. I would return it but that's too much of a bother for a $3 item. Too bad because I was thinking of buying a bunch of them for a local shelter, but won't now at least not through Amazon.

If you use this toy make sure you throw it away as soon as the cardboard starts to disintegrate, which it will relatively quickly.

I must admit - it's beyond simple and they love it. They chase it and jump and if I didn't get tired so easily, they would be playing with it for longer than they do. I would not leave this toy laying around because it is made of wire and small wads of cardboard. You have to use it to get them to play with it. When the cardboard wears out, the toy will need to be replaced, but it is inexpensive and if you buy it with other items, the shipping would probably be free, so if your cats like it, buy a couple next time.I am going to try and do a short video of them playing with it, especially our big 18# Lynx Point Siamese/Tabby mix - he's a riot to watch jumping up to catch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Effective and Indestructible!","review":"This simple device provides hours of interaction and exercise for my high maintenance rescue kitty.

As soon as they notice you have it (i.e., instantly), you are mobbed by cats! Even the shy ones sneak out to bat at it. The Cat Dancer is the only toy I have never seen the cats tire of. We put it away when not in use because the wire could potential be dangerous, but overall this is the perfect toy. It holds up surprisingly well, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cats love it","review":"This toy is so simple. It is just a few pieces of cardboard attached to a wire.

It's cheap and simply made, but it is very effective. If I can figure out a way to anchor one end down, I think the cats would get more enjoyment out of it, as they could play when they wanted to. The only negative is the wire is unpredictable and, occasionally, it bonks the cats in the face. I still think it was worth the money (and I bought 4 so I'd have backups when they eventually eat the cardboard spindles).If you really want to entertain your cats, however, I cannot recommend highly enoughDa Bird."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get enough of this","review":"For our late cat, I got one of these and left it out. Wrong idea. She got bored with it. The vacuum frequently got tangled in it.We now have a mother cat and four six month old kittens. We keep it in a drawer when not playing with them. When I pull it out, they all love it. The more athletic, high-jumping cats (mother and son) will race around and jump high, catch it in their paws, and transfer it to their mouth. The brainier cats like to plan special attacks on it and pounce on it as I make it move about lazily. They all play with it a bit differently but they all play with it.I think the main trick is to make it move like a fly or a moth. Flies and moths bang against walls and windows. They land. They fly off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly dangerous! My kitty lost teeth!","review":"All the positive reviews swayed me into buying this thing.It does what people say...it entertains cats of all ages.BUT this product is horrifically dangerous!I played with my 5-month-old kitty...she went crazy for it, but she ended up biting the little metal part between the cardboard pieces.She lost both of her big bottom teeth from it!I feel so sick and guilty about it...she kept opening her little mouth and licking the air, because she knew something was wrong.She's not in any pain, and my Vet said that those teeth will actually grow back since she's so young.But people need to know how dangerous this is...it's essentially a coat hanger, so I'm sure full-sized cats lose teeth from this thing too.I know you're not supposed to let them bite it. But you have to let them catch it once in while, and it's just not safe for any cat to bite the cardboard, with the metal being so close to it.It's not worth the risk...stick with safe toys!I hate you, Cat Dancer."},{"rating":"1","title":"My cat would not even look at this toy.","review":"Your mileage may differ, but my cat was completely uninterested in the Cat Dancer.

But they didn't think much of it. Didn't entice them one bit.

I was sceptical that it would be even played with just looking at a plain piece of wire with cardboard pieces on the end of it. However, my cats play with this so much that I have to put it away. They know which cabinet I put it in and get WILD when they know its play time. They chatter at it, play cat acrobatics and chase it around with minimal effort on my end. I have a wall attachment that came with mine to hang it on the wall for them and that works very nicely, except I don't leave it out unsupervised - too much fun and a kitten that doesn't know when to stop (the first day he played with it for an hour straight and was VERY tired). I am also worried that they would eat the cardboard pieces off, so just don't leave it out all of the time.

It's simple, inexpensive, and made in the US.One of my cats would even beg to play with it, whenever my husband walked near where we kept the toy.The toy is basically a few pieces of rolled up paper bag on a wire, but when you use it, it bounces around, almost like a bug, and the cats' instincts go crazy. The jumps and flips you can get the younger cats to do are amazing. The older cats will still bat at it and chase it. This thing is great for exercising your cat, and to keep them from getting bored. We also use it to wear them out when they get rambunctious and start picking on one another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible toy!","review":"I read the reviews for Cat Dancer and ordered two, figuring I had little to lose because they were so inexpensive.

My mom came over one day with this, and after shrugging my shoulders at how it looked, we put it to the test... Holy cow! He was all over the place with it! As he was 12, he would only run around after it for about 20 minutes and get tired. Whenever he would lie down, we would just bop it towards his front paws and he'd bat it around while lying down!

They can learn what Robin did, that people can be happy without all the glitz of wealth. Plus no one in the movie gets shot, blown up, or abused.

Just about every picture we have taken (at the highest quality setting) have been blurry and far below the picture quality of the 4 megapixel camera we used previously. We sent the 710 back to Olympus because we were convinced this was a problem with our camera. Olympus wasn't particularly interested to hear that we were loyal customers, said it replaced the lens, and we saw absolutely no difference when we received the camera back.

The description says it has a digital stabilization mode but you couldn't prove it by me, as so many photos turned out blurry. Another huge problem was its slow shutter speed, as time after time, I would lose a shot when friends using other cameras and snapping their shots at the exact same time as me got their photos.One important consideration: the camera does not have a view finder, only the LCD monitor on which to center the image. Perhaps I'm hopelessly old fashioned but I really missed the view finder as using it helps to stabilize the camera and makes centering the image so easy. It takes steady hands to hold a camera at arms length, find and center an image and click the shutter--no wonder the shaky photos. But perhaps the worst failing of the LCD monitor is the glare factor on a sunny day. It makes it very difficult if not impossible to see any image on the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olympus camera","review":"this is a nice compact camera that connects directly to your computer via a usb cable and no additional software needed. consider purchasing a sd card for additonal memory"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Serviceable - Will It Last??","review":"My old Olympus just quit working one day, and at a very inconvenient time and place.

It's been dropped only once in 2007 and still performed well.Sadly, and my assumption as the years went by and after over 1000+ shots taken after a 5 year span, the lens refused to function thus giving me the \\"error lens\\" code.Overall this is a good camera, but after all the rough handling, and exposed to elements during a 5-year span, it finally gave up.It was a good run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ergonomically designed to fall out of your pocket","review":"I bought this camera in a hurry because my other one unexpectedly broke. I don't like going anywhere without a camera. This one is ergonomically designed in a slight wedge shape making it easy to fall out of your pocket. I caught it before it hit the ground. Whew! Further, it is small so if you have large hands you probably don't want this one. The pictures were quite sharp. The viewing screen often whited out in bright, contrasty lighting situations and seemed unable to make a decent exposure in these conditions. I consider that defective. I took it back and got a thoroughly excellentCanon PowerShot A630 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoominstead. Very satisfied with the Canon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I bought this camera after having a Casio Exilim EX-P600 because I wanted something smaller, and liked that it had image stabilization and was weather resistant (important for camping, etc). However, in comparison with my previous Casio Exilim, I have been extremely disappointed with the picture quality - except for outside in bright, indirect light, a good 2/3 of the pictures are blurry and/or incredibly grainy. While its size means that I almost always have this camera with me, I am frustrated and disappointed every time I load the pictures onto my computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olympus Stylus 710.7","review":"The camera we purchased was for one of our daughters for Christmas and she absolutely loves it.

She loves how small it is and she loves the looks of it...Very satisfied with the price and the product..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Olympus 710 screen breaks easily","review":"I had this camera about a week. The screen broke. Olympus warranty would not cover it. The way the camera is shaped it makes breakage at the right side of the screen a probability. I went to two Best Buy stores in Raleigh North Carolina and Orlando. Both store demo units had screens broken in the same area. I wanted to buy the same camera as I had a battery, memory card, etc. I did not by another Olympus 710."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by the glitz","review":"I owned an older Olympus digital camera and the thing I hated the most about it was that it took forever to snap the photo. My subjects would often not be in my picture, would complain about posing or I'd just miss the shot. I loved it otherwise and bought this one. I couldn't believe that it had the same problem! It took forever to snap! I returned it and bought a Canon ELPH and am much happier. The Olympus did take wonderful picutes once you finally got them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grainy, noisy images make this cam dissapointing!","review":"Aesthetically and ergonomically, this is one sleek, gorgeous design. BUT to make a long story short, MANY of the photos taken with this cam are in fact 'grainy' and 'noisy', and unquestionably lacking sharpness and detail (especially indoor flash shots) for what is supposed to be a 7.1 megapixel image. My wife and I actually compared the 'Olympus 710' pics with our 5 year old 'FujiFilm 2650' 2 megapixel camera's pics, and SHOCKINGLY the old 2 megapixel cam won hands down! Go figure. Even our much less expensive 'Nikon Coolpix L14' that we just bought to replace this camera, has far superior quality images. The interesting thing is that I read several posts and/or threads here on 'Amazon' and on the net that allude to the blurry pics that the 710 often displays. Perhaps there was a quality control issue on some of these cams? If anyone else has experienced dissapointing quality images with this cam, please comment below and share your story. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good camera for what it's designed for","review":"I'm a semi-pro photographer. I bought this camera more for my family and 5 year old daughter. It's easier for them to use than my $2K DSLR.Images are as good as expected and the controls are easy to use and very intuitive. My 5 year old takes great pics with it. It's not a DSLR and wont' give stunning images, but the ones I get are more than acceptable for family snapshots with a small amount of post processing in photoshop. Levels, curves and sharpening is all I use to pull out a great photo from the camera.It rocks for taking photos on my bicycle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"I'm not exactly a kid. I'm 18 and interested in electronics.I bought this camera mainly for the size, so it would be able to travel better then my previous camera. It takes beautiful pictures on the no shake mode. However, if you want to use any of the options or \\"special effects\\" you might want to invest in a tripod. But, for my purposes, I just wanted a camera to take shapshots with at parties and such, so I am happy with it. If you're just looking for something small to take around town, this is something you should look at."},{"rating":"1","title":"yikes","review":"This book was horrible for AP Euro, it was not in chronological order and often confused our class.

I don't know about changing your life but listening to the Shins will change the way you listen to music. The depth of this album is on a level that few have ever acheieved. From begining to the end there is not a bad song on it. After listening to this album a hundred times over, I still find myself driving down the road with a smile on my face.

You'll love it! :) thanks for reading"},{"rating":"2","title":"Om Shin Riko","review":"Pretty good and I think more production values would not make much difference here. \\"Wild Honey\\"-era Beach Boys, Nilsson, the Shoes are reference points I guess; also some '70s junk like maybe America or even the Ozark Mountain Daredevils, somehow. The Shins could cover \\"Jackie Blue\\" I think. However, it's not great. I've heard a lot of music like this in my lifetime and when it's all said and done you still can't beat the Zombies or the Left Banke or Brian Wilson at this kind of very fragile thing. Plus Brian Wilson wrote about watching TV and eating and so far I am not sure where the Shins stand on these subjects, altho I like the line about the Birmingham mall. But for young people under 30 who revere the great wistful pop past, it's probably a whole brand new bag and so forth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Condition, Excellent Music","review":"Purchased for my daughter for Christmas.

I saw them open for Preston School of Industry at the Bowery Ballrom in NYC...let's just say the room was much more crowded when the Shins played than when PSOI was on stage (and PSOI is no slouch; their album is also excellent).

NOT VERY!! To be fair, though, I have heard this record, and the gentle sounds are poppy and pleasing - especially if you're trying to cut back on your sleeping pill dosage.These guys have talent, but they're a bit too \\"arty\\" for my taste.

It simply doesn't come up to par with the horde of alternative/indie music that i have purchased over the last decade. Their acoustic sound is nice at times and yes the sound is different, but the vocals are apathetic. The lead singer sounds awful at times, nor can I understand a damn thing he's saying. Just listen to the sound bites above. The New Slang is by far and best effort on the disc, everything else just falls short of expectations. If you like this acoustic sound check out REM Fables of the Reconstruction, much much better. If your a big fan of the New Slang check out The Stone Roses self titled disc. Listen to this disc before buying, don't let the hype cost you money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive none to less","review":"Reading these reviews has told me that 90% of the shins fans writing reviews here came to know who they are from the movie garden State. I am also in this group of people. Garden state which is and incredible movie also had an incredible soundtrack and after hearing the two shins songs I Just had to look them up and they by far one of my favorite bands. Defiently something you dont hear everyday. Im thankfull to Zach Braff for being a fan of the Shins otherwise i would Have never heard there music in Garden State and my life would Still be without the shins. The Shins rock and this album is off the Hook.

Without a doubt one of the best albums in the past year...and there have been lots of great ones.

It took me a year to finally buy this sucker. I saw this album in nearly every \\"Best of 2001\\" list. I couldn't understand why, until I bought the album.This is a unique album in many ways. Whether it be the orignal vocal stylings, or the lyrical subject. The opening track \\"Caring is Creepy,\\" is a lazy, beautiful song. Other highlights include the singles \\"Know Your Onion!\\" and \\"New Slang,\\" and my personal favorite, \\"Pressed In A Book,\\" which is a song that Weezer would be playing in the late 70's.Only one word can describe this album, and that is \\"SUMMER.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Know Your Onion! holds it together","review":"The Shins are one of my favorite groups ever since I saw the video for New Slang on Subpop many many months ago. Song by song they completely change and mold to fit anew.Caring is Creepy-A Garden State song. Very jangly and road trip worthy.One by One All Day-Spaced at first. Becomes a summer convertible song.Weird Divide-One of my other favorite songs off of Inverted. Very spaced and worthy of an Alexander Payne movie.Know Your Onion!-This is my favorite of all the songs. It's lyrics ring true to my life experiences.New Slang-Another Garden State song. The song that \\"will change your life I promise you.\\" It really will, I swear.The Celibate Life-Drags on a little bit. Good writing though.Girl On The Wing-Not a big fan of this one.Your Algebra-2 minutes and 23 seconds of short lyrics.Pressed in a Book-To me this song deserves to be dissected by scientists to find all of the different meanings. There are so many.The Past and Pending-Great way to end it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Every song on this album is important, every song is beautifully written and sung.

But all the songs are great too.I recommend this album to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"They hit gold with the Garden State soundtrack","review":"I love The Shins now. Have I always? No. I heard great things about them surrounding the release of Garden State, and with mild trepidation, decided to try out some of their music. I was very impressed and bought this album....and then later on I purchased Chutes Too Narrow.Both are great albums, but O.I.W, is such an easy listen, with no songs I skip over. They're all feel good songs (aside from the rather ominous, Your Algebra), and I can assure you, you will feel good after listening to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undeniably dear to me","review":"Can you channel someone that isn't even dead yet? James Mercer beats Sean O'Hagen at the Brian Wilson perfect-pop game. Why is it a bad thing that this album is heavily influenced by '60s pop? The Kinks, The Beach Boys, even Pink Floyd circa Sid Barret all blend together with beautifully reverbed, Friends of Dean Martinez style guitars. Girl Inform Me and The Celibate Life are amazing, heavily laced with Pet Sound-caliber melodies. New Slang recalls old Moody Blues, this song is one of my favorites on the album, with a heavy reverb-Spaghetti Western guitar fill. A few songs have an early '80s keyboard sound, but in a good way. In my opinion, pop music doesn't get any better than this. Lyrically, melodically, totally captivating. Must stop listening to this CD, must stop listening"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Had to Write a Review","review":"I think this is the best thing to come along in quite a while.

So get this album, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tracks 1-6","review":"It's too bad that listening to tracks 1 through 6 isn't an option here at Amazon, because those songs are truly the window to this album. Especially, \\"Know Your Onion\\" and \\"Girl Inform Me.\\" However, the idea is still there within the other tracks: a grand album of understatement and nervous energy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"I am always in a mood to listen to the Shins.

I have all their albums and I don't know which one I like best."},{"rating":"2","title":"DESERT BAKED POP BURQUE STYLE","review":"Lush vocal lines and complimentary synth quirks transport the listener into the euphoric world of the Shins.The Shins unique blend of melodic pop trancends classification and stays fresh from song to song. Caring is Creepy opens the the album with a hopeful aire and captivating bounce. The true gems are buried deeper into the track list with Girl On The Wing, New Slang, & Pressed In A Book. Oh, Inverted World is the beginning of something great. Add this to your collection now so you can brag about being down from the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant, derivative fun","review":"(Actually **1/2, but Amazon doesn't allow half stars.)This is pleasant, melodic and fairly intelligent indie pop rock that does nothing that hasn't been before but does it rather well. Standout track \\"Know Your Onion!\\" is a catchy, jaunty ditty about adolescent alienation and includes a lyric about finding one's favorite record \\"lying in wait at the Birmingham mall.\\" Since these guys are American, from New Mexico, that's a little silly, and it's even more so to reflect that the slowly strummed and murmured \\"Weird Divide\\" could just as easily have been titled \\"We Like Syd Barrett.\\" This is pretty good pop though, offering annoying and endearing prettiness in about equal measure.Song by song:1 Caring Is Creepy ***2 One by One All Day **3 Weird Divide ***4 Know Your Onion! ***5 Girl Inform Me **6 New Slang **7 The Celibate Life ***8 Girl on the Wing ***9 Your Algebra **10 Pressed in a Book **11 The Past and Pending *"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Nicely written but not that exciting.

Surpises like this remind me why it's cool to buy vinyl. The production is another cool surpise of this album with lots of sonic variety and an obvious late 60's lo-fi pop aesthetic. The music is very listenable and The Shins point to greatness throughout this record (especially with \\"The Great Divide\\"). The only thing that stops this album from being great is ultimately the lyrics. They are trying to be clever, but it comes across as pretentious, especially with such forgettable words like \\"quotient\\", \\"celibate\\", and \\"condescending\\". Yes, this is a lukewarm review, but so is the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"No shinguards needed!","review":"Wow, great album from the indie rockers who have appeared on both the acclaimed Garden State soundtrack and the soundtrack for the O.C. Great, folky rock with interesting vocals, and tracks that stick in your head. Beautiful acoustic peices such as new slang with it's reassuring background \\"Ooh\\" mix well with more accesible electric tracks such as \\"Caring Is Creepy\\", and \\"Girl on the Wing\\". The dada-ist poetrys of James Mercer pair excellently with the creative vocal style and music of the band"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shins - music spreading quickly","review":"First of all, the music on this cd is original and no song is alike. This is one of the few cd's in my collection that I can listen to day after day after day. I commend the band for thinking up such original songs. I would also like to urge all listeners of The Shins to buy their cd and not burn it. The band is just starting out and they need the money to make new songs. This cd is A+ material. Go out and buy it. No questions asked.

The best I can come up with is: This is a PERFECT pop/rock record. The songs are meticulously crafted... wonderfully catchy and richly textured at the same time. It amazes me that this record is only 33 minutes, because it *feels* like so much more -- there's so much great music in it!... No fewer than 9 of the 11 songs are absolute gems. And another thing... I continue to be stunned by how many times I can play this CD and still thoroughly enjoy it... it's actually starting to freak me out! GET THIS RECORD."},{"rating":"2","title":"creative relaxation","review":"This is one of the few albums I play all the way through. It's tough to sort through all of the new garage/indie/emo music right now yet this one gets consistent play on my radio. My favorite is \\"girl inform me\\" and \\"new slang\\" The lyrics about the bakers at dawn cutting their thumbs and bleeding into their buns could be lysergic mumblings, but still a fresh creative force to be reckoned with. I emphatically recommend this one. It automatically relaxes my head and forces me to think. A refreshing drink of creative music in an otherwise R&B desert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and Beautiful","review":"Basically this album is amazing. The lyrics are interesting and catchy, with the music giving me the cheerful nostalgic feeling that is felt on last days of school. This is an essential indie-pop album."},{"rating":"2","title":"the smoothest and purest melodies heard in years","review":"I first bought this album last summer and was immediately knocked out by 'new slang'. The song has a hypnotic steadiness to it that really sucks you in to the wonderful melody. Melody certainly seems to be one of the big points with this album and every single track delivers smooth and fairly original hooks. What I believe sets this album apart from other modern\\\\\\"retro\\"pop albums is the band's (led by songwriting Mercer) ability to create extremely vivid moods in the listeners mind with fairly minimal instrumentation. 'one by one all day' puts you right in Mercer's southwestern childhood nostalgia, while 'wierd divide' is a perfect encapsulation of the swoon of a relationship. The album's lyrics are yet another strong point: vivid, original, and intelligent, perfectly matching mood with lyrical sentiment.GET THIS ALBUM! Give it about 5 or 6 solid listens and just try to resist its mellow, summery pop magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen, love it, get it.","review":"I know this album is a few years old but I just recently got it and it is one of the best albums I've heard in years. The first time I listened to it, it reminded me of early Pink Floyd like Piper at the Gates of Dawn. After listening to it a few more times, it also is reminiscent of some of later Beatles albums like Let It Be. Pretty stellar company. I don't know why this album didn't get more airplay but I would recommend it. The songs are beautifully written, performed, and the album is masterfully produced. Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have stopped at the first part.","review":"I had a feeling when I learned that Julia Glass won a prize for \\"Best Novella\\" for the first part of the book (\\"Collies\\") that all of the good stuff would end there. The first part of THREE JUNES is excellent, but the rest of the book is so tiresome that it is hard to believe it was written by the same person. The author should have left \\"Collies\\" as it was - a beatifully written, somewhat heartbreaking account of the family. The rest of the book is quite uninteresting, and frankly, quite boring. I found myself in the middle of the book saying, \\"I don't care about this Fenno dude, nor his AIDS-stricken friend.\\" For such a powerful topic, the book could have been much more moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Junes: A Pleasent, Emotional Experience.","review":"Three Junes was a bit tedious because of the plethora of lengthy in-depth descriptions, but it also gave you a clear picture of what the author was trying to communicate.

Ended up thoroughly enjoying the experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOKCLUB SELECTION, NOT MINE","review":"WHILE THE WRITING ITSELF WAS WELL DONE, THE STORY WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING.

Glass's characters are earnest and thoughtful, carefully observed and rendered. The narrative, unlike most recent NBA winners, is more conventionally structured than not, thus requiring little stitching by the reader. I found that to be a relief: good story, told more or less conventionally, well-written. Not much, if any, evil; little gritty inexplicable. The book is full of kindness and color, but not at the expense of mystery. If what you'd like more than anything is to spend the weekend with thoughtful, intimate friends who know books and art and good food, yet don't feel you have much to offer in return, Three Junes is the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"What am I missing?","review":"Is it me?? This is an award winner and recommended by a few friends, but to me it's slow-paced, unfocused and unengaging; the characters are bland and the story uninspiring. I'm 200 pages in and not sure what the point is. The NY Times reviewer calls it a plot-driven novel, but to me it's nearly absent a plot, and the characters aren't interesting enough to carry it. I tried it once and put it down, am plodding through it now for my book group. Otherwise I'd have given up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"I generally try to read award-winning books as a way to avoid bad or uninteresting books. This was a mildly interesting story involving largely one-dimensional characters who whine a lot about their lives, their parents, their siblings. I found the author's persistent use of parentheticals tedious. I may be missing something, but I would not place this book in the same category with Cold Mountain, another National Book Award winner that is far superior to Three Junes. The best I could say about Three Junes is that it is good for a first novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"...a masterpiece","review":"Every once in a while, a novel comes along that makes you reexamine and reevaluate the life you lead. In Three Junes, Julia Glass has created characters that we yearn to understand and in so doing, come to love. Her appreciation for life and its idiosyncrasies is at once beautiful and reassuring. This is what the 21st century novel is supposed to be and what we are so often lacking in other's writing. This is a must read for anyone who appreciates serious fiction today."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave it one star because I couldn't give it less","review":"Characters were so one dimensional. If someone was \\"good\\" they were so good they seemed afflicted. The \\"bad\\" people were all exactly the same. The only character that I liked was the parrot. Has Ms Glass never heard that we readers hate, hate, hate when a new character is introduced in the last chapter?The lady who picked this for book club ended up quiting, she felt we were narrow minded and homophobic. Out of twelve of us only a couple thought it was okay.If you have trouble sleeping this is the book for you, it will put you right out...like a light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Reasons Not to Read","review":"Number One: the Scottish sections read almost like a parody of a Scot's sentiments. Glass' \\"Scottish\\" voice is lacking authenticity.Number Two: the appliqué method, where three stories are told in succession, does little to elucidate the motivations of the characters. Glass gives the impression that she is retelling the same story, but with little depth as we read.Number Three: the novel is marred by cliché, a kind of PC enrichment of sentiment, which appears to mask for a lack of authorial skill. When a writer can't pull something off, it is easy to hide behind well worn cultural solipsism to generate sympathy and support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"We read this book for our book club and we were all disappointed. It wasn't anything like what we were expecting from the description on the back of the book. The lady who picked it was afraid we would be offended by it, luckily we weren't. It was just hard to get into until almost two thirds of the way through, then when I finished I was very disappointed because some of the issues she bought up weren't resolved very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flashbacks!","review":"I purchased this book after reading a sample so I should have gotten something I would enjoy. Unfortunately, it wasn't til I got the full version that the shifting back and forth in time and then back and forth in generations started. I suffered through a third of this book and then gave up. Too hard to follow and not enough in the story to put up with the changing back and forth for me to want to continue. It is now in archive and incompletely read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks fierceness and depth","review":"I really found Three Junes by Julia Glass to be tedious beyond belief. In a way, Glass seemed to be copying The Hours. The triptych, the gay man dying of AIDS, etc. But her novel doesn't have the depth and emotional complexity that The Hours, at it best, manages to give us.Instead, she takes refuge in a kind of narrative \\"niceness,\\" and the sentimentality of The Three Junes becomes a smoke screen she can hide behind. But the cost to her (and to her readers) is that what remains is evasive, chatty, charming, shallow and disingenuous.There! I've had my little tantrum...and she is only one of literally thousands of writers who treat novels as if they are potluck: a little of this and a little of that and let's hope for the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone tell me how to finish this book!","review":"I just can't get through this book. I have dragged myself through 100 pages and I am starting to feel my life is wasting away. I don't care about the characters because I don't know a thing about how they feel. The entire book is either a monotonous recounting of events or dialogue between extremely flat characters. Save yourself $12 and buy a book that is well-written and relatable...may I suggest \\"Crow Lake\\" by Mary Lawson, \\"The Red Tent\\" by Anita Diamant or \\"Raising Fences\\" by Michael Datcher. There you go, something for everyone and a 100 times better than Three Junes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Junes","review":"I read about 2/3s of this book and gave up. It's extremely boring and pointless. Nothing happens in this entire book. No murders. No action. No nothin'!It's called Three Junes not because it's about three people named June, but because the book is split up into 3 parts that all take place in June of different years.The first part is about Paul McLeod. The entire story is about him on a cruise. That's it. Nothing happens on the cruise.The second part is about Paul's son Fenno. This was probably the best of the 3 stories. Fenno is gay and owns a book store in Manhattan. His neighbor, Mal, asks him to take his bird Felicity for him. He wants her to have a home after he is gone. You see Mal is dying of AIDS.Fenno also meets Tony. A gay photographer who's house sitting in Manhattan. They have wild sex every day for a while and then Tony disappears.And I didn't finish the 3rd part. I tried, but I just couldn't make it.Please, don't read this book. It's a total waste of your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"a story with no agenda","review":"Reading this book made me feel as if I was watching life. No conclusions, no moral of the story, no agenda. I thought the story telling was fluid - one of the few novels I have read where I didn't have the impulse to flip through the pages looking for the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful read!","review":"As someone who reads very quickly, I generally have to read quite a few books before uncovering a book that makes an impression on me. There are very few books that make me stop and reflect upon either a great writing style or a great story line. This book has both. The characters are so well drawn and the backdrop of their individual lives is wonderfully interwoven over a period of three years. The author simply but richly portrays her characters and, although there really are only glimpses into their lives, it is easy for one's imagination to fill in the pieces. Fenno was a wonderful central character, a (...)man without the obnoxious affectations that one generally encounters both in literature and, sometimes, in real life. He is a man struggling with relationships, just like us all! This is a rich and delightful book that should leave most readers very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"Three Junes is a lovely read, one that begins strongly and only gets better. The story concerns a Scottish family and begins in June 1989. Paul McLeod, recently widowed, takes a tour to Greece, contemplating his future, his past, his family. Jump ahead six years and we are in Scotland, where Paul's three sons are preparing for his funeral. Jump again four years, to Eastern Long Island, a weekend get together with two of Paul's sons and Fern, a woman Paul met on his trip to Greece. It is hard to do justice to this novel in a few pithy sentences. The writing is beautiful and Glass gives us characters we can care about deeply. Their lives are complicated, but without any melodrama or pyrotechnics. Her writing is simply beautiful and I believe gets stronger as the novel progresses. I thoroughly enjoyed this beautiful novel and highly recommend it. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most exceptional books I have ever read","review":"I never reread books; there's simply too many new and interesting things to warrant going back over ground already covered. But I make an exception for \\"Three Junes.\\" I have read it three times and I have a plan to go back to it every other summer, as a special treat for my summer vacation. The year after I got it I gave it as a Christmas present to everyone in my family who I thought could remotely connect with this. Glass makes Fenno and Mal as real as any characters I have ever encountered in literature. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant writing","review":"Three Junes is this year's National Book Award winner for good reason. Julia Glass has that rare gift for gracefully interweaving the lives of her characters and effortlessly bouncing back and forth between different places and periods in time. She also draws her characters full of life, emotion, and humanity. This novel is an excellent portrait of the modern family. Each member leads his own life in its own unique direction, and yet what they have in common ultimately proves stronger than their differences or the distance that separates them. Fenno is one of the most charming characters I've come across in modern literature recently. Funny and kind, insecure and self-deprecating, sensitive and compassionate, he is loveable for both his strengths and his flaws. This is excellent writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I missed it","review":"Whatever the draw for this book was, I missed it. I know it got awards and great reviews, but I couldn't find the wonderful. I had to start it twice to try to \\"get it\\" but, I never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Junes -Where did They Get That Name?","review":"Sometime ago I read my Sunday paper and noted that \\"Three Junes\\" was listed as a popular book choice. The title sounded interesting so I bought it. That was 2 months ago and I am still trying to get through the paperback edition. It is difficult to follow the timeline, to understand the characters and where they fit, and to get involved in the storyline. I will finish the book because that's my style. It has not been a book that I could not wait to get back to."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Hardest reads!","review":"I'm sure that Julia Glass has a real talent and decriptive ability, but for the average person, this was a complicated, hard to follow epic. I found it disjointed and felt as though I was left hanging at the end. It was a very unfulfilling conclusion.I do feel that Ms. Glass's decriptions were brilliant and feel as though I can picture all that she wrote about it.Good luck to all who attempt this novel. It was not well received in our ten person Book Club."},{"rating":"1","title":"National Book Award, what were they thinking?","review":"I just didn't care about any of these characters and found many of them to be literary cliches (especially Fenno and Mal). A previous reviewer compared Three Junes to something Maeve Binchy might write. True, but she would've done a better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"This book is so \\"flat\\". It lacks characterization. I should have put it down after she drowned the puppy. The first 2 sections are centered around funerals with flashbacks that do not offer any insight. I am not sure if I will get through the third section. This book sounds like it was written by a high school English student. It lacks depth. It is such a disappointment. Perhaps if it had a better description on the book I wouldn't have bought it. I feel I was mislead into this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"I love reading, especially a first book. But this is one of the worst books I have ever, ever read. How did it ever get into print? Let alone win an Award! Amazing. No plot; lots of ends left hanging; sloppy grammar. Save your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick!","review":"Not for me. This book got very low ratings in our book club. Glass has an agenda that I don't agree with. A very liberal view of life. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-hyped","review":"After reading all the glowing reviews on this book, I couldn't believe how bad it was. There are loose strings all over the place. The novel seems to be 3 short stories put together, but with no resolution on any of the significant issues that could tie everything together. The best characters are not well developed, although there are hints that these characters could have made up a compelling story. The main character, who is well drawn, is completely uninteresting with unclear motives.There is no denying that some of the writing is exceptional. But a novel commands that there be a plot and that it has characters that the reader will care about. Neither happened in my case. I only finished the book, because I kept hoping that something would happen and because I am reading the book for a book club. Fluff isn't enough.I would recommend this book to no one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first time i feel like writing an auther a letter!","review":"Loved this book, one of the best reads I've ever experienced. Perfectly written, quite beautiful prose. Great characters, i wanted to know them all. I was bummed when it was finished I could have read about these people forever"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Glimpse Into a Fascinating World","review":"The three best books I have read in the past year are: Lucky Monkeys In The Sky by Michele Geraldi, The Five People You Meet In Heaven by Mitch Albom, and Three Junes by Julia Glass. Each book takes you deeper than ordinary run of the mill fiction. Each book has a real story to tell, a real meaning, an education, if you will. Each book celebrates family and individuality. Each book promises that orginality is the key to happiness, success and love. I am glad to find real authors such as these, authors who don't write for money, but simply want to tell their story instead. I will keep these novels for my children to read one day when they are old enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Junes","review":"I admire the author's beautiful writing, especially the opening of the book, when Paul joins a group tour of the Greek Islands. From the second part on, I found the story difficult to follow. Fenno's switch-back-and-forth narration lost me a few times and I almost gave up. But I forced myself to stay on to the end. Not that I enjoyed the suffering, but I was curious--I wanted to be convinced. For a book to win the National Book Award, there must be a reason. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Junes","review":"What a wonderful book. These are characters that you know in your life. Who feel what everyone feels at various times.It made me laugh out loud and cry many tears.A lovely story that keeps the readers attention, making one think as you turn each page.Three Junes is one I will read over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"If these characters really existed...","review":"I would want to meet them all. This is one of those books you finish wishing it could have lasted longer. (Don't listen to the negative reviews--the readers must have eaten some bad haggis sometime.) I didn't give it five stars because I did get slightly confused in the second part where I had trouble figuring out who was where when (read it to see what I mean). But that is a minor complaint, really. Just enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, Boring, Jumps from Past to Present Too Often","review":"I had heard how wonderful this books was, but I found it slow, boring, and the writer jumps around from past to present so often, that I found myself not even knowing who the characters were - I had to stop and either think about who the character was or actually go back through previous pages to refresh my memory as to who they were. To be quite honest, I so loathed the way this book was written that I didn't even bother finishing it. If a book doesn't pique my interest in 50 pages, then it isn't worth my time to finish. This book DEFINITELY was not worth my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!","review":"I really have been trying but I am now halfway through the book and still completely uninterested. I have to force myself to continue reading as though it were some sort of high school extra credit assignment. Nothing happens in this overly detailed, tedious book. I am into the second section of it and it's even more boring than the first. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Luminous","review":"Glass has written a beautiful novel. I hope she will continue to write and write this well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have a friend who liked this novel so when it won the National Book Award I thought it would be one I'd like to read. How it won the award is beyond me. I didn't even finish it because the third story with the young girl( I don't even remember her name) wasn't compelling. I didn't find the writing as good as many other reviewers did. And much that happened seemed improbable. With so many great novels being written I hope we can award the very best."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get it","review":"I did finish this book because someone recommended it. I never did get what was the author's purpose for this story. I found it full of superfluous ramblings that had nothing to do with the story and caused my mind to stray so that when it came back to some relevant point, my mind was no longer engaged. I found it so frustrating to keep having to go back to figure out what mattered and what didn't matter. The author is a good writer but not a great writer. A great writer can do these sidebar ramblings adding richness to the story. This did not happen for me. I finished it and thought \\"what a waste of time\\". That said, I would give her another try because so many people seem to like her writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum","review":"This book is basically 3 separate short stories, yet there are characters from each story that are related in the previous stories, but yet not always explained how they were related. I kept thinking it would all come together in the end; yet it never did. At times it was entertaining, but in the end, I didn't get the point of the stories. They just seemed to ramble on, with no clear storyline. If I had to summarize the book: it's about a gay man, who moves away from his family in Scotland to live in America. He has poor choices in friends, and many of them die of AIDS. Oh, and his deceased mother was good at breeding Collies."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than I wanted to know!","review":"I enjoyed the first part of the book but I was not prepared for the gay sex in the second part. It's not that I'm against gay sex for gay people but I'm just not willing to read about it. A more honest back page would give a warning to buyers so those that want this could buy it and those that don't could choose something else. I threw it in my recycle bin as I was not willing to pass it on to friends or family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, it annoyed me.","review":"Not that she writes poorly, but Julia Glass completely failed to captivate me with this book. It took me three months to finish it (reluctantly), and I didn't understand nor did I like the \\"design\\" of this novel...three separate stories, the last of which didn't connect to the first (I was expecting it to all along). To each her own, but I found this book boring and annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome Bore of a Book with Unlikable Characters","review":"This book was a complete bore. Fenno, main character, was a tiresome (and tired) pseudo-intellectual without an once of umph or ambition to get himself out of his blah's. Also, why the blah's? Get off your self absorbed/self pittying [backside] and have a little fun - which is my take on all the main characters in this book. This book is a complete discredit to the National Book Award. Skip it and go on to something more insightful and less precious. It doesn't even deserve one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but rambling","review":"I read this based on other people's recommendations and glowing reviews.The book is well crafted, and serves as a sort of travelogue. The descriptions of places are excellent. From the expanse of a Greek island to the aisles of a tiny bookstore, you can imagine how every thing looks, feels and smells.Somehow, this does not extend to the author's character development. If you are looking for a book where the characters have a moment of redemption, or epiphany, or even purpose then this is not the book for you.I found that disjointed story lines rambled to unsatisfying conclusions, and that characters who appeared in overlapping story lines were just coincidental.To say that the book reached a conclusion is a stretch. It would be more accurate to say that it rambled to an ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Slow Read","review":"I am normally a fast reader. This book is well written, but the story line is slow and drages. It took me some time to get through this book. The book was a dissapointment, considering it won the National Book Award. Not something I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The first part of the book held my interest and I cared about the character. The second section, \\"Upright\\" is just plain too long and boring. I really don't want to hear every detail about Fenno, a very uninteresting character. I'm about ready to quit the book. Can't imagine how it became a best seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"This is the worst book I have read in a long time. It is boring, disjointed, and goes nowhere. Part 1 started off okay. Part 2 went downhill and I thought it would never end. Part 3 -I expected that section to develop the lives of Fenno's brothers and their families. WHY FERN? WHO IS FERN? Who cares?I could hardly wait to get to the end and throw the book out. I won't even give it away to a friend. How in the world could this book ever have received rave reviews and awards?????"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"This book has to be one of my all time favorites. I couldn't put it down, but I didn't want it to end, so when I finished it I started reading at the beginning again. The characters were so endearing, each in their own way. I would like to read about them some more, so Julia, Get out your pen, and write a part II, and III and etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and boring","review":"This book was so slow! Normally I fly through books and this one took me over a month to finish becaust it was so boring! The first part was relatively decent, Paul's life was pretty interesting. After the first section though, it's not worth reading. Way too much on unlikable characters: Fenno, Mal, and Fern. I was hoping that the book would tell one of the other brother's stories after Fenno's, but for some reason it switched over to Fern."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish...","review":"I would love to see what this author could do with a GOOD storyline. Her wonderful style of writing really caught my attention and I thought I was going to thoroughly enjoy the book; however, I just could not get into the confusing and drawn out plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"I suggest you skip this one","review":"This book is very flowery and ornate in its language.

I should've known when I started it that it was going to be depressing. I have read my share of sad books and often enjoyed them when they offered insight into human nature or offered a message of sorts. This book has literally nothing to offer. It doesn't leave you feeling good or even remotely satisfied. I would summarize the book as others have done but a reader of this would be bored to tears by the summary. I hope that after reading this no one will choose to read or buy this book. The ending was the worst part. I actually threw the book across the room when I finished reading it because I was so absolutely dissatisfied. The most terrible thing was that the author set up a really good outline that could have had the most moving ending with so many twists that do not serve the point they could have. There was a chance for this book to be entertaining but it is not worth the time it takes to drudge through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Compelling, thoughtful and thought-provoking. Strong and memorable characters, though somewhat flawed by the occasional piece of clunking dialogue.By the way, I have to say that the following quote, from a reader's review below:\\"I felt I was not prepared for this much gayness when I read the book. It deeply disturbed me that the publisher had to go in such length to ?hide? the main plot from its potential readers.\\"is the funniest, most moronic thing I have ever read on Amazon.

The characters are interesting and make you want to keep reading. \\"Upright\\" - the second section - dwells on Fenno - the gay character who has no idea how to live, love, or simply exist. He's completely uninteresting and reading the overly long section is painfully slow. \\"Boys\\" - the third section - concentrates on a completely different character who is only slightly more interesting than Fenno. The writing throughout is overly showy and detracts from the story. Read the first section and move on to your next book. The second and third sections are snooze city."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time - ignore this book","review":"National Book Award, what were you thinking? The writing is extremely tedious. The numerous parentheses and flashbacks in the book stop you from really getting into the story (which is okay, I guess, since the story is not that exciting). It's like if you were jogging (or biking) and someone constantly stopped you and then you were allowed to continue for 1 more block and then stopped again. I could excuse that kind of writing if there was good character development (this happens in some books. I once read a book where the writing was awful but the story was interesting) or a fun story. Save your money and more importantly your time and pick another book. I actually did not buy this book (my wife bought the book 3 years ago).If the choppiness of this review annoyed you, then Three Junes is especially not for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Not Get Through It","review":"Honestly this book was so slow moving I never ended up fisihing it.

Who but a gay man wants to read about a gay man's affairs and lusts? I wish the reviews and summary had told me what I was going to read before I -in haste- bought this book. I didn't even bother to finish the book, and I am left with a bad taste in my mouth for having tried. Not only does the book delve controversially, but it also proceeds at an exceedingly dull pace (in Book Two).

Sorry....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wholly Unsatisfying","review":"Although beautifully written in certain places, the writing is more often pendantic, plodding, obtuse, and self indulgent. Rather than a novel, this book is more realistically a collection of three loosely related essays that would appeal only to the most patient of readers. Characters are introduced, the reader comes to care about them, only for the author to abandon them altogether. Major issues are introduced (i.e., the mother's possible relationships with another man, Paul's possible relationship with Marjorie in Greece, and the chance encounter between Fenno and Fern -- who had met Fenno's father a decade before), but are never explored, fully developed, discovered by those who should have discovered them, or resolved. There are so many loose ends, the book nearly unravels. The ending is equally dissatisfying, as the \\"novel\\" merely peters out. Perhaps the author simply ran out of ways to twist a sentence into near oblivion."},{"rating":"1","title":"National Book Award???? Really???","review":"After starting this book once before and putting it down from boredom, I was determined to finish it the second time around. (Upon finishing the book I realized I should not have been so determined).The novel, broken up into three parts, lacks reader interest, good story flow and connectivity. The author tries to tell the story and history of the McLeod family but I found it way too complicated to comprehend the story the author was trying to convey."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent piece","review":"Amartya Sen really questions the very foundations that determine of what is equality and development.

It was love - and in particular, it was \\"Me Myself I\\" that helped me through some very difficult times in my life.Joan's music is intensely personal, sometimes overwhelmingly so. Yet, her emotional risks in her music are precisely what make her music so appealing.I think many people will identify with Joan at different points in their lives, and the music at each stage wonderfully captures where so many of us were in our twenties, thirties, and older.So much less heralded than she deserves commercially, Joan should have a place in your heart and your music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Jokers might think this isn't worth 5 stars","review":"This is an absolutely stunning, painfully funny film, shamefully underrated (see also 'Office Space', 'Dirty Work' for similarly overlooked comic masterpieces). I'm not such a huge Ben Stiller fan, apart from in 'Mary, and 'Royal Tennenbaums', but he is perfectly cast here, as a reticent man, forced into some horrifically uncomfortable public humiliations.It wouldn't be fair to reveal much of the plot, but the climax of Stiller's search for his biological parents is pure gut-renching black comedy.Don't believe the critics who give this anything less than 5 stars - this is top-quality entertainment, for those who like their comedy black, and on the dry side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Side-splitting laughs","review":"This film has so many turns....you don't know where it will go next.

Great cast, this is why I purchased DVD- but found movie to be silly and a waste of time to watch.So disappointed in this movie, that I am passing it on to a library book sale in my neighborhood!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hurting with laughter","review":"A young couple with a newborn child (Ben Stiller and Patricia Arquette) go on a quest to find the husband's birth parents in the company of an official from the adoption agency (Tea Leoni). The trip will not go as planned, straining their relationship at a vulnerable time and introducing them to a variety of bizarre characters.Writer / director David O. Russell has crafted a terrific screwball comedy with an outstanding cast. The movie would have been good anyway, but watching such veterans as George Segal, Mary Tyler Moore, Alan Alda, and Lily Tomlin go through their paces multiplies the delight. At the center of all the craziness is a credible portrait of a brittle marriage at that turning point where it could either fall apart or endure and become stronger, making the film more than just a nonstop cavalcade of zaniness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best armpit licking scene ever","review":"Ben Stiller is once again out to \\"meet the parents\\" - his own parents this time - but doing so proves, well, almost disasterous. The film presents an amusing cross-section of white America. Ben Stiller plays another uptight role (a blend of the Ben Stiller from Reality Bites/Meet the Parents/Royal Tenenbaums). I laughed out loud a few times and grinned quite a bit too. This movie is not for the typical movie watcher who still finds Hollywood formula comedies amusing. If you loved the Royal Tenenbaums you'd probably like or love this film. And any movie with an armpit licking scene is worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"No, that's the dogs pillow.","review":"This is one great movie. A comedy that gathers it's laughs from characterization and situation colliding in excellent harmony without the use of brainless fart jokes or prosthetic genetalia. The cast is top notch and the writing is dryly hilarious, something unexpected amidst the cookie-cutter comedy that lurks at your local multiplex/video store. Easily Ben Stiller's best movie and Tea Leoni's performance is bordering on comedic genius. For me to expain the plot would be futile, this film should be on every fan's list of funniest films, for it holds a place on my shelf and it is taken down to remind me what a good, funny movie is two to three times monthly. (...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"good clean fun!","review":"Really deserves 3.5 stars but I'll give the extra 1/2 star due to Tea Leoni's fetchingness.Well all in all this is nowhere as good as David Russel's other films \\"Three Kings\\" or \\"I Heart Huckabees\\" but not bad either.You certainly won't be bored, or confused---the plot is simple but played at hyperspeed, it's basically a comedy of the absurd with a minimum of Message/subtext, just a lot of slapstick as well as comic irony. Very easy on the brain...However there is no laugh track so thicker viewers might be scratching their heads at some of the non-slapstick humor.Probably the whole film can be summed up in the final scene, when two straightlaced evangelical types explain their opposition to gay marriage leading to gays adopting children with, \\"Imagine all the neurosis those poor children would have to live with\\"---when in fact what we've been watching is 2 hours of 100% HETEROSEXUAL traditional-family neurosis!!! : )"},{"rating":"1","title":"obnoxious","review":"If loud, cranky, hyperactive Jewish neurotic comedy is your cup of tea, this will seem like heaven.

I quickly ordered it and awaited the day when it would be delivered.After the first 30 minutes, I was bored. I turned it off and tried again to watch it a few days later. Loving Meet the Parents and Something about Mary, this movie was NOTHING in comparison to either of them. Very dark, dry humor about ben's character going cross country with his wife, child, social worker and two policeman who come along for the ride.I will admit that there were a couple of giggle moments (not laugh, giggle) but over-all, I was dissapointed with Flirting with Disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"This just isn't a good movie, and I like movies","review":"I like independant films, I like Ben Stiller and Patricia Arquette, and while Tea Leoni isn't all that consistent an actress I've always had the hots for her, so I thought this was a sure bet. It just didn't come through. Stiller's character is actually quite annoying, Arquette's role is a thin caricature, and Tea Leoni's character, even when she's running around in her underwear, is just too strange to bear. I wish I had liked this film, but the whole thing just fell flat. Find a better move to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD/VHS Trade-off","review":"See it's sort of a toss-up, 'cause on the one hand, you've got the film in widescreen with better (not spectacular) picture and sound, but, on the other hand, the VHS version has two more outtake scenes in the credits.

I guess it's me. I just didn't get it. A friend of mine recommended this film to me and I was really excited about seeing it hoping for some really good laughs. Unfortunately, I mostly sat there wondering what was supposed to be so funny. I found it shrill and disjointed. And after seeing Tea Leoni in three films now I honestly feel she should stick to television or get out of acting period. She really reeks. And it wasn't funny when Mary Tyler Moore bragged about how wonderful her breasts still looked at her age. It was, sadly, embarrassing. A wonderful cast in what I feel was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positive","review":"Purchased as a Christmas gift to replace a set of which one was lost.

Her debut FIRST LOVE is awesome and it sold over 8 million copies! Hikaru sings with passion, emotion, and a playful voice on various tracks. FIRST LOVE is pure R&B/pop that surpasses most teen pop albums out there. First, Hikaru writes her own songs and she delivers them very well when singing. I was surprised to find out her age when this was released back in 1999. Once again you don't need to speak japanese to enjoy this album. You'll be humming along anyway! FIRST LOVE is a classic in the world of pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely loved it!","review":"This has got to be one of the best j-pop cd's ever. I never skip a track and I listen to it often. One thing that I love about Utada is that her English is superb in comparision to most Asian singers, besides Coco Lee. \\"First Love\\" and \\"Give Me a Reason\\" are standout tracks, but I'd recommend any of the other tracks at the blink of an eye. I am anxiously waiting for her next album which has the English track \\"Fly Me to the Moon,\\" which is very addicting. For those people who don't usually listen to j-pop, make this an exception!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Japanese R&B--At It's Finest","review":"I bought this CD last summer while spending some time in Shibuya and I have to admit that for as bad as J-Pop can get, Utada Hikaru's CD is very good. While most Japanese artist hang-out around the edges of R&B, Utada jumps right in! The Japanese language even lends itself very well to Soul music. \\"Automatic\\" is the stand-out track on this CD, but all of the tunes are full of spunk.Another very good Japanese R&B artist is Suzuki Masayuki....this brotha can really sing. Check them both out and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"R&B Fans Have An Angel, Though I Still Hear Cubic U. No Sakura To Be Found Here...","review":"Utada Hikaru's original album was released under \\"Cubic U\\" and for the most part, was sickining. Every track was about love, all but two or three talking about it negatively. I like love songs like are \\"Sakura\\" or \\"Hikari/Simple & Clean\\". I also like her later love songs, but a few tracks on here are disspointing. This is mainly because I'm a pop, rock, and heavy metal fan...though I also like some classical Japanese mixed in!The tracks that stand out to me:Paint it, BlackNever Let GoGive Me A ReasonApprently Hikaru didn't know Bonny and Clyde were murders when she wrote B&C...; Anyway, if you're R&B; fan, Utada Hikaru fan, than you'll like this CD! If you're a pop fan, check out Deep River and Distance."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST HAVE","review":"This is the one the debut album that went multi platinum in japan and it shows to. when you first hear this one you will definately be hooked on the hikki bandwagon. the first six tracks are my personal favorites and i would say the best on the cd as well.

I'm not sure why but her music is very catchy and the lyrics are good. The song First Love is pretty sad. If you could understand what she is saying in Japanese you would understand why I say that. The cd is a must have for anyone. Her voice is just so soothing and Japanese is a very beautiful language for music."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the best of the best","review":"You've probably heard or read that you can get it even cheaper in other sites, the fact is that you can get it cheaper, but those CD's are not Japanese Originals.Those are from Hong Kong or Taiwan, the quality is worse, and everything is done with low quality materials. If you really are a fan of Hikki or would like to listen to real good quality then buy this one. All Cd's in amazon are Japanese, that's why they are expensive.Belive me, in the end they are better. And that is the only way you would help your artist to improve his or her sellings, because China, HOng Kong, etc. don't pay copyrights to anybody.Help the artists. Buy only originals!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Her songs remind me of songs that I have heard before...","review":"Hikaru Utada cleverly and uses both English phrases and katakana words...Only a true bilingual songwriter can do this effectively. As mentioned by others, everything she did in this album has been done previously by American pop singers. Her songs, however, are easier for Japanese people who haven't been exposed to the American pops to get their hands on, compared to the songs by Misia. This album would be a good instruction to the Western music, but once you become familiar with various American songwriters, you will find that there are many others who write songs like Hikaru does."},{"rating":"2","title":"this girl is saiko kawaii and her voice is outstanding!!!!!","review":"Aloha, im from Hawaii and ever since I heard her song \\"First Love\\" i fell in love with this young girl. she is the bomb!! I would do anything to meet her in person."},{"rating":"2","title":"She will win you over","review":"All hail Japan's Queen of Pop! The writing on this debut CD is terrific. To paraphrase one journalist, this album set the Japanese music community on its ear and has irreversibly changed it. As most of you know, Hikki was born in New York City to Japanese parents who are both in the industry and grew up jetting between Japan and the States. This CD has R&B, soul and even some rap influences. I'm a hardcore rocker but I love good music no matter what category someone may put it in. Great production. Great songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Vocals","review":"I am quite impressed by Utada Hikaru. I mean, really impressed. Her voice is very mature, soulful, and it fits the atmosphere of the songs she sings. Two of my favorite songs on this track are \\"Automatic\\" and \\"First Love.\\" Automatic is somewhat of a dance track, where she cleverly mixes Japanese and English together, and it weaves into an entertaining song. First Love was Utada's \\"breakout hit.\\" It is not hard to see why. While I prefer the dance remix of this song, the lyrics are a stand alone. One the first verse, she proclaims \\"how our kiss tasted like cigarettes.\\" Her vocals are excellent and I can't wait to hear more from her in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just falling in love with this CD..","review":"This CD has one of the greatest female vocals I've ever heard (and believe me, I've heard lots of..). The music is great. Its a pop music, and many people don't expect much from pop music, but the depth and recording quality of this CD is just jaw-dropping - the sound is very clear and well worth 40 bucks! Songs are amost 100% in Japanese language, but have some English words in them, so everyone can sing along with Udata (at least these few English words :) - and this adds to entertainment listening this album! In closing, I just want to say - no matter what music preferences you have, you won't want to miss this album. And only its high price can stop you (but who cares about money, when it comes to perfect music? )"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 and a Half","review":"I saw this movie a long time ago on HBO and remembered it as being a good movie and very interesting. I took it out the other day and put it in and watched it again. I must say that it seems dated now. I would like to see them remake Barry Seals story now. Hopper is ok but he pretty much is 'Dennis Hopper' with a fake accent. The movie is still good and informative but it just seems like and early 80's movie. The characters are kind of cartoonish and the acting is kind of second rate and that takes away from the realism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Even The Whole Story","review":"Barry had more going on than the gov't ever knew about except after the fact. This story is true as far as it goes and the Federal Magistrate in Baton Rouge did allow Barry to be murdered. Dennis Hopper did a very brave thing by making this movie.

Inside of the box is decent size 12 page booklet with black and white still of the group. Now comes the totally awesome extra-5 glossy black and white pictures of the group.The DVD itself is great.

I like how they put the DVD together. They chose very appropriate songs for the different scenes. I especially like that they play \\"Tiger Tiger\\" during the opening scene when the semi trailers are traveling down the highway in the desert. \\"The Chauffeur\\" plays during the scene where the limousines transporting the band are driving down the highway in the snow and ice. It is perfect. The live concerts are spectacular! The DVD contains the best version of Careless Memories I have ever heard. I love the interviews with the band. There is nothing contrived about it. They are so genuine and highly energetic. You really get to see a side of the band that you've never seen before. I highly recommend you buy this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"serious issues with audio track","review":"The documentary itself is as appealing and entertaining as it was when I first saw it in 1984, but this DVD has a really distractingly awful sound issue. I read somewhere that it was recently remastered, and apparently it was a bad idea, because in many sections, there was a kind of white noise sound that made it incredibly difficult to hear the film. I am not one for writing negative reviews, but when the sound makes a rockumentary almost unwatchable, that's a major problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not all it could have been!","review":"I'm a huge Duran Duran fan and feel guilty at not giving the Sing Blue Silver DVD a 5-star rating, but have to say I was dissapointed when I sat down to watch it last night. First off, the Duran Duran video DVD release was so packed with extras and Easter eggs that I couldn't wait to see what SBS had to offer - and found nothing. How can they release this seminal program with no extras?? The most glaring omission is 5.1 surround sound. The program itself is still amazing and made me hugely nostalgic for 1984, but EMI missed a huge opportunity to make this great program an outstanding release. I'd rather have extra footage than see the DVD packaged in a fuzzy box that's going to wind up scratched anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fantastic","review":"This is the best documentary of a band I have seen at the time of it's release in '84 and till it's looooong overdue release on dvd, haven't seen one to beat it yet. A great documentary focusing on the US tour, how serious and dedicated the band is about what they do, and the relaxed side of the band.Russel directed a brilliant insight to this band. I would recommend this to anyone who likes music documentaries and wants a little closer look at the Fab5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duran Fan? Get this Gem!","review":"If you only ever own one piece of Duran Duran memorabilia, make it this one. This \\"rockumentary\\" was made when the group was touring at the height of its popularity- in 1984. The video catalogues the North American leg of their tour. It includes priceless concert footage and a few light moments with the band backstage and on the road.What makes this video a keeper is its balance. It shows off some of the best performances of the tour- without being too heavy on stage show. Also, it gives a fun perspective on life with the band at that time, whether they were exhausted, goofing off, or promoting the tour. It captures Duran Duran as its true 1980's fans would love to always remember them- young, energetic, and with a song list full of hits. You can't bring back the arena concerts of the 80's, but you can reminisce with Sing Blue Silver!"},{"rating":"2","title":"funny, that does'nt look like Jeanne Pruitt on the cover.","review":"I purchased this cd and the content is wonderful,and is Jeanne but that is Old Time Gospel Great Legend Dottie Rambo."},{"rating":"2","title":"To the rescue","review":"Pretty desent cd I think his first album was better than this one.

If you are an engaged parent wishing to help coach your child at home, this book is maddeningly frustrating because all the context is with the class room teacher and you are given a book that is lacking context and is full of meaningless tripe. If your child had any interest in math, this book would make sure they'd start hating it.

I've been teaching 20 years, and I believe I'd put this book at or near the bottom of all the high school math texts I've ever seen.I've gone through the IMP year 4 book. There are virtually no equations given. No sample problems solved. The series relies totally on the teacher to give this information in the classroom, or for the students to \\"discover it\\" which makes no sense. A text book is meant to be used as a resource in conjunction with classroom lessons. This book is just a long, ongoing word problem with no practice problems or any other such support for the topic.Yes, this book is way outside the box. If you want to do well on the SATs and/or ACTs, or expect your students to do anything in college that is science or math oriented (Biology, medicine, engineering, chemistry) do not use this book.

It's easily readable prose comes at the expense of brevity, and dipping into it to refresh an idea or approach means wading into a peat bog of example code and implementation specific advice.I've read only one other C++ data structures book, but I'd certainly recommend it (\\"Data Structures and Algorithms in C++\\" by Adam Drozdek) over this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did I even end up using this?","review":"The professor for my class in which I used this book didn't refer to it very much.

This book is however quite horrible. The text goes on and on and on and on! If you only needed a page or two of concise reading to get an idea, this book will make sure that you read through eight pages of unnecessary garbage to get there. Our teacher would assign the chapters as reading, and I would try staying up to 3AM the night before trying to read the very long chapters, and it is ridiculous!Our teacher even turned on it later. The book breaks rules for good coding in its examples that our teacher had to explicitly point out (and she did take off for those errors in our own programs). I think there is only supposed to be \\"one entry, one exit\\" and no breaking out of a program, and the book has other errors too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for OOP and picking up C++ quickly","review":"I think that this is a realy good book, as our class teacher in WPI promised before we started the class.

Also, look over the data structures chapter in Deitel & Deitel for code snippets for projects.

I recently took the Pharmacy Technician Certification Exam, and found that the book wasn't crucial in passing the exam. I had already taken pharmacy tech classes at a college, which helped me a lot more. I recomend buying another books that discusses specific pharmacy tech topics, unlike this one which goes through the pharmacy situations very superficially. It also has a lot of pages of practice problems, practice physician orders, and empty charts to fill in which took up a large portion of the book. In fact, out of the 400 pages in the book, about 2/3 were blank tables to fill in, practice physician orders, practice prescriptions, and references of drugs. A better use of money for preparing for this test is another book that doesn't act as a list of drugs and their uses. A book with detailed pharmacy operations, and calculations is essential for doing well on the exam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stroller!","review":"The delivery was fast and didn't take long for assembly. I have a 2 year old and a 5-month old and this stroller is great for our everyday use to the park, grocery stores and post office. The stroller fits fine in the doorways, and is easy to manuever if you have to open the door by yourself. The seats adjust independantly so it's great when one child wants to sleep and the other is wide awake! As for closing and storing, it is easy. About 4 steps to fold and it fits easily in to my car trunk. I did a lot of research for which type of stroller we wanted and I am very pleased with my purchase. I would recommend to anyone who is busy and likes convienence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than our tandem, folds up to fit in a compact car.","review":"As mentioned before, the seat belt cover falls off easily and it's difficult to open up until you use it a while. The fact that it's mostly recyclable is a real plus in our throwaway society. The pros outweigh the cons, the wheels are durable, unlike our old stroller. Don't have enough time to write a full review, let's just say I'd buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful! Don't waste your money!","review":"For the price, this stroller is definitely not worth the money. The sun hoods do not pivot, so when you face the sun, your children are in direct sunlight, and there is nothing to do to fix this. The stroller is also incredibly heavy and is very awkward to pick up. I am not a happy customer and am in the process of returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter's Danish Digs","review":"Plenty of good hard bop fare on this album and overall Dex (with Kenny Drew on piano) is playing with energy and vitallity. 'Wee-Dot', 'Stablemates' and the title track are all cookers. 'Strollin'' has a great feel and Dex stretches out on a really nice solo. On 'Antabus' Dex kicks into high gear very convincingly indeed on a minor blues. I think any jazz fan would find enough parts of 'The Apartment' highly enjoyable to make it a worthwhile purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Debut album of a major Brazilian samba star","review":"This is the first solo album (from 1986) of acoustic \\"pagode\\" samba star Zeca Pagodinho.

The Thomas track that has been in our train sets so far flips--one side train, the other side road. That is why I didn't read all the details of this ROAD track and ordered 2 sets!

Each album is unique and representative of the progression of a great band. Do not buy and album released by a sour former record label.

Not that they don't have an incredible library of music and video to share because they do. It's just hard to believe because they have always been a band that innovates rather than duplicate. After giving fans a beautiful album, 'In Rainbows', and releasing it in a creative yet lucrative manner, I figured they were above the old money-maker greatest hits nonsense.

Written from a child's perspective, it serves to remind us that there are always many more who suffer from the actions of our leaders, and continue to live the trauma of memory and the difficulties in resolving the whys and hows of experience. For anyone who would like to dismiss the subject of this book based on the German ethnicity of the author, I would suggest some research into the history of Yugoslavia and the current events of this dismantled country and think again about our perpetual need to label others according to their religion, ethnicity, language and skin color.

At the end Leeanne's father says, \\"You're not sure of anything, you're not sure of anyone,\\" and he says it to his wife, Leeanne's mother.About as close as you'll ever want to get to what the real, human cost of murder is on everyone connected with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow-moving and contrived","review":"While it's not the worst miniseries ever made, 5 Days is quit pretentious in its slow-moving shots that apparently are made to have us see this as some kind of \\"oeuvre\\" by the director.

Consequently, the viewer is moved along at a very rapid pace and left to draw their own conclusions to a number of events and fill in gaps between episodes. Given that audiences are usually much smarter than given credit for, this is not a bad thing if done creatively. Not so here. This approach quickly loses focus and sustaining mood and ultimately leaves us feeling uninvolved and without sympathy or empathy for any of the victims. They all come across as self-involved whiners - clearly not the intention and clearly not a reaction the viewer wants to have. (In the extras, the writer defends her inability to weave a cohesive story by saying that choosing five days throughout the investigation and putting the burden on the viewer to play catch-up is more challenging for her. Of course it isn't, it's merely lazy.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters are unsympathetic","review":"It was difficult to care about these characters -- even in \\"life or death\\" situations they just didn't elicit my sympathy.

It was much more grisly than the previous books. It took a long time to plow through, and the switches to journals other than Nell's in some chapters were often confusing.

I wish I had read some of the other warnings from reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I loved the previous Irene Adler books and bought them as gifts for people, so I was seriously disappointed when I read this one. I would never buy it for anyone. I am dismayed by an author and a publisher who would sell a book that is incomplete and ends with a cliffhanger. Who needs the aggravation? Furthermore, there is no pleasure in reading the book - it is tough slogging the whole way. If I wanted to put that much effort into my leisure reading, I'd get a physics textbook or something equally interesting. At least I'd be learning something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and disappointing","review":"For inveterate readers of Holmesian pastiches, this will rank fairly low on the list, and it's certainly a disappointment after the previous installments in Douglas's otherwise fine Irene Adler series. The main plot element - Holmes meets Jack the Ripper - is a tired and overdone cliche. The book moves along too slowly and is overburdened with endless descriptions of clothing and other distractions. The plot devices seem overly contrived, and settings like the wax museum and the exposition seem gratuitous. And the \\"you will buy the sequel\\" cliffhanger ending feels like a ripoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please, at least make it understandable!!!","review":"Ok, so maybe i haven't read the other novels of the Irene Adler saga, i didn't have to, this was after all, a report. A great topic and era to present this story in, and the cast of characters were unbelievably cool and rich in historical fact, but the ending was a total cliff hanger, which turns away readers like me, who are probably not going to buy the sequel, and the narritive moving from Nell to Pink is alright but the other little tid bits were weird and really confusing, not really necessary in story. I still would recomend the book if you are into these types of stories, although i don't know who would want to read a really outstandlingly wordy story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the wait","review":"Disappointing, Difficult to follow,and Forced.

Castle Noir will be out next fall to finish up the story. Fair warning: this book ends with a cliffhanger and characters in transit and danger. It is much darker than the previous Irene Adler novels. The 'noir' in the title is justified because there is a very suspenseful and almost horror like feel to the book. This certainly could be due to the subject matter (is Jack the Ripper loose in Paris?) Sherlock Holmes also appears more in this book than the previous ones. Buy and read the book if you do not mind not knowing what happens until next fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best yet in the series","review":"Yes, this is a cliffhanger & yes, it is darker than the previous Irene Alder books, but it is definately the best yet. I read it nearly straight through, then had to re-read it immediately to get all the nuances. Ms. Douglas' extensive research into the Victorian era shines. This is not an easy, quick read. It is certainly a compelling one. I can't wait for Castle Rouge to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"I really disliked this one. It rambled and was difficult to read. If you hadn't read the previous books in this series it would be completely baffling. After many hundreds of pages, it ends in the middle of the story.

I'm not falling for it.LOUSY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A cheap ploy to sell a sequel !!","review":"I have never read an Irene Adler novel and so was intriqued by the idea of a Victorian female detective. I bought this to read on a long flight. To make this short - don't waste your money. After slogging through some of the most rambling, cumbersome prose I can imagine, waiting for all the threads to be joined, the book simply ends in mid-story! This was one of the most blatent ploys I have ever seen to get you to buy another book in this series. I found this so insulting that I would not buy another one of this authors books simply as a form of protest."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book Ever!","review":"Ms. Kearsley's book is the best book I have ever read! She combines a fantastic plot with history and one of the greatest stories of all time-Arthurian Legend. Lyn Ravenshaw travles from London to Angle, Wales with her client, where she meets the interesting and confusing Elen, the \\"unbearable\\" Gareth, and a host of other characters who all add to this increadible mystery. I definently recommend this book to anyone who likes mystery and lore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read","review":"A wonderful read. I was glued to this but made myself put it down so not to finish too quickly. I am now online looking for more books by Susanna Kearsley. I hope she is a fast writer!

I talked my daughter (6 years) into picking this game thinking it would be fun for us to do together since I like the kid games better. She says it is to hard to get Cinderella to move and gave up after half hour of fumbling. So I sit down to play and beat the game in one hour ten minutes. Cinderella is very hard to move and has bad response time.You have two paths you can travel on and they put things in the way so you have to jump back and forth from one another.Then you are a mouse and you have to travel through tunnels and gears or something to finish ( This was the best part of the game )Then you have to pop bubbles.Anyway this game would probably be fun for a 3 year old IF she moved better but my 6 year old has trouble.Don't waist your money on this one.We bought magic Pegasus at the same time and this is a great game buy that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that easy","review":"The game is fun and the graphics are good but it has a lot to read so my daughter is a 5 year old and she is always asking what it says in the screen so she needs help."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but not great","review":"Entertaining story of life at a Maine resort \\"back in the day\\". Halfway through I found it getting a little tedious as each character was quite a character ! Didn't anybody even halfway normal ever come to that resort ? It was like a parade of kooks after a while.OK, kinda fun read. Nothing I'd ever read again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cozy","review":"This book is pretty cozy. I like anything that involves cooking, food or the kitchen so it seems to be all right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice insight into a time now gone.","review":"The thing I liked best about this book is its reflection of the resort experience of the 1950's and 60's, a time when New Yorkers and Bostonians would flee the city in summer to enjoy the slower pace of a Maine manorhouse. The characters who work and visit the resort of \\"The Kitchen Boy\\" may be odd, but they're realistically odd. It would have been easy for the author to exaggerate their quirks, but that did not happen. Unlike a few of the more negative reviewers of this book, I found I did care about Andy. He reminded me of so many of my own friends I knew in my high school and college days--drifting to some degree, not always making the best choices or exercising the best judgment, looking for what fun could be found in a small environment, but ultimately having experiences worth looking back at later. The author could easily have made him a major stud with the ladies, for example, but resisted the temptation, and the character is much better for that restraint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and extremely well written!","review":"As comfortable and cozy as a book on a rainy day, the story endears as it relates life along the Maine coast during the innocent days of the 1950s. An easy read, this interesting story captivates as it relates the story of a boy growing into manhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"The air smells sweet","review":"This book was a pleasure to read. It had a calm flow to it and I loved how descriptive the author was, it helped me paint the scenery in my mind while reading. I especially enjoyed the phonetic spelling of the Maine accent, which is a very special thing to hear. This was a nice break from the thrillers and crime books I often read. Like a breath of fresh air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get out yer lobster bib....","review":"I too was a former student of Mr. Phippen, (high school in Syracuse, NY)- and he was the best - as is this fun and funny book.

I'm looking forward to his next!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This was one book that I kept reading mainly because I kept waiting for something to happen, which it didn't. A series of vignettes about summer employment in Maine, I was expecting some revelation to tie it all together, but it never came. The characters were well developed and interesting for the most part, but other than revolving around Andy, the main character, the pieces seemed to have little to do with each other. Couldn't wait to be done this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat emptor!","review":"The editor, Andrew Ross, describes this book as \\"an expanded edition\\" of a special issue of the journal \\"Social Text\\". Potential readers should be warned however that it is also an expurgated edition, from which Alan Sokal's celebrated parody of recent socio-cultural jargon has been suppressed. One understands Professor Ross's chagrin at the cruel and unusual joke that Professor Sokal practised on him. However, the unadvertised deletion of Sokal's contribution is a hoax on the buyers of \\"Science Wars\\" who naturally expect to find in it the one item of the original publication that has received worldwide attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"POMO BS","review":"Andrew Ross is a charlatan.

They are as described on Amazon. They were shipped in a sturdy box directly from the manufacturer. Although they were shipped within the time frame given after the order was placed, the original shipping estimate was only 3 days after my credit card was charged and the tumblers actually arrived 10 days after my credit card was charged. The shipping charge ($5.75) was better than shipping and handling charges of some vendors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Love these cups!

I missed it back in the 80's as it didn't catch on. While they don't have the same sound as in the 60's they are more grown up and worldly. Zanzibar Sunset starts it off with an unexpected beginning and the rest of the songs continue in that tradition. If you like their albums The Ark and Of Cabbages and Kings you just may find this a good companion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Happens In This Movie.","review":"I went totally crazy over this movie when I saw the cover and I paid the full retail price. The idea of a young teanage boy having a relationship with a middle age Latina is something that makes me very interested. But, what happens in this movie is this--after wasting time for an hour, they finally get down to business. The couple make out and have sex. But, do we get to see it...? Answer. No! They do it first under a thick dirty plastic cover, which gives you only shadows. Then they do it outside the cover, and we get to see a shot of their faces as they moan. Are you kidding me?...I had exected some bold Mexican movie, like \\"Sex and Lucia,\\" where you get some real action. This, however, is whimpy, stupid, soap opera stuff. A waste of talent, money, and resources. Need I say more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"It's a good product that matches the clad pot set I have. Awesome pot also, I think they may be discontinued and I don't know why! Great handles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smile and say cheese","review":"Not being able to find a decent sturdy cheese slicer at the supermarket I thought I'd try on-line. The Anolon Cheese Slicer looked like a solid product so I ordered one. I was not disappointed. It looks good, has a comfortable rubberized grip, and the stainless steel slicer is sturdy, not bending when being dragged over a block of hard cheese. I use it primarily for slicing Tillamook cheddar and jack cheeses and it works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost completes the job","review":"Well made and does exactly as designed, almost.I use it on blocks of sharp cheddar and when you reach the end of the slice it does not finish smoothly. It tends to rip off a chunk of the edge. My other slicer glides thru and off with a nice finish.I'll next have to check the angle of the cutting edge vs the older."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for standard blocks of cheese","review":"I bought this based on previous reviews thinking that I could slice through a standard \\"baby loaf\\" block of cheese. No such luck. This is designed for those little premium cheeses that you put out at parties. I attempted to use this to slice pepper jack cheese. Not happening. Tore through the cheese instead of slicing. Took off huge chunks at the corners of the block. I figured it was the tiny bits of pepper it was getting hung up on so I tried regular old cheddar. Still took off corners in chunks. Not a good item for everyday cheese slicing for sandwiches. Does a great job on small cheeses that are only a total of about 3 inches wide."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"sturdy but dull blade makes it very difficult to actually slice cheese - it tears chunks of cheese off rather than slicing - thin slices are impossible...we're still using our very old and broken cheese slicer as it works so much better. I cannot recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"take a nap","review":"The first 10 minutes of this movie were rather amusing and after that it settled down to a real napper. Endless long face shots of Schimmer in particular looking concerned,pathetic,etc.,etc.made the film a test of one's staying power. Occasional humor and the interest generated by Paltrow and Hersey helped,but the movie was unsavable.A 25 year old with his weird mother and bunk beds,Paltrow's pathetic outfits and Hersey,s atrocious hair and truly strange behavior are just a few of the blots on this would-be landscape. Michael Rappaport and that Bitsy character trying to go over the top was also borderline offensive.As I review the film in my mind, Two stars might have been too high! Skip this one and enjoy an extra episode of Friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty good movie...","review":"The Pallbearer is an interesting story of a man (David Schwimmer) who is called out of the blue by the mother (Barbara Hershey) of a 'friend' from high school. There's one little problem. He didn't know the guy! Instead of telling the mother the truth, he lied and performed his duties with his best friends in the 'audience' laughing their butts off at him.His little lie led to two relationships. One was with the dead guy's mom, who somehow is able to lure him into a kind of sickening sexual relationship that he can seem to manipulate his way out of. The other is with his high school crush (Gwenyth Paltrow) who was less than amused that he chose to lie to the dead guy's mom.His lies end up getting twisted and he has to work out the problems they've caused.This movie also stars: Michael Vartan and Michael Rappaport."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just dreadful","review":"A bad, bad movie. Part of the problem was that whoever was responsible for the final form of the script (whether writer, director, producer, or studio) couldn't decide whether this was going to be a drama with comic overtones or vice versa. But even if this is supposed to be a sad film, it is sad without any redeeming aspects. Just a bunch of sad, unlikeable people. David Schwimmer's character is unbearably pathetic, Barbara Hershey's character is unbearable (and I have to add that I have always liked Barbara Hershey, so seeing her in this role was especially painful), Carol Kane as the mother is sad, and Schwimmer's friends are all superficial.I think the makers of the film were trying to emulate Albert Brooks, but with slight problem of not possessing his deft touch. A profoundly disappointing film. Though I must add that Gwyneth Paltrow was much better than the rest of the film. I kept feeling bad for her that she was stuck in some a poorly conceived film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stagnant humor and uninspired, heavy-handed direction","review":"This is one of those movies which simply blows away a good promise after the first half-hour...I just did not get it.

I went to her show shortly thereafter in November 2005 at the Hollywood Café and enjoyed it. She sang, played the guitar, and was accompanied by a jazz-type drummer and either an electric bass or guitar. Since I enjoyed the show I went out and purchased this album. After a couple of listens I threw it in the discard bin. The main problem is the cheesy arrangements and some horrible guest \\"singer\\" who appears on the latter half of the album. Who is this guy? No, I don't want to know. Well, maybe I do so that I can avoid him in the future. Anyway, Sylvie's vocals are fine on the album, but I just couldn't get past the arrangements. Some of them sound like a theme from an 80s sitcom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good voice but who cares ....................","review":"I really like her voice but there's no substance to the songs - they're like pointless word games.

One month later it has had to be reset because of losing time on many occasions, the battery has been changed once and now it's failed again. The Timex warranty page gives no clue as to how to contact them, except for an address to send the watch for repair, and, of course, it is now too late to return the item. For a $30 watch, the cost of sending it for repair is not worth it. The batteries cost $15 so I don't want to get another, and I think this watch is going in the trash.I am disappointed. I bought Timex because of its reputation for reliability, so I feel let down. I also wish that Amazon had a better warranty program for this kind of item, which often doesn't manifest problems until the return period has expired and it's been used for a while.

I am not the biggest rap fan in the world, but I love this stuff, and these guys do impress.They even rap backwards - double speed on the second track \\"Movie Scene\\" which is a funny tribute to hong kong cinema.Their lyrics are intertwined with a ton of references to pop culture like captain caveman.

It was back when you didn't need to be hard, self-absorbed, or constantly talking about money and women.Hip hop is not diverse enough anymore for a group like Fu to have success. If you want something clever, fast and different to listen to then buy this album.Saying that the current state of hip hop is depressing is by far an understatement. Buy this album and you'll see a side that doesn't get much expression anymore.The rhymes are interesting and fun to listen to; and you get to see the art of passing the mic mid-verse. Current hip hop 'stars' aren't skilled enough to make this work anymore.

True, Lance and Joey will probably never win Oscars, but that's true about the majority of actors. They certainly did as well as, if not beter than, most actors out there.Give me \\"On the Line\\" over \\"Vanilla Sky\\" (that's two hours or my life I'll never get back!) any day.I look forward to Lance's next movie -- and I'll admit it, I think he's hot!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously...it doesn't suck!","review":"Okay, so I was not a fan of nsync when I saw this movie, my best friend made me go. But I was pleasantly surprised. It was easy to forget that these guys live day to day in popstar-dom. Lance was very believable this sweet, bumbling guy, who kind of reminded me of Winnie the Pooh! But Joey's the one who really made the movie. He had great comic timing, and was really just hysterical. If you're one of those people who thinks we should have more movies that are just plain fun, then this is definately a good choice. I loved it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad little movie","review":"Yes, it's not Oscar material, nor is it the worst movie in the world. What it is is a charming boy meets girl, loses girl, then finds her again movie. I'm a 39-year old *NSYNC and Lance Bass fan. I'm being honest when I say that it didn't suck, but it didn't bowl me over either. Despite it's lousy box office take, I think both Lance and Joey Fatone will continue, and should continue, to work on their acting skills. I think, given plenty of time, Lance could be a great romantic leading man. He went into this project saying he wasn't an actor, and while he wasn't awful, he has long way to go. Joey does an adequate job in his role. Keep it up guys; you'll hit the mark at some point, if you really want to. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"fhfcghgfh","review":"i think it was a great love romantic movie.lance did good as kevin. kevin is the kinda guy id like. i loved the end justin and chris are soooooo funny. i didnt know there were so many cameos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really cute movie","review":"This show didn't get the exposure it deserved. I'm not saying it is Oscar materal but I was very impressed with Joey and Lance's performance. They were better actors than the other guys who are actors.

It drug on too long.In the end it was a cute show and I would watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hands down, worst movie I ever saw","review":"Wow. WOW! What a spectacular display of mediocrity. Lance Bass is by far the worst actor I have ever seen. The story line is not only stupid, but unbelievable as well. Joey Fatone's character is ridiculously horrible. Did anyone notice how, as a singer, the majority of the movie he is TERRIBLE, until the very end when he pens a poignant love song for his good friend Kevin, who until that point he had [left hanging]...I almost shed a tear.Seriously, if you want to compare this cinematic nightmare to Crossroads, with Brittney Spears, she deserves an Oscar. As an N*Sync fan, I can honestly say that I have lost so much respect for these boys. Good thing Joey redeemed himself in My Big Fat Greek Wedding. And the funniest part of the movie was at the end when Justin & Chris from N*Sync make a cameo. Don't see this movie. It is 90 minutes of your life you will never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I saw this movie and was so excited to see it and it ended up being pretty bad.

Lance Bass is a talented actor along with Joey Fatone and Emanuelle Chriqui! This is a hilarious romantic-comedy!This DVD has exilant extra footage including interviews with the cast and very funny bloopers! Kevin (Bass) is the shy guy that always messes up on the chances he gets with girls but when he meets Abby(Chriqui) he changes a little and he knows that Abby is that person he wants to be with. Now the search is on! With his friend Rod (Fatone) helping him all the way and the rest of Chicago reading his every move in the paper he does everything to find Addy! With scandles from friends and another newspaper writer apone him he soon thinks that he will never see the girl from the tain again. But hope is not lost! Another plan comes to his view to find this special girl.This is a family movie no inaproprate scenes! Its a wonderful story with a wonderful plot and cast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad!","review":"This movie was really cute. I don't think it was just made for NSYNC fans; I don't think of myself as a fan (although \\"Falling\\" is a very pretty song). I went to see it since I can't wait to see Serendipity, and they seem to have the same \\"looking for love\\" theme. I hope people don't avoid a perfectly sweet movie just because the main actors are also members of a musical group that they don't like. I won't go into detail of the plot--if you have seen the previews, you know most of the story, and you probably know how it ends. The subplot involving office politics was pretty interesting; we all know how much it sucks to have someone take credit for our ideas. Anyway, it wouldn't hurt to get together with a group of your best friends and see a movie with a happy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real time waster","review":"My parents met eachother 33 years ago on the \\"EL\\" which is the only reason I could even stand this movie which is just so syrupy and predictable.(Was there any doubt that Kevin would get the girl?)

There were two bright spots: the hilarious Jerry Stiller and the \\"behind the scenes\\" with a cameo by Justin Timberlake & Chris Kirkpatrick.one more thing: it's the \\"EL\\", not \\"L train.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"OK if there's is absolutely nothing else to do","review":"This movie wasn't the worst I've ever seen. However, it's pretty down on my list. The plot is way too predictable. There aren't any surprises. Joey Fatone made an idiot of himself in this movie by acting like a rock n' roll psycho. If you're a fan of Joey, you'll probably puke at seeing him in this. During the movie, my eyes kept wandering off the TV screen and looking around the room. There just isn't any excitement. The plot is corny. Lance meets a girl on the subway and talks to her for ten minutes at the most. Then he spends the rest of the movie looking for her. By the end of the movie they kiss as though they were in love. However, the Justin and Chris from Nsync sneak a hilarious appearance at the very end of the movie. Yeah-that's the one thing that'll make you laugh. As I said, this wasn't the worst movie ever, so that's why it's 2 stars and not 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Similar to old movie....","review":"When I first heard what \\"On the Line\\" was about, I was first reminded of an old classic movie featuring Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, and Jules Munshin called \\"On the Town\\". It is about three sailors who get one night of leave on the town in NYC. Gene Kelly's character meets a girl on the train, and the rest of the movie is spent searching for her.Sounds pretty similar, eh? Well, \\"On the Line\\" isn't too bad... it's corny, but that's what we all can expect from it. I'm not even sure if i'd call this a slumber party movie, but oh well whatever floats your boat. I'm an N Sync fan myself, and I do like Lance Bass.... but I couldn't find myself to like this movie. You should all check out \\"On the Town\\" instead...the music in that is more entertaining ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"ROTTEN!","review":"If you haven't seen this movie yet, rent it or something: I beg of you, DO NOT BUY THIS! It was the worst film I've seen in my entire life, the only saving grace was that it was hilariously horrible. It's pathetic that it was filmed in Canada to be passed off as Chicago and in one scene, one of the characters praises the \\"beautiful, fine day in Chicago\\" that they're enjoying, but curiously, there's only land and powerlines as far as the eye can see: not Chicago like at all. As a native Chicagoan, I take a little offense..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad acting","review":"The number of reviews on Amazon, for this movie, is about the exact number of people who have actually seen it. I sadly went to see it. I was about the only person in the theater and that was opening day! This movie is a huge bomb. Nobody wants to see it. I don't know anybody who has seen it. I don't even know anybody that knows this movie exists. I don't know what gave Lance and Joey the idea they had any acting abilities. I guess they figure their popularity with N'sync is enough to draw in their fans and they don't need any talent. Don't quit your day job guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Wack Film","review":"outside of Joey Fatone showing a little Acting Cred there isn't alot going on with this film.Lance Bass is the kind of actor that would be lucky to be a fill in on a Low-Budget Soap Opera let alone star in anything.the best thing for me about this film was Al Green Performing."},{"rating":"1","title":"more thought could have been put into this movie.....","review":"I was pretty thrilled when I heard Lance was going to be in a movie, and the story sounded kinda cute so the day it was released my buds and I were the first ones in the theater. When it was over I ran for the exit. The movie was slow and matched with a poor script it equals a big load a bull plop. Trust me I would not be saying this unless I meant it. I hate this movie so much I never want to see it again, when it comes to blockbuster i'm going to put a lil' post it note by the video's saying 'warning: will make you angry' On The Line had it's moments... The acting wasn't hopeless though, the guys did the best they could with the little creativity they had.Bottom line: Don't waste your time folks, even crossroads was more entertaining that this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad plot, so-so acting","review":"\\"On The Line\\" turns out to be another neer-do-well romantic comedy, such as Sarah Michelle Gellar's nauseating performance in \\"Simply Irresistable\\" and the basic brainless fluff that \\"Serendipity\\" basically was.I'll give the movie credit for some things. One, Joey Fatone and Lance Bass (from the Grammy-nominted 'N Sync band) can act reasonably well. Second is the fluffernutter happy ending that usualy accompanies such films as these. But the plot suffers from major cliches and is just a basic recycling of the long line of romantic comedies before it.An Chicago ad salesman (Bass) is shy around girls and don't know how to meet them, along with his brainless friend (Fatone). Then, he meets Miss Right, and the usual chaos happens.\\"On The Line\\" isn't that bad because Bass and Fatone can act well, for the major part of the film. But, it's predictable, brainless, and just plain corny. If \\"On The Line\\" had an original plot, it would have fared better.But it didn't. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, I highly recommend...","review":"This movie was not only a sweet romantic film, but the comedy made me laugh really hard. NSYNC fan or not, this movie was great and anyone can enjoy this. It shows what other talents Lance and Joey have besides music. The other actors, like Emmanuelle Chriqui, Dave Foley, and GQ added to the great acting. One of my favorite parts was Joey's \\"sugar dance song\\" (you'll know when you see it) and of course the end was probably the funniest. Also, the soundtrack is great. I highly recommend that you see this movie. Maybe a few parts could have been a little better, but otherwise I wouldn't change it at all. I like it the way it is. Hope you take my advice and see it soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lance and Joey [no way]!","review":"Please someone help me, [...]!! Why did joey and lance even bother!!

The visual inventiveness of the opening teenage band scene isn't quite lived up to in the rest of the film (the singer chokes when being urged to dedicate the song to the girl of his dreams - we see him sweat and literaly 'feel naked'). Nevertheless, 90 minutes of sweetnatured and agreeable diversion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice surprise","review":"Mother of two,saw the movie on Friday 10/26 with my 8 yr old daughter.What a nice surprise. Lance Bass is charming as the boy who can't get the girl, Joey and the other friends are hilarious in their attempts to date all of the girls in metro Chicago. Dialogue is witty in sections and the story line (while trivial) has a definite boost from all the sweetness. It was a pleasant 90 minutes, I am still singing the Al Green songs! Finally a movie that I can see with both my daughters! (14 & 8)I have to agree with the previous reviewer who said one of the glaring negatives is the POOR dubbing of the curse words in order to get a PG rating. It was annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Response to negative NSYNC reviewer","review":"[...]. My review is based on the trailer for this film. I am NOT an NSYNC fan, but can't wait for this movie to come out. I agree that it follows a very predictable formula...boy meets girl...boy spends movie trying to get girl. But I enjoyed the chemistry that seems to exist between the characters and the slight twists from the norm for this kind of film. The lead, Lance Bass, is not what I would characterize as a girl's dream guy, but he certainly convinced me. Anyway, I just hope that people do not pay attention to such negative reviews, as the one above. Just because someone doesn't like NSYNC, is not a good enough reason to miss what seems like such a nice film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than new !!","review":"This is a superior part to the original plastic link .

As a matter of fact, if the second disc wasn't included, this would be a rather underwhelming and ultimately disappointing purchase.

The three main characters are shoved from scene to scene like a trio of theater props, which might work if the scenes rose above the level of predictable cliche (Fag Hag Party, Crummy New York Apartment, The Agony and Ecstasy of Off Off Off Broadway, The Drug Scene, etc.) For me, this book held all the sparkle of a rather stale TV sitcom. Whatever impulse I had to laugh (there are two or three genuinely funny observations in the 400 pages)was crushed by the narrator's constant badgering pose -- FIND ME FUNNY! SEE HOW IMPISHILY CLEVER I AM! BET YOU WONDER WHY I'M NOT WRITING FOR LETTERMAN! No, actually, I didn't wonder. Not once."},{"rating":"2","title":"A silly but funny movie","review":"An outrageously silly movie, yet very funny and at times touching.

He doesn't have any immunities, so he builds himself a portible bubble and hits the road. Along the way, he runs into one crazy character and situation after another, which is where the major laughs occur. It's very similar to Pee Wee's Big Adventure. Bubble Boy is a good movie to see if you're looking for some laughs. As a bonus, most of the music in the film is great. Catchy songs galore, ranging from sentimental to pop punk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too goofy for me","review":"At first I had hopes of enjoying a good comedy but sticking with it wore me out with the over the top silliness.

I was close to turning it off several times but something always stopped me. I mean, who wants to see a movie about some poor kid that has to live in a bubble? Sounds very depressing.The movie starts off kind of slow but then begins one insanely funny scene after another. I won't bore you by previewing the scenes. I know this movie will not appeal to everyone. But if you laughed a lung out watching the bean eating scene in Blazing Saddles, then this movie is for you. Slapstick- yes! Close to offensive-yes, at times. Dumb moments- of course. There is no way to write a movie like this without them.So if you want to sit down for an hour or so of some good laughs, watch this movie. Even better, if you have friends with a sense of humor like yours, watch it together for the first time. You will have lots of fun laughing together. Enjoy.

If the occasion ever arose for the oppunity for me to hunt this monster there are several things I would do1. Drive a steak through the movie's heart(in this case represented by a vampire)2. Cut off its head3.

The only reason why critics critisized (forgive me for wrong spelling!) this film is because it wasnt a box office hit.And it was only a box office sunken ship because it wasnt released in many theaters. so it HARDLY got a chance.I saw it a theater whose room it was showing in room where its audio was messed up.

If you have read her other stories, written later in her career you can see the growth, so that alone, especially if you are a fan of her writing makes this interesting. That also is probably why some would judge this not her best. The plot varies in that the lady, a widow, Dori Robertson is in love but the guy, Gavin doesn't want to be and only realizes at the end that he does indeed care for her. I'm really not giving anything away, because this is the basic plotline of these romances; boy meets girl, they fall in love, have a falling out and reunite for a happy ending. There is also the frequently used plotline of matchmakers putting the couple together, the children as the matchmakers. Don't think this is a criticism, the books and stories are addictive and you will develop a fondness for the characters and wish the book went on for more pages, so that's another plus - a likeable Macomber book"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Matchmakers","review":"Love Debbie Macomber.

The characters were so self-indulgent and unsympathetic that it was all I could do to continue watching. And there was something about the way Tom Kalin and his editor chose to structure the story that made it a lot of work to watch. I just couldn't connect with it. It was too incoherent, too taken with itself, too pretentious, too erratic. Kalin's earlier black and white film, SWOON, was a very nice, albeit low budget take on the Leopold and Loeb story (a finely crafted experimental approach at that). This, on the other hand, felt like a shrill bucket of cold water didactically dumped on my head! Rent, don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I only rented it!","review":"In my opinion, this is a great example of a film which did NOT have to be either conceived, filmed, produced, or released. Although it may be interesting to the curious few, the lack of redeeming features is what is remembered. Like other reviewers, I can't understand why ANY of the actors, both well and little-known, would agree to perform in such a needless and depressing venture. As some reviewers have already said, the characters are underdeveloped (for that we should be glad, incidentally)so that the viewer couldn't care less about what drives them to act the way they do.Oh, for a good psychiatrist...preferably before the fateful Chinese food order!Do not waste your time and possibly your sweet nature with this gloomy glop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not Waste Your Time!!!","review":"This movie is so uneven it is hard to understand what is going on --the plot--where is it--it is all mixed up.

It slams Islam for its violent past while turning a blind eye to Old Testament violence. It condemns Mohammed for not ever performing a miracle (this is for some Muslims one of Islam's selling points), and accepts unquestioningly the miracles of Jesus. If you are looking for an overview of Islam, there are a hundred better books out there, and I am shocked that this outdated book is being reprinted in our times as a scholarly investigation of Mohammed and his religion.

When Jesus, or any prophet, was around most people did not like him.Think about it. Is a hater of Islam going to write a nice book on Islam than tell people this is a good religion? No!

It is from the early 90s but is a story that is still entertaining today. Nick Nolte and Julia Roberts play competing reporters at different newspapers in Chicago. When a major story breaks, they both compete to scoop each other, but ultimately decide to team up when it becomes clear that their lives are endangered. Julia Roberts shines in one of her first leading roles, showing us what got her to be known as America's sweetheart. Nick Nolte is also fantastic. He is a very good actor who doesn't get many good roles anymore, because of his past. It's good to see him playing a likeable character instead of making a cameo as a psychotic drunk.

Though both the Macbook and the Macbook Air have 13.3 inch display screens, they have different overall dimensions.It would be good for Amazon to work this out with Mobile Edge and make sure they differentiate on the Amazon website which one is which, and have different UPC numbers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Case for 13.3\\" Toshiba Satellite T135-S1330 Laptop","review":"I purchased this case for my Toshiba Satellite T135-S1330 TruBrite 13.3-Inch Ultrathin Laptop (Black). Its a slim case that I place in my backpack when traveling. My 13.3 inch computer is a near perfect fit, with a little room left, which is fine. Its built well. The zippers seem strong. And the extra compartment holds a few cords and my mouse. But the power cord may not fit in the pouch with a mouse.

The pocket on the side I usually use for small cables (headphones,zune connection cable, android phone cable, etc). I've had the 11.1\\" case for awhile and it's held up very good. I'm giving the case a 4/5 because as someone mentioned there is nothing to keep the zipper from scratching the computer from the inside. With that said I haven't really noticed any scratching but definitely see how its very possible. Others have mentioned using the pocket to hold their power plugs... the pocket stretches so I can see doing that however I haven't tried it as it would seem to be quite bulky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mobile-edge 13.3 inch black neoprene computer sleeve- Fine protective laptop storage in a computer backpack","review":"I bought this item recently and like it very much. I like the neoprene construction and the design very well and it seemed like good overall protection for my valuable computer investment for the small amount of money that it cost me. I also like the color of the sleeve (black). I also like the full length style of external zippered storage for my extra items very much. It even has a strong strap to grab on to while the sleeve is carried outside of my computer backpack (Swissgear/Wenger Maxxum). It seems very well constructed with high quality zippers and should last a long time in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a wrist strap","review":"The case is good notebooks sleeve. However the strap is very small and can only be used around your wrist. The strap does not have any support, so when you carry the laptop with the strap, it swings all around. Also the material inside the case, which is there to protect the zipper from scratching the laptop, is very clumsy and is difficult to pull it around the laptop.Overall, if you want this case to use as a regular sleeve with a nice front zippered pocket, then this is for you. However, if you want to use this as a carrying case, it would be better to get something which has a SHOULDER strap."},{"rating":"1","title":"No protection on the inside from the zipper","review":"This case seems like it would be great EXCEPT there is no protection on the inside from the zipper to prevent your computer from getting scratched.

I don't understand why a lot of DM fans hate this album so much. It's so damn beautiful. But then again, I really think a lot of so called DM fans just like DM because it's cool to like a cult band.SOFAD is Depeche Mode's darkest album as every person here stated before me, but it's also so full of brilliant ideas, and I loved the fact that they went way far from their hi-tech pop sound in Violator, to the rockiest side.Depeche Mode's trademarks are all over this CD, the lyrics, the strange flow of notes, the best ballad from Martin Gore (One Caress, that orchestra rocks!!!), and other things, only this time they decided to sound heavier. Flood did an impressive job on pulling this out. \\"Rush\\" is an excellent example of how good synths and drums can mix and produce an amazing feeling of power.This CD is Depeche sounding the way they should've sound at that time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened here? Are they deaf?","review":"Gotta say, this was my first DM CD back in the 90's (yes, I was a late bloomer for DM I'm afraid). However, I fell in love with the original mix and after listening to this new 'revision', the mix has suffered greatly. Honestly one of the worst 5.1 mixes I've ever heard. I love the idea of surround mixing and listening to music in surround (Queen's 'A Night at the Opera' is the best example), but right from the get go \\"I feel you\\" had to be one of the worst excuses for 5.1 mixing I've ever heard. You would think for a band that really embraced technology they would have done a better job here, but no such luck I'm afraid. I am going to see if I can return this. Shame on you DM, you really let me down here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depeche on the decline","review":"Ok Ill admit it,for me Depeche Mode are and always will be a synth pop band. For them electric guitar/organic instruments simply don't work. And imo Depeche Mode realise this as they've proven with their latest return to their synth roots with Exciter. Ive given this 2 stars as it's still DM and has some pure electronica but I simply can't & will not tolerate electric guitars on their records..It's like when Neil Young went 'techno!?!

This album is a Depeche Mode fan's worst nightmare.Hideous! This album is so bad that it does not even desereve a star. The music in this CD is nothing like Depeche Mode in terms of the unique musical quality that the band is known for.The band went astray into a musical direction that wasn't theirs.They should have left that wretched world of music to the several bands that are out there that cater to that type of music. It was obvious that the band was going through hard times in their career and personal lives that they put out this monstrosity of an album. Unfortunately this would be the last album that Depeche Mode would make with member Alan Wilder who left the group in 1995. Maybe this album is the reason why he left the group. Discard this CD. This is not normal Depeche Mode music... Songs of Faith and Devotion is hazardous to your ears and health. What a horrible album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS ALBUM DESERVES A ZERO","review":"My God!If I ever find myself needing to empty my stomach, I'll listen to this album. Absolutely horrible.

I am not too familair with the details of the band's members but I know they have gone through many hardships and substance abuse and maybe this is a culmination of all thier pain and torment packaged for our listening pleasure! Regardless, I don't know what stance or opinion this album is taking on religion probably beacuse I couldn't listen to it enough to form an understanding.I Feel You starts off okay with classic Depeche Mode but the album pretty much goes downhill from there. Slow, boring, vocal preachy songs without the usual synthesisers and beats that you find with classic Depeche Mode.Bottom Line: Blah...Non Depeche mode fans have no reason to go near this with a ten foot pole. People interested in the band should start try Violoator or 101."},{"rating":"1","title":"songs of what??","review":"This album really blows. If you liked any DM albums before this you will be disappointed. I'm a big DM fan, so don't get me wrong.

When I saw DM in concert last year I was hoping they would give some songs from this album new life, but the concert was even worse! They had no energy at all...just like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gahan's Voice is Heavenly","review":"I bought this album back in 1994 after i saw the video of \\"I feel you\\". Till that day i really wasn't very interested in Depeche Mode because they had always sounded me as one of the cheesy pop-synth bands of 80's.Songs of Faith&Devotion is really different from all of the Depeche albums. First of all, this album is more a rock album rather than a pop album. The songs are very dark, maybe reflecting the personal world of Dave Gahan during that period, because i remember he tried to commit suicide during those years.I just bought this album for a try, but it really became a classic for me. This album doesn't catch you in the first go, but after you listen to it for a several times you can't stop listening to it. I honestly give 5 stars to all the songs (music and lyrics). My personal favorites are \\"In Your Room\\", \\"Rush\\", \\"One Caress\\", and \\"walking in my shoes\\". Also I strongly recommend the single version of \\"In your room\\" if you can find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A warm blooded crossroad...","review":"A lot of bands does this kind of album, ten years on, the momentum build up and a solid fan base a lot of bands change direction in their music, 9/10 fail to keep their fan base and even more fail to keep their musical integrity. However this is most definently not the case with this album, this album got soul! (Not that their others lack of it but...) I've been to a lot of conserts but i have never seen a song that really hypnotized me as much as \\"i feel you\\" does, i'm not saying that it's the greatest song on earth but on of them. Comdemnation is the song however that really captures the soul of the band, and the best vocals ever layed down by gahan, it's ridicuelesly good! And the adrenalin of \\"rush\\", the dramatic \\"one caress\\", In your room and so on... This album is one of the few that i really would recommed everyone to feel, because this is a album with soul that you dont just hear, you feel it deep down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The next turn...","review":"Depeche Mode redefined themselves once again with this release, adopting \\"real\\" instruments, going so far as Alan Wilder's learning to play the drums. While this release doesn't pack the song for song punch as it's predecessor \\"Violator\\" did, the style makes this a more interesting album. It's this constant reinvention that has kept Depeche Mode around for nearly 20 years.As for the songs, my current favorites are \\"Condemnation\\", \\"Mercy in You\\", \\"One Caress\\", and \\"Walking in my Shoes\\". This, to me, is the third major turning point in the band (the first being after \\"Speak and Spell\\" and the second being around \\"Some Great Reward\\" and \\"Black Celebration\\"). While this album is good, their subsequent release, \\"Ultra\\", is superior in almost every way and a strong contender with \\"Violator\\" for DM's top album.I like all of DM's music and it's this varying style that makes them one of the most interesting bands of the era."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"this is one awsome cd! i really love dm's music all of it from the early 80's to now! and the more recent stuff like songs of faith.., or ultra have to be their most darkest, and basically the best they've done in their career! even with dave's drug problems in the early 90's they were still capable of making great music which shows you just what an incredable band they really are! long live DM."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPOINTMENT!","review":"This was a complete let down from their other albums, specially from \\"VIOLATOR\\" and \\"MUSIC FOR THE MASSES\\". The only songs that come close to the other albums are \\"Walking In My Shoes\\" and \\"Mercy In You\\".

The live version is a bigger DISAPOINTMENT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two awesome songs, lots not so great.","review":"A Depeche Mode fan, I like the production on this disk. Strong vocals, lots of bass, less \\"electronic\\" feel. \\"Walking in My Shoes\\" and \\"In Your Room\\" are excellent songs. Unfortunately, the rest of the disk is completely unremarkable, and no where near the quality of \\"Violator\\" or \\"Music for the Masses\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"still sounds great","review":"Songs of Faith and Devotion is a really interesting depeche mode album because there are more rock songs like I feel you to more soft intro-spective songs like I feel you.

But this is the beauty of it all, seeing a respected scholar paving the path to the truth with sound work and plenty of patience.If you like to know a bit more about the origins of many languages like English, this a good book to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best introduction to the Indo-European problem.","review":"It is nearly impossible to explain to lay people why this topic is important without them keying onto one particular sub-topic or another. This is the best book I have found to start serious people off on the topic of where we came from, and what is so apparently strange about it. (How do you relate the Hungarian exodus myth to the Mahabarata, or to Irish ancient history, for example).Mallory's book has become one of my top 10 recommended books for serious people."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unconvincing defence of an outdated model","review":"A great deal of recent archaeological evidence has muddied up the picture of the evolution of the Indo-European languages created at the end of the 19th century. This picture was inspired less by good scholarship and more by Eurocentrism and racism. Mallory rehashes old, tired arguments. A lot of the linguistic arguments are based on old, incomplete surveys. For example, on page 114 Mallory mentions that *mori (for sea) is found only in European languages. But it is a common word for a large body of water in Kashmiri. Even Kannada has a cognate.The book is replete with such errors. The PIE proponents must consider the possibility that the evolution of languages is likely to have been a very complex affair and their simplistic model is at variance with the facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, thorough introduction to a complex field.","review":"This is a good, thorough introduction to a complex and difficult subject matter. Dr. Mallory has assembled material from linguistics, archeology, and historical accounts to document the many aspects and issues in this hotly-contested area. While readers searching to fuel political programs will find little fodder here, serious students can trust both the majority of the details and the major conclusions of the author. He also follows the professional custom of summarizing major alternative interpretations when discussing issues still in dispute within the field.Undoubtedly, some will find the entire concept of Indo-European origins offensive; for them the best course might be to look elsewhere. This book is not about polemics, but about rational, careful scholarship; even if the very premise of Indo- European language were called into question, the historical and archeological detail would be fascinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-sided; a poor synthesis","review":"I wish this book really fulfilled the claim of the title! It is not as much a search as an attempt to impose an old, discounted argument. This book does not use all the new evidence from the history of science or art. And then it is full of errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased and full of errors and omissions","review":"The several single star reviews made me look at the arguments carefully. And certainly the book is full of errors and omissions. For example, on page 153 there is a doctored \`centre of gravity' diagram of the Indo-European languages. Mallory shows the spread of Indo-Aryan languages to be upto 80 degrees to make the centre of gravity fit his theory. But actually Indo-Aryan extends all the way to Assam where the longitude is 96 degrees! Neither does he discuss Bangani, the centum language from India, because that goes counter to the 19th century divide. PIE is indeed a dismal field!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasn't convinced","review":"The field of historical linguistics is in a state of crisis.

The author contradicts himeself all over the book and only a reader with a very short term memory might enjoy reading this piece of fiction. At many points his method of reasoning is hillarious. A serious reader should rather read the work of Leon Poliakov (\\"The Aryan Myth\\") to get an insight into the racial politics involved with the issue, which has made an otherwise obvious fact, a topic of furious debates over more than a century.

With a personal touch, Lela Nargi's writing puts the reader into the subject's lives and gives a tantilizing view of who cooks, why they cook, and why they cook WHAT they cook. The recipes are an added bonus, giving the reader another way to relate to the women they have just read about, and making the experience more fulfilling than just a book about women and food.The stories are delightfully varied in terms of culture, tone and food, and give some new ideas on celebrating with food.

I plan to use this in my 7th grade social studies class to demonstrate exactly how a series of events as complex and consequential as the Boxer Rebellion can be recreated so completely and utterly wrong.

I've seen it more than a few times and it always is an enjoyable experience. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the DVD release. The audio is adequate though it is only stereo. I didn't notice any particular problems with it. The video, on the other hand, is decidely inferior. It looks like it was transferred from a medium quality video tape. I have seen better looking presentations on broadcast TV. I had a tape recorded off the air that looked as good as this DVD. But the tape is gone and the DVD will at least last. The best thing that can be said about the DVD's video is that it is widescreen, but it is not anamorphic. Very disappointing.

The 4.0 audio mix sounds like it is wandering away from the correct frequency transmission much of the time. There's a scratchy presence in much of the audio, and the actors' mouths are just a bit off, as if they are dubbed. The audio does a huge disservice to the Tiomkin score. I could not watch it very long, and I love this movie. In addition, the color looks washed out and the detailing is soft. Perhaps the master was taken from a satellite broadcast.The Korean subtitles are removable but the audio and image are unforgivable. Avoid this release and wait for its official release from a producer with the rights to the original elements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"I was not aware that this movie has Korean subtitles which is very annoying. It should have been more clear about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, terrible disc","review":"We bought this because it is a fine film (inspite of the circumstance during filming). That said, this is an inferior product. On our copy, the audio was poor from the outset - the level varying thruout, often scratchy. The picture quality started at a barely medium level with abvious and annoying lines and dropouts. About halfway thru the film the DVD froze and refused to respond to any input (this does not happen with any other dvd so it is obviously this product). We had to turn the DVD player off and then on again so that the DVD would reset to the start frame so we could open the disc drawer and get rid of it. After that experience, and the other reviews here, I would have to say stay away from this vendor and it's movies. I only wish there was a way to post zero stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites.","review":"55 Days at Peking is one of my favorites.

Also, several scenes that were truncated or missing in the vhs version appear to be fully restored.

I bought it on the cheap as a used videotape because I like Kathleen Wilhoite. This talented character actress was wasted due to a nonsensical plot. I felt the screenplay must've been written over a weekend by a recent film school grad. Alas, Wilhoite has been relegated to either big roles in in terrible movies (e,g, \\"Murphy's Law\\") or too small roles in better films (e.g., \\"Lorenzo's Oil\\" and \\"The Edge\\").I wish Wilhoite would get a better agent before age diminishes opportunity (she's not yet 50)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot count to two","review":"I only received one of the two pack of seat warmers.

It is an interesting look into the differences that have always existed between the women of Northern and Southern China, as well as the growth of the role of women in Chinese society form the middle of the 19th Century to the middle of the 20th. Given the scarcity of detailed works in the West regarding the rise of Chinese women in their society, the book is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh what a party!","review":"This book is a little lighter fare for Albert Campion fans.

I love Gene Wilder and I am all for a film that will give the French Revolution a little levity. Humor can be a very memorable instructor. This film used cliches of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI that were so incredibly overdone that they were silly, corny, and dull. Those were not the only characters to suffer from that treatment. There were also silly sexual innuendos, including some of S&M.;The sad thing is that the plotline was great. It took a poor director, or direction, to pull off the whole thing so badly. It belongs to that class of films that are wannabes. It wannabe funny, entertaining, and clever. Instead it became dull and silly.

Tired of carrying a 2-lb SLR, and I replaced it with the Lite Touch for vacationing, snap shots, and pretty much all events. Good quality snap shots, typical for this type of camera w/ plastic lens. Normal pictures are good; pictures in panoramic mode are distinctly less sharp, but acceptable. Lens doors are very fragile and easily stuck if carried unprotected. In my case, the doors jammed, and I had to jam them permanently, thus exposing the front lens. Because of light weight, body is relatively thin plastic and scratch easily. Uses a single lithium battery (about $13) which isn't included. I think only Olympus makes a smaller or as small camera, but not for $30!.

It immediately jumps past the obvious stories of, say, the JFK and MLK assassinations to get into the minutiae, whereas a nice primer would help get why the post-death mysterious killings and events are so mysterious. Each chapter, if it can be called that, tends to run on way too long, and rambles a lot.

I think that compulsive liars are some of the funniest people in the world, and having Michael Keaton play one is perfect.Not too many movies have come out recently that will really make you laugh (besides dumb and dumber and a few others) but just the way people dress in this movie will make you laugh, and the acting is hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Funny Movie","review":"This is a very funny movie and very enjoyable.

Thrilled,Donald experiences South American life first hand,taking trips from Brazil to Mexico with his pals Jose Carioca and Panchito.It's one surreal,psychadelic and funny movie. I really liked it a lot,the live scenes were pretty good,and the music was swinging. Being 21,it's unbelieveable for me to like music this old,but I loved it and I'm sure you will,too. Being a Hispanic-American myself,this movie also made me see the beauty of my culture and made me proud of my roots.I recommend this for any Disney fan. These 3 amigos will have you loving them the moment you watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the movie, hate the DVD!","review":"This was one of my favorites as a kid. I was really disappointed with this DVD. You can see the film grains, especially in the live action/animated scenes. Also, I don't remember the film entirely, but it seems like they left ALOT of stuff out that was in the original movie. Its weird that they would NOT take the time to perform a restoration of some sort when transferring from VHS to DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I Missed Something","review":"Ok, maybe I missed something in this movie, but it wasn't that great for me. There were a couple of cute segments and I liked The Three Caballeros song. Otherwise, this was definitely not one of Disney's best. As a whole, the movie was boring and Donald's girl chasing was somewhat irritating. This movie has gotten such great reviews that I'm thinking there was something I missed and I need to watch it again. If you're watching it for the first time, don't expect too much. There wasn't much of a plot line, just badly tied together segments about Latin America. Again, not one of Disney's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone...","review":"I like what is presented, but I don't like how it was done.TOO MUCH NARRATION!!My 5 year old cannot follow who is talking... the actual charactor or the INVISIBLE narrator in the movie.I think it is too confusing and sexy for little kids.We owned this movie for almost 2 years and watched it only twice.It is educational about different cultures and the music is very enjoyable...so maybe a little older kids and adults can enjoy it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"not one of the better Disney animated features","review":"sexist, stereotypical nonsense involving three cartoon birds has some interesting animation but not much to raise it above the boring levels it maintains for most of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Disney's best, but one of my fav's.....","review":"Intro: Okay so I've loved this movie since I was about 6yrs, and when I was 6yrs I didn't know anything about drugs or what-not. Or think much of how much Donald chases girls, not even when I watched it again at 8yrs and then 11yrs. But now that I'm 17yrs I still love this movie I watched it 3x's in two days. Due in part to my nephew who now loves the movie. Anyways it may not be Disney's best, but I think its worth a watch what with its great song and dance scenes or just songs... Its certainly an interesting trip. Part travelogue, part acid trip,and mostly all fun. Kids will love it, I still love it and I'm 17yrs. Certainly not for everyone, but all fun none-the-less. One of my favorite Disney films still of course nothing can beat Cinderella...ahahaha Anyways *enjoy*!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe not the best movie....","review":"It might not be Disney's best movie, but I remember as a child Iwatched this movie and I really liked it.And I didn't really getthe \\"Skirt Chasing\\" as a sexual thing.For me it was just a fun movie, and I don't think kids will get the wrong impression fromit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Latin Music Fun!","review":"The insight into the two latin cultures of Brazil and Mexico are informative and entertaining. The Brazilian and Mexican style of music and dance is educational and a smart way of introducing children into the history behind these two latin cultures. Although the styles of dress are dated, the songs are fun to sing along to, especailly Panchito with his Mexican spirit, engery, and style. The three caballeros dancing and singing their way through this movie reflect a comradary among the two American continents that exists today. Mr. Disney was truly ahead of his time when he created this cartoon in the forties."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last great Disney feature film","review":"Starts out somewhat slowly with three good, but unremarkable, shorts. Then Joe Carioca shows up, and the Disney artists cut it loose. Aside from a couple of short, cheaply made exceptions, 'Baia' and 'Christmas in Mexico', the rest of this film is staggeringly inventive. Anyone who loves the 'Pink Elephants on Parade' sequence from Dumbo, needs to jump on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"holy crap Walt is a genius!","review":"This movie is simply amazing. If you like the comic stylings of donald duck and the neon/flashy, yet simplistic latin culture, then you have found something to do every friday night for the rest of your natural life! This movie screams, \\"QUE FABULOSO!!!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Classically entertaining","review":"My 73 year old mother bought this for our family because she enjoyed the Spanish themed music and dance. Apparently this was one of her favorite movies when it was first released. I have found it to be charming and educational, offering insight into Mexican and South American culture. My 9 year old found it interesting the first 2 times, but the 3 year old is addicted, watching it every day and singing all the songs. His little 3 and 4 year old buddies enjoy it too. It is definitely not the same old, and it beats the Teletubbies any day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to be what it is not","review":"I typically like House Beautiful books, but not this time.

Even if you are looking for a coffee table book of beautiful photos, which is what the editors of House Beautiful are best at publishing, this book disappoints.

I love these boots. I have back problems and can't wear a high heel. These are very comfortable and light. The only downside to them is that they scuff easily and are faux leather. I will be purchasing another pair of them this year. Keep in mind that I wore them every day (even in summer) so that may be why they got beat up so easily. Other than that, I would suggest them to anyone looking for this style of boot that doesn't have alot of money to spend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice S*** kickers","review":"I've been needing some new kickers since my daughter's dog ate my last ones (evil stare at dog) and these fit the bill nicely. I prefer a hook lace up, but these work fine. I'm going to be in the mountains this winter and wanted something that would protect my feet and provide traction, all the while looking like they kick butt. These do the job. The belt is a bit unnecessary, but an interested touch. I wear a size 7.5 and ordered that and they fit fine.The only thing I don't like are the laces. These boots are made for more of a cord type lacing instead of the shoestring type they come with. That's remedied easy enough, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken after five months.","review":"I bought these boots for my girlfriend as an anniversary gift. They fit great, but they split where the material meets the heel after five months of her owning them. I don't know if the material was cheap or if I had just a faulty pair, but if you can buy your boots elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love them","review":"They aren't the BEST quality but I think they are going to hold up just fine.... I bought them for halloween but have worn them several times since...(Have them on right now) I did put a cushion in the bottom (they don't have alot of support in the sole, but thats a cheap and easy fix) They look really cute, I get lots of compliments! I think they will be great this winter when its snowy and wet! And before I bought these I was reading the other reviews... They kept saying that the size was different then what they usually wore.... I wear 7 in most all my shoes and thats what I ordered and they fit perfectly"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY SNUG FIT!","review":"Nice boots for the price. Tend to be a bit squeaky when you walk. They also are very true to size. I wear an 8.5, which is what I ordered and there is minimal room left. The calf area is extremely snug. I have a size 12 calf and the boot is very snug! Nice boot and super snug."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously Crap","review":"Just by looking at these boots you can tell they are poorly made and made cheap! Shipped them back the next day"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit with big feet.","review":"I bought a size 9M. I usually wear size 9 in all types of shoes. When I tried these boots on, the toe box was too small and when I tried zipping up the boot, it was difficult when it came up to my calves. At the ankles the material also slouched, and looked so awkward on me, probably because it was made with a not good material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Combat Boots","review":"I purchased the boots for Halloween Costume. They arrived quickly. They do run small. Good thing I read prior reviews and ordered a size up. If you plan on wearing thick socks, you should go 1 1/2 sizes bigger otherwise need to order at least 1 size up or they will be too small.I have small calves, the boots fit perfectly. If you have big calves definitely these boots are not for you. If they were leather I would rate them 5 stars. But other than that, exactly what I paid for. They do look like real combat boots. The length is perfect. Totally satisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"looked nice, fit poorly","review":"I bought these boots cause I wanted a pair of boots to wear out in the sticks. They're not warm, too tight to wear thick socks on under, they're hard to lace. And wear on my ankles after about 3 hours. I have thicker calves, and have these laced to fit, but they're not worth the 30 I paid for them. I waited until we went camping to wear them and unfortunately that was well past the return time.... I own other Volatile shoes these are by far the most unimpressive ones I've bought"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased!","review":"I used to have a pair of the Pole Climber boots from hot topic, and loved them. Wore them straight for three whole years until the soles literally fell off of them. I've been looking for replacements since, and have either not had the money to spend frivolously, the items weren't worth the price, or just didn't like what I found. These fit everything that I wanted and more!They fit well, though they were a bit snug when I first put them on. Wore them for a day and broke them in fast; they stretched just enough to be comfortable without letting my foot slide. I was even able to wear them to work the first day I had them, and I work in retail. Stood for a good 7 hours straight with no problems!I'll definitely be buying a second pair just in case. As soon as they get more 9's in anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great boots","review":"I was looking for combat boots, and loved that these were knee high. I tried the black tartan at first, but they were in the wrong size. This was my 3rd pair before I got the right size and style, but now I wear them all the time. They're really comfortable, and I like how they look with shorts and dresses. I'm on my feet all day, and don't have to pull these off the minute I walk in the door. I could wear them every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY POOR QUALITY","review":"The boots were shipped as a gift to an out of state friend so I have not seen them.

The author never really describes how to connect the component tiers with MTS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable - too bad, too","review":"I bought this book with very high hopes and was really disappointed when I couldn't read it - literally. This book is written in quasi-english, for which the editor should be well reprimanded.

Also, the focus is split between how to set the physical architecture (how many computers, etc) and how to write general purpose business objects that in theory could be used by many unrelated departments, and split again into how what essentially is making objects suitable for automatic code generation.

The entire soundtrack clocks in at a jawdroppingly shallow 27 minutes 52 seconds.I think my experience with resonate with other buyers: I played the soundtrack once, trying to capture a bit of the spark from an enjoyable *little* movie. But what you find is that any verve came from a combination of the songs with the video. Best example: the 'Evita' moment - a spirited rendition of \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\" - is rendered flat and affectless on CD. Not seeing the audience jump up on cue, Madonna-like, in classic Evita pose succeeds in draining the fun out of the track.

Poor little doll!But still, Way to go on the design!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the??","review":"This doll is too skinny. Rosie O'Donnell is much more plump than this doll portrays, and is therefore an unrealistic doll as well as not worth the money. Avoid this doll like the plague; wait 'till Bandai makes a fat Rosie O'Donnell doll. However, the head in proportion to the body is well done on this doll; her head is QUITE large."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Me A Koosh Ball To Through At Her!","review":"This is terrible. It might have been a good idea, but if I were Rosie O'Donnell, I'd sue! This is a Barbie head on a Ken body. If you don't believe me, buy it and undress it.

I'm one of those readers that doesn't read a book if I'm not engaged right away and this book engaged me immediately.

The characters are well-developed and emotionally complicated. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that is interested in a tale that captures, shocks and provokes. The women in the Sisterhood are the women we'd all like to know. Throughout their own struggles, their triumphs bear testimony to what we do to survive and despite everything, learn and continue to love."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Slow Start, But Heart-warming End","review":"This book made me smile. My only qualm, is that it took me a while to get into it, because the beggining dragged for me. I must say though, as the book picked up, I became more in love with the characters. The plot thickened and I found myself completely engrossed. I found myself cheering for Bonnie all the way. By the time I closed the book, I was sad that the story had ended.

Read it,enjoy it and then pass it on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and heartwarming","review":"I really enjoyed this book, and since my spouse and I are heading down that adoption road ourselves, this was a very, very good read. In short it showed how a couple of people and then an entire community worked to solve a problem and likewise make a difference. During which, adversity and loss of other sorts came and went. Some folks were bitter, but not for too long. It did hit home for me when you come to think about some of the really bad parents that need to find a better place for themselves and an even better place for their children. Folks have been raising other folks children for years, its time that someone acknowledged that it is for the greater good. I would highly recommend this book for a summer reading list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!","review":"I was captured by this story. It is so warm. Makes you feel like part of the \\"family\\".

I don't think I've ever taken this long to read any book, especially not one of his. I've been reading this book for about 9 months now, and my wife keeps asking me why I'm still reading it if it's so boring - my response is that I'm \\"hoping\\" it will redeem itself.. not to mention that I'm committed to finishing it. I am about 80% done with it, and still waiting for it to grab my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save a tree","review":"It's probably unreasonable to expect a thriller to be evocative and to have believable characters who you could actually care about, but it surely is not unreasonable to expect it not to be mind-numbingly boring. I read the first 50 pages attentively and then paged through the rest in an effort to salvage my investment in this tedious book. It consists of an accretion of details without resonance and without feeling. Yet it's on the best-seller lists. I wonder why. Is it because the publisher is cynical enough to believe that anything with Tom Clancy's name on it will sell? Or is it because airport bookstores and supermarkets are blanketed with millions of copies, so these \\"Tom Clancy\\" books are guaranteed best sellers regardless of their merits? Save your money. Save a tree."},{"rating":"1","title":"clancy should be ashamed to be associated with such drivel","review":"I'm a Clancy addict. I decided to try one of the op-center series. This was it.

The overlong descriptions of the landscape, the wildlife and the sunrise plus the private thoughts of the characters tend to obscure what could be a good story if written by Clancy himself.I regret to say that advertising this book as a \\"Tom Clancy \\" book is, in my view, very misleading. One expects a tautly written action story with many twists in the plot typical of Clancy. Mr Rovin's style is far removed from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"HO HUM","review":"Book by book Clancy is slipping away from the \\"soul grabbing\\" action style of \\"The Hunt for Red October\\". Rather than being called a \\"techno thriller\\", it should be labelled a \\"red tape sleeper\\". The charactors are well designed but,we spend too much time listening to phone calls and reading E-mails. I look forward to the return of the \\"old\\" Tom Clancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, boring, long.","review":"This is one of the worst books I've read in a long time. It was a struggle to get though it.Too many characters to keep track of. None of them all that interesting. The chapters in DC were tedious, the chapters in Botswanna were enough to keep me trudging along.It was too long at 418 pages and had lousy ending.Very disappointing with Tom Clancy's name on it.

It has a real cute love story. Corey Feldman plays Bobby, a kind of loser who's grades are lousy, and his love life is no exsistant. He's actually in love with his best friends Joels girl, Laney. Laney and Bobby get's mixed up with this ecentric old couples experiment, to stay young. The old couple and Laney and Bobby do a switcher roo, and things get crazy...but this is where the movie really takes off, and get's interesting. It's worth checking out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic 80's Cheese","review":"If you are looking for a trip back to the days of the dynamic duo Corey Haim and Corey Feldman (License to Drive, Nat'l Lampoon's Last Resort), this film is for you. It is a perfect blend of high-school drama and obvious symbolism that makes this movie an 80's classic. Think \\"teenage-drama meets transcendental meditation\\" - what more could you ask for??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good feeling from good entertainment","review":"As one of the many positive 80's movies, this rates at the top because of the interesting storyline, great combination of acting, memorable soundtrack and well exicuted cinematography. It is likely to appeal to those who are romantic at heart, but also holds a place for teens learning to deal with their weird parents and the rigours of school life. I have worn out one video copy, just a shame it isn't available in PAL format anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dinger lives / An 80's gem","review":"One of my favorite films so defining of the 80's. A classic teen angst high school movie but with imagination. I think Corey Feldman & Corey Haim made a great team in this. This film makes you want to go back to the 80's. I was just going into high school at the time this release in theaters .Watching it nowadays I completely related to Corey Haims character Dinger. Dinger and Bobby are best friends Bobby falls for Lainie the hottest girl in school and has to convince her that she loves him before the night's over but here's the story in an accident Bobby switches his body with the old man next store living life thru his eyes and vice versus. The same thing with Lainie and the old man's wife. A romantic comedy with a twist. Pay attention to the characters and their bond. A great film about friendship & relationships in high school. An essential to collection for anyone who grew up in 80's cinema. I own the DVD and the soundtrack is great too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love a good mystery","review":"I read this book when it was first published. Loved it then and still do.

You were probably blasting old Metallica or Guns-n-Roses, smoking cheap cigarettes and passing around a bottle of Boone's Farm. Well there were other nights too. You were probably in the back seat of your girlfriend's car, parked in some dark hidden place. If you were lucky she had Samantha Fox on the tape deck. She'd be singing along to 'Touch Me' as you were copping a feel. Well those days are long gone, and that old girlfriend is somebody's wife now with a couple of kids. But the memories remain. Samantha Fox was queen of the hip-hop eighties. These teeny-bobber girl singers of today should take a lesson from Sam. She didn't write her own songs either, but her sexuality could be felt through the speakers. C'mon you know you couldn't walk down a record store ailse without looking at her album covers. She was great, she was the 80's. Oh I miss those days..............."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But Could Be Foxier","review":"I am a huge Sam Fox fan and when I saw this album, I was overjoyed! There are some of her less-than-stellar tracks (Just One Night, which *is* funny at the end, Hold On Tight, and in my opinion, her worst song - Spirit of America), but there are also some great Sam tunes. You get the rare radio edits of \\"Naughty Girls,\\" \\"I Wanna Have Some Fun,\\" and \\"Love House.\\" You also get the brilliant video version of \\"Another Woman (Too Many People).\\" Along with those gems comes three rare b-sides \\"Hot Lovin'\\" (from the \\"Hurt Me\\" single), \\"Giving Me A Hard Time,\\" & \\"Even In The Darkest Hours\\" (from a rare Japanese remix CD). And even more fun - there's a hidden 18th track - the Sam Fox UK Megamix. Although it's only four and a half minutes, it's very cool to have and a true rarity. Don't miss this CD if you're a Foxy fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great 80s pop/dance.... but what's with the bad edit?","review":"Any real fans of Samantha Fox will already own these songs. But for casual fans or those just looking to add some 80s hits to their music collection, prepare for disappointment. The songs are catchy, but the first time I played this disc I was caught off-guard: the most popular U.S. single, \\"Naughty Girls (Need Love Too)\\" is a poorly edited version, not one that any radio stations played. I can't figure out why they'd decide to make the edits. On top of that, I can't figure out who decided that the edits actually sound good... when I heard them, I was convinced that my CD was scratched. They were THAT noticeable.The short story: If you want \\"Naughty Girls\\", find it on another compilation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Touch Sam Fox? If you insist!","review":"When Samantha Fox went from Page 3 nude modelling to singing on pop records produced by Stock Aitken and Waterman, I think it would be fair to say that she had BIG THINGS in FRONT of her.\\"Touch Me\\" is classic 80's pop - synthesized, overtly sexual and cheesier than a ball of Edam.

This \`Greatest Hits' CD is absolutely awful and it jumps all over the place. Samantha Fox goes from Pop to Go-Go to Rock and to R&B- and she still can't get it right. Samantha can't carry a tune to save her life. Listening to this album was a waste of time. Skip this as if your life depends on it. Holla!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good 80s Reminiscence","review":"A number of the reviewers who panned this album apparentely did so because of Samantha's other activities, such as posing topless for magazines. That stuff is irrelevant to how the album sounds. Overall, the album is a good compilation of 80s dance/pop music. Solid ear candy for children of the 80s. Even if Sam's voice isn't the greatest [but I'm not the best judge - not a vocalist myself], it doesn't matter that much because the catchy melodies and grooves are what matter to this type of music. This album is bouncy; makes for good background music while you're doing stuff around the house. Worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review","review":"Samantha Fox is surely a great singer (even if she's sometimes underrated) this album shows it again.

I work outside in Colorado where I need my hands and can't really wear gloves most of the time. In the winter my hands and face get very dry, and this is the best product to moisturize them. The cold, wind, and dry conditions here are brutal on my hands. Cracked and bleeding knuckles, finger tips, and cuticles. If I use a traditional lotion from the supermarket on my hands, the alcohol makes my hands burn and sting. While the Farmers Friend is soothing and oh so good. The smell is fine also. It has eucalyptus-rosemary smell, which in my opinion, is actually quite enjoyable. If you read the product description, it says that this is their most 'intensive' treatment. This is more of an ointment that you rub onto your skin and let it slowly soak in. It definitely moisturizes you skin, but in a more deep natural way than traditional lotions.

I have tried every product on the market, even a special prescription cream that is made in Israel. None of them really worked. I bought this Burt's Hand Salve since it was so cheap and people on here give it such good reviews.I must say this product works and smells amazing! The Burt's Hand Salve doesn't really absorb that well so I put it on my hands before I go to bed.

I've used it nightly for 2 weeks now and it hasn't helped; I still have dry patches on my palms even though I've also switched handsoap.

Berry acting is flawless and we witness the greatness of Dandridge and exprience the pain of her doenfall with Halle Berry as our guide.Dorothy Dandridge is the first black woman to be nominated for an oscar, she had a daughter who was mentally retarted the dad didn't want to have anything to do with a retarted daughter. When Dorothy Dandridge go to hotels to use the bathroom she can't use the one's that are only for white's she she pee's in a cup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dandridge","review":"This movie was spectacular from a \\"made for t.v.\\" movie stand point. Halle Berry was an exceptional choice to play the role of Ms. Dandridge. All my life, I have been a fan of Dorothy dandridge and I was happy to see a film depicting her life. It was very well put together but focused little on what Dorothy was known for, her movie career. Dorothy Dandridge was the first black woman to be nominated for an Acamedy Award. She had many stellar and standout performances including \\"Porgy and Bess\\", \\"Island in the Sun\\", and \\"Carman Jones\\". I would have liked to see more of the film cover her outstanding film career. The film did however show her fight against racism in the music as well as film inmdustry. She was a one of kind woman and this film is definitely worth watching if not owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dorothy & Halle are One","review":"This makes me appreciate Dorothy Dandridge.

And, the racism she had to face from Hollywood and the hotels in those times.Right woman,Right place,Wrong time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Dorothy Dandridge","review":"I love both Dorothy Dandridge and Halle Berry.

I was completely disappointed. I was genious of them to give the consumer a 30 money back guarantee because, to my surprise, it broke after 40 days. I have wasted a hundred buck on a machine that did not work anything at all and broke after a month.

I was in the process of moving and when I finally got it out of the box and tried it out, I had misplaced the receipt. The first couple of days were great. I would use it for about a half hour to an hour a day. I normally walk but wanted something to work on more target groups. Well, after about a week, I noticed a catch in my knee. I stopped using it for a while and restarted a few weeks later. The same thing happened again and the machine began making a creaking noise. I have since discontinued using it but periodically my knee will catch now if I am doing any type of hiking over hilly terrain. I now wish I never bought the machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch - my aching knees!","review":"I have attempted to use this machine several different times and each time my knees really ache after 2-3 days of use.

It certainly does their image no good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality","review":"I have had this machine for just over a year. While I like the very low impact of it (your feet never leave the pads), I am thoroughly disgusted with the noise it makes. I have greased every single moving part of it and it makes such a high-pitched, ear-killing screech that it is now rendered unusable.It is a good workout for your thighs and rear, but I am extremely disappointed in it. I would not recommend buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!!!","review":"I bought the extended warranty- thank goodness!!! because I went through one trainer every 30 days. These machines are garbage, the people who made these machines rely on people who purchase the machine and then don't use it. I used it every day for 30 minutes and returned 3 machines. The first problem: The chain broke. Second problem: The tension adjuster snapped. Third problem: the frame cracked. I am not a heavy person either, the unit is just not made to be actually used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed...","review":"I bought my LTT about a year ago to help get rid of the baby fat I had gained from my pregnancy. I used it 6 days a week for 30 min. and also used 5 lb. free weights while using the machine. It started squeking about three months after I bought it but it wasn't too much of an annoyance with the TV on however, the chain has broken four times already and the hook that connects the chain has now broken. I only weigh 156 pounds, so I can't be the problem. My husband has fixed it everytime that it has broke but when the hook that connects the chain broke last night, my husband suggested buying something else because it is becoming time consuming and costly to fix this machine every other day (literally).<br />I would say spend your money on something else, although heavy, the gears and chain construction is not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless piece of junk","review":"My wife bought the LTT about a year ago, from the info-mercial, for waaay too much money (total was around $175). It's largely gone un-used, and even with that, it is malfunctioning and breaking. I repaired it once (got rid of metal shavings in the bearings....clearly they used the lowest quality possible), and two weeks later, it is already malfunctioning again. The movement is not smooth, the stance required is unnatural (pigeon-toed), and it only works my quads. I'm throwing this thing away, as I get a much better workout from climbing real stairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Service","review":"Stay far away from anything to do with sportrus.com!! The service is horrible. I order 3 weeks ago. My credit card was charged the day after I ordered and I was told it would be shipped the next day - 2 weeks later still no item. I contacted sportrus.com only to find out the e-mail address I was given was invalid. I finally got a valid e-mail address from Amazon only to be told that I knew it would be delayed when I purchased and that it had continued to be on back order and the Trikk would be shipped as soon as they came in stock. So this review is about the lateral thigh trainer - I never ordered a Trikk. They also told me my credit card would not be changed until the item was ready to be shipped (right - I have been getting interest on it are they going to pay it back?)

From the time I got it it was a piece of junk and it was not damaged in transit.

I placed a call to the company that sent it to inquire on a warrenty and what it was.

THERE ARE NO SUBTITLES IN FRENCH, or in any other language. Grrr.THE AUDIO SITUATION: There is either the original French, or a prepared commentary in English by Peter Cowie, who is immensely informative and interlaces his material with copious quotes from Renoir himself. There are no dubs into other languages.The thing has been visibly remastered. Dirt and scratches have been removed.The thing is, unless there's something I'm missing, there's something YOU'RE missing: the screen you see is only TV-sized: 1.33 to 1, whereas the original film was 1.37 to 1.

The broken old knight (even his orthopedic corset looks like an armor) not even achieve the last victory of de Boieldieu. He remains desperately alone and his last act of cutting the geranium (obviously for de Boieldieu burial) is one of the best in the movie.In a nutshell the DVD is definitely a must-to-buy.

The comments from the director about how WW1 was a \\"gentleman's War\\" only corroborate his lack of vision as to what war really means. WW1 was far from a gentleman's war ( can any war be truly that?) and the movie's very basis falls apart as we see the prisoners trying to escape from what appears to be very relaxed, humane prison camps. I cannot say if such nice prison camps existed in WW1, but I am sure that few prisoners would have tried to escape from them if they had, in order that they might fight again. WW1 was a nasty, ugly war, with human wave attacks from trenches, filled with mustard gas. The idea that prisoners wanted to escape as these did is preposterous.Over rated and poorly scripted---truly a disappointing fantasy.

These others, like GI, get 5-star ratings and are called classics, or at least classics of their genre. The first three are just crap and Kane, while very good, simply does not deserve the oohs and aahs and best-film-ever ranking it so often receives. But, in the field of overratedness, they all pale in comparison, and shrink to insignificance beside Renoir's contribution. It offers an overdone theme, unimaginative staging, a hackneyed script, and 4th grade-pageant acting. The combined effect is the 20th century's best answer to insomnia since Seconal. Donnez-moi une break!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"Jean Renoir's masterpiece, 'the grand illusion', is truly a film about humanity - it is a universal theme, something we can all understand and relate to. The triumph of the human spirit in the most troubled times, is kind of an ironic theme considering Hitler's imminent rise to power and the ensuing war that would alter the course of history. Nevertheless, Jean Renoir's poetic homage to brotherhood is one of his most beloved films.It is not hard to like this movie the acting and direction are superb - Jean Gabin is one of the all time great actors..Jean Renoir's innovative approach would influence countless directors to come, including Orson Welles..Criterion did a marvelous job on this dvd - also worth getting is 'the rules of the game' jean renoir's greatest satire."},{"rating":"2","title":"great classic work","review":"I don't normally watch older films, but this one is done very well.

So much devotion to GRAND ILLUSION seemed to be based on its fantastic history, but would the movie be so good? Would it be dated?Actually, it IS dated. And there's the strength. Renoir captures a time that is forever gone. No modern film could hope to capture this film's beautiful message. A message of honor and universal humanity. A film that takes time to sink in.How beautifully ironic that a Nazi officer, and then the Soviet Union, were responsible for saving this master print.

His flow is phenomenal and the insight he gives is precious even now. Standout Tracks: DUCK DOWN, RUFF RUFF(dope match up with Freddie Foxx), 13 AND GOOD(the story of a guy who sleeps with a teen that calls her father who is a gay cop will have you in stitches), POISONOUS PRODUCTS, QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, LIKE A THROTTLE, WE IN HERE, THE REAL HOLY PLACE(the deepest track on here), WHO ARE THE PIMPS? and the reggae tinged joints like SAY GAL and SEX AND VIOLENCE are gems also. Filler: NONE! Bottom Line: BDP's six album is still a classic with a message that still isnt heeded till this day.

In fact, reading this book with my husband has helped me to better understand some of the struggles he's going through as a dad and has helped to open up the lines of communication a bit more. The author includes great ideas for playtime, learning time, and discipline that we have found to be very helpful. This is a very well-rounded read and one that is used regularly as a reference guide in our home."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected","review":"I was really excited about this book..at least until I read it. Granted, I only read a few chapters then decided it wasn't worth my time, but I felt like this book didn't say much about the actual child. It was more of what the dad should be doing (like great detail on how to save up for the child's college). That's good info but I bought the book to learn about stages of my child's development and different techniques to handle these, not finances. So yes, this book is probably good for a very specific target group (let's say 9-5 job upper middle class 30+ year old father with the traditional role) but didn't apply to our equal responsibility, equal respect, young, just barely making it financially, household."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book like the plague - it makes a TERRIBLE gift!!!!","review":"This is the second book I have received as a gift by this same author. Same cute cover (that I am sure led to the gift purchase), same insanely horrible content. Who on earth wants to be given a book about raising your toddler to flip through and find a chapter on the best strategies to get through a divorce (if the author actually took his own advice in the prior book, I have to assume the divorce information is from experience).Once again, the author wrote a book focused on his own self doubts and fears, and couched it as a healthy way to raise children.This is the second book I have ever stuck in the recycling bin instead of contributing to charity after reading it. No one on earth should be punished with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book begs to be ignored","review":"I read through this book and learned more about how inadequate the author feels than about anything else. This book is full of generalization, politically correct tripe, and features a disclaimer for the anti-marriage crowd.I would prefer a book from someone who offends me and takes a position, over a book (like this one) where the author is a coward and refuses to say anything that might be considered politically incorrect.Not surprising that this author ends the book with a section on how to survive a divorce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice design, poor running quality","review":"Looks great on counter, but makes a lousy cup of coffee- carafe does not stay hot, steam builds up inside and it is prone to get moldy, and is awkward to pour......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful but poorly built.","review":"Do not buy this coffee maker.

We found the FlyBar and I bought it for him for Christmas. Generally it behaves as advertised, however there are a few minor flaws I'd like to share. The most significant is that one of the four threaded holes where screws fit to hold the cover in place was neither drilled nor threaded. We decided to live with it and hold the cover on with the remaining three screws, it being Christmas it's hard to tell a twelve year-old you need to ship his prize gift back for a new one.He started to use it for a while, on days it wasn't snowing, and a small insignificant part broke. This didn't disable the pogo-stick but this is a heavy-duty high-end product and that shouldn't happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good stick, but parts wear out very quickly","review":"Written as William's Son:Performance wise, this pogo stick works quite well, jumping to heights of about 3 - 4 feet. However, the pogo stick has some major problems:1. It makes much more noise than most people admit. It's loud.2.This is the major one. The thrusters on mine began to wear out in LESS THAN A MONTH. That's a month of 2 weeks frequent jumping and 2 weeks of unuse. THat's a problem. Another is the shock absorbers. They came out following the 2 weeks of unuse.The pogo stick worked well... until the parts started flying. Two point five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"Purchased pogo stick as a Christmas gift. Received package CLEARLY showing what item was in box. You would think company would have some Discrition in packaging around holidays. But, that is not the worst of it. The pogo stick broke within 15 days of using. What a waste of money. I write company about my unhappiness not one person replied . Talk about terrible customer service and not even caring to make it right. Again, big waste don't spend your money. You don't get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Jump That High","review":"I bought this thing so I could jump really high. I am about 165 lbs and I have it set to jump as high as it can go and it will only jump about 1 foot. There is no way you can get this thing to jump 4 foot in the air, it is not worth the money the the bar in the middle is really wide, it feels very funny riding on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BREAKS ALL THE TIME!","review":"For the most part, this is a good pogo stick. But it breaks all the time! Unless you have a lot of time to wait for flybar to send you replacement parts in the mail, and even that is only free for a year, i would suggest you get a Vertego V3. it gets more hight, and because its a spring system, and not a rubber band system, it dosen't constantly break. I would strongly advise against buying this overpriced piece of crap. DO NOT BUY THIS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken in 2 weeks","review":"This is the 2nd Flybar product I have purchased for my son. The first one was the Super Pogo II, which has a poor design, the cotter pin kept breaking, the Flybar company were very helpful,they mailed us out replacement parts very quickly and without question. But it broke again and again, so we finally threw it out. Then we purchased this one, the 800! With the thick rubber bands, surely this design would be stronger, better? No. Out of the 8 rubber bands inside, 5 broke within days of each other. My son is well within the weight limit and I just don't have confidence in the Flybar Brand anymore. Won't buy another one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but thrusters break easily","review":"My son saved his allowance and did extra work so that he could purchase this. When finally he saved enough, we ordered and he loved it immediately. It does bounce very high (but not scary high)and the ride seems smooth. He wanted me to write a very positive review the very next day so that everyone would know what a great product it was.However, within two days a thruster broke. We contacted the manufacturer who gladly replaced it with not only one thruster but TWELVE. Wow, I thought, how generous. It quickly became apparent why they sent so many out--they break very, VERY easily. At least six of ours have broken in less than a month. At this rate the life expectancy of this pogo stick is extremely limited, and we are very disappointed.This product is fun for a day, and then it starts to break. Not worth the $200."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a great product","review":"I bought a flybar 800 a few months ago and its the coolest thing ever. You can jump super high on it, and the people that work for flybar are awesome. i emailed them when my ruuber tip broke, and they responded a few hours later and sent me a new one for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference for the price!","review":"I realize the title is misleading-- \\"Step One\\", but the previous reviewer failed to notice that the same author and publisher have a book called \\"Step One: Play Beginning Bass\\" or something like that. This is \\"Step One: Play Bass SCALES.\\" This is a GREAT book, but it is specifically geared towards understanding scales, and how they relate to bass playing.

I found the words of the Philosopher of special interest. This Sutrian old-timer defines the tomato [and its concentrate] as being \\"the perfect food for the traveler, who is, himself, in an indefinite or ambiguous state--separated from the place of departure but not yet attached to the place of arrival.\\" When I read the above passage, I did a double-take. I was on a plane drinking tomato juice, which I never order at a restaurant nor drink at home!

By sharing his stories, Rips takes us with him."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Believe It's Not Fiction","review":"Rips is an entertaining writer but few words in this book ring true. A town of 5,000 people in Italy where all the old folks (and others) speak English and a foreigner who speaks no Italian gets the whole scoop and makes great friends in a few months?Truly unbelievable. The book started sounding made up with one of the first stories, about the beans--beans noted throughout Italy, by the way, as the only ones never to cause indigestion. By the end, it was total super realism. That said, Rips is an entertaining writer who should stick to fiction that's billed as such."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Stories: Disjointed, Sometimes Funny, Meandering","review":"Read the rave reviews and then read the book yourself. Pasquale's Nose is a big disappointment and not tied together well, chapter to chapter. Michael Rips flits from subject to subject, character to character without developing anything enough to make you care and there is a rich seam of stories about the residents and history of Sutri to be told here. The book is unsatisfying and unfinished and attempts to be philisophical at the end with a discussion of Adam and Eve and the question \\"Where Are You?\\". Even so, I am glad I read the book because it opened up the village of Sutri, Italy -- and surrounding area -- for my further investigation. It whetted my appetite. I'll give Paquale's Nose that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Interesting","review":"I could not get interested in this at all. Maybe 4-5 pages held my interest.

And let's face it, this book isn't going to help people who do believe that and all the other \\"don'ts\\" included in this book. While my mother had her share of issues with self-confidence and self-worth, she was aware those were her own issues and not something she wanted to teach me. She and my father raised meto be confident, independent and capable.

When I tried to power up the camera, I had a message on the LCD saying Sony Info Li Ion Batteries, followed by the camera powering down. When I tried to determine the charge status of the battery, the camera would not provide the requested info.

I liked it so much that I purchased another copy to be shipped to my brother in Florida. This story was surprisingly and refreshingly different. I would advise parents to read it before allowing their teenagers to due to the fact that there is some adult content.

It is almost like she realized her deadline was coming up, and hastily finished up what took all 9/10s of the book to build up to.So the ending was a bit disapointing in the quickness of wrapping everything up,but overall, a great read.Not for the faint of heart or closeminded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the MOST ORIGINAL book I've ever read!","review":"Can you believe this was actually on my high school reading list for honors english?

This book is not like anything you have ever read. There is never a dull moment. You think you cannot be suprised again; then the author takes you to yet another outrageous situation. I'm thinking now of the followers of the boy with fins who decide to have their fingers and toes removed over a period of time in order to be more like him. Ms. Dunn is clearly an original. Certainly she hears a different drummer, or in this case a circus barker. I had almost decided that the book perhaps is just too grotesque.

I was sort of hoping that this would be another \\"Ballad of the Sad Cafe\\" and it so wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept, poor execution","review":"I have been recommended this book for the past several years and finally got around to reading it. Like others have stated, I did not really feel connected to the characters either because they were truly evil or because they had no spines, both had no real redeeming qualities. It was a very interesting concept but I thought the execution was flawed. I think this is a love it or hate book, plain and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disturbing!","review":"This book was so disturbing! When I initially heard about this book, I was intrigued. A woman who takes drugs during her pregnancies in order to have \\"freak\\" children for their traveling carnival act. I did not know to what degree the author would go to show how twisted their family was. I wish that I could undo the reading of this book so that I didn't have the memories in my head!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful and Unique Story","review":"All I have to say is W-O-W. I saw the title of this book in Freak Like Me by Jim Rose, and picked up a copy of it to read on vacation. The first thing you must understand if you choose to read this book- it will be nothing like you have ever read. Filled with very interesting characters and subplots, this book just screams unique and is one of the bare essentials for a good collection of books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Katherine Dunn's a genius","review":"Katherine Dunn's the reason why I'm not a writer. Don't get me wrong, I wanted to be a writer. I was in a 'writer's group', and had this great idea about a short story involving a circus geek/midget, married to the fat-lady...oh, it had possibilities.Until, during my research i read 'Geek love'. And I realized my story had been done. By someone much more talented than me. By someone with a voice and imagination that left me stunned and depressed for weeks, and enamored of her talent for a lifetime.I now collect her work, and will pay top dollar for any original copies. On subject: this book is amazing off subject: katherine, please answer my calls, i only want to ask you one question."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book ever!","review":"I don't need to write 3 paragraphs to tell you this book is excellent. Buy it, read it and read it again, you will love it. Unlike any book ever written."},{"rating":"1","title":"An oppressive reading experience","review":"I found this book oppressive -- there were times when I couldn't bring myself to pick it up, yet I couldn't abandon it. I have had this book for over 10 years and am not sure why I decided to read it now. I am so disappointed. It is not well-organized, the narrative bounces around too much, ALL of the characters are horrible and completely unlikeable. I have a feeling that it will be one of the books I always remember, so I cannot completely deny its power, but I do not think it deserves the praise it has gotten. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Once the reader gets past the initial shock value BEHIND the story, the novel is predictable and drags... if you cast Cheng and Eng, JoJo the Dog-Faced Boy, and \\"The Enigma\\" in a VC Andrews novel, you'd end up with this drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Turnaround and the quality (and price!) of this offering on a used book was perfect in every way. Kudos to the vendor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not sure about this one...","review":"I'm just not sure what I thought about this book. I just finished it and am left feeling kind of numb, I guess. Was there really a story to this book? Apart from following the Binewski's life, there was really only the Miranda plot, and it was quite sidelined, I thought. I must say, the characters were very interesting, and the absurdity and strangeness of it all kept me reading. I think that what makes this book worthwhile is the relationships between the family members. It was very complex that way, but on the whole, I have to say I have read better books, but certainly this one stands apart from the rest -- it is definately unlike anything I'm likely ever to read again. Not a waste of time, but it didn't amaze me, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't get it","review":"I read this book for book club and I am one of the few disenters here. A long, involved story with such fast, unsatisfying ending. It was a quick conclusion that left many questions unanswered. Without giving away the ending, can anyone tell me why Ellie did what she did at the end? I cannot find the reason. It's loose ends like this that frustrated me. I also really didn't care for the main characters. I could only sympathize with Oly for so long, I didn't care for Miranda - I only really liked Chick and I felt pretty much only the twins were especailly intrigueing. A lot of reading with little satisfaction for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"liberation in being loathsome","review":"A wild and wicked satire. Its inspired lunacy shines from the moment we meet the parents who decide to breed their own freak show, starring children conceived to be \\"defective\\" by design.Author Dunn was ahead of her time with this spin on a genetically engineered master race--it is only recently that all couples could avail themselves of genetic technology in the pursuit of perfect babies.Then, paradoxically (as was the case in Tod Browning's film \\"Freaks,\\") we see how decency abides in the deformed while so many of the \\"normal\\" characters are invisibly stunted or warped.I generally avoid fiction like the plague (altho I enjoy Francine Prose, Ayn Rand, E.L. Doctorow and Judith Rossner). If you read and loved Jerzy Kosinski's \\"The Painted Bird,\\" (YOU MUST READ IT) or Nabokov's \\"Lolita,\\" you will pick up on Dunn's sensibility.GEEK LOVE the best novel I have read in the past 20 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Without a doubt one of the BEST books I've read!","review":"This book is so full of life! Dunn creates this entire world, complete with idioms, that envelopes you immediately. I love, love, love this book! I've made everyone I know read it. If you can read one book for a time, make it this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transgressiveness without any depth.","review":"I read somewhere that critics called this \\"a collaboration between John Irving and David Lynch,\\" but frankly, it doesn't have the depth of neither one of them. Transgressiveness is not bad if it provides some insight in to human nature but I had difficulty seeing what that was in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to love it but just couldn't get into it","review":"So many told me to keep reading, that I would end up LOVING Geek Love. But I didn't. After a month of literally trudging through this book, I had to toss it aside. And I HATE not finishing a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So close, and yet . . .","review":"This is a very overwrought book, full of danger, deformity, deep secrets, and outright sibling war. Something strange, frightening, or disgusting happens to someone in every chapter - almost on every page - but the effect is unexpectedly flat. I was left with the feeling this book hadn't earned the emotional reaction it was trying for.I woul suggest _The Wasp Factory_ by Iain M. Banks instead. Using a smaller canvas, he paints a sharper picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"unique","review":"i was infatuated with the entire concept of this book and thoroughly enjoyed it and have recommended it to many of my friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unforgettable Novel","review":"I'm a horror reader and heard so much about this book via a horror discussion list I belong to. This will have to be one of the best books I've ever read. I recommend it to people who want to be introduced into the genre. It's haunting, tragic, horrific, beautiful. I couldn't put it down. I cried at the end - I couldn't help myself. A poetic ending and the exact way I wanted to story to conclude.I now look at what we term \\"beautiful\\" in a different light and that sometimes being beautiful on the outside can be a disadvantage.I will never forget this tale - ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Anna Karenina!","review":"Tolstoy's classic is famous for its opening sentence about all unhappy families being different, and all happy ones being alike. Had Tolstoy still been around to read Geek Love, I'm not sure he would have felt that way. At its heart this is a simple story of a totally dysfunctional family -- our narrator, Olympia (a hunchbacked albino dwarf) spends much of the book musing on how relatively uninteresting she is, compared with her much more impressively carnivalistic family. Along the way Dunn deals with sibling rivalry, sexual violence, animal rights (including about the creepiest nurse/doctor character in all of literature), and -- best of all -- religious cultism. It's not a book for everyone; there are a handful of terribly ghastly moments in it. But overall, it's strongly written, incredibly poignant, and often hilarious. If I could take ten books onto a desert island, this would be one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Unique and Interesting!","review":"This book is totally different than any other book that I have ever read. It gives you a glimpse inside a very dysfunctional family that owns ad works with a travelling carnival. The character development is great. If you think your family is weird... you should read about this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interseting Yet Very Twisted","review":"This book was really interesting. Although it was twisted and at times almost disgustingly horrifiying, I really enjoyed the book. It had a good view point on how people judge and percieve others. I thought it was fasinatingly gross. Check out this book. It was very neat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dunn before, Dunn better","review":"It's pretty easy to see what Katherine Dunn is trying to do here, but unfortunately she doesn't make it. Any one of the themes \\"explored\\" in this wannabe shocker can be better appreciated in other sources -- for example, John Irving's _The World According to Garp_ , or any of the early John Waters films. Both Irving and Waters treat their subject matter with a sensitivity and compassion than seems greatly lacking in _Geek Love_, with the result that this novel ends up affecting your stomach more than your heart. The only thing that kept me from giving it just one star is the occasional witticism from Arturo, who uses scatalogical and anatomical epithets in a clever way. Otherwise, it's just pornography, which I guess is okay if that's what you're looking for -- though I prefer my porn straight, without the pseudo-philosophical trappings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting. Gross","review":"No. I didn't even get past page 25. It sicked me out that much -- and this from a person who this doesn't often happen to, in any situation. My experience with this book was over three years ago, and those 25 pages haunt me still. Too gross for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Bad Taste","review":"I had to read this book for an English Lit course and I really had a very hard time finishing it. I must be pretty abnormal since most reviews were good. I found the content very disturbing. For someone's mind to come up with such horrific actions which I feel are immoral as well as sick must have a twisted outlook on life. I really couldn't see the author's point. The ending was a pretty common ending to murder, incest and drug taking. There are so many wonderful literary books out there, I can't understand why a Professor would recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick and Twisted","review":"I should have read why some of the reviewers rated this book a one before I read it. This book just did not do it for me. I could not get past the sick mind of Arturo and cult-like following of his family and other characters in the book. A Great Disappointment!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am crushed.","review":"I've only read ten pages of this book, & I won't read anymore.I understand that it is fiction & humor. But oh! How I wish Katherine Dunn had created some fake disorders to go along with her fake science, instead of revealing her ignorance about real ones.\\"I was mad at Maribelle. She was a pinhead who'd been with your mother and me for a long while. She was trying to hold me up for a raise I couldn't afford.\\"Wow. Does she even know what a \\"pinhead\\" (microcephile) is?If you have any real interest in or prior knowledge of circus freaks, sideshows or \\"human oddities,\\" & aren't one of those humans who find the victims of physical abnormalities \\"repulsive\\" or \\"horrifying,\\" you will immediately be disappointed by this book.I know I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"95% fantastic","review":"I loved just about everything about this book until the end.It had a very 'deux es machina' feel to it.

I read it years ago and continue to look for copies in the used book store as I pass it along to those that I meet that have the same sick puppy hidden shadow as I - heh heh. Be careful who you share your love for this outrageous story as they may hold it against you. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed in Geek Love. I read it based on a recommendation in an article from Time magazine. It was very hard for me to even finish-halfway through it I almost put it down. If I had gotten it from the library, rather than purchasing it, I would have tossed it aside quickly. The author went way overboard trying to shock the reader. It was not even realistic. The reviews for this work definitely misled me."},{"rating":"1","title":"You either love it or hate it. I HATED this book","review":"I couldn't figure out the point. It grossed me out. It's morbid. I slogged through it because it came highly recommended. I had to force myself to finish this book. If you are interested in freaks, read Angela Carter. I could at least see the point in her books. I hated Geek Love. I kept asking myself Why?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated Hidden Genius!","review":"In the highly saturated realm of fiction, this book is a refreshing and welcome change from cliche storylines. With her satirically presented view of \\"family values\\" and the deeper resentments of sibling and parent/child relations, Ms. Dunn has singlehandedly addressed the taboo of dysfunction from the perspective of those already looked upon as freaks. Even in the occasional slower parts of the book, the anticipation of \\"what could possibly happen next?\\" holds you to turning the pages. Try it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Terrific single-source for boat-towing information","review":"Steve writes in a clear, hands-on style. He combines the thoughtfullness of someone who has thought a lot about the topic with the practicality of someone who has done many, if not all of the things he writes about. Here is someone who has towed a great number of boats with a number of tow vehicles and and write well on the subject. This is a great book for someone who really wants to know what's up with trailering boats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Throwaway Daughter","review":"Grace Dong-Mei Parker was adopted from a Chinese orphanage by Canadian parents, and despite their well-meaning efforts, she's adamantly opposed to having anything to do with her Chinese heritage. The sense of identity that language lessons and lunches in Chinatown never accomplish, happens dramatically when she witnesses a news broadcast of the Tiananmen Square massacre, and results in her return to China at the age of twenty to try to track down her birth parents. The circumstances of her birth and abandoment comes out gradually, from several points of view.Despite being nominated for the American Library Association's Best Books for Young Adults, this reads like adult fiction to me, especially with the complexity of the narrative (multiple points of view and timeshifts--but it's not as confusing as it sounds). Adjectives include lyrical, bittersweet and Canadian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written for the layperson and the enthusiast alike.","review":"The author jumps around and changes subjects too much. He starts an explanation, then stops halfway through and says he's saving it for the next chapter. His analogies are absolutely terrible. He is pushing a theoretical agenda, so don't read this book if you're looking for just a simple, straightforward explanation of string theory. I understood most of what he had to say only because I had previous knowledge of string theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly speculative","review":"As far as we know, there is still only one universe that we can observe by our instruments. What is the evidence for the supposedly 10^500 other universes that we cannot observe? Hint: they are unobservable.The landscape problem was a by-product of the Super String Theory that was unable to make consistent predictions about our universe. Perhaps it is not so super after all. Susskind should delay publications claiming unobservable worlds until there are evidence of just observing one other universe that is not of our own. If there are indeed 10^500 worlds around, that should not be so difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I picked up this book after reading Michio Kaku's Parallel Worlds. This book was a disappointing read compared to the before mentioned book - which is a clear and engaging read. The cosmic landscape jumps around a lot (especially in the beginning) and it simply isn't as readable as the before mentioned book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"This book is so poorly written and illustrated that I had difficulty not just giving up. Apparently it was never seen by an editor. The text is rambling and not clear. The illustrations are mostly so simple as to not convey any information.

One of the discs' features is to watch ORIGINAL versions of each video and 'ALTERNATE' versions. How does a 'Toxic' video sound with Britney wearing nothing but the diamonds the entire video? Or her 'My Prerogative' video where the whole thing is the video playing in the original version where Britney rolls around on a bed? Also, there will be special cameos by people that were originally cut from the videos. And, there will be an 'Outrageous' video, even though it was never completed.

Of course Madonna was the best suited person to be on a CD with Spears since neither can sing a lick. I notice that most reviews here get very sexual in their writings. It's simply that Spears made that cleap slut category all her own. It's time to retire her G-string and take it where it belongs.

Yet I began to read and within the first pages, I was hooked. I couldn't put the book down! ine night I even read fifty pages, and I didn't have to. In the beginning of the story, a mysterious person, refered to as U.N. Owen, sends ten peoplenotes saying they should take an opporunity to visit Indian Island. The charactors agree, thinking U.N. Owen is a distant friend. From the point the people arriveat Indian Island everything turns into hell. All ten people die, and it is a musteru to find out who it is. They all die in their own mysterious ways according to a poem posted above all of the inmates beds. Agatha Christie kept me guessing every second who the murderer was.

I, for one, DO NOT, and only read it as a requirement for school. The only thing I can say I liked about it is the ending and the explanation of how these things came to pass.

I HATE BAD ENDINGS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not All of That","review":"I'm not sure why this book is so highly rated but I'm mad I wasted my time reading it. It was written well.

However, after reading AND THEN THERE WERE NONE, I wish that there actually were none, of her novels that is. The book starts off with ten people receiving invitations from an unknown man to visit and isolated, uninhabited island. The book gives a brief discription of the characters then they arrive at Indian Island. The ten then start hearing voices telling of killings that they were never found guilty of. Then they start being killed off one by one. No one knows who the murderer is, but as the novel wears on it is predictable as to who the murderer is. The book never really caught my attention too much and I found it easy to put the book down and talk bad about Agatha. I did like the underline meaning of the book though, which is how mans guilt can eventually wear him down. I just wish Agatha would have made the content more invigorating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MASTERPIECE OF MYSTERY STORYTELLING","review":"Agatha Christie is the master of the mystery novel. Period. There is no question in my mind that she is the epitome of what mystery storytelling is about.'And Then There Were None' is, I believe, her all time greatest novel. Though with well over 70 novels in print, it is hard to read them all. I love the way her charectors develope in this novel, in the short time they inhabit Indian Island.The premis is simple.

If you read this too, you would think the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tight One","review":"This is one of my favorite mystery books. It is so tightly plotted it fairly hums. There are no gaps in the logic. What is unusual is that you know after the first fifty pages or so exactly what is going to happen, yet the book cannot be put down. The characters are well developed and Dame Christie put a lot of thought into constructing a tight novel. In the long run that is what sets this book apart. This could be used as a role model ( and probably has been) for the logical construction and plotting of mystery books"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Our community theatre group will be performing the play based on this book soon, so I decided to download it to my Kindle and read it ahead of time.

It took a little while(Maybe 3 chapters) to really get involved in the book. Ten strangers are invited to the island by a mysterious host (later found out that the host is one among the ten). Then, randomly, People get killed off, one by one. The real fun in the book is trying to guess who the mysterious murderer is. You'll have such a surprise at the end!

This was the first Christie that I had ever read, and I absolutly LOVED it!! Keep in mind, though, Christie is a master at writing, and you really have to pay attention to what's going on or you could easily get lost...or miss a clue! As soon as I got done reading it , I told my mom that she just had to read it also. She gave it a try, but she gave up after the first few pages because she thought it was confusing. She missed out on one of the best mysteries ever because she gave up. PLEASE DON'T GIVE UP! It will all start to make sense! I read this book in 2 days because I couldn't put it down.

First they find a morbid poem about ten Indians who die one by one in specific ways, and then people start dying under the same circumstances as the Indians in the poem.I was a little afraid when I started reading this book that I would have to remember every detail of the characters being presented, but that wasn't necessary. It was a quick read and fast paced, and I never guessed who the killer was in the end. It was also complicated, but not so much that I didn't understand what was going on.

And this is her best book. I have read and reread it and have yet to find a flaw. Originally published as Ten Little Indians for reasons which will become apparent as you read it, this little gem should be read by all who aspire to write novels. The characters, the landscape, the background, the build up of action, the fantastic action -- all leave me breathless as well as enthrauled with the perfect narrative tone and control exhibited in this masterpiece. If you haven't read it yet, you are in for a treat. It is way better than the movie, the play, or any of her other works including The Seven Dials Mystery, Three Blind Mice, Witness for the Prosecution and Murder on the Orient Express."},{"rating":"2","title":"And Then There Were None","review":"This has to be my favorite Agatha Christie book of all time.

Soon, they find to their horror that their host has filled the house with booby-traps that use a trait of each guest to kill him or her.

It may leave you limp at the end, but it's great fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery's Most Famous","review":"When I read this book, it was the first mystery I'd ever read, but the book was so good that I began to read more mystery. After becoming the mystery connoisseur, I determined that this was by far the best Agatha Christie novel and best mystery novel in general. This book is a real page turner because the reader has no idea who the killer is until the last page (even further then that actually; you don't find out until the epilogue)! This book has even gone down in history crowning the phrase \\"and then there were none.\\" So, in conclusion, I believe that this book is a must read for a first time mystery reader or a life-long mystery lover!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Definate Page Turner!!!!!!!","review":"This book by far was one of the best Mystery books I've ever read! It will always be one of my favorites. The way Christie brings the characters to life and how she enthralls you in her words keeps you wanting more. This twisted and spell bounding book will leave you breathless and captivates you from the moment you pick it up, I couldn't put it down! You know it is a good book when you find yourself yelling \\"IT'S HIM! I KNOW IT IS! DON'T TRUST HIM!\\" This book becomes real because of the power in Christies writing. I could read this book a million times and still wonder what's going to happen next.

One by one they begin getting murdered and the point of the book is trying to figure out who the killer is.

I'm a sucker for a group of people stranded somewhere (House, island, wherever) when suddenly a murder occurs.Christie gives some brilliant and insightful background information to her shady suspects and unravels the story as carefully as a ball of yarn.A fantastic read that gets better every time I pick it up. Highly HIGHLY reccommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still shocked....","review":"This is the best book written by Christie.

A governess watching a child die, etc. By when suddenly one of them die, and others, and each of their death's being described in a poem before hand, things start to heat up.I loved this book, and I think you would too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten Little What?","review":"If you think you know this story by the Queen of Crime because you saw the movie, think again.There's no Poirot, no Miss Marple, but this is a good read, and not, I think, typical of Dame Agatha. I suspect that she appears in this book disguised as the judge. It's an inside out version of Murder on the Orient Express. The changes to the plot and characters made for the movie version suggest that however \\"conventional\\" the English murder mystery may have been, it was never as conventional as Hollywood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book EVER!","review":"I dare someone to name a better book! This book is absolutly amazing. It starts out with 10 people all being invited to the same island. As you read through the book you realize the host told them lies in order to get them out there. They soon thereafter begin to be murdered one by one. This book has an unguessable ending and will knock you off your feet when you read it! I wish that I could give it more stars. And believe me, you might be thinking at this moment that you are smart enough to guess. Well, that is what I thought! I is almost impossible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MASTERPIECE!!!!!","review":"This is by far Agatha Christie's best book. I read it in just over 2 hours, and I'm only 13.

Among Christie's books I prefer the elegant solution of Murder on the Orient Express, but the atmosphere and suspense of this book are greater - people being picked off one by one on a remote island was a great conceit and as you read you will yourself to read faster.A great place for a novice mystery reader to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"And Then Were None by Agata Christie - I love it. One of the best book written by A. Christie. Will read again:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The mystery book no one will ever write as good again!","review":"There was a time when I loved to read Agatha Chistie. In those times her books meant everything to me, and I almost didn't read another author. In one year, I read 67 of her books. And believe me, among these 67, AN THEN THERE WERE NONE is the best one.The plot is one of those you don't find anymore on detective books. Ten people that don't know each other hide something terrible of their past. They are invited to spend sometime at a man's house - a man that no one know. And suddenly, one by one, they are murdered in a very suspicious sometimes, sometimes terrible and bloody way. Most of all, the ending is one of the best I've ever read. Agatha Christie was really a wonderful writer. Her books will certainly remain forever, since she is the Shakespeare of detective fiction. And this book is for sure her best work. If you haven't read that one yet and you enjoy Agatha's books, hurry up and take that one!Marco Aurelio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Kindle transcription","review":"The publisher did a terrible job transferring this book to Kindle.

In fact, it's the only book of hers that I actually like. I don't normally care for her stories with Ms. Marple or the Inspector Poirot.

Once I started reading this I seriously couldn't put it put back down."},{"rating":"2","title":"And Then There Were None","review":"Over the summer, I was required to read one of three books. I chose And Then There Were None since it grabbed my attention. The story kept me reading, and I often found myself reading it for hours at a time. Agatha Christie made this book seem real, like I was in the story. The beginning was a little slow, but after the first few chapters were through, the plot came alive. Ten mysterious murderers were brought to Indian Island by a mysterious host. Then, all of them die, one by one. Be sure to read the epilogue so you can find out who the killer is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN!!!!!","review":"I could not put this book down! It was scary and very suspenseful.

Roleplays, placing oursleves inside the minds of the characters and how we feel they would react to the situations given to them helps you to understand the book more. I found myself captured by this book and its unexpected plot twists and the delightfully refreashing discord the characters had been placed in, as well as the colorful backrounds and the constant air of suspence and suspicion on each page. To put it in a simple phrase, this book is just astounding."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!","review":"I hate reading books. Almost all of them. But when I read this one i started liking them. The story is almost all climax and only boring in the beginning. I think this is her best mystery of all. DON'T BELIEVE ANY OF THE BAD REVIEWS!

It showed how fear and confusion and alot of other emotions effect people. It is probably one of the worst book I have read and did not enjoy it. I really don't recommend this book to anyone. I think that you will waste your time with this book. It is a mystery that repeats itself, it doesn't keep you interested. I give it a one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Bizarre, & Bologne","review":"I think that this book is very stupid. It has no story to it and I think it is boring.

The denouement is truly spectacular! Buy this book; you will NOT be disappointed. Agatha Christie's plotting skills approach the genius level. By the way, if you want to experience a highly unusual tale from the mind of Dame Christie, check out the killer in Endless Night, a superb 5-star psychological murder mystery. Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book I LOVED it!!!","review":"I just loved this book I don\`t really like books that talk about death but this one I liked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Agatha Christie","review":"A cracking good Agatha Christie murder mystery with no detective (until the very end). Written in 1939 and set in that time, it omits the modern crime-solving techniques and even things like cell phones. It doesn't take long for the reader to be swept up in the situation at hand, however, and to try to guess the identity of the murderer, until he or she is murdered. The end seems a bit contrived, but plausible. A good book for a discussion group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Page Thriller.","review":"It is usually for a person if he repeat reading any book will feel boring, but, i have read And Then There Were None for almost 5 times now, and planing maybe to read it again.There is something \\"unknown\\" exsist inside the pages and between the letters, everytime i read it i discover something new in the guests personality,and i feel anyway that i am reading it for the first time. I have it in both languages, English and Arabic, and also the Arabic copy was translated by a Doctor of the Arabic literature, so it was something fabulous to read in Arabic, too.You can't guess who is the killer, even if you guessed, your guessing will die with the person in his turn,so you have to guess again, and again the death will be faster than you, and so it is.In the end, you wont the believe that killer was:..., well discover it by yourself, it is worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent--but so is the play!","review":"I certainly agree with all these fanatical reviews. But I feel I must defend the play. Yes, it's simpler, and more innocent, but it's not a cop-out. The reviewer of Jan. 11, 1999 should note that Lombard and Vera are NOT murderers in the play--they both wind up being innocent of their charges, so it is not a matter of two murderers getting married.Having said that, the book is certainly wonderful, extremely detailed and of course suspenseful."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!!!!!!","review":"This has to be my favorite book!

Agatha Christie is the Queen of Mystery!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And Then Then There Were None","review":"This book was a great book. The book was confusing in an interesting way. What I mean by that is the book gets you excited and if you're really into it you might get a little scared. The book is about ten people that go to Indian Island. They are Emily Brent (a proper person), Vera Claythorne (a young woman), Justice Wargrave (a judge), Tony Martson (an alcholic), Philip Lombard (a detective), Mr. Rogers (a butler), Mrs. Rogers (a maid), General McArthur (a general), and Dr. Armstrong (a doctor). There is a murderer killing people, and each time that happens a glass indian figure disapears. You will be surprised who the murderer is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Agathas Best","review":"And Then There Were None was a book that had little interest to me. I love mysteries and trying to solve them along the way, but with this book I soon lost my interest. I have been an Agatha Christie fan for two years now and have to say that I was completely disappointed by the way which this book was written. Not only were there to many characters, but there was also very little description. Which is so unlike Agatha to do. I will continue to be an Agatha fan, but hopefully the next book, which I read will hold my attention a little more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it was cheesy","review":"This book was probably a big hit in its day but it seems pretty cheesy. My son needed to read it for his 8th grade English class. There are much better books out there. I am not quite sure why they picked this book. The word \\"queer\\" is used quite often which would give these students a very low grade (if they were writing a paper) for repeating the same word not to mention it made them laugh every time they read the word. At first, it is hard to keep track of who each character is. It didn't hold my interest. Many people enjoy this type of writing, but based on this book, I would not read another one of her books. I understand it had a original title different from this. I didn't appreciate that and maybe it was acceptable during its time but it doesn't sit well with me. Google it if you want to learn more. Instead of ten little soldiers it was ten little Indians which was changed from ten little (not a word I would repeat)."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a best story!","review":"i am the fan of agatha christie and sir arthur conan doyle. ihave read almost all the story written by agatha christie and yet this is my favorite of her book ever!i highly recommend for the first reader of agatha christie's and you won't regret that i can assure you...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"Wow!

No kidding."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the all-time greats","review":"While I loved the movie, I was not prepared for the difference in the endings between the book and the movie.

A true old-fashioned thriller and if you love Christie, this is her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edge of My Seat!","review":"I just received my Kindle for Christmas, and was sent on a mystery-reading frenzy sparked by the recent Sherlock Holmes movie. I started with the Holmes stories, and have made my way to Agatha Christie, whose books I have never read. The first I downloaded was And Then There Was None. I started reading it late last night and immediately continued this morning. Since my husband was out running errands, I found myself in the house alone right when the book was reaching its climax. I was so scared that every little noise in the house made me jump. I was quite literally on the edge of my seat! I have to say that it's probably the first time that a book has made me react in such a way. I cannot wait to read more, and will hopefully be diving into the Miss Marple series next. So, in short, this was a great afternoon read for any mystery lover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic 1O past muderors killed on Indian Island.

A systematic elimination of each of them takes place done in step with the \\"Ten little Indians song\\" by a mad killer. Is the killer on the island or is it one of the ten in the house?The story reads fast and the book is a page burner. I read the 194 page book in one day.

The girls love it -- they play it alone, together, with friends. We use it indoors exclusively (when we're outside we make our own the \\"old-fashioned way\\" with chalk), and it's great for helping burn off energy during long rainy spells or the winter, when we can't always get outside. I am a little annoyed that the tiles are only configurable one way, but all similar items I've seen are the same -- it's a function of the puzzle-edge design.

The story was choppy, incomplete and unbelievable (even for a movie about witches and warlocks!).

It didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stewart's only dud!","review":"This was a really bad movie. Jimmy Stewart made many great, classic films, but this wasn't one of them. He and Jack Lemon and the other cast members gave nice performances, but even their considerable talents couldn't uplift this movie. The movie gives you no reason to suspend your disbelief over the plot. Likewise, it gives you no reason to like or even care about most of the characters. You don't dislike them so much as you just don't care. The end of the movie is better than the rest of it, but it doesn't make up for the time you waste watching the film. There is a very good reason why this movie, which foreshadows in many ways the neo-pagan counter-culture of the 60's, is little known -- it is very bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak are both amazing in this romantic comedy.

Is this what people really think witches are like? Is this what they think magic is? James Stewart (not a witch) had the one really true line in the movie: \\"Who's to say what magic is?\\"The premise is an odd one, but I don't think it's completely unique to this story. We are to believe that a witch cannot blush, cannot cry, and will lose all her powers if she falls in love. Well, perhaps there's some truth to that, under certain circumstances. Falling in love with a muggle can definitely mix things up. To me, love is the biggest booga-booga magic of all.But it is disturbing that these witches refer to muggles as \\"humans,\\" implying, of course, that they are not human.Well, it's a cute little story, and amusing in its way."},{"rating":"1","title":"spoiler alert!","review":"This ridiculous premise seems much more suited for a modern B-movie than a classic. I cant believe Stewart accepted such a silly script. Lemmon is as good as can be expected and the only redeeming part is when Kim becomes human. woops! did i just give it away?! no matter, there are far better love stories to see. Lastly something must be said about her brows! I understand shes a witch but theyre so huge and distracting throughout, her beauty is completely overshadowed."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my all time favorites","review":"Bell, Book and Candle is one of my favorite comedies.

I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cast, ok film","review":"Kim Novak is beautiful as usual, Jimmy Stewart is solid as usual, Jack Lemmon steals every scene as usual and the rest of the cast is solid.

Game is sturdy and solid and looks attractive.Only minor complaint would be that the leg levelers do not have a \\"nut\\" molded into them so you could use a wrench to adjust them easily.

This one put me in the frame of mind of those early 70s covers which were a feast for the eyes, then when you played it, was a feast for the ears. This CD followed suit for me. Bass heavy with lush strings that gives it a Barry White feel, and because of the female lead, seeming like these are leftover Love Unlimited tracks that Barry gave away!!!

After checking every crevice of my house for pee spots, I finally got around to checking the pads themselves. As it turns out, they are NOT completely waterproof. Apparently the plastic lining is not really plastic, because after checking the pad directly after a spill, I felt (and smelled!) urine seeping directly through the pad.I resorted to double padding, and sure enough, every urine mark leaves a shadow of urine on the pad underneath it.

This is a pure hip-hop classic because of its \\"8 Million Stories\\" that can generate \\"Electric Relaxation\\" that any \\"Sucka N*\\" will \\"Clap Your Hands\\" to and \\"We Can Get Down\\" way past \\"Midnight\\".Alright I couldn't find a place to put \\"The Chase, Part II,\\" but you get the point. 1993-94 will forever be my favorite year of hip hop, with Wu Tang, Nas, Biggie's first single, Snoop and Dr. Dre, and mostly because I got to see Tribe not once, but twice with De La Soul!This album's a masterpiece with not one bad track or any un-listenable filler material (which was way too common back then). Buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"100% Quality - No Filler","review":"What is there to say about \\"Midnight Marauders\\" other than that it's one of the greatest albums in the history of hip hop? Not much.From the opening horns of \\"Steve Biko (Stir It Up)\\" to the very last beat of \\"God Lives Through\\" there's not a bad track on the cd. Q Tip and Phife are at their best, (check the rhymes and pop culture references on \\"Keep it Rollin'\\") and Ali's production is on point. This is a must have for anyone who wants to discover what true hip hop is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, well done Tribe, an instant platinum hit.","review":"The Tribe does it again. An excellent instant platinum hit just like the the essential, must have, Low End Theory. The beats are just superb and relaxing in almost all 14 songs. Even though the Low End Theory to many was the greatest album made by the tribe, I'm gonna have to say this one is better. This album is a must have in any household. All I got to say is that A Tribe Called Quest is the best rap group ever after this major hit. Best 3 songs on the album are: Award Tour, Electric Relaxation, and Oh My God."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest","review":"Not to make less of The Low End Theory, but I'm always surprised by critics who say Tribe's greatest albums were their first two. If I had to give a Tribe CD to someone who never heard them before, Midnight would be the first to come to mind. It combines everything that is wonderful about Tribe. Lyrically they are so tight. Has social commentary and yet is very playful. Musically it is excellent. Also, unlike the first two, Phife (very underappreciated) excels in his game. I think all their albums deserve listen but start with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"What to say about this album that hasn't been said already?","review":"Out of the hundreds of albums I've listened to in my life, there are many that I consider quality music, but only a handful which gives me chills up my spine EVERY SINGLE TIME I listen to it. This includes Nas' Illmatic, Common's Resurrection, and Midnight Marauders. Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my god!!!!! Indeed","review":"Well what can I say? What an album. One of the GREATEST Albums in hip-hop. Normally plays third fiddle to the 2 former albums Peoples Instinctive Travels and the Path of Rhythm and The Low End Theory. To be fair the beats on this album are superior to those on the former 2. Tracks such as \\"Electric Relaxation\\" and \\"Keep It Rollin\\" prove this. This album is the birth of Phife Dawg as rapper. Lyrics such as\\" MC's like to meddle but here's my propositionI let my lyrics flow and juxta your position\\"Put him on point. As always Tip I on point too. Which makes it my favourite ATCQ album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"With Muhammed my man..Electric Relaxation","review":"If your mom don't approve then we'll just elope, let me save the little from inside the boat...need I say more this is the Tribe at their very best..You need this in your collection if your are a true hip-hop fan.."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the 90's best","review":"Back in the early 90's, I was all about the hard core hip-hop. If it wasn't Ice Cube, Getto Boys, N.W.A., or Paris, I wasn't into it. After awhile, it dawned on me that if all these thug things we're actually happening, somebody would be in jail by now. Then I see the Award Tour video. No sex, no violence, no bling-bling. Just a good song, in a good video. So I go out and buy Midnight Marauders. The tracks are smooth, funky, jazzy and smart. Not a Getto Boys hard core, and not a Will Smith softness. A nice medium area that they pull off withour really trying.When it became 2000, there were a lot of surveys - best artist of the millinium, best haircut of the 70's - you know, all that important stuff. In best album of the 90's, I'd always see Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Garth Brooks, or 2Pac.

I currently have ten of their knives in my collection, and this one is by far the sharpest. Another review said it best, that the rope cuts itself out of fear and respect. It's not too large, and does not create a stir when you open her up. That's good in professional environment. The knife is also one of the lightest knives I carry, making me forget sometimes that I even have it on me. Seems very durable, the action is perfect, as with all Spyderco blades. It's H1 steel, which won't rust, but I do not spend time in an environment that warrants that right now. I purchased this because I wanted the style of a Harpy, but not the large bulk or attention of the Civilian. I highly recommend it for all knife enthusiasts, no matter the task. From self protection to cutting open boxes, this knife will do the job without any hesitation, for a reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised by poor quality control...","review":"As a Spyderco owner I have always wanted to acquire this model. Upon arrival I discovered that the blade didn't fit properly in the handle when closed. Only the tip of the blade was retracted in the handle - the serrated portion was totally exposed with a clear gap visible above the handle. I compared this with other samples and this was not correct. Although Spyderco offered to accept under warranty and refund shipping costs I did not want to go thru this hassle for such a basic QC failure. Returned for refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Little Knife","review":"This is a great 2nd knife to carry in a variety of situations, especially on the water or around ropes and lines. I haven't seen a poorly made or designed Spyderco product yet, and this one is no exception. I carry mine a lot, not just for what it's marketed as, but also as a mini-Civilian (another Spyderco model) that could be used as a very effective defensive weapon if needed. Although I don't whip mine out for any little reason, I guarantee you this would be a great box opener if you're that kind of person, a good orange peeler, canoe knife, kayak knife, climbing knife, great at any saltwater application because it will never rust, and a million other things. I own two and haven't ruled out a third one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining DVD!","review":"Hi-5 is my daughter's favorite show and I highly recommend all their DVDs!

However, the Margaret Cheney work was a big disappointment to me nevertheless.Tesla's accomplishments are justifiably lauded throughout. However, it seems that each and every one of the inventor's wild, unfounded, publicity-seeking boasts is praised with the same unquestioning pen. By the mid-point of the book, I found it hard to put any credence in what was being written.I'm interested in finding a better-balanced treatment that looks more deeply into the meat of Tesla's revolutionary early work and glosses over the just-over-the-horizon meanderings of the last 40 years of his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prometheus Unbound, Highly Recommended","review":"If you are intrigued by genius or what David Keirsey calls the Promethean temperament, then you need go no further than this book. Cheney makes you feel as if you are there in the room with Tesla as he lectures in front of a wowed audience. The breadth and depth of Tesla's genius is astounding. As I read it, I was struck by how exciting Tesla's research was (anyone who thinks science is boring should read this book). He had some profound (if sometimes off the wall) theories on how to use electricity. It is a truly sad ordeal, though, to see Tesla at middle age, bitter because so many of his inventions had been ignored or stolen. But hopefully books like this will bring recognition to his myriad of inventions. He was certainly worthy of a Nobel Prize, at the very least for his invention of the alternating current."},{"rating":"1","title":"Content might be great, but I simply couldn't read it on my Fire.","review":"I was looking forward to the book.

Cheney's bio, however, makes a valiant attempt.Her material is poorly organized. She jumps back and forth in time, from the young Tesla to the old Tesla, with no warning or pattern. She jumps around in subjects almost as willfully. Her treatment of Tesla is reverent and laudatory one minute, dismissive and belittling the next.She gives almost no firm dates, so I found myself often bewildered about exactly which Tesla was being discussed. Her description of Tesla's science makes it clear that she was no scientist herself, and in fact makes Tesla's accomplishments all the harder to decipher. And most damning of all, she alludes to Tesla's odd habits and personal quirks, but never once comes right out and describes them.Tesla's story makes for a fascinating biography, but Cheney's may not be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish reading it","review":"I stopped reading the book in chapter 9 but should have stopped earlier.

Why not hire a business manager and concentrate on the big picture instead of getting lost in trying to scratch out the dollars necessary to survive? Why get hung up with Morgan?For a nonscientist, like me, many of the inventions and gadgets and discoveries seemed vague and hard to decipher. Given the importance of Tesla in advancing the field of electricity, the book does serve as an introduction to a much under reported and under publicized aspect of scientific history. I feel that this book is a start to explore Tesla and his inventions and his insights. I would like to see a coil in action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good history of Tesla","review":"Found this to be an excellent review of his life, and what he had gone through. The book is very readable, and does not put you to sleep like others. It does not go into details on his inventions, but does mention many of them, and the battles he had to go through with others at that time, and how most of his work was ahead of his time, and disregarded at that time.Well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tesla","review":"I read the Tesla book and finished it two weeks ago. I thought it was like a greek tragedy in some ways. His idea of transmitting electricity through the atmosphere sounded rather dangerous and impractical. He should have received more recognition than he did. If he was a little better businessman, he would have been wealthy beyond imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way to go Tesla!!!! You still keep surprising us!!!!!","review":"Nikola Tesla succeeded to be remembered through the course of the 20th century and beyound and become an important part of human history , a feat which the band Baggalutur failed to accomplish , and thus became a forgotten part of Icelandic , and not world - wide history , unlike Tesla , who had already become quite legendary worldwide during the latter days of his lifetime as a genius inventor.Tesla remains undouptedly one of the most important persons to have appeared on the scene in the entire history of science. Like Iceland , Tesla has been somewhat of an island in the Atlantic of the vast ocean that is history itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Bought it here as it was well over twenty dollars cheaper than anywhere else that carried it.

I like rap without all the cussing, and I'm a fan of smooth oldschool style. This album brings out a few of his only \\"smooth rap\\" songs that he's ever done.

Not only that the Philly sound gave the fullness for the production, the vocals alone gave it that soulful, church feeling to their songs. By far one of the best \\"girl groups\\" in the music world. Too bad they were categorized as a \\"disco group\\" back in the 70's. If they would've come out right now, they'd be amazing and would impress even Simon Cowell on a bad day!

To save her, he must win the trust of a psychotic teenager in order to get her to reveal a code.I was expecting some suspense and tense moments. I was expecting Michael Douglas--who is a decent actor--to struggle between wanting to help the girl and save his daughter. What I got was very little character development (you never really feel compelled to root for Douglas), and some extraordinary suspension of disbelief:The hard-boiled, psychotic girl opens up to Michael Douglas faster than a guest on Jerry Springer.It's also worth noting that this is the same director that ruined \\"Kiss The Girls\\"--the James Patterson book is phenomenal.But, if you really want to see it, just rent it. There's not much replay value with the film, so save yourself the [money]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been There, Done That","review":"Yes, you've seen this film before. And yes, that isn't always a bad thing, but here your time is wasted. See \\"Ransom\\" again if you need a fix. Plot holes populate this movie to the point of frustration, the acting is average, the suspense is minimum, etc. It really doesn't take advantage of its premise. I would have been more interested if it became an intense psychological thriller dealing with the inner workings of this young woman's mind. \\"I'll never tell!\\" Yeah right, she tells ten minutes later in full deatil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where do they find these criminals?","review":"This was a pretty typical thriller in that it didn't really thrill. The bad guys were cookie cutter crooks. I think it was the same group of incompetents that Harrison Ford had to deal with in Firewall. There were a few twists here, but they were all forced and predictable. This film kept a pretty good pace and was somewhat entertaining, but it has all been done before, over and over again in these formula thrillers that studios churn out like TV episodes. I guess if you like Michael Douglas you would like this movie, but I've seen too many films with pretty much the same plot and the same bad guys that self-implode to really enjoy this one. Worth a rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping and Entertaining","review":"Dont Say A Word is a excellent movie. All the cast perform extremely well (especially Brittany Murphy and Michael Douglas) and the plot has enough twists and turns to keep you gripped through out (even though the basic plot isnt anything new).

He has a certain patient that has a number inside her head.The kidnappers say that they will give his daughtor back if he can find out that special number.Michael Douglas, Famke Janssen, and Oliver Platt all give solid performances, but the highlight of this movie is defiantly Brittany Murphy.

Namely, 1) How did the bad guys know the girl had a six-digit number in her head that they needed? Weren't they in jail after the subway incident? 2) How did they install all those cameras everywhere? 3) Wouldn't the drugs the doctors were giving the girl have incapacitated her at least a little? 4) What did those bodies they found floating have to do with anything? 5) Why was the deadline 5 o'clock? What was so urgent about them getting that number after they had waited 10 years? If anyone has any insight, please share!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, for a Friday night flick.","review":"2.5 stars. 'Don't Say A Word', is OK if you are home on a Friday night with nothing to do or you want to be mildly entertained for two hrs. If not, you won't like this. It has no real surprises and the plot is that of the usual Hollywood fair. Mr. Douglas does a fine job. Mr. Platt is good, yet his character isn't involved through the whole film. His character just \\"dissapeares\\", midway. The villians are regrettably forgettable. Details to plot and character developement are important in a film; especially one like 'Don't Say A Word'. The acting, production and direction are fair. Overall, it's a good film. It may be better with popcorn and some tasty beverage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another movie about the upper class fighting crime","review":"This is just another boring movie about a rich guy who takes a bite out of crime. He and his wife use their superior intellect to beat the bad guys.Off course, 99 percent of the police play only a minor part, showing up at the end to carry the dead bodies away.This plot has been done before a million times. This is not an interesting movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn-o-Rific","review":"It never fails I fall for the hype that some movie is good and different and it ends up being the same old same old. In the orginal trailer it kept showing the girl saying \\"I'll never tell\\", which became the unofficial tag line of this movie. It was annoying then and even more so now. Michael Douglas plays a well worn piece of leather as usual, Famke Jansen is one redeeming factor though, but I would watch her making coffee that is just me. Anyway Sean Bean is playing the villian again which he is good at but he is somewhat wasted here. I guess this movie is a passable waste of time if you have nothing better to do. I give 1 and 1/2 leatherfaces out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Say Award","review":"Maybe it's me---I saw the film on it's day of release, just over two weeks after September 11th., and the film's portrayal of a constantly smoky New York w/ firemen and policemen everywhere made me slightly uneasy. So did Douglas's obviously facelift. Another flaw is a seriously uninvolving subplot involving a policewoman played by Jennifer Esposito. And Oliver Platt's character is forgotten about seventy-five minutes in. But Douglas turns in a decent performance and there are two or so clever or thrilling scenes. All in all, a sub-par effort put on the shoulders of a mega-star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple plot, no twists, lots of suspense music","review":"2 of 5 stars for the suspense movie \\"Don't Say a Word\\". Very simple plot, no plot twists, lots of suspense and a long movie with little contents. The story is simple, some nutcases want to extract a magic number that a girl has in her memory. The girl has been a mental patient most of her life. So, they kidnap the daughter of her shrink and demand he extract the number from the patient. From there it is a straight forward kidnapping recovery story.Darkly photographed, lots of heavy stringed music to add a suspense edge to the movie. Well acted by Michael Douglas. But, not much reward for sitting thru the movie. No twists. You don't even really find any value from the magic number.You can skip this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable","review":"Not a bad film, pretty prdeictable, if you like Michael Douglas you will like this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch Brittany Murphy for Future","review":"The #1 reason for watching this movie is discovering young actress Brittany Murphy who is outstanding as Michael Douglas's psychiatric patient. In order to save his own daughter's life, Douglas must discover a number that is locked inside this patient's brain. That number will lead to the recovery of a fabulous jewel. Douglas's and Murphy's scenes together are all terrific. The rest of the movie is a rather conventional Hollywood thriller about good guy Douglas sweating bullets under the demands of bad guy Sean Bean and how Douglas will save the day and triumph over Bean. It's a night's entertainment and I enjoyed it. I can't imagine wanting to own my own copy though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't say a word? Dont expect much","review":"Conceptually, this movie is fantastic: To save his kidnapped daughter, a child psychologist must pry a sequence of numbers from the mind of a seemingly psychotic and thoroughly overmedicated and messed up young girl.Notice I said \\"conceptually.\\" Keep reading my review.Based on this premise, what I was expected was tense drama and suspense as Michael Douglas attempts to forge a bond with the girl to unlock the mysteries of her past and convince her to reveal her secrets. What I got was completely unrealistic--the girl's trust solidified in a matter of moments, leading to a completely predictable, formulaic conclusion.Come on. The only time people open up like that is when they're on Jerry Springer. Had I known that this movie was directed by the same director that ruined the book, \\"Kiss The Girls\\", I may not have rented it at all.Conclusion: If you're curious, rent it. This is not something with a lot of playback appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intense thriller.","review":"Michael Douglas plays both an awesome psychiatrist and a terrific father of an eight year old girl in this tense thriller about a group determined to get a ten million dollar jewel lost in a robbery ten years ago. One of Michael's patients is the key to that jewel, and the terror group knows it. They kidnap his daughter, eight year old Jessie and unless Michael is prepared to use his psychiatric expertise to pry a six digit number from his patient's head, his daughter, and perhaps others will die. The only part I couldn't relate to was the mother of 8 yr old Jessie, played by Brittany Murphy, who spent most of her time with a broken leg in her bed. Her acting in some scenes was great, but for the most part I just felt she didn't act like the mother of a kidnapped daughter would act. Her grief didn't seem real, her terror not quite plausible, otherwise, a great film well worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this movie!","review":"What a painful and boring movie! No one should buy it, renting it once will keep you out of it forever. This is not a thriller, just a platform for Michael Douglas to look good and play the good and courageous father of a kidnapped little girl.That movie, if you like real thrillers like Hannibal, won't fascinate you at all, the plot is extremely thin and you can see all the \\"twists\\" coming in ages before they actually do, a complete failure to me and certainly NOT a classic thriller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really no big deal...","review":"Once again, Michael Douglas mantained his reputation intact after such not so good movie, due to his unbeliavable capacity of good acting.But the plot is really weak.

Koster is a desperate jewel thief, just released from prison, who kidnaps Conrad's 8-year old daughter Jessie. Conrad is forced to use all his skills as a psychologist to get through to a new catatonic patient (Brittany Murphy) in order to rescue Jessie while running against the clock.

I was riveted from the first few moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing story marred by typical Hollywood hokum","review":"The story is certainly intriguing enough, and I'll agree with the Amazon reviewer that that makes it suitable for 'rainy day viewing'. Unfortunately, it's too bad that the filmmakers seem so enamored with their own technique that they simply have to pile on one cliche after another: slow-motion flashbacks, cute kids that are unusually smart, tinkling piano music to remind us that it's a tender family moment, bedridden wives that suddenly turn into Linda Hamilton in \\"The Terminator\\". On top of that, we've got Jennifer Esposito pretending to be a tough cop and Michael Douglas wearing more makeup than usual. The whole thing almost begs for someone like Leslie Nielson to come in full Airplane mode and spout \\"I am serious - and stop calling me surely\\". Underneath all this is probably the makings of a potentially interesting story, one that ocassionally reveals itself when you least expect it. Otherwise, this is pretty routine affair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Font say a word","review":"Brittnay Murphy was intense in this movie. Very suspensful the entire movie, certainly worth watching.

Why waste your money?I'm now questioning the value of purchasing these cheap type of products at Amazon. They have a 30 day policy for returns, and as far as I can tell will not stand behind the product.

I checked all things that I might have possibly done wrong, but I didn't find any. When you try to load the CD, it doesn't let you play anything.

It made a funny noise after two weeks and completely broke after three. Also...on the instruction booklet there are warnings everywhere re: power cord made with lead base and radiation emitting from cd player. This may be true with other electronics but i do not recollect seeing such warnings on my other things. The company will not give me a refund since i purchased this via amazon.

Paying $10 on top of the original purchase price to get a replacement CD player for my brand new CD player! I might consider this IF I felt it was a fluke, but in reading the reviews I'm afraid it's not (my husband purchased this one without carefully reading the negative feedback). I kindly suggested they offer me a credit and I could look at other products in the COBY family. That was denied so I guess I'm stuck with a radio/CD player which doesn't play CD's and writing COBY a negative review for their poor customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute and functional for what I bought it for","review":"I bought this for my 21 month old daughter so she could have music on during \\"room time\\".

The size is small and lightweight enough to move it easily (it can fit into very small spaces), but it has a surprisingly BIG sound. The size is only about 8 inches square. This unit actually had better low frequency reproduction than some bigger boomboxes I've owned. It has familiar-looking, easy to use 'dial' type volume and tuning knobs (not digital), and the simplest of switches and buttons to operate the cd player and am/fm stereo radio. Can run on batteries or the included cord. I've had NO PROBLEMS with it and it sounds great.

We kept one cd in the player, and rarely ever changed it out. I mention this to highlight the fact that the player did not undergo a constant changing out of cds or pressing of various buttons. Despite this,the player stopped playing cds after three months. It was kept in a stationary position, used only once a day in the evening and yet it did not hold up.

Not one radio station comes in clearly. I have no idea why this is as we live in the city and our signals are strong. The sound quality for the cd player is poor, but at least it doesn't sound like the speakers are blown. The antenna broke off within the first 2 months. Partly because we couldn't get any reception so the antenna was moved frequently. I do like the shuffle, repeat. All in all you'd be better off spending a few more dollars.

That was such a headache that I finally gave up and I guess the machine gave up to, since it doesn't play any CDs now. The radio is a cheap one but nothing that I didn't expect.

I was so annoyed that I only asked if I mail it to the address on the COBY website. He said yes! I waited about a month, was on hold again for 20 minutes. When I finally got him on the phone again, he said they never received it, that I sent it to the wrong address. I am so frustrated with the whole situation.

If anything, this manual is even more lacking as it doesn't even include the 50 scenarios comprising the Crusader Trail, and offers no information on the new AI opponents you'll be going up against in the scenarios. Like the first guide, this is really nothing more than an expanded instruction booklet and not really necessary to getting the most out of Stronghold Crusader. Much of the introductory material is just a rehash of what was contained in the original, and coverage of the new features and campaigns introduced in Crusader is far less than what I would have hoped for when buying this guide. While Crusader as a game is a worthwhile sequel (and the Warchest version even more so), this accompanying Strategy Guide falls even farther short than the original guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Great Grooves","review":"Another wonderful collection of JJ Cale tunes and laid back grooves.

For this reason alone it is a dangerous item. Also, the dial knob feels like its make out of cheap plastic and could break off without much force. The turning motion of the knob is rough.

I haven't used the toaster part, but the oven part is ok if you can find cookware small enough to fit on the little round turntable. The microwave part is very disappointing. If you want to make popcorn, forget it, I've tried 5 times with 3 different brands. I don't know why they even made a setting for popcorn. And it does a lousy job cooking frozen dinners.

My husband would like quicker toast so I'll get him a 2 slide toaster but despite all the negatives I've read from other sites, this site had the most positive, I KNOW it is a great little appliance. My 96 yr young mother uses it exclusively and I too wondered if hers stopped working, how will I find another to replace it. Glad to know they are still making it.

I told my co-workers how I felt it must have been written by someone else. But alas, it appears that she did indeed pen this beautiful tome.

However, you would not want to roll this case for any great distance, especially over uneven ground. The case has a tendancy to tip over while rolling over any kind of uneven surface.

The book goes very slow and has MANY side plots which prove to be useless in the novel. The book is a SLOW read, and the book could have EASILY been under 100 pages for the main plot. My favorite is still The Runaway Jury. The Rainmaker just lacks the big scandal we all love in Grisham's work.

Unfortunately, the book also becomes predictable towards the end until the last few chapters where the suspense resumes. The plotting, although linear, is interesting. It is also a very emotional book; this book can make you hate insurance companies. The linear first-person perspective both supports and opposes the ability of the book to convey the plot. Also, there are many unanswered questions that the book leaves. At times, the story feels incomplete, especially at the end. However, The Rainmaker by John Grisham is an excellent book in general and is definitely worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Grisham","review":"I love John Girsham's books and all the movies. He has great amount of experience writing about the law and it's complicated twists. His writing style is easy to pick and and enjoy for all people. One can see the words being drawn into a movie as they are reading. I like to read books before watching a movie because it is usually better and so I recommend people to do so. Their imaginations are alwayz more creative than any motion picture can display. enjoy reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rainmakers bring home the bacon and that's what Grisham does","review":"This is a neat little package of a book. 550 pages-odd but a fast, fast read which turns the screw nicely. Grisham is excellent - I'm sure he knows he is - but in a sense, with so many great books under his belt, I wonder if that doesn't leave him with a desire to tie-up too many loose ends in the last chapter or so. I felt that some of the last few swings were a little too convenient and so, much as I cannot believe I have the audacity to give Mr Grisham only four stars, that is what I am going to give him. I think more flags earlier on in the story would have given it five, but the quick spurt to the end - common in a number of books - is possibly a failing of an editor, not necessarily Grisham himself? I wonder if he reads these reviews?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was there a plot here?!","review":"When I finished this story I was like that's it?! Where was the plot, and the conflict?!

Three hours later I was still engulfed in it. The description is so vivid I feel as if I'm in the story line myself. I can relate to the situations the characters deal with. There are many conflicts that all intertwine with one another. A love story evolves, but doesn't disrupt the main plot. I had already watched the movie, so I always pictured the main character, Rudy, as Matt Damon. When I finished the book, I was upset; I wish it were a never-ending novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"rainmaker, the","review":"Rudy bailer was fresh out of law school when he got his first big case. It was summer in Memphis, and the company he was just working laid him off due to a merger. To make matters worse, he just got evicted from his apartment and had no place to go. Finding the next available job, he started working for a new law firm. Eventually, the FBI closed in and shut down his new office and he was yet again out of a job. So Rudy and another employee of the firm started an all new practice together. Although some of the first months are trying times, they stumble upon a very interesting bad faith insurance claim. A boy was dying of leukemia and the insurance carrier would not pay for kemo-therapy. So Rudy takes them to court."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you like this book?","review":"I don't understand how people can actually like this book. Compared to Grisham's previous novels (such as The Firm, the Client, and A Time to Kill) this novel absolutely sucks. He takes no time in development in his characters. Rudy Baylor is an arrogant, self righteous lawyer who preaches about the woes of big corporations. It's not if he has any experience in the matter. He's fresh out of high school. His girlfriend Kelly is the sterotypical beat up woman who returns to her man again and again and almost gets herself killed. Why can't he return to the helpful and intelligent women such as Abby in the Firm? Or in the Client? Kelly has to depend on Rudy, who isn't a stable himself, to get her out of the mess she's gotten herself into. The Rainmaker lacks character, it lacks orginality, and it lacks thought. Spend more time on your novels John Grisham!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"This is my least favorite Grisham book. Aside from the underdeveloped plot, the characters are very flat. And, the story, especially the ending, is so completely far-fetched, it makes the endings of The Firm and The Pelican Brief seem plausible.I don't understand the hype this book receives, it certainly doesn't deserve it. Grisham knows how to keep the reader captivated, so it's disappointing to read something like this and know that he could have done a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rainmaker","review":"Because the text to speech is disabled and I am blind this book is not available to me.

This one's another of his works, interesting but not informative, fast-paced yet predictable. The way Rudy Baylor does the job is not very impressive as the things are just happening for him, the smaller devil working with him is more interesting. The court scenes are really good, the usual grisham stuff is there too. But if you're a grisham fan just read it the way i did, you wont be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Page-Turner","review":"I have read a number of Grisham's novels and this was one of the better ones.

Some of the things he does and the endless chain of lucky coincidences were hardto swallow but it was fun anyway, almost like a fairy tale. Until the last 32 pages and the off the wall 50 million dollarverdict. That was the last straw. Rudy only sued Great Benefit for 10 million and I figured he get maybe 5. Where the50 came from I don't know. And how Great Benefit could go bankrupt when just last week in court they were worth450 million, 100 million of that in cash, I don't know nor believe? And it quickly disintegrated from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed It, BUT....","review":"Though it was a bit slow in the beginning, in the end, I enjoyed every minute of it. Like many of Grisham's novel's there's always something more behind it.What disappointed me about the rain maker, is what disappoints me about most Grisham novels, especially this one; The protaganist (Rudy Baylor) always ends up in the same way most characters do.It's a wonderful read though and I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rainmaker","review":"I found this novel by John Grisham very entertaining. I had a hard time putting it down until I was done reading it. It kept me guessing about what was going to happen next and I would often guess wrong Also having never read a book about lawyers before I learned a lot of new things that I would have never known out otherwise. If you like stories about underdogs you will truely love this book. Rudy is a true underdog in this story. He is a just starting out lawyer whose first case is fighting a huge insurance company for 10 million dollars. Not your typical first day on the job. This book moves at a fast pace and my only complaint is that sometimes its hard to keep up. But overall go get this book and it will not dissapoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rainmaker","review":"I was mildly dissapointed by this book. I was expecting something suspensful, a thriller, at least something that kept your interest. The meandering storyline was bland at best, with very actual storyline. The only half-way interesting part was in the last three chapters. Everything else in the book is basically just a day in the life of a unsuccessful lawyer. I wouldn't recommend this for someone who's looking for a thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll be disappointed.","review":"I loved every minute of this book except the ending. The main body is filled with wit and excitement as we follow Rudy in his attempts to find a job and try his first case. At this point Grisham presents the reader with a half baked , totally unbelievable mini drama, the outcome of which made me dislike a previously likeable character. Rudy, who detests the unethical practices of those around him, lets the reader down. The final chapters give the impression that the author wants to finish up quickly, but instead of saying \\"and they all lived happily ever after\\", he writes \\" and they all commited some serious crimes, flew to the moon and lived there happily ever after\\". You'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful writing!","review":"Sure the action in the book is unrealistic but it's not a non-fiction book; it's a book meant for entertainment, which is exactly what it does! Grisham's writing is superb and often times hilarious(the actual trial is a riot). It's one of many excellent John Grisham books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Grisham classic!!","review":"Somehow John Grisham can make insurance claims and legalese interesting. Two of the cringe inducing most boring topics I can think of and Grisham is able to keep me enthralled page after page. Every character in this tale of corporate injustice is easy to see in the mind's eye. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gresham's best book","review":"Gresham is at his best in this colorful tale of a young lawyer on the run from bill collectors, struggling to find a job out of law school and falling into the case that will make or break his career.This is the only Gresham book that is written in the first person, and Gresham does a marvelous job in reflecting the protagonist's thoughts and emotions as he interacts with a variety of characters, from good-old-boy lawyers and their crony judges to the uneducated poor who are fodder for corporate rip-off artists to the various parasitical characters that live off of the legal system in some form or fashion. With a variety of sub-plots, the reader is not really sure which one will take center stage... and that is one of the beauties of this novel in that it reflects life's vagaries.I was only lukewarm to Gresham's writing, until I read this book. If you're a Gresham fan, then read it. If you're not a Gresham fan, this book will change your mind. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Characters","review":"This is a great story with great characters! Who wouldn't like to sue an insurance company? Rudy is likable from the first page. He ofen feels like a guppie swimming with sharks, but he holds his own. I enjoyed this story the most of all of Grisham's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham Turns the Unbelievable into the Believable","review":"John Grisham's \\"The Rainmaker\\" is full of excitement and fun. This is definately one of his top two novels although it appears to be written to become a bestseller. This is as well written as A Time to Kill, but doesn't raise any issuses like A Time to Kill does. I got caught up in the book and couldn't put it down. It has excitement, corruption, action, romance--everything that is part of a page-turner and bestseller. Grisham turns the unvelivable into the believable in far--but not far-fetched storyline. I recommend this book to anyone young and old."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific page turner","review":"The story is new and fresh.

I actually found myself impressed that this easy, elementary approach still had me wanting to get to the next page and I was wishing it was longer so that I could continue to enjoy it.

His characters are so flatly drawn they give paper cuts to the reader. The plot is way too predictable. He needs to take more time between books, and actually use some creative thinking. I would have given this 0 stars, but wasn't given the option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of very uneven quality","review":"The first 100 pages or so are quite boring.Then Grisham hits his stride. The main storyline contains courtroom drama that matches Grisham's best for attorney shenanigans and legal surprises. I couldn't stop reading the portions that described the trial.The conclusion is bizarre and anticlimactic and seems silly, as though Grisham couldn't come up with a sensible end. The love intrigue is irrelevant to the case against the insurance company and is contrived.The story is marred by Grisham's tendency to use his story for his far-left activism. Here it is a campaign against big corporations (insurance, in this case) and abusive husbands.With good editing, condensation, and self-discipline, this could have been a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading not enabled!","review":"Bummer, I can't stand when good books have the reading feature disabled on Kindle.

The subtle nuances authored by Mr. Grisham provide a compelling and thought provoking reading. The part addressing wiretapping and the hilarious results surrounding the pompous big time attorney and the jury is one of many examples of the tremendous talent that Mr. Grhisham exhibits in his authorship. Well Done..!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An okay addition to the Grisham library","review":"The Rainmaker is probably my least favorite Grisham novel (though it's still pretty good - once you get used to \\"Rudy's\\" style of writing). The first time I read it, I was very dissappointed at the ending. I didn't feel that Rudy was a person that I could admire. It was a little better the second time around, but it still could be a lot better. The book gives some laughs, the \\"Stupid Letter\\" probably one of the best. I saw the movie recently, and I think that the book is better. Sorry, Coppola, but Grisham's better at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good read that flops monumentally in its final pages.","review":"I thought I had finally found a Grisham novel in which the characters were more than two dimensional stereotypes. For once, a believable character faced with daunting adversity. The book's entertainment value, however, lies in the reader's interest in how the whole mess is going to work out. What a disappointment when every subplot ends up a red herring, and the main character's development arrests seemingly midsentence and goes in an utterly unacceptable direction.Is Grisham too much of a celebrity now for a decent editor to challenge"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ending!","review":"While I enjoyed reading most of the book the ending was a huge disappointment. It felt rushed and carelessly thrown together, like a high school student hurrying to finish an overdue book report.The characters were very superficial. Not Grisham's best, or even close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Grisham","review":"Lacks the mystery and intrigue of past books.

At first I was nonplussed by the book. I kept expecting it be a suspense-filled rocket-ride right out of the gate--like every other Grisham book I've read. It's not like that. But it's compelling and keeps you reading and rooting for the good guys. I'm here to tell you that if you have insurance of any kind--especially of the medical variety--you will find this story to be a balm to the soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one must be the script for a \\"made for tv\\" movie.","review":"The weakest of Grisham's stories, this one reads as if it was written to be the Sunday night \\"made for tv\\" special ---doesn't even make the big screen! The character development leaves us with nothing more than caricatures. And theonly satisfying part about the ending was that the story was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rudy Baylor, the Rocky Balboa of all attorneys.","review":"John Grisham has crafted an intriguing, fast-paced storywhich will keep the reader turning pages long after thethe family has gone to sleep. Grisham's main character,Rudy Baylor, quickly becomes a close acquaintance of thereader. Rudy is a young, ambitious law student who getsthoroughly \\"kicked around\\" by circumstances beyond hiscontrol. His inherent intelligence and amazing ability tomake the right decisions at the right time, especially whileemployed by a \\"sleaze-bucket\\" attorney firm in Memphis, eventuallybring him to the ultimate heights of justice andjurisprudence in the American legal system. The final pagescaused me to wonder if it is possible that Rudy Baylor might,in some way, be related to Rocky Balboa? Grisham laces hisstories with believability in his characters and just enoughlegaleze to wrap us in tight blanket of suspense. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was one of the best books that I have ever read.","review":"I liked this book because there wasn't just one good story line there were several. This major one was Rudy Bayler trying to nail ainsurance company for killing a person with lukimia. I also liked the first person narreration, by John Grisham in his finest books ever. Sure every book he writes is about a lawyer just coming out of, or in, law school, but he's so good at it who cares."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD AUTHOR, GOOD BOOK","review":"John Grisham is a very talented writer, I have read all of his books and do truly enjoy them. Rainmaker is one of many examples of his good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always a wonderful read!","review":"John Grisham's novels always have me laughing out loud; up all night; and I simply cannot put them down until I finish them! When I found out that there was going to be a movie I HAD to read it again. I cannot wait to see the movie, although Grisham's books are so descriptive that the movie is playing in my head as I am reading. I can picture every character and what they look like in my head, so the movie's characters are bound to be a disappointment. No other author has captured my undivided attention like John Grisham has in EVERY ONE of his books. Those who criticize him, need to re-read the book and this time PAY ATTENTION! In my opinion, The Rainmaker and A Time To Kill are his very best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and the main character was a complete waste.","review":"I had no cares for any of the people in this story. This is boring and simple reading. If this was the only Grisham I ever read, it would be the last. People you are being too kind to this author. He is turning out junk by the minute."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a LOUSY book!","review":"I'm afraid I can't recall the last time I read such an unrealistic book. A kid lawyer fresh out of law school takes on the super powerful legal conglomorate representing a massive insurance company... and wins, all by his widdle wonesome. The only way this could happen is if the opposing lawyers make every blunder possible... which they conveniently do. Along the way the law firm which tries to cheat our young hero mysteriously burns to the ground and a judge who is in cahoots with the insurance company's legal team suddenly dies the day before a vital ruling. I waited until the end of the book to find out who the kid's mysterious, immoral benefactor was... and there wasn't one. Nope. Just coincidence, the whole way.Along the way there are pointless subplots with a woman who claims to have millions in an Atlanta bank, a love story with an abuse victim, and the ethical dilemma of the need to be an ambulance chaser to make ends meet. WIll our young hero prevail? Who cares?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-paced legal thriller","review":"Grisham provides another gripping legal drama with an explosive pace, making this book hard to put down. The story has a little bit of everything; from the law student who finds himself in the role of David versus Goliath, the comical character played by Deck, there are the complimentary thugs and the token beautiful woman. Grisham weaves the story together magically and it makes for a very exciting read, building into a crescendo at the end with an unexpected twist. The only faux pas with this novel is that readers will invariably question whether the story could happen in real life. As a lawyer myself I seriously doubt it, but then real life tends not to be an interesting read. Apart from the fact that the story beggars belief, this makes for a definite purchase and comes close to the greatness of The Partner, but not quite."},{"rating":"1","title":"80% good then a dud","review":"I could not put the book down but the ending sounded like Mr Grisham was past his deadline and had to get the manuscript in. The ending (which I will not disclose) is a great dissappointment. He wraps up his loose ends in a most sloppy of manners. A good book with a bad ending makes this attempt at a novel mediocre at best"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite frankly, boring.","review":"John Grisham usually writes pretty decent books (A Time to Kill and The Firm are my favorites) but this was just BORING. It was just too easy for Rudy to win that case. It made me laugh when he tricked the defense after they bugged his phones, but his tricking the defense made it too easy. Most of the book was about his economic problems which weren't all THAT bad. Or maybe they were bad but Grisham didn't play up on them enough. This is not just my opinion. Two friends of mine have read the book and they both agree with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rainmaker is a great legal drama.","review":"The Rainmaker was very good but it didn't keep my interest up as much as The Client or The Chamber (the only other Grisham books I've read.)The characters were very memorable, especially Rudy Baylor. I also liked the way John Grisham told the book from Rudy's point of view. It was interesting to see how the case was viewed through the eyes of a young lawyer fresh out of law school. The Rainmaker is a thought provoking novel and is a great read, especially for Grisham fans! The book is much better than the movie, as usual."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"For me, this is the one of Grisham's best novel, after his classic \\"The firm\\". read it twice and didn't find one sigle page boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book - until the end","review":"From the first chapter until nearly the last I was thoroughly engrossed into this book.

Rudy went to a lot of trouble just to walk away from it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham Succumbing to Formula Novel???","review":"In the four-tape abridgment I heard, Grisham still produces an attention-getting -- and attention-keeping -- novel, but I'm beginning to find the pattern of his books annoyingly similar. There's that point in the plot where you say, \\"Whoops! One too many good breaks for our hero! Goodbye, believability!\\" And that point further on, where you say, \\"Well, obviously, everything will come out all right, or there goes the story.\\" But the fun is in the detail -- with Grisham, getting there is half the fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad News","review":"I have owned 4 of his grills a loved them all.

It relates what happens to employees when a new CEO is appointed to reorganize Crapper Companies, a manufacturing conglomerate. I had to keep reminding myself it is a work of fiction because Crapper sounds a lot like the company I work for. My husband read it and said it sounded like the company he works for!

I like how the book organizes each plant, plus its very informative. The reason it lost a star is because I must have got a bad one because the printing was off.

Turgenev's insights into human thought and behavior are as incisive here as they were in the other book. This relatively short book seems simple, but it really isn't. There is a lot going on here, reflective not only of how people interact with each other, but also of Russia at a certain period. The wordsmithing here is masterful, either a tribute to the author or the translator or both. But the real power of this novel is the classic story of the interaction between generations, between the sexes and between the classes.

It seems the company that made the video wanted to impress us with their fancy editing techniques. Well I'm impressed. But I didn't buy the video to see fancy editing. I bought it so that I could get a close-up look at terrific musicians in action, watch their fingering, see their faces, see which guy is playing which part, and watch their incredible drummer.

My girlfriend also liked my watch, and needed a new one, so when I went back to the States I bought her one. About four days later, hers got water in the case, and soon thereafter died. Worse yet, my own watch died several days later. So out of two watches of this style, the average lifespan is about four months.

He does not spare himself and he does not disappoint. We are entirely there with him.

The theme of the aloof American traveller getting into a mess abroad with chattering, irrational foreigners is outmoded and trivial. Bryson is obnoxiously critical of Europeans and their ways, making this book, in spite of its occasional tolerably funny passages, one of the most ridiculous and unpalatable books I've read in a long while. I get the impression that Bryson the American feels he is always right and the childish Europeans are always wrong and immature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inlcudes Lots of European Locations","review":"Bryson covers lots of cities and interactions with locals; his encounter with Austrians in a pub makes for chilling reading.

At age 42, I no longer feel I have to read every word of a book--life's too short, so skip the parts you don't care about--but I did read every word of this one.BUT--on the last page, when he decides to go home, he reveals that his wife is pregnant again and he really thinks maybe he ought to get back. WHAT??!! What kind of lowdown leaves his pregnant wife and kids fending for themselves while he gallivants around Europe for a couple months? What kind of idiot woman stays married to such a schmuck?

He tried to \\"go home again\\", but it didn't work out well, at least for him. Still, he does describe some interesting places and provides tips on the pleasant ones. This is a \\"maybe\\" selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncontrollable laughter!","review":"I'm glad I read this book in the privacy of my own home. If I had been reading this in public, I would have been mistaken for one of those crazy people you see sitting at coffee shops and laughing hysterically by themselves.This is the first book I have read by Bill Bryson, and I was completely impressed. As I was reading through this book, I had to keep myself from running back to the bookstore and buying his whole collection.In \\"Neither Here Nor There\\" Bryson is reliving a journey he had taken through Europe in his youth. If you've ever been to Europe, you will deeply appreciate the sarcastic humor that Bryson uses to describe the people he meets and the places he visits."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Fiction than anything else","review":"A desperate effort of an American living in the UK to surpass his true heritage of 'american humour', the books has its moments but all in all is more fiction than anything else. Mr Bryson does not understand a thing about Europe or it's culture, no matter how many places he visits, how many miles he covers or how many years he chooses to live here, he remains and represents the average American mind, short of the ability to understand - and even worse, wanting to understand - anything that lies beneath the surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and dull","review":"Bryson has a lazy and sometimes obnoxious style of writing, and the countries he visits in this book all blur together because of it. His perceptive commentaries on the natives can generally be summed up as \\"The Swiss, they're so funny!\\", \\"The Austrians, they're so funny!\\", \\"The _______, they're so funny!\\" He also uses a lot of expletives, apparently thinking this will add humor to his writing. His attempts to tie his travels to an earlier journey as a student are thin at best, and may be nothing more than an attempt to add padding to this small and worthless volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Continuing with Cliches","review":"Whenever I need something to read before I fall asleep, I reach for one of Mr. Bryson's book. Since I travel a lot, people assume I love travel literature, and give me his ridiculous books as \\"going away gifts.\\" This particular book, \\"Neither here nor there\\" certainly doesn't buck the trend of under-educated, under-informed, boring slop. Although I don't doubt that Mr. Bryson has traveled in Europe, his use of standard cliches has the ring of someone afraid to leave his front door, in case he might have to eat something with which he is not familiar. He pretends to know the political and cultural history of every country he visits - therefore allowing him to make the rudest and ugliest jokes...but what can we expect from an American afterall?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jolly Good Fun","review":"It is clear to anyone reading this book that Bryson knows nothing about Europe, but therein lies its charm. The thing is filled with memorable one liners and hilarious set pieces; checking out of a Copenhagen hotel springs to mind, as does his gracious departure from a restaurant in Italy to make way for some small time mobsters. Those looking for 'Baedeker'-style detail will be disappointed, but Bryson's perspective on this odd continent is fresh and enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bryson could make anything funny","review":"I love Bill Bryson. I've read almost all his books, and each time I finish another one, I get a little sad thinking there are now fewer left for me to get to. He is that good.\\"Neither Here Nor There\\" is classic Bryson. This guy could write about paint drying and still make the funniest, smartest observations ever. Although all the giddy excitement of traveling to new places shines through in this memoir, most of the time Bryson talks about his experiences on trains, railway stations, police stations, waiting rooms, or hotel rooms by himself. Here is were his true talent shines through and he illuminates the absolutely wacky in the mundane.I could have done without some of the misguided political commentaries he let slip in this book, but it is still a wonderful treat to see Europe through this mild-mannered madman's eyes. If you really want to laugh and laugh, go pick up this book--and all his other ones, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Neither Here nor There: Travels in Europe","review":"It is extremely funny and really describes life as it really is? What more can I say concerning this author and book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither Funny Nor Informative","review":"From reading the numerous glowing reviews, I guess it is just me. I was bored silly with Bryson's \\"Neither Here Nor There,\\" and after just 70 pages ended up skimming the rest to see if it got better. It didn't and I cut my losses and gave up. Normally I like books by humorists, but Mr. Bryson's humor seems labored and deliberate; basically he hits you over the head with his cliche'd descriptions. I found some of his experiences unbelievable and perhaps he asked for some of the treatment by his manner, attitude, who knows?I have read Dave Barry and howled, David Sedaris and doubled over trying not to embarrass myself in public by screaming with laughter. Mr. Bryson is not my type of humorist. I guess my impression of this book is that he took a trip back, with a chip on his shoulder and really didn't enjoy it at all. Why are we supposed to???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can anyone say...xenophobic?","review":"From Bryson's descriptions of Swiss people as boring, to racist cracks about gypsies in Italy, I wonder why I am the only reviewer who felt annoyed. (Maybe he should read Isabel Fonseca's \\"Bury me Standing\\" and learn a little about the culture of gypsies. Sure they can be annoying, but you'd have to be a stupid schlep to get pick-pocketed as easily as he did) This is one uptight American that I wouldn't want to travel with. This is a great book for people who like to travel to foreign countries to rip on other peoples' cultures. A colossal bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called \\"Eurpoean Tales of a Bloated Gasbag\\"","review":"Why did Mr. Bryson write this book? Was it to discourage people from traveling in Europe? He is disappointed at every stop he makes - perhaps had he planned a little better, that would not have been the case. In addition, Mr. Bryson forgets that he is a tourist and that people actually live their lives in the places he visits - they do not live there to accomodate tourists or Mr. Bryson. Do yourself a favor - don't buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a \\"tour\\" de force!","review":"I'm not much of a traveller, but this book is one of the most delightful romps I've ever been on. Bryson is not only a very funny guy, he has a keen eye for detail, especially the traits that make us all human in our own particular, regional way. I've already started another Bryson book."},{"rating":"2","title":"More funny travel stories from Bryson","review":"Bryson brings his characteristic humor to his explorations of Europe. While his observations can sometimes be a bit mean-spirited, he also pokes fun at himself, and many of his observations are quite funny, if clearly exaggerated. Starting in the artic north of Norway, and continuing in a zigzag pattern across the continent, Bryson explores many of the most famous of Europe's cities, as well as some more obscure locals. While he notes the changes in Sofia that occurred after his visit, his descriptions of Yugoslavia are even more dated (starting with the fact that Yugoslavia doesn't exist anymore!). Fans of Bryson's humor won't be disappointed, but if you're looking for a guide to traveling in Europe, this probably won't be your best resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly American on the loose","review":"Loved 'Walk in the Woods' so I bought all BB's work. I finished this one thinking BB is kind of a jerk. I am a long-time resident of Yer-up and his methods are cringe-inducing. To wit: BB never seems to reserve hotel rooms, planes or trains, yet feels the locals should see his crises as theirs. He never speaks any of the local language, yet is mystified at being misunderstood. And toward the end, BB declares that, alas, he must work his way home to the UK because his \\"long-suffering wife is on her semi-annual pregnancy.\\" Ooooh! I'm surprised she didn't change the locks as our buddy Bill pranced around Europe on a protracted midlife-crisis tour."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Xenophobic Traveler's Story","review":"I have enjoyed several of Bryson's books in the past so finally got around to this tour of Europe; I'm sorry I did. This is like one man's mid-life crisis dream of re-living an adolescent fantasy journey, with little real thought about the people in the places he visits. Sources for drink--often LOTS of drink--and the occasional museum are the primary focus of his entire journey, and the xenophobic comments that pass for humor here get very old very quickly.Probably the saddest part of the entire book was being reminded that less than 20 years ago, he could visit Sarajevo and watch families playing quietly in a park. For anyone like me who is just now considering reading this, don't. There are far better, more current travel books and far better Bryson books out there, so do yourself a favor and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither Good Nor Worth It! Truly Awful","review":"I was totally dissappointed that the author of so many wonderful and compelling travelling stories could produce such a blatantly offensive novel. Neither Here Nor There is nothing more than a rambling, stereotypical take on Europe and its people. Absent is any of the charm, wit, and carefully constructed observations of people and places that are the hallmarks of his other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"travels in europe","review":"fantastic book...very funny, history facts intertwined throughout...well written. made me want to go back to europe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"That book is dangerous!","review":"I bought Bryson's book while idling in Heathrow, waiting for my plane to Nice. I started reading it soon after boarding. Trouble began when I started laughing out loud. The plane was maybe 1/3 full in business class (where I sat), and I tried to keep my guffaws down, but could not. I had to stop reading when I started getting strange looks from fellow passengers and the flight attendants. So, I have a warning for anyone buying this book: don't read it in public. Read it in quiet places where noone can see or hear you! Being Belgian myself, and having lived in Luxemburg and France, and been to many of the places he mentions, I can tell that he hits the mark on more than one occasion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"Sure he's kind of funny, but this book was more frustrating than rewarding for me. Bryson here seems to be extraordinarily ethnocentric and much of the humor is from looking down on other cultures. He offers observations but no real insight and is more like a spoiled kid on a trip than a travel writer. I did learn one good thing about the bizarre Capuchin Monk tomb in Rome, other than that the book was a waste. I abandoned it in a foreign hotel room- not even worth carrying home to the used bookstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I've been through in Europe!","review":"I couldn't stop laughing while reading this book after a day-long meeting, back in my hotel room in England. I have travelled to Europe at least once a year, sometimes for business, most for holidays, for the past 10 years. The author's experiences, and impressions, of Europe match mine exactly. This book is a wonderful memoir for anyone who has travelled to Europe on a self-guided tour; it will remind them of what they've seen and done there. It is definitely not a travel \\"guide\\" book for people who intend to use the book for planning their trips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Numbingly unfunny","review":"About as unfunny a book as I've read recently. Bryson's attempt to force a funny expression into every other sentence makes the experience of reading this akin to spending a few hours with a hack comedian who's trying out his new material on you. I found the humor forced, smug, and really pretty mean spirited...unless you like petty jabs at the expense of the overweight and acne-scarred, and tired sterotypes about Germans, Swiss, etc., leave this title on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"He Shoulda Stayed Home","review":"I loved Bryson's book about Britain but this and his book about America just fall flat. The US book confirmed that following American interstates is dull as dirt, but hey, I already knew that. The Europe book skates around the Continent combining a lack of depth and humor in a deadly fashion. It's not bad; it's just that I suspect that Bill Bryson is really funny for one book and then he wears thin. Perhaps, however, the Britain book is great because he knows the foibles of his subject well, but sashaying around Europe gives him just enough time to do a few snap judgements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a balanced view of Europe: 19 out 22 Chapters are on Western Europe","review":"PROS:- Bryson's writing style is fluid and funny.- Good coverage of Western Europe: 19 out of 22 chapters are on it.CONS:- The subtitle of the book is, \\"Travels in Europe\\", but it should have been called \\"Travels in Western Europe\\" since that's where 90% of the book takes place.- Bryson has minimal interaction with Europeans, only interacting with the locals briefly, even though he traveled alone. He seems to travel with his guidebook in hand, looking at buildings, but not really spending much time getting to know the people. Part of that probably is that he doesn't speak a foreign language well.- Not terribly informative.CONCLUSION: Don't expect to learn that much about Europe, but do expect to laugh out loud. If those are your expectations, then you will love this book. I gave it 4 stars because it was so funny, so entertaining, that it overcame the flaws I listed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny","review":"When Bill Bryson was in his twenties he went on a trip to Europe. It was for him a liberating experiance despite spending his time with a friend called Katz.This book is about another trip that he goes on through Europe after he has worked in England for some years as a journalist. He starts of in Norway and travels through Europe to Istanbul.Bryson is partially a travel writer, partially a story teller. His books are largely a starting point to have a talk. That can be about his childhood, his German teacher or his belief in the arrogance of French people. This book is actually a laugh out loud type of book. I first read it some years ago, but on re-reading it recently the jokes were just as funny and one actually breaks into laughter reading it.The book is short and can be read quickly but it is worth every penny you pay for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story!","review":"I started this book thinking that probably it would be a bit over dramatic and sentimental since it was written by the son. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is dramatic, but in a way that places you right in that village, fighting alongside the village people, outraged and helpless. It is sentimental. Gage paints vivid characters you feel as if you've met. An amazing and heart-rending story. A well-written and interesting history. A piece of Communist injustice. Definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was no Con Air","review":"I'm generally not into reading, but I decided that I would give this one a shot, expecting it to be as good as Face/Off. Boy was I mistaken. Cage should stick to acting. Do you remember in Snake Eyes when he punched that guy in the face? Do you remember in Boy in Blue when he punched that guy in the face? I enjoyed those moments more than I enjoyed reading Cage's book, or reading anything for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrifying and Touching","review":"Nicholas Gage (Nicola Gatzoyiannis)wrote a book that was both terrifying and touching. It was terrifying because it exposed the brutality of Communism and touching because it told of a woman's undying love for her children, especially the boy who would one day pay tribute to her. The descriptions of torture Eleni and fellow villagers endured at the hands of the ELAS/DAG were some of the most horrifying things I've ever read. The scene where Eleni tells her son, Nicola, to be brave and gives him a gift of a cross is one of the most touching scenes of family love I've ever read about. This story is a must-read for everyone. It is both instructive about the moral degradation caused by Communism and about the courage of a family. Also read Nicholas Gage's followup, \\"A Place for Us: Eleni's Children in America,\\" which chronicles events leading up to Gage's life today. Excellent writer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review on Eleni","review":"This is an amazing book. It is full of Greek history during WWII and the aftermath thereof. The author does a very good job combining the country's history with his own personal history. I recommend this book to everyone I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad Tale of Many That Happened to the Greeks by both Germans and Turkish","review":"I'm Greek-American and read that book in about 2 days, with little sleep. The movie was horrible. Gage is an excellent writer, always has been. The schism between the children and father was common for that generation, since the fathers came to the US to begin busnesses and build a life here so they could have their families with them. My paternal pappou came, but in the early 1900's, and was very successful. He and his brothers all got out before WW II and more Turkish slaughters.Gage is very open about the feelings for his father since, as in many Greek families, the \\"mana and yia yia\\", were everything. The father was an anonymous figure far away. It was the women who were the strong ones at that time... they had to protect hearth, home, and teach the Greek way of life. Their roles were all-encompassing and the execution of Gage's mother, which couldn't even be truly adknowledged properly, out of fear, shaped his entire life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable","review":"A very touching and human account that stays with you long after you've read the book. Comparing it to previous books by Nicholas Gage it's clear that he put everything he had into this. The description of the gripping events that occur throughout the story somehow moves the reader to evaluate his own feelings and motives."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredibly moving chronicle of injustice and suffering.","review":"I cannot remember reading a story with greater emotional impact. The actions of the guerillas and reactions of the people of Lia - given my age and upbringing here in Canada - are not something I am easily able to comprehend. Nicholas Gage must have to deal with feelings of rage which at times must seem overwhelming. I recommend this book highly. As is always the case, it is much better than the movie, although, Kate Nelligan did a good job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the most powerful books in the English language","review":"This is an enormously powerful book, among the most powerful written in the English language. To find its full equal in force, drama, and dark energy one must hark back to the greatest of Greek tragedies. Although a cruel death is at the center of this story, there is much in it about life, and why it is lived.

He said that a bad marriage can be up to a thousand times worse than no marriage at all. He says that it is wrong to get married solely just to get married. Although he said that he is a big believer in marriage, he said that he knows lots of single psychologically healthy people who are happy in being single. He points out that you can take control of your dating life, so that you don't ever need to let a doomed relationship go beyond several dates. When a relationship goes on for so long, so much bonding occurs that breaking up becomes extremely painful. He says that there is nothing wrong per se for a couple that have a platonic friendship between each other to date for an extended period as long as they're honest about it and upfront with each other in the beginning. Words of wisdom are in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very honest....","review":"This book is a very honest look at yourself .... you must be honest- totally honest with yourself first in order to make any decision regarding a relationship with someone else. This really is the basis of building a relationship with another. You have to be accountable for yourself in all aspects of your life, emotionally, physically, mentally, spiritually and then you can make good choices and decisions for yourself. I know there are no guarantees in life but guidelines and our own intuition can help us along the way to be stronger and make better choices for ourselves. Always go into a relationship with no expectations... know who YOU are... but no expectations.. and see what transpires. ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title of the book should be How to Use eHarmony","review":"I found reading this book to be a waste of time. It's a very light book and can be read cover to cover in an hour or two. The whole book reads like an ad for eHarmony. Everything in this book is geared toward how to fill out your profile on eHarmony. Just like most online dating sites, this book makes date/mate selection sound like your shopping for a new car.

Not really a big deal, but Coby said I had to pay postage in and back to have it replaced! 2ndly and more importantly, the reception is awful--Almost shockingly I can't receive ANY radio stations (AM or FM) in Chicago and only a couple in Minneapolis, among others. I'd have more luck trying to tune in radio stations with my teeth wearing tin foil on my head. If it is a faulty unit, I will never know--the company wants me to again pay postage in and back to get a new one, though under warranty.

I received this radio today and it has a pretty decent reception both FM and AM, actually better than my old Sony which I bought for $35 (very disappointed). I live in Oakland, CA and work in Novato, CA. I've tested both places. Since Novato is a bit furture away from San Francisco area, the reception is a bit weak especially when I got inside the building, however, it works great when I tried it in Oakland (which closer to San Francisco) I got pretty good signal from both FM/AM in and outside the building. The head phone that comes w/ the unit is so so.

This one's features looked great. I had good luck with Coby products in the past but this model was a letdown. It was a bit bigger than I hoped. The digital tuning feature works good but it's a little too battery hungry for my taste. A BIG drawback I see though is that the print labeling on the soft touch-pad type controls started to wear off within 2 weeks of (not heavy) use. For the money, look elsewhere.

Save your money -- don't buy it.","review":"There's not much more I can add to that, except to provide some details. Principally, it it can't provide a clear signal for powerful stations in Boston. For instance, WGBH is has such a good signal that you can get it 50 miles away in your car, but right here in town, the Coby can barely pick it up, and if you run by a building, the signal fuzzes out. Most annoyingly, the Coby randomly switches bands on its own so that for instance you'll have it set on WGBH (89.7), and it will just switch you to 89.6, again causing the signal to deteriorate. It's pretty much the worst radio I've ever encountered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible purchase","review":"I bought this little radio because the gym that I go to broadcasts their TV channels over FM radio, so I just wanted a simple radio with an FM tuner - nothing fancy. This device didn't even meet those standards, which I thought were pretty low to begin with. I have used this less than 20 times and have already had to replace the batteries once, and it's to the point where I can't read the display at all so I have no idea what station I'm listening to. The only time I can read the display is when it's turned off. I consider myself to be pretty decent when it comes to programming devices (VCRs, TVs, clocks, etc) but I really couldn't figure out how to set the memory channels. I will be throwing this away today because I'm absolutely tired of fighting with this thing. Don't buy. Spend $5 more and get something that's worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tuning fails when it gets warm","review":"I was happy with it initially, but the tuning started to go out intermittently. I discovered that tuning problem was due to the unit getting warm. This is a serious design flaw since the unit is black and gets warm in the sun. Being a \\"sport\\" device, it should be able to function outdoors."},{"rating":"1","title":"AM has no reception.","review":"I purchased this item to listen to the game on AM while at the gym. I was not able to get the local station to come in at the gym or at home. I tried while camping as well. I was not able to get any AM stations to come in anywhere. The FM side seemed to work great, but that is not what I bought it for. Other negative points are that you have to scan through all 10 preset to find the one you want, the volume is a little loud on the lowest setting, and the arm band is a little goofy at first to figure out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot","review":"There are a number of problems with this radio. It's as if someone just slapped this together without any fore thought. For instance, the arm band has all the velcro on the same side. This means that when you wrap it around your arm, you have to twist it, or you end up with velcro on a smooth surface. My main problem is with the controls. In order to change channels, you have to cycle through the whole 10 presets in order. In other words, if you're on channel 2, and want to get to channel 1, you have to go from 3 through 10, and then to one. There is a button for the band, and you can just switch between the same two AM and FM channels, but if you listen to more than two, it takes an effort. If you're jogging or bicycling, it takes away from the fun. The sound isn't too bad, but nothing to write home about."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless armband","review":"The radio works fine, but the armband is worthless.

I figured, despite the criticisms I read here, that it would be good enough for my purposes. It isn't.My gym broadcasts on three channels. This unit picks up only one of these and it receives it over a wide range of its different digital channels. I'm still using it as the sound is okay and the one channel it gets is useful for me, I guess, but I am basically shocked that the product is as poor and ineffective as it has turned out to be. I've also found the arm band to be completely useless. It's not strong enough to hold onto my arm. If you tried to make a bad product, this would be it.It's not a good value at any price.

To my disappointment FM had the same problem. If you're standing still it works fairly well, but walking or jogging will drive one insane. The radio size is a bit on the large side and the strap would possibly fit better if I had a larger arm diameter.

It looks more like a blade you would expect for a jig saw but with the half inch shank to fit a Sawsall. It would allow you to do some jig saw jobs with a Sawsall.

I've liked her earlier albums and I like her voice; it's a nice change in a music genre that often seems to idealize baby-voiced vocalists like Emmylou Harris, Nanci Griffith, and Iris DeMent (all of whom are fine singers, of course, but it's unusual to hear a female singer with Williams' deep, husky, voice).I found this album musically monotonous. Really monotonous. Like, sleep-inducing. I could chalk that up to personal taste and forgive it if more of the songs had lyrics that were interesting or meaningful beyond fairly standard pop fare. Too many of these, as much as I hate to think it, were warmed-over rhymes and old themes with no new insight.Get Car Wheels instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Lucinda Williams CD!!!!","review":"There have already been plenty of reviews, I just want to say, this is a great cd.

Vocally there isn't a lot different than Willaims has ever done. Musically, she or her producer, Hal Willner, has taken a few positive strides.I do agree with others the lead-off track is one of the weakest on this disk. The repetativeness is completely distracting and not worthy of Willams' talents. Ditto w/\\"Mama You Sweet\\".The strongest tracks are by far \\"Unsuffer Me\\", \\"Where is My Love\\", \\"Rescue\\", \\"What If\\" and \\"Wrap My Head Around It\\". Especially the strings on \\"Unsuffer Me\\" and the guitar on \\"Where is My Love\\" really make the songs. They are subtle yet make all the difference.I do like \\"Fancy Funeral\\", though it is a little down...even for me. \\"Come On\\" starts really good, but it doesn't really go anywhere.The good thing is, the rest of the songs are perfectly serviceable. Nothing outstanding, but nothing making me hit the 'skip' button like I did with 'World Without Tears'."},{"rating":"1","title":"a big disappointment","review":"Pretty much a big disappointment. Anyone of these songs would be the worst if included on Car Wheels. This album is not nearly as bleak as it has been made out to be in the reviews and not nearly as good. Come On and What If (the music of which is clearly inspired by Cortez the Killer, which you can sing right over top of her lyrics) are certainly two of the weakest songs she has written; they are borderline unlistenable with horrible lyrics.

I will continue to buy all her albums anyway, I think she is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lu continues to please","review":"The latest offering by Lucinda Williams, while somewhat different than the two previous studio efforts, is tremendous. Working with a new producer and the ubiquitous use of strings gives a different feel to West, but the vintage Lu we have come to know and love is still ever-present, ever pulling on our emotions, ever pleasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning To Live, Over and Over","review":"A sprawling yet deeply personal piece of American writing - wistful, angry and consolatory in equal measure; aptly titled and performed.

That is, there are none! It's one funeral dirge after another. Secondly, there seems little to no melody present. The songs are recited rather than sung because there's just no tune there (I'm aware the demo vocal parts were used). Third, whereas Lucinda's music was once infused with country, blues, and a most-definite \\"Southern\\" sound, this disc sounds stripped of any personality whatsoever. Finally, what is it with these songs where she repeats the title 122 times? And, yet another rap? Major disappointment this one is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget this one","review":"I'm a big fan of Lucinda Williams, and have several other cd's of hers, including Car Wheels On a Gravel Road and World Without Tears, but I regret getting this one, and won't listen to it again.The lyrics are repetitive and simplistic, the melodies have a boring sameness about them, and it's far from her best work.Let's hope for better next time. She's shown she's capable of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"William's West: Hot and cold","review":"When Lucinda truly sinks her teeth into a song there are none better. And there are two or three cuts on this latest effort in which she revels in her \\"Lucindaness\\". On the other hand, she seems to just go through the motions at times and there are examples of that on this CD also. But the production quality is superb and the guitar work by Doug Pettibone and Bill Frisell is worthy of William's vocals and then some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucinda's best","review":"At the top of her game, really. I have all of her albums, and have been a Lucinda-listenner for years.

I have never read clearer explanations than in this book about the Michelson-Morley experiements, or the Double-Slit experiment, or Bohr's atom, or finally, the concept of non-locality. If you are a fan of Michio Kaku, or John Gribbin, or Brian Greene, et. al., and if you are patient and work hard, you will love this book. But the authors, unlike Gribbin and Greene, do unfortunatly use the proverbial turgid prose. They never use a one-syllable word when a four syllable word will do. They would be an English teacher's nightmare. I could easily see them describing a \\"cow\\" as a \\"lactating bovine mammal.\\" In the end, though, their ability to teach is so strong, their exposition (if not their prose) is so clear, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clear and detailed account of quantum entanglement as the building block of all consciousness and the material world","review":"This book describes the new physics of quantum entanglement and how human consciousness can emerge along with the natural world from the indefinite existence of quantum particles. The intimate collective of all life on earth is described and how evolution proceeds more from cooperation than from competition. The book ends with a description of the danger faced by the environment from pollution. The magician can come to understand how her/his own consciousness is integrated in the totality of life on earth, the collective of human experience, and the fabric of spacetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful","review":"In the absence of a close-ended, conclusive (and ultimately supersymmetric), causal proof of the existence of matter independent of the consciousness which would (and is trying to) observe it, it seems premature to presuppose there is one: yet this is the presupposition that has remained absent of proof. Why? The non-existence of matter a priori, fills in the \\"explanatory gap\\" and parts company with the Freudian paradigm. Recent research from an interdepartmental centre in a Roman university also demonstrates new experimental evidence for (non-)locality and quantum theory. For anyone more interested in truth-finding than truth-seeking, \\"The End of Time\\" by Julian Barbour (typo corrected paperback from amazon in the UK), and \\"The End of Science\\" by John Horgan are a pair that come to mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"The new age \\"epistemology\\" and ...","review":"...This book should be titled \\"Alice in the land of misinformation\\" ... or .. \\"Tao of Sentimental Physics\\"Just another bad science book for artisans and paisans ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been way much better.","review":"I bought the first Now Dvd when it came out in 2003 and found it ok so I bought this one and honestly, just have few good videos.I think that the best videos are: No Doubt \\"IT'S MY LIFE\\", Good Charlote \\"HOLD ON\\", Christina Millian \\"DIP IT LOW\\", Black Eyed Peas \\"HEY MAMA\\", Chingy with Ludacris & Snoop Dogg \\"HOLIDAE IN\\", Jessica Simpson \\"WITH YOU\\" and Norah Jones \\"SUNRISE\\".

This album doesnt sound rushed and the songs are totally suited to the artist. My fav songs on the album are : Alive (the best winners single i've heard from all the countrys \\"idols\\"), Speechless and Ordinary Girl. All the others are awesome as well...

The ending is a real let down and what little plot you can fathom seems to come to nothing.Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sword of Doom - Ho Hum at Best","review":"I should have paid more attention to Erick Husher \\"The Serat\\"'s review and left this one sitting on the shelf. All of the the excellent reviews lulled me to a false sense of security and I foolishly wasted my money and my time. What other's consider artistic and stylisic I considered boring and uncomprehensible.Even the opening scene where the much reviled Tsukue Rynosuke, rogue ronin, kills an old man on pilgrimmage with his granddaughter was misrepresented in the reviews. For pete's sake, the ronin overheard and answered the old man's prayer, he didn't wantonly kill the old guy. Think of it as Kevorkian ronin.Some of the swordplay was good and the black and white photography was all right but the movie never really works. This ronin was supposed to be evil and without conscience yet ends up driven insane by the ghosts of those he has murdered. I am of the opinion that you either have a conscience or you don't. It can't be both ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sword of Boredom","review":"The fights are weak. The story is confusing. If you are amazed by the subtle footwork of warring swordsmen, then this is your film. If you are looking for the Lone Wolf and Cub-type of film, RUN AWAY!!!! The ending is no where near the payoff it should be for having to sit through brooding Japanese subtext of emotional conflict. The protagonist has the potential to be one of the best on film but his stone face lulls me into submission. No wonder he wins all of his fights: he stuns his opponents with tedium. 2 stars are for the ending. If you are an art-house goon, you'll drool over this drab dribble."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's certainly not cutting edge ...","review":"I ordered it because of a comment in the New York Times about one fight scene filmed along a narrow path.

The guy is a horrible fighter that doesn't know how to use the sword properly. The director should concern high level of movie watchers. The director might cheat some viewers, but not some sword experts like myself. In my point of view as a sword expert, the main chracter is horrible. He ruined the whole movie. I think a reviewer well pointed out how the main character could not fit properly in this samurai movie. Horrible main character."},{"rating":"2","title":"After watching this film, you'll be saying, \\"Huh?\\"","review":"This film has a lot going on, so you really need to pay attention. Still, no matter how much you concentrate, nothing is going to make the last 15 minutes any easier to bear. An intricate plot begins to unwind. Mass confusion that you just KNOW is going to have a satisfying conclusion. Instead, there's a freeze-frame ending that you expect will be followed by, \\"Tune in next week for the exciting conclusion!!\\" But it never happens. The film is over. Imagine Star Wars, when Luke and Darth are under attack by the Emperor...Darth lifts the Emperor over his head and throws him into the abyss. Now what would happen if the scene were re-written with a freeze-frame ending at the point where Darth picks up the Emperor?? Picture that sort of ending, and you've got a good idea what \\"Sword of Doom\\" is like. It would be a brilliant cliff-hanger, but the reality is that there's no Sword of Doom Part II."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read what I have to say before buying this movie.","review":"I saw this movie a few years ago.

However, I was disappointed to find this map has marginal updates. My home address in a subdivision that is 5+ years old is still not available on the map. Mapquest, Google, even Tomtom all have my street address but not Garmin.Likewise, points of interest that have been around 1 to 2 years were not always found. Again, I checked a 2010 Tomtom GPS and it had the hotels, restaurants I was looking for. With the price of GPS' dropping fast and Garmins lack of most current updates, I probably avoid buying updates from Garmin again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Maps","review":"Using this product probably could not be more simple, all you really have to do is plug it in. After doing so I was finding Geocaches faster than before and was confident to travel places unknown afore. Not only does this card unlock new details on top of the basemap but many more features I had no idea my Garmin Colorado could do. Bought it from Amazon because they are trusted and only a few bucks off the best price I found on the net. If you have a Colorado I highly recommend this product. I didn't give 5 stars because the maps certainly are not flawless but come close I suppose. My one negative; and this is being very selective shall we say, is because a couple days ago coming back from a hike I called up the nearest gas station and the map was 0.15 mile off."},{"rating":"2","title":"the City Navigater N.

Now I only use my TomTom for long trips in the car. I use my Oregon for everything else. I never even pull out the other GPS for Geocaching. Could not be easier to install and use.

Sure, there's only so much that be covered in this short amount of time, but they do a good job of covering the basics, and if someone watches this disc a couple times, their photos should improve noticeably.He only covers baseball and football in depth, but the tips for these two sports can be used for almost any outdoor sporting event. The author goes to great lengths to emphasize that the shots shown therein are NOT taken with pro-level gear, but I would have liked a little something in there showing \\"what's next\\" for shooters who might wonder what an increase in equipment capability might bring.This is a pretty good overview, and I'd not hesitate suggesting new shooters view this DVD.

That is, until you heard that voice coming out of the past to chill you to the marrow with her heart-rendering versions of some very classic country and crossover ballads. For those of us who came of age in the late 1950's or early 1960's this was the music at the high school dance where you got to ask that guy or girl that you had your eye on for that slow dance that gave you time to talk and feel out the situation. Thanks, Patsy. This volume contains so many classics it is hard to know where to begin but I counted at least 15 that you ABSOLUTELY need to listen to. That, my friends, rather says it all. Classic Hank Willaims tunes like Cheating Heart, Willie Nelson's Crazy, others like Why's He Not You and She's Got Him. Wow.

I found the scene with him and Sunchaser in the future at the ruins of Chaco Canyon to be some of the most powerfull writing they have done so far. The Spirals crying out for WolfDreamer to save them and now knowing what became of Green Ash's(People of the River) son Born of Water was gutwrenching. You can relate to the panic the people must have been feeling watching their world change before their eyes, having mammoths drown themselves and forgetting what some animals looked like must have been unsettling to them. It also dosen't help that their best Dreamer has lost his way to the One and has fallen for a hunted woman.

Actually I own 3 Hanson-Roberts decks. 2 original size, and a small pocket size. Although Hanson-Roberts comes in a smaller size than most tarot decks, it does make it easier to shuffle. And the smallest size is just as dynamic. The readings are right on target. I also own the two books, the Companion book and Tarot Unveiled. Both were helpful in the beginning of my studies. Quoted from Tarot Unveiled \\"The cards in this deck have a certain magical and enchanted quality that many people find appealing. Its images are also faithful to traditional tarot symbolism. \\" I love the coloring of this deck, not as stoic as other decks, and not so frightening. A great deck for anyone new to tarot. My only negative about this card deck, it could have been a little larger, but then, it wouldn't be Hanson-Roberts. Would it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for beginners","review":"I really loved this deck when I first got it, but as I learned more about the tarot, it got a little to fluffy for my taste.

However, it's a little bit too cute at times, with the round-faced, red-cheeked people smiling in so many of the cards. I use it quite a bit for readings for people who aren't familiar with tarot, because it's approachable and friendly-looking, but it has a tendency to sugarcoat the serious stuff. It's great for teaching someone to read tarot, because it's so unassuming, but to read for myself, I almost never use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Deck","review":"This deck is the first I have owned.

This deck is stunning, fantastic, and aesthetically nearly perfect. The artwork reached right up and grabbed me by the throat. The only problem I saw with it is that it's really a general rehash of the Rider-Waite deck. If you know a younger person who is interested in the tarot, and has never read it before, by all means, send this one their way. If you've been reading the tarot for awhile, and have a R-W deck, skip it. There's enough originality in the art to make it pretty, but not enough new symbolism to make it worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I'm A huge fan of guitar music, with maybe 100 Guitar CD's/DVD's in my collection...

All hail the great individual Alobar and his gallavanting wife Kudra. And no doubt the great Pan and Bunny LeFever. Basically, this book is for anyone at all who likes having things set before them a different way--it poses some really interesting questions.(I.e.--CAN one refer to curtains as 'drapes'?

Examining his bibliography on a time-line, with the exception of \\"Skinny Legs And All\\" (and I'd bet money he'd written it or at least had a good outline somewhat before its published date), everything from Jitterbug Perfume to the most recent excrescence seems to be the masturbatory fantasy of an increasingly bizarre and pitiable personality attempting to hold on to some vestige of youth in the typical way of dirty old men chasing after sweet young girls, only he does it on the page rather than (or perhaps in addition to) real life.This novel, this very one, is the mark of when Tom Robbins jumped the shark. (I typeoed 'humped' and almost left it that way, as it seems rather fitting.) I'm disappointed. Robbins' earlier works are like opening your mind with a rusty can opener. His later ones are just embarassing to read.

It also jumps around from paris to Seattle, to New Orleans and anciend what i think is rome or greece or england or ireland. IT jumps so much that it leaves you the reader in the dust.

A plot that jumps around like a jitterbug with connection besides this obscure beet...i just didn't get it and couldn't take anymore of it. I tried to muschle through a few chapters hoping for some glimmer of light that would be able to carry me to the end...nope, nothing.

Some of his later stuff (Fierce Invalids from Hot Climates, Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas) fails to recapture the early magic. Or maybe I'm just getting to old for this.

What better way to eternal life than Kudra and Al's.Perhaps my favorite part in the book, which I have read several times (I buy used copies and give them to anyone who will take one)is at the dock where the ferryman sends people one way or the other.

Weaving his way through the ages, following the characters as they change before your eyes, and examining the grisly wonder of death, Tom Robbins is at his best. I appreciate all of his books, so there is no surprise that I liked this as well. What was surprising was the immediate urge to re-read, rare in this reader.

This book rejuvenated my amazement with this author. Tom Robbins' writing is descriptive in a playful, humorous manner. I can only compare his plots to an episode of Seinfield, where all characters start out in very different places and then end up all together in the end. And none of it seems like a stretch.

Robbins is a master at putting words together in beautiful, evocative ways. The story is classic Tom Robbins: a wild, epic adventure featuring an Indian woman escaping self sacrifice before hooking up with a former king also escaping death. Among the guest stars are Timothy Leary (aka Wiggs Dannyboy) and the Greek god Pan. But as anyone who ever read any of his novels, the story is secondary.

I felt like I was reading something by a high school student who had just taken a comparative religion course and wanted to show off. Preciously clever, no real character development, club-you-over-the-head pseudo-philosophy, and completely unsubtle sex & innuendo.

I think you have to have an IQ of about 70 in order for that to happen.He has the same cutesy prose as Dennis Fariña, who only got published because he knew the right people. TR writes about sex like a creepy, impotent old man. You know, like Robert Heinlein.At least Heinlein's female characters have talents other than (....). AND his stories are cool.

Amid the baronial flourishes of Robbins' would-be masterpiece, full of its vulgarian panache, its droll boorishness, its self-styled rule-flouting, its delightful miscegenation of puns and philosophy, yes, despite it all, the reader is moved to occasionally snicker, roll her eyes, yawn, or become willing suppliant to the cult of clock watchers to gain egress from the author's intermittent sputters of mental flatulence. In short, Robbins is too enamored of himself, too interested in slaloming through his own cleverness, to meet the demands of this sinuous narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"More words than a dictionary","review":"I'm not even going to get into the story.

An unorthodox way of reading a \\"not put downable\\" book, but such is the nature of this momentous book.Jitterbug Perfume is a benchmark in contemporary writing, defining an era.

I'm glad I stuck with it! Robbins has this incredible writing style that combines well written prose with clever similes and metaphors. Just like David Letterman, he will be writing something serious and out of the blue he'll throw in something that adds a decidedly comedic mood. So it's not an easy read, but extremely enjoyable.On of the most refreshing things about the book is the way that Robbins will be writing about ancient times, and driving his points home with modern and humorous images. He was \\"shaking like the shuttle in an overachiever's loom\\" or \\"The Middle Ages hangs over history's belt like a beer belly.\\" I don't know if everybody would appreciate this kind of writing, but I loved it.

I highly recommend Jitterbug Perfume for people who want to be entertained, intellectually stimulated, and inspired.

To say much more about this completely absorbing, complex but understandable tale would be doing a disservice to the would-be reader. This is a story where the less preconceived notions one has about it, the better. It is a rapturous fable of flowers, scent, humanity, our fear of dying, lust and beauty.

In this book, Andy tries to uncover this man, and finds a lot more than he had bargained for.I recommend this book to other readers because it is very descriptive, and it is very cliffhanging. Also, Wolf Rider is addicting, so you can't stop reading it. I liked this book because it is realistic enough for you to feel like you know the character really well. A reason why I didn't like this book, is because the main character, Andy, received a phone call saying a man had just killed a girl, and absolutely nobody believed Andy. I think that at least one person should have believed him because it would have made the story a lot better.M. DanMrs. Bannon's Fifth Grade Class"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wolf Rider","review":"=) I thought that Wolf Rider was an exciting and thrilling book. Some parts of the book were a little boring, but I really enjoyed most of it. It always left me at the edge of my seat, waiting to see what could happen next. (A typical review.) That's something along the lines of how I felt. I was a really good book I must admit, and it did have a lot of cliff hangers. It begins by talking about a boy named Andy, and he gets a disturbing phone call, about a man, (ZEKE) telling Andy that he killed a girl named Nina. ZEKE also mentions that she attendes a college nearby, and Andy tries to find her. After many attempts of trying to convince her that she will be murdered, she still ignores Andy. Over all, if you like suspence and mysterious books, you should read Wolf Rider. =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATED IT!!!","review":"ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS... THIS IS THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ.

That's what this book is about, Frankie and unique obsession with the radio. Frankie struggles with school and passes only with the help of his best friend, Mario. Spying on his teacher, plotting, and annoying his parents are his best qualities apart,of course, from listening to the radio. To find out how this mastermind works you will have to read the book just like me.This was a book I definitely couldn't put down. It had interesting characters,ones that I could relate to in real life,and was full of humor although it happened in the time period of World War II. The part I didn't like was when pages of the story dealt with the radio at the time that Frankie would be listening to,but other than that the book was very interesting, comical, and full of suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Read--Good for boys","review":"I felt that this book let me down. The beginning few pages were very intriguing and interesting; however, it took forever to come to a climax and actually accomplish anything.

This book is very addicting, a great thriller. Extremely hard to put down. It's about this young kid named Andy, he just moved in with his dad after his mother died. He got a phone call from this guy named Zeke one night. Zeke said he just killed someone. Nobody belives Andy, and he has no proof. But he is bound and determined to prove it is true, looking all over for help, and trying to find his own proof. It's not the most realistic book, but still is a book that keeps you on the end of chair, and on your tips of your toes. The cover or title didn't catch my eye. I wasn't going to read it until one day my reading teacher read a section to it to me. I continued it on my own, and I am glad. Must read great book.

Where to begin?","review":"The author tries to create a world where every adult and person of authority acts irrationaly; even the father of the protangonist does not believe his him, though the author tries to portray the son and his father as having a close relationship and responsibility to care for each other. We are given no proof as why none of the adults even listen to him. Does he have a record with the police concerning crank-calls? The answer is no. So why aren't the police in this book doing there job? The answer is the author never throughly thought this story through. This story play upon the paranoia of a teenager as being the outsider, the outcast, standing alone in the world, and trying to be a hero in the end. The funny thing about this book is the author tries to create a reality based world and fails miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wolf Rider","review":"I thought Wolf Rider was a fair book, but not a great book.

The author does a nice job of making the main character look and act like he is going crazy, but it might have been more believeable if ONE person would have believed him besides the \\"bad guy.\\" It was too black and white: either A) I believe you and want to kill you, or B) you're a jerk, stop talking about it, and you need professional help. The ending left me wanting MORE than what was given. I do not feel Andy, the main character, and his father ever reached an understanding for as long as the dad didn't believe him. The idea that they didn't talk about the \\"bad guy's\\" demise bothers me. The image of Andy going away on a plane, and his father weeping over a cuff link... what was that about?

I praise Ann for her courage in escaping the only life in which she was raised and had known and deciding on her own beliefs. She was obviously very traumatized by the whole ordeal. Every sentence spews a bitter hatred not only for polygamy but for the whole religion and supporters. I don't believe her account of events is very accurate.

After admitting to himself that his lifelong devotion has left him unsatisfied, he observes the love of his son for his young wife and is deeply moved. He ultimately finds that he must uphold the redemptive value of love (whether of a man for his wife, a father for a son, or a friend for a friend), even against overwhelming odds. The samurai's defense of the meaning of life that he has found culminates with three of the most spectacular and dramatic action sequences I have ever seen in a film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mifune at his Best","review":"Samurai Rebellion (a bad translation to appeal to western chambara fans)bears a lot in common with Kobayashi's other masterpiece Hara Kiri. As Donald Richie notes, Hara Kiri is one of the best anti-Samurai films ever made, because like all of Kobayashi's films he deals with the individual vs the establishment, in this case, the Tokugawa Shogunate.Samurai Rebellion attacks the shogunate at it's prime in 1727. And the individual is Isaburo Sasahara, played by Mifune Toshiro, in one of his best roles in his long career. His performance is understated and builds until the bloody end. Kato and Tsukasa also deliver intense and multifaceted performances. Nakadai, the star of Hara Kiri, puts in a good performance with his distinctive voice.I think it is a mistake to think of this film as a Samurai action picture but instead it is a family drama and the three main characters are a paragon of true Bushido in the face of a cruel and vain bureaucracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"Did not contain the CD recording as advertised.

I am and have been a huge fan of the pk's for as long as I can remember. They were my first cd purchase as a youth and I've seen them live many times. I awaited this cd anxiously. I am very happy with it, the songs are fun, creative and have great beats like most of their stuff. The lyrics are phenomenal and it seems to be a very personal album. The only thing missing are the classic, slow, ballads that Gerald and the crew do so well. I was left waiting after all the songs for that one ballad, and it was not to be found. So don't go looking for a mellow pk's cd, this is an up beat, great for driving album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good classic","review":"I purchased this game when it came out new, then again as something to pass around on deployment.

Courtenay is every bit Finney's equal as Norman, the actor's intensely loyal, long-suffering \\"dresser,\\" and the only person who can get \\"Sir\\" onstage for each performance. The gifted Eileen Atkins also resonates as Madge, the company's spinsterish stage manager whose quiet love for \\"Sir' has always competed with Norman's.

And who cares that Meg isn't the greatest drummer? She has very good rythem and is always on beat at all time with Jack. The Directing is wonderful for the use of the Super 8mm. The close ups on Jack shows you just how crazy Jack is when he plays and just how passionate Meg is when she is playing her drums. The band also has a great chemistry with the crowd as Jack and Meg thanks them after the show and gives the a little \\"God Bless.\\" The White Stripes are the saviors of rock and roll, and for that, that is why they are my FAVORITE band.Jack White= Robert Plant and Jimmy Page Combined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth having in your library","review":"I've never bought a concert on DVD before.

In a world of prepackaged, computer generated garbage that gets past off as \\"music\\", the White Stripes are proudly carrying the torch.The chemistry between Jack and Meg is amazing. I've never seen a band this much in synch since Led Zeppelin with John Bohnam. They literally can finish each other's sentences (musically speaking).If you've only heard the White Stripes on radio or CD, then get this DVD.

It comes thru that they do this because the LOVE it, not to be famous or to make money, blah blah blah - it's who they are. Buy this DVD and you will see what the love of THE MUSIC is all about.

This DVD captures much of the energy, spontaneity and enthusiasm that makes them so great on stage.As far as the sound quality goes, it leaves little to be desired. The film is shot on Super 8 AND 16mm (contrary to another reviewer's understanding) and may be a bit grainy for some.

This book will appeal to all who loved Mr. Darcy's character in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, yet it goes on beyond that classic in that the book contains a faith journey as well. There's the required ingredients that make a book a Regency--the clothing, the places--Carlton House, Vauxhall--Regency bucks and Prinny himself, but the ingredient of faith makes this book so much richer.

It is an almost exact imitation of the plot of \\"Arabella\\", one of Georgette Heyer's well-written, well-characterized novels. In that novel, Arabella achieves the conversion of the hero to goodness without rivers of tears and unbelieveable hours of prayer (as the soggy heroine of \\"Before the Season Ends\\" indulges in seemingly endlessly). I was annoyed by this book, and by its preachy premise. The laughable final surrender of the hero to God's Will through duelling with the country parson (who happened to be the most interesting character in this book)will leave you shaking your head over why you spent your time slogging through 400 pages of contrived, often depressing drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Enjoyment!","review":"I've never been drawn to Regency romances, but this book had me hooked from the first line. Full of unique, fully formed characters, Linore Rose Burkard has penned a novel that evokes thoughts of Jane Austen. I enjoyed reading about the customs of the time, the fun and pagentry of the Season, and the elaborate wardrobe it required. Most of all, I loved Ariana Forsythe and her earnest desire to seek God's will, even when she finds herself falling in love with a man who seems a questionable match.

This was not only long and unendurable, but completely unbelievable as a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Annoying","review":"The only reason I read this book was because I got it for free.

Don't waste your time!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Author Scam on reviews","review":"After you finish \\"Before the Season Ends\\" you will find a bribe from the author Linore Rose Burkard stating that a free book will be offered to those who give the book a 4 or 5 star review on Amazon. This is blatant hypocrisy especially as the author writes as if she is truly a Christian, not a cheat.The book itself was interesting, I enjoy the Regency period & am a fan of Georgette Heyer who wrote much better Regency novels.Burkard lacks the sense of humor that influenced Heyer, although she did try to be amusing at times. The ending - a foregone conclusion - was way too long and drawn-out.I would probably have given a 3 star review if it hadn't been for the author's offer of a \\"free book\\" bribe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasic read!","review":"This is a really wonderful story! I liked it very much even though I knew how Ariana's story with Mr. Mornay would end.

This is highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written, romantic and inspiring!","review":"Before the Season Ends is all a Regency romance should be. I picked it up simply to peruse the book and could not put it down. I found the storyline fresh and smart. Burkard crafts her characters masterfully. Even those peripheral to the story seem to come to life and step off the page. She immerses us so convincingly into the era that Regency becomes reality upon opening the book. The language is fantastic. Burkard effectively places the reader right in the center of the excitement and intrigue of a season in London. Finding a book of this quality with a Christian theme woven throughout the story is refreshing and inspiring. I highly recommend the book and am watching for more from this author.

Finished Badly","review":"I have nothing about Christian romances but this book is strictly for hard core fundamentalists. Having formerly been involved in that sphere of Christianity, I had no problems initially with this book and considered it a good read. However, about midway through the book it became tiresome and annoying. The heroine seems more suited to a life as a nun than as someone's wife, constantly praying over every... single... event in her life, so much so that I was skipping numerous pages at a time. Calling it preachy would be an understatement.To the author's credit, it is very well written and much more akin to Jane Austin books than today's romance novels. Societal decorum is followed to a much higher degree and it is squeaky clean in all aspects.If you are looking for a sermon, look no further but if you want a regency romance without a constant religious tome, keeping looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written romance","review":"It is nice to read Regency romance with clean writing and inspirational message. The descriptions are well done, and the plot moves along quickly without being rushed. While the storyline will seem impossible to some readers, the author does a good job of providing a heroine who stands for what she believes in spite of internal struggles and doubt.

The Christian theme is subtle and adds quite nicely to the story. However, the second half is far too preachy for me and I lost all sympathy with the protagonist as a result. It was also so drawn out that by the end I didn't even care whether she got married or not.The ending was also too predictable and not very believable. Like another reviewer, I had the feeling that one person wrote the first half and another person wrote the second half.Personally, during the second half I began to doubt whether I would ever really want to associate with the protagonist as her sermons on religion (and general attitude) became very distasteful to me.But anyway, in terms of the actual mechanics of the book, the second half dragged on for too long and the ending was both not very credible and very predictable.I won't be reading the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"minor flaws to a nice story","review":"If you enjoy reading Jane Austen you will likely enjoy this book. The characters were well developed and for the most part the story flowed well. My complaint is that there was too much time spent in Ariana's head. I grew tired of hearing her internal dialogue about the same issue. Easily fixed, skipped many sections when it felt tiresome and enjoyed the heart of the story.I felt the last part of the book needed more work. Imagine Mr. Darcy wagering his salvation in a fencing match. This was such a silly unessential part of the story which left me rolling my eyes.Still, I can easily recommend reading this book as I did enjoy it overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This book was a big disappointment. I purchased it for my Kindle after reading the great reviews. The main character seemed childish and I couldn't relate to her decisions, especially to her insistence upon marrying the rector who was her father's age. Philip Mornay seemed like a pathetic Mr. Darcy wannabe. He was misunderstood until he met Ariana and he tried to deny his growing attraction to her. I didn't like him and found it irritating how much emphasis he put on picking out Ariana's wardrobe. The entire book was extremely predictable and the few last-minute attempts at plot twists were over-dramatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Beginning/Boring Ending","review":"I don't really understand how this book has received so many 5 stars. This first half of the book I was really satisfied with; it was page turning--I couldn't wait for an other interaction between Ariana and Phillip and loved Aunt Bentley's little quirks; however, once you get about 70% into the book everything changes. It becomes about a quest for Mr. Moranay's salvation--so dire to Ariana, yet is not really pressed upon until this point in the novel. The first half of the book and the second half are arguably two different books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story!","review":"A delightful tale in a delightful time peroid. Not a dull moment is in this book. It will keep your interest. Ariana and Mornay are clearly a match but what of the differences of faith? Read it soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Absolutely wonderful!! I loved this book so much and the two books that followed. I could not wait to keep reading. Such a good and pure romance. Exactly the type of read I enjoy to the fullest! I would highly recommend this book to any young woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice read.","review":"I'm a guy and yep, a romantic--however, I don't usually read romance novels. I became acquainted with Lenore Rose Burkard through an online writing group. I wanted to see what kind of a writer she is so I picked out this novel not realizing it was her first. I was captured in the very beginning by the characters and the humor. I found it to be a very nice story and well-written. I'm attached to the characters and want to follow them. I will be reading her other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected jewel","review":"I found this as a free ebook on my Nook and as an avid Jane Austen fan, decided to give it a shot. I can't wait to see what else the author has in store for her readers! There are other authors that have tried writing Austen-eque novels, but I find them terribly lacking. I was genuinely impressed with this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Pride & Prejudice, you'll love this book!","review":"Well, I must say that this genre is not my typical style of book. I usually stick to mysteries and fantasies. But, since I love the book Pride & Prejudice, I thought I would give this book a try. I'll admit that it was better than my expectations and I can't wait to get my hands on any books to follow. Following Ariana's struggles with Mr. Mornay was an absolute delight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Before the Season Ends","review":"I very much enjoyed reading this book. I never got bored or lost interest. There was a little mystery, a little scandal, a little intrigue and romance. You fall in love with the characters and become immersed in the culture of the regency era. This book makes me want to go to a ball and deepen my Christian faith. I also liked the glossary and discussion questions at the end of the book. I wish there were many more books like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Christian Historical Fiction","review":"I really enjoyed this book! I had never read anything by this author before and I really liked her writing style.Ariana is sent to stay with her wealthy aunt for \\"the season\\" and makes her debut into society. Although he is off limits, Ariana cannot deny her attraction and growing feelings for Mr. Mornay. In addition to their differences in social and financial standings, Mr. Mornay does not share her faith in God. As the season goes on, it seems that Mr. Mornay, who never shows interest in any female, is showing unusual attention to Ariana.I felt like the last part of the story drug out a little unnecessarily, but overall, I loved this book and have already ordered the sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"This was a wonderful book! I have read many similar books by Lori Wick or Janette Oke but this was by for the best! I read it in 3 days....I read every chance I got."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a \\"The Making of the Matrix\\" DVD\\"","review":"I originally thought that this DVD would include \\"The Matrix\\" movie and have additional commentary along with the scenes as an option. Actually this is what would normally be referred to as the second DVD in a collectors edition DVD set. This DVD should be labeled as \\"THE MAKING OF THE MATRIX\\" and in my opinion not worth what is being charged. If your a film buff or are just a Matrix Junky, then this is for you. If you are expecting more than a just another \\"The Making Of\\" DVD with a few ad's for the upcoming parts of the trilogy, then forget it. Save your money. It's worth a few bucks, but it's not worth the as much as would be normally charged for the movie itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad ad","review":"I purchased this manual to work on my wifes 2004 chrysler crossfire. Not only does it not contain the crossfire, but it doesn't contain 2004 models anyway, which I still might be able to use for my 2004 Ram pickup.Into the paper recycler it goes.Poor advertising."},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely shoes!","review":"I bought these shoes a little while ago and I just love them! they catch everyone's eye with their cute T-strap design. The heel is a bit higher than I anticipated but that is likely a judgement error on my part. They are comfortable (e.g. they don't rub or blister like most high heels) and go well with most winter clothes. You might not want to try to walk a mall in them, but for an evening out or even a day at the office they're splendid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment. Lazy author.","review":"Maybe the author(s) aren't procrastinators, but they are lazy! I found this book to be worse than a waste of money. It was a waste of time, too.Take the time to develop some real material here worth publishing rather than just a rambling brain dump.There is little-to-no original thinking in this book.Maybe it is valuable to have common-knowledge anecdotes and heresy about procrastination repeated to you. if so, I'll save you the trouble with some examples:\\"I have heard of some companies restricting email use to just the last ten minutes of each hour. Try that out.\\"\\"I have a colleague who had two monitors. I asked why. He said that he 'can keep multiple applications open'. I have heard of productivity gains of as much as 50% from such methods. Try that out.\\"\\"The Now Habit\\" is a (much) better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I still haven't read this book...","review":"So I've managed to put off reading this book for over 3 years. I read the first few pages, and then never got back to it. I kept telling myself that I was going to finish the book and learn the psychology behind my terrible procrastination, but I guess the book doesn't help much if you keep putting off reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much talk and analysis and no cure for Procrastinators","review":"It does a nice job analyzing why people procrastinate. Lot of whining, no solutions... A waste of my time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on solving procrastination","review":"The authors get into the psychology of procrastination, which no other book I have read does. This helps the reader get to the root of his or her problem. Although a few of the psychological explanations are tenuous at best, most of them are very good and will help many people understand their procrastination. The second part of the book gives actual methods to solve procrastination, which was explained psychologically in Part I. These methods are helpful and realistic (you are not expected to change overnight, and not even within weeks or months). The book was definitely worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't procrastinate, read it!","review":"While I have read the first half, (why you procrastinate) I have learned about the root of some of my life long actions! Here's hoping the second half (learning to not procrastinate) will offer some good reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"diagnostic and prescriptive","review":"This is an old favorite that got lost in a basement flood a few years back.... I find that it is as good as I remembered. The early chapters help to describe and expain the varied sources of this problem and its differing manifestations; the second half is a practical workbook for \\"learning to tell time\\". Because of my nature- as well as lingering disorders of thinking- I need a refresher every so often. It may or may not be EXACTLY what you are looking for but it is both philosophical and practical- an uncommon combination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insanely Helpful","review":"I can't say I'd ever rate anything a 5 since it implies perfect but this book is pretty close. Knowing why you do something is a HUGE help in figuring out how to overcome it and this book does an outstanding job of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother. Read \\"The Now Habit\\" instead.","review":"This book is long on fluff and short on concrete advice. What useful advice it does contain is largely the same as inThe Now Habit: A Strategic Program for Overcoming Procrastination and Enjoying Guilt-Free Play, a book half as long. I believe that the authors of this book worked at the UC Berkeley counseling center at the same time as Neil Fiore, who wrote the latter book. If that's a coincidence it's a pretty unlikely one.The authors are also obsessed with procrastination caused by being the first in your family or community to go to college. I don't doubt that this is a real phenomenon, but it applies to maybe one one-hundredth of one percent of the potential readership."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless if you want to learn anything","review":"I was hoping to get a video that teaches people about Boston...this is not it. Save your money and look elsewhere. I am a tour guide and this is amateurand does not meet expectations at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah Blah Blah - Weak","review":"This book has alot of text but weak on info. I quickly glazed over due to the fact that there was alot to wade through to find the nuggets of information. The reference part of the book is lacking. This book is NOT very helpful if you are trying to get up to speed quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for understanding codes","review":"this book is great for class, and understanding all that codes includes, as it is a hard subject. This book is very clear and has lots of examples as well as diagrams to help understand even further. This is not the most interesting book, but then neither is the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"More information than you'd ever want to know about codes ...","review":"A necessary evil for the responsible interior designer. Overall the book is well written and informative, although the side 'tips' and 'notes' can get a little crazy. Still, I don't believe there's anything else like this out there, so if you need it, get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOOK FOREVER TO GET HERE","review":"I ordered this on April 7 and didnt even receieve it until May 7th! thats an entire month later, RIDICULOUS. and I Needed it for a class that i eventually dropped and forgot i even bought the book for.horrible. the book is good though, its pretty standard for anyone in the industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good!","review":"I received this item in a timely manner and it was exactly what they described it would be.

Andrews' use of historical events to teach life lessons really gets the message across. Recommended reading for turbulent times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traveler's Gift Review","review":"The Traveler's Gift has many good words of wisdom, which if taken, can lead the reader to a better, more prosperous life. The advice is given in an intriguing way which makes the reader anxious to meet the next personality the traveler will encounter. I would like to have given the book 4 1/2 stars. The only fault is the writing is good but not excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick read, motivational, exceptional!","review":"Highly recommend reading this book and having an audio of it is really the way to go! Especially if you are planning a new years resolution or if you need to make some changes in your life.

You can think about your own decision making process and see how you stack up. It was an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Really enjoyed this book. Contains principles for living but in a story form which makes it interesting instead of just listing them. On a similar format to the old book The Greatest Salesman in the World by Og Mandino."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traveler's Gift is inspirational.","review":"Not normally a fan of self-improvement \\"stuff\\", I was referred to Andy Andrews as a way to help coach my staff. Listening to the book on tape, I found myself drawn into the story and wanting to re-listen to the messages. The characters resonate with reality and there were many passages that were directly reflective of my own life and experiences.I highly recommend this easy listen to anyone - my adult children will be receiving a copy and I'm asking each of my direct reports to read or listen to it as well. It's wonderful and I know that I'll be listening to it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"This book was given to me by a close friend who knew just how much I needed it. A perfect book for a cross-country (USA) flight.Whether you are down and out or just need an attitude adjustment, this book will rock your world. If it doesn't, read it until it does. If it doesn't change your outlook, improve your vision of the future, or clear up your goals, I don't know what will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful modern parable","review":"What a beautiful book this is. The author, Andy Andrews takes us on a fictional tour through time travel with his protagonist, David Ponder. David is at a time in his life where he feels helpless and hopeless, because he feels he has lost everything of value in this life. We visit many important times and people from the Civil War to Heaven, meeting characters at the pivotal moments in their lives, and he learns from their reactions during these times. The seven lessons David learns through his travels are beautiful, moving and ones we should all embrace throughout our lives, not only in times of pain. READ THIS BOOK. You will not be the same"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just had to own this book","review":"Borrowed it on the Kindle, it meant so much, I had to purchase it, underline and mark it. Will read over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"\\"The Traveler's Gift\\" is a life-changing treasure. The fact that it's entertaining, informative and inspiring is a fantastic bonus.Most of us will see a personal reflection in the main character, David Ponder. All the cards seemed to be stacked against him and just when you think it can't get any worse ... the adventure begins. While meeting seven extraordinary people from different times in history, Ponder gets to see what each person was thinking during intense moments of decision that helped shape the world. (Luckily, you get to learn from their unbelievable minds as well.)Of the seven visits, my personal favorite is a man of lesser fame, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who played a vital role in the North's victory in the Civil War. (I get the chills just thinking about it.)Andy Andrews has got to be one of the most brilliant, inspirational storytellers of this generation. \\"The Traveler's Gift\\" is a definite \`must' read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Little Book...","review":"Two words....must read. This is a great little book with simple but powerful messages. I loved the historical characters. It actually made each decision easier to remember and review in my mind--and to relate to others. I'll re-read it several times before handing my copy to my wife and daughter. And I'll send copies to friends, family and business associates."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"This is the best inspirational book I have ever read. It is easy and fun to read. I found it challenging, emotionally moving, thought provoking, and most definitely inspiring . I've read a ton of these kind of books and most of them I enjoyed, but I don't see any of them having the lasting impact on my life that this book will. I'd highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Traveler's Gift","review":"This book was entirely too predictable!! (Lost your job? Crash your car and go into a coma, everthing will be revealed, and your troubles will be over!). It hard to believe that Andy Andrews knows anything about or has ever experienced hard times. I was disappointed with the ending - after all the inspirational, quaisi-christian rah-rah, feel good 'decisions', finding out that David Ponder winds up as a successful business man is quite a letdown! (I guess money is the only true measure of a man in some circles). Also, the dialoge was very contrived and silly. As my 14 year old nephew said - that book sounds like it was written by Gildoroy Lockhart! If you really want to read a story about hard times (and real people) read 'Nickeled and Dimed in America'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book If You Are Feeling Lost","review":"Masterfully lays out seven decisions that are crucial to your success.

I highly recommend it. If you are a business owner or someone looking to improve your daily outlook on being your best-READ THIS BOOK!

It is a great read and I would recommend it and this seller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks substance","review":"I love to read and this book came highly recommended. I am a picky reader, but also have a hard time putting any good book down. I put this one down a dozen times, but was committed to finishing it. I was convinced that I would come out the better for it. The upside of this not being true is that it is another testament to me that history books and scripture are all the motivation I need.I will not go into detail regarding the plot or authenticity of characters and events in the book. There are a fair shair of motivational words that are thought-provoking, but nothing with substance. The book is very \\"wordy\\" and the end is beyond cheesy and disappointing. As the author teaches that faith is one of the 7 decisions he allows his main character to see his own highly successful future. Where is the faith in that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I WAS NOT INSPIRED, I WAS BORED!!!","review":"Okay,I tried to read the whole thing, word-for-word.Yyyyaaawwwnnn, wow, was that boring.

Thought Provoking! We gave this to all of our children and some of our grandchildren for Christmas this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was a great disappointment. I read it because someone whose opinion I respect liked it. I found it to be the puerile fantasy of someone whose highest ambition is apparently to make a mark for himself by building big fancy buildings. The seven secrets of \\"success\\" are nothing new. If you find \\"the buck stops here\\" to be an inspiring revelation, you might want to read the book; that is one of the seven secrets. Success, to the author, apparently means worldly, materialistic success. After positing that David P. was to be the last person privileged to travel through time to gather wisdom for humanity, I expected something of a more spiritual nature. Not only is the message devoid of any originality, but the writing style is pedantic and plodding. If you have trouble sleeping, give this book a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambitious, but falls short...","review":"Sorely lacking in depth and complexity, The Traveler's Gift is an ambitious idea that falls short of satisfaction. Each visit had great potential, but fell flat from sparse handling. Unfortunately, while the seven decisions are each compelling on their own, I was left unsettled by the characterization of the successful christian life that becomes David Ponder's life at book's end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Take","review":"I tried to read this book twice thinking that the first time I didn't give it a chance. I couldn't read anymore after the second decision. It's poorly written and there is nothing revolutionary about it. It's the same old self-help stuff regurgitated and the storyline is even worse. I feel cheated that I paid $1.29 for it at the thrift store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Decision of All: Don't Buy This Book","review":"I don't know why I bothered to read this book. I could tell from the outset that it was yet another unimaginative self-help tome, but I perservered. Andrews makes the same pithy, unimaginative observations as those who preceded him: Dale Carnegie, Norman Vincent Peale, Deepak Chopra, Leo Buscaglia, Laura Schlessinger, etc., etc., etc.Don't waste your time and heaven's sake, don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of imperfect assumptions and unrealistic views","review":"All of a sudden Harry Truman is supposed to be the authority on truth?It's interesting that his claims are never questioned - sort of like religious faith.Lot's of religious undertones and unrealistic claims such as \\"every decision you make carves out your destiny\\".Yeah, what about the decisions your parents made?This book is full of the old nice, idealistic but unrealistic addages of work hard and you'll reap the rewards.Someone is not living in the real world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book, well worth reading","review":"This book is characterized by some bold choices: what to leave out as well as what to leave in. The author tells the story simply, engagingly, mixing history and advice. And he also leaves out nuance and complication, but in this case that turns out to be a wise choice. Andy Andrews makes some strong assertions, staking out clear positions, and if he had muddied the waters, he would have ended up equivocating. And if he had done that, then the advice wouldn't have amounted to much. No, he's clear. And it's up to the reader to decide whether this account rings true or not. For me, it did. It's helpful advice that really hit home. My only complaint is that I didn't read this book years ago. But Andy would not let me get away with that complaint. Practice forgiveness, he'd say, starting with you! And happily greet the future--a bit wiser. And he'd be glad that when I finished this book I had a grateful heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow - this is a really bad book","review":"I had to force myself to get through this book. It was a gift and I felt obligated. By the end, I was upset that I had wasted my time.The principles of the book are extremely shallow. The 'lessons' are supposed to infuse you with motivation and a can-do attitude. I felt more like I was part of a Tony Robbins Info-mercial."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst","review":"Honest to god, this is pretty much the worst book I have ever read. And I read a lot. From the bad history (Uh, dude, Columbus wasn't the only one who thought the world was round. It was pretty common knowledge by that time) to the cliche'd storyline to the completely undeveloped characters... just bad writing all around. I'm just glad I checked it out of the library and didn't waste any money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"This book is a very easy read, it has great life lessons and is delivered very well i would recommend this book to anybody that want to improve their life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING!","review":"I judge the books I read by making a decision as to whether to buy the books for my children or not. This is one book that I will purchase for all 4 of my kids; it is that good! It is written in novel form but with a strong message. I also purchased the audio version and what I like is that I can select a specific track and listen just to the 7 different decision messages which are written in the form of affirmations. This book confirms my strong opinion that out minds are just like computers, you put garbage in and you get garbage out. This book gives the reader the opportunity to put quality in and get quality out! The messages are so powerful to me that I created a wall chart with all seven decisions on it and it is posted prominently over my desk where I can review it every day! The book holds your interest while at the same time giving you great affirmations to live your life by. I highly recommend the book be included in everyone's personal library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life renewed !","review":"I wish this book had been around when I was younger. Modern times produce new stresses.The advice given in this book is timeless and can indeed renew attitudes and lead to betterlives."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but I but spoiled for me...","review":"This is a very good book. Very simple yet profound. My trouble is that I heard Andy Andrews speak a few weeks before reading it. He mentioned several items from the book in his talk, which 'stole the thunder' of the book. Only criticism I really have is the ending of the book.

And we can have a better life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"This review addresses the cd-audio edition of the Traveler's Gift. This work is probably better appreciated in the print form, as sometimes the story was a bit slow-moving, and other times, one wants to linger over some of the points (specifically, the seven decisions).Also, the narrator often sounded like he had just a little bit of excess moisture in his mouth. I kept wishing he would pause and swallow before continuing!All in all, a very sweet, thought-provoking little story with a nod to \\"It's a Wonderful Life.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reminders","review":"This book was referred to me by my coach.

He is then taken through time to seven destinations in which he receives the seven keys to success.These seven places range from visiting Anne Frank, to King Solomon, and to Christopher Columbus. And each person that he visits grants him another key to success.Andrew's keys to success are encouraging and very practical principles that can be applied to many occupations and situations. I highly recommend this book to all readers. Especially Christians as there are a few references to the Word.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"A hero bent on self destruction. . .","review":"Probably my all time favorite Balogh novel (and I've read just about all of them). The hero broke my heart.Left to bear his family's grief and guilt over a horrible tragedy in his youth (think along the lines of the movie \\"Ordinary People\\"), the hero set out to prove he was every bit as terrible as they said he was. He is a rake who despises himself for being a rake. When he meets a lovely and passionate widow he sees the dream of love and family again within his grasp. . . but he cannot allow himself to reach out and take it. Only by healing his past (and having his father and brother accept their share of the responsibility) can the hero hope to have a future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insecure hero insults heroine who then falls in love","review":"Mary Balogh sells well. Some of her books I like. Many people like every thing she writes, but I find you have to expect to come across the odd rape, perhaps the hero and heroine indulging in premarital intercourse in the first few pages. A little too dramatic for my tastes. This one does have a father calling his son (the hero) a murderer following the death of his brother with a family reconcilation after x years and a hero who goes out of his way to be unpleasant to people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Already rusting after three months","review":"After first opening the package I was very impressed with the weight, the feel of the knives and how extremely sharp they were.

At first it was only the smaller of the knives and though I wasn't happy I could have received a single bad blade. Now all three are showing small rust spots. I have owned much less quality knives and not taken nearly as good care of them and non of the previous sets have rusted. These knives are not worth the money you pay for them.

But Hitler had planned this for many years, and the invasion plans had been in full operation since the end of the Battle of Britain.

This movie's for you. Are you a fan of the After Dark Horror movies but feel that some of them don't live up to expectations? This is definitely one of the top installments to avoid. The only way I could fathom this movie being any worse was if it had a lot lower budget and the creature was some halloween costume from Wal-Mart. Actually maybe that would have made it more amusing. Unfortunately this doesn't make the so-good-it's-bad list either. Just boring all around. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than I expected....","review":"I had high hopes for this one...I thought it would be at least decent. I watched the first hour and my boyfriend and I both fell asleep. When we finished the movie later, we were disappointed. The creature looks sooooo fake. The first time it really shows it when it jumps on the back of the truck I busted out laughing. Before that, I still thought it could be good. But it didn't get any better. I had read that it was a cross between tremors and alien...well, yea, it looks like a second hand version of the aliens in alien, and, yea, this comes underground...but it just didn't work. I think Tremors is 10 times better, but that just might be because I've always loved Tremors. And Alien...well, lets be serious...this just doesn't compete.

This one will be on Sci Fi no doubt in the not too distant future. If you absolutely can't wait, go ahead and rent it. This is not one to buy though for sure. The creature is not very good and the acting isn't much better. The characters have nothing in the way of development. The alcoholic sheriff looks pretty darn young and attractive to be as pathetic a figure as she is supposed to be. And how do you consume that much liquor and still manage to function at that level anyway? Oh well, none of the latest films from the afterdark horrorfest have been that scary so far. I haven't seen them all yet, but ...well, this is about Unearthed. Watch it so you can say you watched it. No other reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch \\"Alien\\" instead...","review":"I am an avid horror film follower- this was HORRIBLE! Dragging on & on, and not very scary.

The movie is great, but, when I have the time, I'd rather read the book. The characters are so rich, painted in full with both strengths and weaknesses, that they feel like real people. What makes me fall in love with them and keep returning to this book is the way the characters relate to one another, the way they just fit together and take care of one another. The whole perspective on life is just simple and good. Oh, and the plot is incredibly well-crafted. But I'm more into characters, so it took a few reads before I really started to appreciate the structure of the plot:)If you do like this book, Haley has a few other treasures out there that are well-worth the read. \\"Nest of Singing Birds\\" and \\"The Murder of Medicine Bear\\" are my shortlist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting Married in Buffalo Jump","review":"I am very disappointed to see that this book is out of print.

I disliked nearly all of the characters, Sophie most of all. What a stupid woman. I would have liked to see Alexander paired with someone a little less vapid, and a lot more intelligent and interesting. Ms. Haley can write but her story did not create any interest in this reader. I didn't care what they did, or when and how they did it.

The next day I wake up and it's almost all gone. I've also noticed that my skin is much less oily and my pores much smaller. I notice that I peel two days later - which is annoying, but what gets the results. I just make sure I use a heavier moisturizer on that day and night, and I exfoliate with a facial sponge and that takes care of it quickly. I am also using Clinique's acne solution system and started both around the same time, so it may be the combination of the two that's producing the results. But either way, I'm very happy with how well my skin is looking these days. Can't wait to see the results of another month of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"great do-it yourself peel","review":"a friend recommended this for me. I have acne scars and though I know they're not going to go away, I just want something I can do at home to slough off the top layer of the skin. This works great. At first I didn't even notice much peeling, but I realized that it was because I wasn't putting very much on. I used q-tips and with a small tip not very much was getting on my skin. So while it felt hot while it was on, it didn't result in any peeling. Then weeks later I used a cotton ball and that did the trick. I kept it on for a little over 3 minutes and it was hot, very hot. My skin peeled a lot 2 days later. The peeling lasted for days afterwards, but I like the result. The little white heads are gone and pores look smaller. I recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't noticed a difference","review":"I used this twice a week for 6 weeks and didn't notice a difference in my acne at all. My skin got incredibly dry, which is to be expected, but no difference other than that. I'm disappointed as I read such other great reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"Why do I here about Proactiv more than this product? This worked wonders on my face and shoulders as it lightened my skin whhere I had previous scars. It may have burned like crazy after the first uses but it was well worth it. After using it 3 times my skin felt refreshed and it didn't look as acne-ridden as it use to be. It cleaned up a lot the acne on my face including the dark spots and the pimples. Although it takes time this product really worked and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to rid their face of acne or other irritations. A huge warning in advance is if you can't take the pain of a strong burning or tingling sensation then this product is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected","review":"after reading the reviews on this product i felt as if it was worth a buy. when i recieved the product i placed the solution on a scar on my nose for a few minutes, within seconds after i washed it off the scar has turned complete black. Darker then it originally was including areas on my nose that where not dark. its really have left me very self conscious, and disappointed about how dark my scar looks after using this product. i have seen a dermatoligist and am now using a product to try to reverse the affect and bring my orginal pigmentation back to normal. i am African American with a dark skin tone, and this product did not work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's giving these reviews?!","review":"With all the glowing commendations for this product, I figured I couldn't go wrong by purchasing it. Wrong, wrong, wrong. I followed the directions; I didn't leave it on longer than 8 minutes, and I didn't use it more than once a week. I rinsed with cool water and used a noncomodogenic moisturizer afterwards. I didn't lay out in the sun. Now, 6 or 7 weeks later, my skin has never been in such terrible condition. Where I was only having mild breakouts before, my face now resembles that of my acne scarred adolescence. I cringe when I look in the mirror. Please, save yourself some trouble and DO NOT buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salicylic Acid","review":"I love love love this product. I was worried that it was going to work when I got it but I have noticed the change in my face since I have started to use this. I would recommend this to any and everyone who is having some problems with their skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Product","review":"First off, Im 18 with combination/oily skin that occasionally gets gets inflamed pores. I would call it cystic acne but these pimples are in a small inflamed area. These types of pimples are very hard to treat with benzoyl peroxide and do not respond well to many types of treatments. I have not used this for very long but I decided it would be ok if I left it on my skin for ten minutes and I was acne free for two weeks. It was amazing! I will continue to use this to treat acne and hopefully with continued use I will see a change in skin texture as well. I am amazed at what AHA and BHA acid peels do for my skin. One negative though, it is extremely painful to use on my skin even when I only leave it on for a minute or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"The oily skin solution!","review":"I ordered this item on the Amazon website to step up my skincare routine. I had never done any facial peels before, and was nervous about the burning sensations that some reviewers had experienced. The first time, I left the product on for only a couple of minutes, as I was feeling a burning sensation mostly around my nose. when I rinsed the product (with cold water, no neutralizing solution), I was amazed at how my skin looked. It simply felt squeaky clean! I had some peeling around my nose, and on my cheeks a couple of days later, and my T-zone-oily skin was less shiny. I have been using the peel very 5 days or so, and my friends have noticed how clear and bright my face looks. Most of friends now want to try this product. Trust me, it does wonders, especially for the rest of us with oily skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just used this yesterday evening, and. . .","review":"I am a black woman, with caramel skin tone--- and I do believe this will be part of my routine skin care regimine!!!I noticed immediate improvement, though not drastic. I have large pores on on my cheeks--on either side of my nose and my forehead, small blackheads on my nose. I usually use Queen Helen mint julip facial to help with my \\"enlarged pores\\" and it seemed to be only an immediate fix-- a day later they looked like craters again. However, after this peel I noticed a change in pore depth and size. I woke up thinking \\"Oh my goodness are my pores huge again\\" -- but today (2nd day after peel) they still are minimal!!! I am very impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work.","review":"This did not work for me.

However, after months of using it, feeling the burn and never seeing any results in reduction of pimples after using up the entire bottle, I decided not to purchase anymore. Didn't work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best find yet","review":"I didn't purchase it here on Amazon but I have to say this is a great product. It is not for the faint of heart. I have very sensitive skin. I was only able to leave it on for probably less than 30 seconds the first time, the second time putting it on, I could only handle a minute BUT the difference was noticeable the 2nd time. If you can handle the tingling/burning sensation, it really is worth it. I make sure to start with the forehead, then to my chin, upper lip, then my checks as that is the most sensitive for me. There isn't another product like this for such a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent peel","review":"Use this once a week and I guarantee you'll have smoother skin in less than a month. However, do not give in to the idea that keeping this gel peel on your skin for more than the recommended high of 8 minutes will get better results -- this stuff is potent, so start out keeping it on for one or two minutes at most, then work your way up to the longer treatment. You will experience slight stinging after application and that's entirely normal. I will be using this product on a weekly basis from now on. Scaley, rough patches on my cheeks have almost entirely disappeared."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gradual but effective","review":"I've been using this product for about two weeks now, though not on a regular schedule. The first day I got it, I used it for two consecutive days. I try to use it about every three days depending on the dryness of my skin. When I first used it, it burned very badly and I left it on for a minute. Initially, I saw no changes in the clearness of my skin and it actually made my skin very dry at first, then very oily even when using a good moisturizer. There was quite a bit of peeling on my nose after the first couple uses and I wouldn't recommend wearing makeup after using this unless you want to look cakey and flaky. I typically use it on Fridays and leave it on for the maximum 8 minutes then let my skin recover over the weekend. My skin looks quite a bit clearer with a few minor cystic blemishes here and there. Overall, I would recommend this product. It works better than most other acne products I've tried. Just be patient and persistent. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused after all these raving reviews","review":"It's hard to find a product nowadays that receives such high reviews, especially when the product is inexpensive and deals with a sensitive issue (appearance).After reading the reviews here on Amazon and researching Salicyclic Acid 20% on the internet, the believeable consensus is that this peel works very well. I was completely sold.After receving the product I tried it for the recommended time with nothing during, nor days after, the application.Frustrated, I left the peel on my skin the next application for over half an hour with no response. No redness, tingling, peeling, nothing- and obviously no results.I am kind of in shock about how this product, if anything, isn't for beginners, but for me is like putting water on my skin.While I am dumbfounded, the product did absolutely nothing for me, not even negative things.Who knows, maybe I have skin as tough as nails."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spot Treatment","review":"We use this as a spot treatment on acne spots before we go to bed. I have tried it on blackheads, whiteheads, and those deep painful cystic feeling nodules...it works particularly well for the whitehead and cystic types (especially the swelling). Sometimes it also helps to cover them with a spot bandaid after the gel has been applied. I wouldn't recommend using it on the same spot more than a few nights in a row otherwise it can dry out the skin too much and cause it to...well, peel.Unlike other acne products, it does not discolor your sheets!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why don't other companies make this?","review":"Long story short been trying everything under the sun. I didn't change anything to my system (I wash my face with a Salicylic acid face wash morning and night and follow with face lotion). I started this twice a week Mondays / Thursdays. I've gone for about two weeks and the results have been simply fantastic. I haven't had any zits at all! Sure, it burns like crazy but I think the results are worth it. I usually go for about five minutes then wash it off. This little bottle also seems to last forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This product is amazing. I wasnt expecting much, but the results are unbelievable, i have used it 3 times so far. My skin is so much clearer, smoother, and pores are so much smaller... totally worth the 18 bucks. The first time i left it on for 5 mins with slight burning on my cheeks. But the consecutive times i first clean my skin of all dirt and oils by swiping it with rubbing alcohol and then apply the peel. It works so much better and I dont leave it on past 3 mins cuz the burn is more intense. I have used so many products to try to control my acne (moderate) but nothing until this has come close!!!I actually purchase this along with some emu oil so after the peel i use a tiny amount to keep the skin moisturized ( a little goes a long way). Awesome!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dramatic change in my skin texture","review":"I was a little nervous about using this at home, but I followed the directions to the tee and am so happy with my results. After about 6 weeks of use, I have less acne breakouts and my pores look much smaller. Fine lines around my eyes have lessened, as well as furrow lines seem less deep. My t-zone is more normal and less oily. I am amazed this addressed so many different problem areas on my face. A great overall facial skin problem solver. Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"I have fair, sensitive skin and this product has done nothing. In reviews people spoke of heavy peeling and nice skin tone after a while. I got 0 peeling and no change in skin.

I'm a black woman with tan/brown skin. I get really dark spots left from the acne. I just received my bottle Friday and tried it two times. The first time I used a cotton ball and it was very little burning so I left it on for 10 minutes. I didn't really see any results. I tried again the following Tuesday and I had received my brush that I ordered. I used it instead and I felt a major difference. It began burning immediately. I was able to distract myself for 10 minutes. I didn't get red but I didn see the white spots that others spoke about. I used the neutralizer and my skin was so smooth. I also noticed that I only had a shinny nose where my entire face is usually oily. I think if I keep using it twice a week, I will see more results and the bumps will completely clear. I'm satisfied. I will change my rating to a 5 if I'm able to use Amby on my dark spots without reoccuring break outs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing!!!","review":"I love this stuff. I have been using for a week now, and I have never found a product that works as great. I already see a huge difference. I have been using every other night vs once ever week, and it is just amazing. No lie, I can almost go without makeup. It will make you break out with small little pimples the first few times, but that is just getting the old bad stuff out of your skin. Nothing to bad, or anything to worry about, at least not for me. I will continue to use this stuff. I don't really think that it stings other than, maybe, the first minute you put it on, but definitely nothing one can't take."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS!!!","review":"I have issues with eczema on my arms and face and after paying LOADS of money to a worthless dermatologist and equally worthless prescriptions, I found this product.I first used it in a few spots on my face (nose, cheek) where I was having small mini breakouts. A minute or two with it on, I was shocked to look into the mirror and see all kinds of major GUNK coming out of my pores. It was as if the product hit the \\"evacuate\\" button and all hands were on deck to help with the purging :PThe next spot was my arm. When I previously went with the dermatologist, it took honestly at least a year to see the SLIGHTEST improvement in my skin with my arms being the toughest spots. 4 minutes with this product on left my arm feeling much smoother. It will be a spot that will need repeat applications for sure but I was very encouraged by all results so far.WARNING:This is a wonderful product but like everything else in life, it's not idiot proof. Read the directions!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for my skin","review":"I had such high hopes for this product. In fact, before I purchased it I told everyone I'd found this amazing peel on Amazon but I take that back.I won't advise anyone to stay away from the product as it obviously worked for many people. I'm african american with a medium complexion. I have combination skin with blocked pores and dark marks all over my face from acne. I used this product for 4 weeks, once every 5 days and the only outcome was incredibly dry/old looking skin even if I used a good moisturizer. All of the marks on my skin are now darker than they were prior to using the product and it did nothing to combat acne. I didn't leave the product on for more than 4 minutes yet the last and final time I did, the skin on my chin burned off leaving bruises.For me, it wasn't worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY pleased","review":"I started having problems with adult onset acne at about age 25 - am now 40. Have tried everything - oral antibiotics, topical antibiotics, retin-a, etc. etc. Despite trying numerous dermatologists, I never got what I considered good results - just a three minute visit and a couple of scripts. Decided to try this - at the price, nothing to lose. Man am I pleased. For the first time, acne is resolved (I have used the peel once a week for about six weeks). My scarring is improved and my skin tone is becoming much more even. Even improving my melasma. I would highly recommend this product. Word of caution. Acne will worsen after the first treatment - wait it out - it will improve Dramatically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed...","review":"I've been using this product for 5-weeks. Honestly, my skin looks the same. The only time I had any peeling was when I got a little peel happy and applied Alpha Hydroxy on off days. YES! I know. Not everyone will experience peeling all the time, and not that I really wanted that. I just wanted...something. Granted, I only spent $18.95. I should have known better. Bah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful for female premenstrual breakouts","review":"I tried using this because i was getting adult acne on my chin (large recurring zits right before my monthly cycle). All this product has done is severely dry out my skin rather than prevent or treat acne. If you're looking for a way to get rid of premenstrual zits, What i've found to be more effective is to ice the zit immediately when you start to feel it forming under the surface. In addition to icing it, i also push the zit down while icing it, repeating that 3 times daily, but you have to start doing that before the zit has time to get bigger. I also put benzoyl peroxide spot cream on it. I've also noticed an improvement and less breakouts since i've been exercising 30 min a day several days a week, drinking more water and adding more raw fruits and vegetables to my diet, also taking low doses of vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) supplements which is supposed to help balance hormones during that time of the month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah...","review":"My son and I both have used this peel many times, and it really didn't seem to make much of a difference for either of us.

The burning was tough to handle, so I would only leave it on for about 2 minutes each time. (The directions say to start off with 1 minute at a time so it's not like I put on an inadequate amount.)I used this product for 5 weeks, once a week, and didn't see much of a difference in my skin. Perhaps the people giving this 5 stars are putting it on more frequently and for longer, but they have extraordinary tolerance (or fried facial nerves.) I have now stopped using the peel, and there hasn't been any change. What a flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful with this","review":"I used this product exactly as instructed when it came. I used for about a month with applications every 4 days. I Liked the effects from the initial couple of peels. Then like others I broke out with painful cystic acne after the 3rd peel. I wanted to muscle through this period reading that this will clear up eventually and I would have pushed through this period, however, I ended up having a disturbing side effect from this peel. Now, not only do I have acne scars, acne and clogged poors on the left side of my face (this is my only problem area for some reason) I now have a white spot of discoloration. I beleive this occured b/c I went into the sun a few days after a peel for only about 10 mins without sun block. I felt it wasn't worth the side effects to continue.

My skin had a really hard time dealing with the humidity and the pollution - not something I'd had to deal with before. I've never had the best skin; it's always been oily and I suffer from blackheads and large-ish pores. Arriving in NY my skin became so oily it was disgusting and lots of tiny little spots started forming across my forehead. I now use this once or twice a week for just a few mins at a time and then follow with a benzoyl peroxide cream at night, which I use most nights and a light oil free moisturiser. All these three things combined have really helped the oil control, my skin is nowhere near as greasy, I've less black heads and my pores are definitely smaller. Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me :(","review":"I have combination oily & dry skin & I used this product 3-4x/week starting the 3rd week & used it regularly for almost 6 weeks & didn't really see any results. Had to stop when I moved because the new place has almost 0 humidity & this peel made my skin super dry. But my main complaint is that unfortunately for me, it didn't seem to have made much of a difference after 5 weeks. But then again, other products haven't really worked either, so I think it may be a hormonal issue & I'm trying birth control pills to see if they will help control my crazy hormone imbalance (my acne actually got worse now in my 20s).

I'm a peel novice, so I've never used one before. After a horrible breakout in September due to hormonal imbalances--my entire face was covered, I decided to give this a try. Years of Accutane and prescription medication obviously did nothing, so what's one more try? For the first two weeks, I wasn't really hopeful. It seemed to be working better as a spot treatment than an overall mask. I wasn't peeling, and my acne wasn't going anywhere. Also, it never \\"burned\\" my skin. It just made me itch a lot. Then I decided to up the time I had it on from 3 minutes to 5, and it worked! I finally peeled, and with that, my acne subsided. I currently only have 3-5 pimples on my face, all of which I'm confident will disappear in the next week or so. I can't believe that this little bottle is all it took to help my acne.

It seems as though I've lost four layers of dermis. I followed the directions explicitly, and only left it on for a little over a minute.

After 1-2 months, I stopped and started using Origins (serum + moisturizer) and my skin was making much better progress.Last week, I try to combine the together. I used the peel and then put on the correction serum, then moisturizer. Now I have 3 visits from spots, all of them dark and kinda hurt.

It has drastically improved my skin tone and texture. I was hoping to reduce some of my acne scarring, and this has definitely helped. I can't wait to see how my skin looks in another month! It does burn a bit, and it is imperative to moisturize after. I hope it helps your skin, too! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It really works!","review":"I have suffered from frequent break-outs for 20 years now. I have tried trips to the dermatologist, spa treatments, OTC products all with limited success. I have been using this peel for almost 2 weeks now and have seen a significant improvement. My acne has cleared up and my pores appear much smaller. My old acne scars have diminished as well.Now, the first time I put this on, there was a definite burning pain. I only managed to have it on for about a minute before rinsing it off and applying some lotion. That alleviated the pain almost immediately. I am now able to leave it on for several minutes and am seeing more noticable improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's an ok product","review":"I have adult acne and I was using this product as directed once every week, but it wasn't doing much so I decided to start using it as a spot treatment and it's working much better that way. I don't have cystic acne anymore, I just seem to get the hormonal acne around my chin and jaw line. I just put a dot on every pimple I have after I wash my face. Then I wash it off after 5 minutes and then put on an oil free moisturizer. It's been working ok, dries out my pimples but they're still pretty red. I get scaring from my pimples (hyperpigmentation) and I've been using the glycolic acid 35% on the dark spots as a spot treatment as well. They're both definitely better than just using face wash and 2.5% SA or BP spot treatments that you can get at the store so I'm happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dangerous Acid that should be Rx only!!!","review":"\\"Had to return it. After only 30 seconds on my face, I knew it was a VERY strong acid. Rinsed it off and that made the burning worse. Looked like I had a severe sunburn for a week and the peeling (which I guess it's supposed to do) was out of control. I recommend using only the 0.025% or 0.05% tretinoin gel to facilitate a gentler cell turn-over. It can be purchased real cheap on the web. DO NOT buy this product, it is not worth the chance of getting a chemical burn like so many reviewers have had!

If you know your skin's trends, you should apply this following the directions on the insert before you usually have breakouts as well as any time you have a breakout because this treats mine. First bottle is almost done and lasted a few months; WILL order a second soon. Only downside is this sucker STINGS! So have something to do to distract yourself for a few minutes. It also stings pretty bad whenever I wash it off with water; I don't stop rinsing until all the stinging goes away. For some reason, the first few times I used this product it didn't sting as bad, but maybe that's because when you have a breakout it stings more or maybe even with your skin during different seasons... DOES work as advertised though! Would recommend because let's face it, if you're interested in a product like this, you will do anything to get rid of acne, including taking on some facial stinging ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenominal Debut Album","review":"Have been following these guys ever since they got signed to Pete Wentz's label.

Product is strongly foul-smelling upon opening bottle, enough so that it makes me question the quality of the oil inside. Additionally, gel caps are all oily EXTERNALLY, which they obviously should not be, which makes me question production quality of this product even more. Never had these problems with other krill or fish oils tried before. Should have known better, as twinlab is notorious for selling one-off quality products at one-off level prices...and I suppose there is a big enough customer base for them to thrive on...but to me that doesn't really equal good value since their products are clearly inferior the overwhelming majority of the time.

Fett also presents the history of conjure, root doctoring, midwifery and a great deal more as it relates to medicine and healing in the African American community.

It does not sustain swing rhythms in any significant way or feature blues-based harmonies or diatonic melodies. The compositions are tuneful and challenging miniatures consisting of single, whole themes that undergo development, sometimes extensively, such as in Awakening - Midweek, which moves laterally through a series of emotional and intellectual changes to end up in an entirely different place than it began.The playing by Lande and Garbarek is consistently precise and expert, and the artistry is at a very high level throughout. They capture and channel emotions and thoughts with exactness over a broad range of moods within a contemplative nature-like setting. The playing achieves great intimacy and rewards close involvement by the listener.This should not be confused with banal \\"pretty music\\".

The situation this family endured deserves better treatment than it gets here. Malika Oufkir's view of the social and political scene, which could have offered brilliant insight into a world hidden from our view, was that of a naive and uneducated teenager: uninformed and self-centered. Perhaps this is the result of being imprisoned in a desert for 20 years. Besides its disappointingly limited scope, an inept author was chosen to collaborate on this project. The writing of this first-person narrative was trite. Instead of being captivated by this family's plight, I found myself playing a distracting game of count-the-cliches, with at least one on every page.

There is no continuity in the story. Someone must have paid big payola to get this drivel onto the NY Times best seller list.

I love books of all kinds. I'm not one of those snobby literature geeks that can't bear to read a page-turner because it would just be too trite. Yet even I couldn't get through this book.This story really should be re-written by a better author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting topic, not a great read","review":"2.5What happened to Malika Oufkir and her family was absolutely horrendous. It's difficult for most 21st century minds to comprehend imprisoning families for the sins of the father (literally) and the 'prison' conditions described in the book. And this all happened a couple decades ago! The way this family persevered and survived, both physically and mentally, is uplifting. The stories that Malika would invent and tell her family comes to mind.Unfortunately, this book was not that well-written. In fact, I was bored several times during the long chapters leading up to the imprisonment. I think this story deserved much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"heart renching veiw of what really happens in the wrold","review":"This book was a real eyeopener as to how the rest of the world, outside the united states, conducts their human affairs.

Too bad because it was a fascinating tale that fell far short of mediocrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Oprah 'Success'","review":"Interesting story but who in the world edited this? The average sentence had 5 words in it and the prose, if that's what you could call this atrocity to the literary world, was suited to a third grade level. The author would also refer to events that hadn't happened in the story yet - apparently assuming that you were already familiar with her tale.This book was painful to read. How do you suggest a book for discussion that has no literary genre, no vocabulary, no plot, etc.? It's easy to understand now why it was the first time I was able to walk into the library and pick a hot 'best seller' right off the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read.

It is an excellent read and also informative of a different culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stolen Lives","review":"I found this story to be an inspirational account of a young girl's struggle from the palace to a jail cell. The orginial controversy of punnishing children for their father's actions developed the story into a thrilling drama. It was a compelling and gripping story, but they way it was written was a little off. Some of the sentances were difficult to read because of the way the words were written. I did not like how the writer kept jumping to the past and present to explain events. This made it confusing to determine what details were current and which already occured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Could't Get Through It","review":"At first I was intrigued by the vivid descriptions of a palace life in a far-away land. Then, the details began to jump back and forth and all over the place. It seems that just when Ms. Oukfir would get to the next part of her story, she would remember something else from the previous part and go into a whole different direction, never returning to where she left off.It was getting me dizzy so I just put the book down. The story is worth telling, it's just too bad there wasn't a good editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a 5th Grade homework assignment","review":"She went through hell. Yes! She showed tremendous courage. Yes! But in the telling of this book the scenes, characters, events, timeline and happenings are jumbled up in a childlike rendition of a most difficult life in captivity. This book reminded me of a 5th graders reading assignment. Malika's focus is not so much more than \\"am I still pretty\\" while in her various jails. Some of the stoty makes no sense ( the hidden radio hookup between cells) along with many other events that are difficult to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and Poorly Written","review":"After living off and on in Morocco for 7 years in the 90's I'd never actually heard of the Oufkirs but I did hear much of the supposed royal excess.

Probably unknowingly, she and her writer depict her as an extraordinarily unattractive human being. She is amongst the most privileged of the world and never, despite her ordeal, sems to have concerned herself with the less privileged or wondered about the others that might be detained or missing, justly or unjustly, in Morocco because of her father's attempted coup. There are, moreover, many internal contradictions in her story. Many cliches. Translated for a British audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tale of horror","review":"A girl from a privileged class is adopted - against her will and that of her family - by the royal house and spends years imprisoned along with her natural family after her father tries to kill the royal leader. Her journey through various prison sites is riveting.The book is another example of how different the rest of the world is from our small Western world. It is important to remember that the accident of birth can place you anywhere.Oufkir's tale of tragedy and horror takes the reader from privilege to the bottom of despair to escape and emergence into another life and time. A sad tale for sure. Good reading for anyone who is interested in different cultures. Her descriptions of the landscapes and prison environments are excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrible Lives","review":"I read this book after seeing Malika on Oprah. I am not a book club reader, but received this from my son(8 years old) for Mother's Day. It was hard to get into this book at first, and it is very jumbled as it is told directly to a woman from Malika. It is obvious she is recalling experiences that were extremely painful. This has made me realize that we are very fortunate individuals in America, we live lives of freedom. I cannot imagine life as it was for the Oufkir family. They had stolen years, decades to make up for. What a tragedy, and horror to live with forever. I will pass this book along as it made me appreciate many little things I have taken for granted. It is a great book, horrible lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Want to Believe","review":"I appreciated Malika Oufkir's book very much. I have to wonder though, with the reader from Olympia, Washington, about some of the information Oufkir includes. It somehow seems disconnected at times. I also wonder why her father, well-connected and wealthy, jeapordized his family's lives with his attempted coup. The writing, as well, seems \\"rough\\" at times. I am very interested in Morocco and have traveled there. I do have great sympathy for Oufkir; I just wish the book were better written and more clear in the details. The poor woman, though, was probably in a state of constant shock due to the terrible conditions, and her recall probably IS uncertain at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harrowing and disturbing","review":"Not for the faint-of-heart, this book kept me up at night.

It provided an extraordinary glimpse into the world of human rights abuses and leaves the reader with a deep appreciation for the simple joys that we take for granted.Malika Oufkir was a teenager in the prime of her life when she was put into horrible prison conditions for twenty years with her family. Her family was being punished for the political actions of her father.Malika is an excellent story teller and has lives on the inside of the royal family in Morocco so it is very interesting to hear details of her upbringing.It is extraordinary to hear of the atrocious jail conditions inflicted on this family that was used to such a lavish existence. If you have any interest in human rights or the politics of Morocco then you will be fascinated by this read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing story of courage; sad but yet uplifting","review":"This story was so amazing that I could hardly believe it could be true. For me, living in the USA with all the freedoms that we have I found it sadly true that in other countries there are people being jailed for nothing. This story was a true account of a family who was jailed because of their father's actions. This was royalty!I found myself absorbed in the story and how this woman kept her siblings alive by 'telling a story' to them every night for years while being jailed in inhumane conditions. Malika Oufkir not only gave her entire family the courage to press on and hope for 'someday,' but she also gives the reader the courage to realize that we all have courage inside of us.

Now after just having finished it and knowing that I would be discussing it tonight, I was really concerned. What was wrong with me that the book annoyed me and seemed to me to be one of the most poorly written books I've ever managed to finish. It contained constant contradictions that caused me to begin to question the truth of everything else that was said. The complete disregard Malika showed for the plight of the two retainers who joined her family in prison leads me to see her as a selfish, self-entitled woman. And, did you know that she was the hero of everything? Her family wouldn't have survived without her - according to her. The book might have been better with a more skillful writer, but as it is, it doesn't measure up to the dramatic subject matter.

She is about the bravest woman I have ever read about who was imprisoned; I know if it was me I would have given up a long time ago and died. Her strength and courage was God's gift.The Moroccan King was revengeful and very cruel; punishing Malika and her family for something that they knew nothing about at the time and had nothing to do with.

Her mother and her brothers and sisters are imprisoned for the next 20 years for their Father's crimes. They are given very little to eat and live in horrible conditions with rats, scorpions and cockroaches. Malika finally decides to escape and beginsto dig her way out with a spoon. They finally escape and then try to live normally again after being locked up for 20 years. I really felt sorry for her youngest brother who went to prison when he was only 3 years old.

It's so easy to imagine this story as a starting point for an interesting account of the social and political environment in Morocco.

The lyrics are clever and intelligent.However, Harper's music, in my professional experience, will impress the adult who buys it more than the child whom it is supposed to be for. Harper's music doesn't have the energy that appeals to children, and her subject matter doesn't connect with children. Her tapes and CDs don't get checked out of our library.A parent who has an exceptional child might coach the child into enjoying this album, but most children will be much happier with something by artists who have a natural talent for connecting with children.

We feel Max Lucado should be made aware of this grave error."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting reminder of God's Love","review":"I highlighted so much in this book that I will not only use for myself but share with others. My favorite line in the whole book was \\" You will give up on yourself, before God does\\". That in itself is just an amazing look into how he loves us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath of Fresh Air","review":"This is the first book written by Max Lucado that I've read. It's one of his earlier works. His writing style is a little different than those of most other authors whose books I've read, but it's a good kind of different. The book is written in a more conversational tone. It's kind of refreshing after reading so many books written in a formal, ridged style.This book discusses how to listen and hear when God whisper's your name. The book is basically a compilation of several short stories that all lead to a centralized theme. The author tells a story and then explains how it applies to life. This style results in a great book that aides in your walk with Christ.When God Whispers Your Name has a powerful message. This book is a breath of fresh air in a world filled with smog. It's definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring And Exciting","review":"\\"When God Whispers Your Name\\" is an inspirational book based on Biblical stories presented in modern disguises. Max Lucado tells the modern story and then identifies the Biblical original. He does so in a way which holds the reader's interest and is never boring.My daughter is in a challenging, Biblically based Theology course I had gone into this book in the hope of enhancing my familiarity with Bible stories in order to help her. I obtained what I wanted, and more. Lucado tells Bible stories in ways that make them memorable. I approached this book with some trepidation. As a Catholic, I expected this Protestant minister to overwhelm us with quotes and citations. There is some of that, but they never interfere with the story.This book provides the reader with a road map to a more intense personal relationship with God. As I went through this book I found myself to be both inspired and excited. It can do the same for many Christians and others too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Inner Peace","review":"This was the first Max Lucado book I have read and I was completely enthralled by his writing. His continual references to the scriptures and his real-life examples really made me feel like he was talking directly to me. More so, I felt like God was speaking directly to me through the pages of the book. This is a must read for all Christians, but especially for new Christians like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"Interesting perspective on the Bible. Used in a Bible study group. Good for discussions. Easy to read and entertaining too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I think I'll mention its good points first. The animation and art in this series is good. The Female lead is a pretty lady. That is the only thing that made keep watching it. There is plenty of action, but it wasn't too intense because I didn't care if the main character died and the series ended. All the bad guys are chumps. They are probably related since all of their noses looked like wieners hanging on the middle of their faces. They also have really stupid sounding voices. The series is kinda like James Bond, if he were a cyborg chick with mentally handicapped enemies. I found it impossible to care about this series at all. Out of the many anime series I own, this is the worst. I agree with the review that said, \\"at least it was cheap\\". If you pay money for this you will probably be very annoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this -Jult Warfell","review":"I had no high hopes for this series and true to my opinion, I was sadly dead on.

Fits AK mags","review":"For the price, this vest cannot be beat. The mag pouches comfortably fit a single 30 round AK tapco mag. The shotgun shell holders comfortably fit my 28 gauge shells or my 7.62x54r rounds. The pistol holster works fine, but I opt'd for the extra mag pouches because I have a thigh holster. It is heavy duty and durable, and the digital woodland pattern matches my marpat perfectly. The vest adjusts quite well for people of all sizes (within reason). I would not only recommend this vest to a friend, I would trust it in a combat situation. The only thing I do not like is the black part with the tube in it. It should have had a molle strap or something. The drag handle is not double reinforced either. Altogether though I would give it a 4.5/5 stars... but 4.5 rounds up, so 5/5 it is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best gear for the price.","review":"You can't get a better piece of equipment for the price.

Great adjustablity with the size. Im a medium build and i adjusted it to fit me perfectly. but disadvantage is it wont go any smaller, so if your a small person it might not fit, at least not snug like it would be for a slightly larger person. Overall This vest is awesome, so many pockets and straps for anything you could ever want or need. Feels soft yet very sturdy when you have it on. Great material, not some crappy off brand build. Haven't tested it out for real, but im sure it will take the test/beating. we will see. recommend for anyone who wants a good quality vest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice tac vest","review":"This vest is almost as sturdy as my US army load bearing vest.

Seams are tight and feel very solid. The vest is made of thick, rugged material with good quality velcro and snaps. I can't compare it to any higher end vests but it works great for me. My only complaint is that there need to be more size options! I am a small guy (5'6, 130lbs) and this vest fits but is just a tiny bit bigger than I would care for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good value","review":"Well thought out load bearing vest.

The vest fit me almost perfectly right out of the box. Only needed a slight letting out at the bottom of the waist. I removed the cross-draw holster and put the extra mag pouches on since i have a drop leg holster. My FNX-40 fits perfectly in the cross draw holster btw. The mag pouches hold my 30 round AK47 clips quite well but are a bit tight so double stacking mags doesn't work very well. I'm sure the mags on my new AR will work much better for double stacking. the pouches for pistol clips are perfect for my 14 round mags as well. The only thing I would change would be to make the walkie-talkie pouch removable so I could attach my k-bar there instead. Great vest and look forward to field testing it soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Product, not even Airsoft Quality","review":"After reading the reviews here for this product, some even describing how good this product is for various field applications, I figured it would be ok for the Range and utility. Not even close.The zipper tore the second time I put it on, while I was trying to adjust everything. None of the Velcro \\"MOLLE\\" knock off acc. would stay on either. The \\"quick draw vest\\" support anchors make it difficult to use effectively. Also the holster will not support any attachments on a handgun.Returned it, bought a better brand.

Rachel Miner was great as was Nicole DuPort and Rider Strong! I especially loved Rider's performance as Ford! (really loved his character and he did such a great job with it)The movie has actual plot, unlike most horror movies these days which just consists of gore and sex (not that this movie doesn't have both gore and sex, but it's nicely done and not over the top, in my opinion)I won't give away any spoilers but I think it's worth watching!

It could easily have been on a ship at sea, on a space ship, or some deserted island. Make no mistake this movie is all slasher. No need to tell you about the plot because its so shallow it has no bearing on the movie. The acting is engaging enough although not what you'd call good. The script is pretty sub par and really dumbed down. Effects are good as you'd demand in this day and age. Production value is pretty high. Character development is for s***.

If you already have the original and want something more, go get \\"Incantations\\" or \\"Amarok\\", and only get this one if you worship soul-less exercises in technology like \\"The Songs Of Distant Earth\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aged well with the years","review":"Think of this 2003 re-recording of the 30 year old Tubular Bells like your spouse of as many years with a new outfit; you'll remember what you love about it all over again.Now how about releasing that live version the Queen Elizabeth Hall in June 1973, with Mick Taylor, Steve Hillage, Fred Frith, Ted Speight, David Bedford, Kevin Ayers and Pierre Moerlen?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"Having watched Tubular Bells on PBS years ago, and loved it, there isn't an ounce of life in a single tune here.Simply awful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but different from the original","review":"When I had bought this I had ordered the original version and received this version. When I saw that it was 2003 I thought about returning it, but decided to keep it. When I first put it on I immediately noticed a difference even though I had not heard this in years. I still have the vinyl LP from the '70s! I really like this version of Tubular Bells, but I am not sure if I like it as much as the original version. The original version was done with less instruments which lends to its uniqueness. The sound quality of this version is by far better than the original due to the limitations from the source tape of the original. All in all, I am glad I kept this version, but will buy the original version also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sending this one back...","review":"After ordering the CD (but before receiving it) I have found out that this is one of those carrying CSD (Copy protection). I haven't even gotten this yet but the minute I do, I will probably just send it back unopened for a refund. I am not a supporter of copy protection and have also had problems with other protected discs in numerous equipment. In fact owning and iPod and always on the go, everything I buy gets loaded into my iBook or iMac and sync'd to my iPod.I guess my biggest gripe is that the recording industry assumes that anyone trying to import a CD into MP3 format is out to break the 'law' by music sharing... I wonder if sharing my music by letting my friends listen to my iPod and showing them where they can buy a CD for their own is also illeagal...."},{"rating":"1","title":"get the Original \\"Tubular bells\\"","review":"the new version shows that Mike has no money and he wants to desperately get our money and interest by making another bells after another.we had \\"Tubular bells II\\",\\"Tubular bells III\\",\\"The millenium bell\\",\\"the best of tubular bells\\" and now we have this.truly - the original reminds still after 30 years one of his best albums and one of the best albums of instrumental rock.get the Tubular bells\\" from 1973,don't even touch this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"Mike Oldfield reaches back to the past to rehash his \\"Bells\\" for the n-th time. When Glenn Gould re-recorded the Goldberg Variations, he breathed so much new soul and new ideas into the new version. For Oldfield, the Bells have been such a cash cow that he can't let go of milking it. It speaks for the evolution of modern music that with digital precision the spirit of the music vanishes and all you get is perfect sound, polished like a Britney Spears dancedoll without much individuality or meaningful musical contribution. Had Mike truly revived his Bells with new artistic ideas, it would be different. Even naming them TB 2003 (like Windows 2000) shows the bad taste in this marketing stint. Empty and disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"It was the best, and still is the best of its kind. The \\"study\\" habits it promotes make life so much easier. I went through high school and college listening to these tapes before every semester, and they not only helped my study skills, but my life skills in general because it discusses a lot of common sense life knowledge as well. If they don't have it on Amazon, I recommend you buy it directly from the publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Early Trevor Gem","review":"Readers of Trevor's more recent books--Death in Summer, Felicia's Journey, Two Lives, After Rain--will enjoy this earlier novel, which has all the trademark Trevor strengths: economy, wit, good carpentry, and that rare thing, truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for SVT","review":"Not for SVT.

Replaced with original Motorcraft part and works like new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microscopic...","review":"I picked these out months ago as a suggestion for my fiance. Online they look gorgeous, and maybe if I got a microscope they'd look as pretty in person. I had to put them in my second hole because they looked ridiculous in the first. My fiance's incredibly disappointed because they are non-returnable. For this price I didn't think they would be huge, but I thought they might be at least visibly discernable with the naked eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture here taken under a microscope!","review":"OMG ... they are extremely tiny - Do not go by the picture .

The real struggle is having enough tissue handy to dry your eyes. The author puts his heart on his sleeve by opening his floodgates to his grief over the loss of his son, and the amazing discovery of his sons' everlasting presence. This book relates to anyone who has rode the emotional rollar coaster of infertility, loss of a child, and the surprising joy of adoption. This is a truly touching book that has opened not only my eyes, but my heart. A wonderfully written personal journey of love."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Any Parent","review":"For a parent who has lost a child, had trouble becoming a parent or even for a parent who had no problems at all, this book is a reminder of how precious a child is and how we have to make each moment count. It reminds us that children are the purest gift we can ever recieve and to feel lucky for every day. He saw the positive of losing his son even through all the fog and that can be an inspiration to everyone who reads it. The book is written as if the author is sitting there telling his story to you and you can feel the emotion and love he has for his son and his wife as well as his daughter. It proves that no one ever really leaves us."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a pity !","review":"The first two parts are very good, love, true love, a quest for love, true love; then she finds her husband. And then, it is a story of selection, elitism, superior people who won the eternal life. Hears as fascist to me... Well, it's no news, Barjavel often showed such ideas, but what a pity ! He knew how to make suspense so well !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for someone learning Spanish","review":"This book is about the life of a young woman in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War. It is written in the language of a young woman, and, coupled with the fact that there is an English/ Spanish dictionary in the back with a section on idioms, makes it easy to read for someone learning Spanish. Beyond that, it is interesting, exciting, shocking, sad, and funny all rolled into a wonderful accounting of what life was like in this tragic era."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read.","review":"This is an excellent novel. From the very beginning Carmen Laforet manages to create a very interesting and convincing atmosphere, the characters are full and the plot does not stagnate. I have read it several times and always enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book!","review":"I had to read this book first for a class but loved it so much I wanted a copy of my own. Carmen Laforet is an extremely talented author and a great read if you enjoy works from the posguerra period in Spain. I found it easier to read than some works by other posguerra authors (Spanish is my second language so I sometimes struggle with some vocabulary)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never read this","review":"Bought this for a class I was taking and ended up dropping the class. Anybody want to buy a book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sticky but smells good","review":"These flavors smell and taste good, but it's extremely sticky on the skin.

I waste my money on this junk again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first??","review":"This music is more addictive than any opiate - by that third hit you will be willing to sell Amway for another listen. I hate to classify, but think pop with a very indie sound. My only complaint is that this is their only friggin album."},{"rating":"2","title":"court room experience","review":"I Just finished reading this book and Love it! I like how the author used fictional stories to take us through the criminal justice system. There are many aspects of the courts that most people don't learn unless they have experienced them, this way you learn like you have beed there. I will recommend it to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My wife's favorite watch ever!","review":"I got this watch for my wife and she absolutely loves it! She likes the color, the way the band feels on her wrist, the fact that she can program it herself, and that it's not \\"too sporty\\". She likes it so much that she sleeps with it on and basically only takes it off when she takes a shower... Sometimes it seems like she likes that watch more than me! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timex Women's Watch","review":"Nice watch, and the frame is a little bigger than the older version.

But all in all a very nice watch and in perfect condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inflexible, uncomfortable strap","review":"Ah, Timex! For decades Timex was my go-to watch brand for travel. When I recently needed to replace my trusty \\"Expedition\\", I looked to Timex. Unfortunately my old favorite watch is no longer made, so I ordered this watch. Perhaps the watch would have worked well, but I'll never know. The strap was so inflexible and uncomfortable that the watch was sent back immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not lilac","review":"Good morning, I purchased this item for my daughter believing it was lilac or a light purple color. When I got it it was more silver gray - not really purple at all. I returned it and got another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Oil Return Design","review":"This is a quality Felpro gasket but it does not include the latest design of the oil return hole. You can enlarge the hole at your own risk as rebuilders have been doing for years. Finally, Felpro incorporated the enlarged hole ( which looks like the profile of a Monopoly hotel on its side) into the gasket design, but the gasket set offered here is not the new design. Part number is the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent lcd.","review":"Excellent lcd when it was launched a couple of years ago and still remains a good option. It has inputs for everything. I use it as TV because it has composite video, s-video, dvi and vga interfaces. It also works great as a pc monitor. With a response time of 25 ms it is good for movies, but you can see some small ghosting in games. Great quality and design."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Black and Tans","review":"I enjoyed this book. It debunked much of the mythology that people my age were exposed to. As a child, I knew some IRA men. They were formidable characters. My hero Michael Collins took a drubbing in this book. The use of condescending adjectives for bishops was a turn-off. Nevertheless, Bennett provides a very valuable service."},{"rating":"1","title":"British bias","review":"I didn't know the details of Richard Bennett's background but it didn't take long for me to know this book is definitely biased toward the British. Bennett appears to think the Irish would have been perfectly happy to remain under British rule had those in charge in Dublin not bungled their 'rule' a bit and had a few ruffians not insisted on pushing for Independence. And wasn't it nasty for those Irish heros to wage their war when the Brits were otherwise occupied elsewhere?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title","review":"I bought this book on the title alone - big mistake. Expecting to find more detailed information on the Royal Irish Constabulary Reserve Force (The black and tans), I was sorely disappointed. The book takes a quick, general and superficial look at the Irish \\"war\\" of independance, albeit with a somewhat pro-British bias. The activities and men of the black and tans is not covered in more detail than in other general accounts of this conflict."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING! NOT THE REAL BAND!","review":"I was very disappointed to know that there is another band out there which is \\"ripping-off\\" the original band's name.

These are the blues sung in a voice that one will not find amongst the fresh-faced participants of American Idol. These blues are sung in an authentic voice that had to be EARNED.

Long live the Blues!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Amazon!","review":"This so-called remastered DVD version of \\"The Next Man\\" is not a technical improvement on the original VHS version. In addition to highly distorted sound and fuzzy picture quality, the film was poorly edited.The tech info provided by Amazon is skimpy and misleading at best, and deceptive at worst. This a better-than-average movie warrants a higher quality transfer and Amazon customers deserve more reliable and detailed product information.Shame on Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"The box for the DVD says new digital transfer and yet the video on screen was nearly unwatchable it was of such poor quality.

If you want more than this get \\"Cup of Loneliness\\" and The Razor and Tie \\"She Thinks I still Care\\". For some reason, both this and the other Mercury compilation substitute a rerecording of \\"Why Baby Why\\". I don't know why since they use the orginals of a couple other Starday recordings. Anyway, if you want the original version, which I think is better, you'll find it on Columbia's Spirit of Country, and probably a 100 other compilations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Recommend","review":"This is a strange book. Actually, it's two books in one, with a dopey chapter for children thrown in for good measure. The first half is about nuclear power, both in energy production and weapons. The second half is an editorial for nuclear disarmament. The authors make no attempt to divorce their politics from the discussion. Even the first, more substantive half of the book is liberally laced with disarmament talking points.Notwithstanding their views on disarmament, the authors support nuclear power and do a pretty good job explaining the scientific, financial and engineering aspects of the Peaceful Atom. If the portions on nuclear power were available separately as a pamphlet I would strongly recommend it to anyone interested in the subject. On balance, however, those few chapters don't justify wading through the entire book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST inspirational book of its time...","review":"This has got to be one of the best inspriational books of its time. This book is packed cover to cover with sayings and quotes from every type of person. The artwork is simply magnificent and adds to the book just as much or more than the actual words do. The arrangement of categorys, subcategorys, etc., could not be done any better. This book is simply amazing, and every pastor as well as congregation member should have their hands on one"},{"rating":"1","title":"A difficult read","review":"I have read many individual conversion stories to Judaism.

The textual analysis did not flow well and it did not keep my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"One more beautiful score to add to Dover's great list!","review":"A very beautiful reproduction of an older Russian edition, with clear, legible text and music. So far, I've not found any reasons to justify the complaints issued by an Italian reviewer asking for, among other things, English translations of the sung texts (surely that would take up too much space; furthermore, when will we accept Russian as no less valid a language as Italian, French, or German?).

These little replacement snap-on joystick covers mitigate that flaw -- they're easy to grab, stick up, and increase the \\"throw\\" of the joystick.Unfortunately, they also stick way up into the air, making it impossible to use a normal PSP carrying case such as the wonderful Logitech PlayGear Pocket case, or even the propylene sleeve that comes with the unit.As much as I want to like these things, they're just too impractical for my *portable* unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, it's correct, this should be RECALLED - DO NOT BUY.","review":"I usually don't write reviews but am so thankful for the input from others on this, and having had my analog core destroyed by using this product, wanted to help warn others. The physics of the over-size and taller stick, as stated by others, does wear down your analog core somehow. It took only 3-4 weeks on mine with very limited play, maybe 4-5 hours at most.DO NOT BUY at any cost, it is not worth it. I returned mine and spend the money on buying a new analog core/button on ebay.

Because the center of gravity is higher than the regular nubs, it ends up putting pressure on the wrong areas and your analog will eventually quit responding like you want it to. The best bet is to get a replacement nub that is similiar in size to the original, but has added grip. There are sites on the internet that have these.

I couldn't finish it. In his own words, Richard Wagner comes across as pompous,arrogant, self-centered, not very bright and boring to death. He may have been a musical genius, depending on whom one consults, but I certainly had no use for, and could not spend much time with the unpleasant person in this book.

This CD also comes with the bonus songs From Kelly \\"Before your love\\" and \\"A moment Like this\\". Also playing along on this CD is top 10 American idols with one song each with the exception of Kelly Clarkson who has two (Four counting \\"Before your Love\\" and \\"A moment like this\\") and Justin Guarini who also has two.

I think all of these kids will be heard from and Nikki with her beautiful face, figure, and stage presence would make a good TV personality. I want to wish all the gang the best of luck in their endeavors. I followed their journey from day one and shed a lttle tear as each one was eliminated; but as Simon said \\"America got it right\\" and Kelly was crowned American Idol!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Put Together","review":"I loved American Idol, I watched every minute of the series and saw some wonderful performances. Sadly, the producers of the album opted to have the performers record their songs in a studio. The result, the songs lost the emotion they had as you watched on TV. Tamyra's performance of \\"A House Is Not A Home\\" had me in tears at home when she did it on the show. On the CD it lacks the emotion. Kelly's performances have some of the emotion she showed on TV, but they also fail to live up to what was shown on TV.Another mistake was the fact that the singers all sound like their vocals are very strained. That does not make for good music.If you loved the show, this will be a good walk down memory lane. If you didn't adore the show, skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Idol Greatest Moments","review":"American Idol Greatest Moments is the best compilation cd out today. If you liked the show you will love the cd. It is full of all of the greatest moments of the top ten finalists. I love that you are able to experience these talented voices again on cd.This cd is full of terrific songs, performed by such talented people that it helped make the show what it is. If you like Kelly Clarkson, you will love to hear songs by, Tamyra Gray, R.J. Helton, A.J. Gil, and Justin Guarini, just to name a few. The producers did a wonderful job putting this cd together. So if you want a cd full of songs that will really touch you. I would definately suggest this cd. It is so great the whole family can enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"RJ","review":"I watched this show over the summer and I will say that RJ was my favorite. He was so good-looking and talented! Dang! I like Kelly a lot but I would have liked to see him win, too. Jim Verraros shouldn't have been in the top ten. He was better than that genie in a bottle chick at the auditions, but he still looks funny when he sings and he's not really FANTASTIC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than I Thought","review":"This CD was so much better then I thought it would be!

Next EJay was so great he should have been in the top five and never should have been voted off 9th. Anyway Christina Christian has a amazing vioce and i am sorry that you were sick. Justin your hair is so cute email sometime and i will braid it for you maybe. And R.J you are so cute nice vioce keep it up. And Kelly Clarkson as a nice vioce but it TRAMYA GREY ALL THE WAY!!!!!!!!!! NUMBER 111111 FAN!!!!!!!!!! KEEP YOUR HEAD UP, GOD WORKS IN GOOD WAYS AND I AM GLAD THAT YOU GOT AN RECORD DEAL YOU DESERVE IT.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Variety is the Spice of Life","review":"There are no two songs alike on this album, and for listening in the car that is essential. Everyone wants that CD they can listen to over and over and never get tired of. This is the one! This CD will take you through all the emotions and styles of music. You can listen to upbeat one minute, and the next something slow and romantic. The individual performances are different from the show, but every CD is produced that way. You want to be surprised at a live performance at how the artist is able to change a song and give it something extra when they are performing live. This CD allows you to get to know them a little better as recording artists. There are few CD's that are good from start to finish with such diversity and talent. You can't put a price on how much this CD is worth when you consider all of the talent and variety that is included on one CD.

RJ Helton's \\"Lately\\" and Tamyra Gray's \\"A House Is Not A Home\\" are two of the best songs in the album.

Yeah, maybe my fish can get a record deal: They \\"sing\\" in tone, can breath, but refue to lip-synch(I know it sounds gay). This is just sad because bands that PLAY THEIR OWN INSTRUMENTS, WRITE THEIR OWN SONGS, and PERFORM THEIR OWN SONGS can pretty much get almost no attention. Let's take the band King's X: Doug Pinnick (vocals/bass) is an amazing metal singer who can sing in perfect pitch and writes good lyrics about God (King's X is a Christian band); Ty Tabor (guitar/vocals) has some of the bestguitar solos you probably don't know; and Jerry Gaskill (drums/vocals) has some pretty complicated rhythm patterns...yet only like a few dozen people (I know a lot more people than that like KX; I'm just exagerating) seem to like this band.

But all in all, if you love ICP as much as I do and if you didnt get all the comics when they first came out, then this is for you. Plus, it has all the cover art before each volume wtih out all the extra [stuff] that is on the actual individual comics. So get this if you dont have theses songs yet. P.S.

This book is a MUST READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars is pushing it, but it's not worth 3.","review":"\\"A Bride For Donnigan\\" was one of the better books by Janette Oke, and started out very interesting. But, there are some hills of good and bad. First off, I found everything too perfect and sugar coated. What are the odds of Donnigan and Kathleen getting along? Much less, falling in love? It might happen, but it would take time. Which leads me into how Oke didn't express how much time goes by, nor the age of Donnigan. We don't know much of anything about Donnigan. Towards the end, the total point of this book was gone. I was hoping for more about their marriage, and the trials and tribulations of it. I did enjoy the characters, nonetheless, and did care about their outcome, but Donnigan seems too good to be true. I'm also glad that a book was finally written about this subject, even if it was just a storybook romance. It still doesn't beat \\"Roses For Mama,\\" but is good all the same. I recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get far with this one","review":"I didn't get very far reading this book. I didn't read about Kathleen's relationship with Donnigan because I was throughly disgusted with her character by Chapter 3. Kathleen is so timid it's revolting. She does the housework for her stepmother \\"Madame\\" for years, including bringing her breakfast on a tray. Never mind the fact that \\"Madame\\" has got two good legs and Kathleen limps. Never think about that, Katie, me darlin'! Never speak up for yourself! Just do like \\"Madame\\" says. Maybe she gets better as the book goes along, but I didn't really care. I'd have liked to see \\"Madame\\" get hers a little ways down the road.

However, by the end of the book, I was just glad that I had gotten it from the library and hadn't laid down good money for this dreadful piece of under developed, boring waste of paper!! Not up to the standards that I have come to expect from Janette Oke. All I can ask is...how can writers who \\"scribble off\\" (to use another reviewer's well put description) fluff like this actually sell books? I'd like to warn you against buying this book, and if you still want to read it, get it from the library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As much fluff as a bag of cotton balls","review":"If you're looking for a quality read, don't pick up Oke. On the positive side, there are no curse words or lurid sex scenes. If this is your only standard for a good read, you're in luck.

Her lack-luster writing style makes me wonder if perhaps she just scribbled this off on the weekend to meet a deadline, which is really too bad because the plot idea is excellent, but it could have been done oh, so much better! Her characters were flat, and the way she jumped over long periods of time, I thought perhaps my book was missing pages. It wasn't.

Then, when the bears come home and catch her asleep, mother bear (who looks like Mammie from \\"Gone With The Wind\\") tells her she can come back any time she feels like it.

One of the BEST illustrations I have seen in a children's book in a long time. Better suited for older preschool aged kids/ younger elementary school kids since it is a little scary.

The wording is tedious to read, and I found myself skipping sentences to avoid it. The illustrations are beautiful, but even my husband agrees...it's just not one of her better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer Version","review":"I was not impressed with this version of Goldilocks, while the illustrations were beautiful, the added repetitive wording got very tiresome. I was reading this to my 6 month old, and I don't mind that they didn't call them \\"Papa, Mama and Baby\\" but repeating \\"great, huge, big, giant, large, huge bear\\" every other sentence was exhausting to read and quite boring, did not keep her attention or mine at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful illustrations but too politically correct","review":"The illustrations in the book are gorgeous. However, they are possibly too complex for young readers. Still, the illustrations are beautiful. I really object to the descriptions of the three bears. Papa bear has become a \\"great, huge bear\\" and mama bear the \\"middle-sized bear\\" while baby bear is now a \\"little, small, wee bear\\". Ridiculous! The story has gone from a family of bears, whose home is invaded by a (beautifully drawn) little girl, to an unrelated collection of bears of varying sizes that make the story clunky to read, for no obvious benefit to the story or anything else besides some distorted sense of political correctness. I've returned the book, and suggest that you look elsewhere for the classic story."},{"rating":"2","title":"More, please.","review":"While I love Jean Thompson's short stories ... being able to sink my teeth into this delicious hunk of a novel was even more satisfying.

I sent a note to the seller saying I was very disappointed that the \\"expedited\\" service was as slow as it was. I was leaving for vacation and assumed I would receive it within 3-4 business days so I could take it on vacation. I didn't know how long it would take until AFTER I committed to having the faster service.

Father Tim's struggle with depression and self-doubt was very realistically portrayed and I suffered right along with him as he fought to regain himself. As usual I enjoyed the doings of Dooley, Uncle Billy Watson, Puny and the twins, and the rest of the Mitford family. I particularly enjoyed the liberal sprinking of quotes of scripture in this book and even pulled out my Oswald Chambers to look up a passage mentioned in the book. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series but until then I may go back and re-read the earlier Mitford books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jan Karon hits the mark.","review":"All of Ms. Karon's books are inspirational, but this one is especially so.

I read and re-read pages to enjoy it even more.","review":"In This Mountain takes you though a miriad of emotions of Father Tim and his family and friends in Mitford. Jan Karon allows the characters to experience joy, pain, sorrow, and rejoice... I had a hard time putting it down once I started reading it. The book drew me in and made me feel that Mitford was my home, and I looked forward to each page, each chapter.... This is the second time I am reading the Mitford series, and I highly recommend sharing it with anyone who enjoys a good heart-warming read.In This Mountain (The Mitford Years, Book 7)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a joy to read!","review":"Jan Karon's muse is definitely back. This book is a joyful read. Father Tim has always served as an inspiration to me just as he does to everyone he comes across. The characters that surround him in the Mitford books have become more real to me than the people in my own neighborhood, and church. Jan Karon is a gifted author, and enjoying her books has been a real blessing to me. I am eagerly awaiting the next installment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In This Mountain","review":"I have not opened this product yet. All of the other Mitford Series audio books I've listened to and/or purchased were unabridged. The online description of this one didn't specify. So, I took the chance that since all the others were unabridged, this one probably is too. No such luck. I would rather have the unabridged version, if it exists. The Mitford Series by Jan Karon are truly delightful, which is why I don't want to miss a word!

Sadly, this is not the case. I believe that the author is writing for those readers who are soooo glad to have a good old small town story with the right values, that she neglects character development and plotting. Even the dialogue, origanally charming, is of a sameness. I will not be finishing this book and that is very unusual for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Me Feel So Good!","review":"As usual, I loved Jan Karon's new book #7. I always feel so good after I've read her books. I feel so close to the characters and I know them and love them. I can hear them talking in their dialect; and to me, they are very real. I never want the series to end, but I don't want them to be written just to take advantage of their popularity. I am afraid the story will suffer if they come too quickly, but I can hardly wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price too high","review":"I am appalled at the high price for these used audio CD's.

However, In This Mountain, was a real disappointment in Jan Karon's otherwise delightful series.The storyline was disappointing, the characters weren't as interesting, and Father Tim's depression was way too drawn out. The lengthy religious aspects of the book made it feel as if I was reading a theology book instead of a book for pleasure. I will stick with the seies in the hopes that the next book will move back to Jan Karon's usual excellent work."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unspeakably bad book","review":"Like those cream-filled cupcakes, the Mitford books are addictive, although bad for you and not even tasty. The first few had a certain charm. The author, however, has long since revealed the full extent of her abilities, wit, and imagination. If you want to read a series of books about a loveable cleric, read Trollope's Barchestershire novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"In This Mountain","review":"I shop only for unabridged books on CD.

Our daughter loved turning the pages and touching all the different textures since she was 6 months old. Eventually she got bored with them so we ordered the Touchy-Feely Mermaids book when she was about 11-12 months.Its definitely very colorful and busy. So much that she seemed overwhelmed as compared to the simpler Usborne books and didn't like it much. She is a bit older so she has some interest in it now. In our experience it didn't seem to be a fun a book for older infant/early toddlers since there is too much to see/read and less to grab/feel. There are sparkly sections but they are smaller.I'd recommend this for older children. The book doesn't have a recommended age but I think older girls (and boys) would enjoy the story of how mermaids live and the colorful underwater scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS BOOK","review":"This book is AMAZING! My daughter absolutely loves it and has been playing with book all the time. She has a basket full of books and this is the one she picks (along with it's twin Fairies).

While this model filters water as well as earlier models, the design of the top cover is just terrible. As one reviewer says, \\" it floats\\" and doesn't sit securely on top of the pitcher. If you grab the handle and use your thumb to open the hatch to fill the pitcher with water, the whole top rocks back and falls off. I would not recommend this model to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your time, or money on this","review":"this was my second attempt at using brita...i had a smaller one and the lid never stayed on and would always fall off when i was pouring my water, so i decided to get a new one thinking it was defective...so i got this one, it was not better at all, completely horrible, you wouldnt think that the company would sell such a crappy product. the filter works fine, but the lid doesnt stay on what so ever, the hole that you would fill with water would always open when pouring a glass of water, i ended up just taping it shut. and the grey handle is on the verge of falling off, its like they dont know how to keep these pieces \\"snapped\\" on the container, it doesnt make any sense and its not worth the $30 i spent on the thing, the only reason i still use it is because of the price and the pack of filters i bought for it. i do not recommend this brand to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid does not fit","review":"The lid will not fit. If forced in place it pops off once pressure is relieved. It doesn't make sense in this day and age of advanced injection molding for something to not fit. I still use it but I have to take care when handling and keep my thumb on the lid to hold it in place.I threw it away. I couldn't get the inner part out to change the filter.

This one, not only does the lid not fit, but when you finally DO manage to cram the lid on, it dribbles water because the lid spout interferes with the pouring.My respect for Brita is zero now--obviously they know about this problem and have done nothing, and keep it on the shelves to suck others into wasting $30 bucks on one.It's sad really, I bought this from Home Depot to reward myself with a larger-capacity pitcher, and only when I got home, and mine didn't work, did I think to go online and check the reviews. Really, for a water pitcher, you shouldn't HAVE to look up reviews--is it really that hard to design one that pours, and the lid fits?Sheesh. It's not rocket science. If this is how poorly they design their pitchers, what are they doing with their filters? I'm switching to another brand--I no longer trust this company to have the integrity to do anything right."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lid is AWFUL","review":"The lid sits on time--literally. There is nothing holding it in place. It's a big pitcher. You need to hold onto the large pitcher AND hold the lid in place or it will fall off when the water is not completely full. The slightest jarring knocks the lid off.This is day 2 and, already, we have had a major spill. We don't have kids in the house. I cannot even imagine having this thing around kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design and Quality","review":"I read the reviews forthis product in whiteand now I really wish I would have taken them seriously. To mirror the same thing most people are saying about this pitcher, the lid will not stay on securely. It completely lifts off the top when you place your thumb on the back of it where your thumb is suppose to go. This is just poor design that can't be overcome unless you like the lid popping off and spilling water all the time. On top of this, the overall quality is poor. Compared to other pitches I've used from both Brita and Pur, this one is very flimsy. The positives are the pitcher does hold a lot of water and the green does make it attractive, but I simply can't recommend a pitcher of this poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I pretty much HATE this thing. The flap over the spout sticks shut. When you get it unstuck, the entire lid comes off. I've probably spilled more water out of this thing than I've been able to drink. Also, the \\"timer\\" seems to measure TIME only as opposed to volume. So it's really useless for a single person who doesn't go through a lot of water as the filter is still good long after the timer says to change the filter. I really wish I had returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"The Brita is exactly what you want it to be.

Because of this, anytime somebody places their thumb on top of the handle while pouring (which seems like the \\"safe\\" thing to do), the lid will pop off. Surely, this company has engineers that are capable of recognizing and fixing this flaw. Unfortunately, somebody must have decided it was \\"good enough\\" to sell instead of spending the money to correct things.

The inside had a bunch of the black particles in it so I ran it through the dishwasher. The grime came off but it was a little concerning at first. The filter monitor at the top doesn't work at all, but I can live without it. Finally, the top doesn't stay on tight and you need to hold it down while pouring.

Due to this, the pour flap wouldn't open, spilling water. Solved by just removing. The lid hasn't been improved in this model and comes off fairly easily compared to other models. I'm using this to replace my Brita oceania model which has poorly designed shape and top water reservoir (angled top). This model does have a great shape for fitting in the fridge.-G"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Brita pitcher I've owned","review":"The top easily flops off. It overflows into the handle while filling. My entire problem was that the lid just didn't fit on the reservoir properly. It's just not up to pat with any previous Brita or Put pitcher I've owned. I did like the digital filter reminder though. So instead of replacing the filter, I'm just going to get a whole new pitcher. I still like the taste of filtered water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy unless you want to always hold the top!","review":"So excited to get this to replace our current Brita Pitcher. This holds a bit more, and I thought it would be fun to upgrade from white to the purple. As soon as I got it, I unpacked it and checked it out. The lid does NOT snap on like my current pitcher's does. It just rests on the top of the purple insert. When you press your thumb down on the purple part to pour, it appears as if that might help hold the entire lid down, but it does lift up some near the front. A total hassle, so I packaged it back up to return and won't be buying a new pitcher now. It's one thing if you can train yourself to remember to make sure the lid doesn't fall off, but if a guest comes over they are prone to possibly spill some water.Don't be fooled by the sleek look of this pitcher! I guess it's too much to ask that they make the lid snap on like their old designs. Ridiculous!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I bought a different model","review":"Just got it from Amazon, and wish I had paid attention to the negative review and bought a different one.

The lid does not fit securely in place so it needs to be held while pouring. This is a large unit and it is awkward to hold while pouring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most annoying","review":"Most annoying, the small cover that effectively seals the spout would suction itself on once wet and when we tried to pour, water would leak around it or actually cause the lid to fly off and water to go everywhere. We even tried creating a notch in the plastic cover, but to no avail. This one with no cover obviously solves that issue. Only slightly less annoying, the carbon bits that would leak down into the main pitcher. So far, no bits. Two thumbs up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really pretty but not as good as the \\"plain\\" Brita pitcher","review":"I love that its red. But thats pretty much where my love for this pitcher ends. Its definitely not as well made as the old Brita pitchers. Very often when you go to pour the water, the entire top of the pitcher falls off. You have to hold the pitcher with one hand and hold the top on with the other. Really annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total bust","review":"Lid is loose and falls off almost with every pour.

The top of the handle is open, wide open. Therefore, the water easily spills into the handle (which is hollow, BTW), and the bottom of the handle is not closed tight, so the water spills on the floor, in the fridge (your choice...) You do not even need to fill the tank completely, halfway is enough, just washing the thing is sufficient, et voila! water on the floor! Magic! Don't buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought I was \\"upgrading\\"!","review":"We've used a Brita pitcher for years, so when I saw this larger capacity one I bought it without thinking twice. Like one reviewer said, you shouldn't have to look up reviews for a water pitcher, but I wish I would have. One, the lid does not stay on like my old pitcher did. If this one has water in the top when you pour a glass it's more than likely going to leak unless you use one hand to hold the lid tightly on. Two, it takes two fills of the top reservoir to fill the pitcher, which is annoying especially when you want to pour a quick glass of water but instead you are stuck waiting for the top to empty into the bottom. Three, the lid spout flapper tends to stick at times causing water to spray everywhere but your glass. Brita, why mess with a good thing? Your older pitchers worked great, just wanted more water per pitcher. Instead I got more hassle than there needs to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this - Horrible Lid Design","review":"Brita has been adamant about not redesigning this lid. Since this model has been out for a long time. Amazoners have been pretty vocal about this for some time but Britta has NOT listened yet. May be if we stop buying this, they will. Also, filters are really inexpensive at Amazon or Costco or Kmart during a sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly designed and frustrating","review":"I'll make this short and simple. The design is awful and not not well thought out. There's a gap between the reservoir and the handle so you have to be SUPER careful and steady when filling and putting it in the fridge or else faucet water will escape down the HOLLOW handle (again another horrible design) and mix in with the already filtered water. This would happen to me every time I went to go fill it and it would always spill out of the pitcher and all on my floor.I also didn't like the way the water tasted plastic-y. It still had a weird plastic taste even after I washed it.I returned it and got the Bobble water pitcher and like that one MUCH better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lid to the pitcher comes off while pouring","review":"The lid to the pitcher comes off while pouring. I'm thinking about returning the pitcher. Having a lid not come off while pouring is the most basic of order qualifiers. I don't understand how Brita has been so successful with this poorly made product. I have to make sure my hand does not knock off the lid when pouring."},{"rating":"1","title":"USELESS!!!","review":"Bought this (not at Amazon) because I needed to replace a very old Brita pitcher that I had (and loved) for many years.I didn't research this purchase too heavily (because I'd never had an issue with Brita before) but I wish I had. This thing is just awful! The small 'flip up' lid falls off EVERY time we use it and the larger lid has to be held down when we pour. The filter can process about 1/2 a pitcher full of water but if we refill the filtration chamber once the first 1/2 pitcher is done, it won't filter at all, and if you try to pour off the filtered water to make room for the water in the filtration chamber, it all leaks out around the insert...mixing filtered and unfiltered water together.In short...USELESS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Tasting Water","review":"I purchased the Brita water pitcher because I was tired of buying (and running out) of bottled water. Our tap water is not bad, it just tastes a bit like chlorine. This pitcher does a very good job filtering out all of the chlorine taste. It tastes very similar (not quite exactly) like bottled water. I am pleased with the pitcher. [...] has some good info."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase","review":"I love my Brita! It is so convenient! The only thing is that I go through filters a little bit faster then they say, but that's just because I tend to drink so much water. Definitely one of the best things I've bought by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy to be using a brita","review":"I am very pleased with the brita pitcher that I purchased through Amazon.com The water always has a fresh clean taste that makes me want to drink water more often.The only complain that I have about the brita pitcher is that the lid does not snap into place like I thought it would. I was disappointed that it did not fit more securely onto the brita pitcher, however it has not really created a problem so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovely to look at, annoying to use.","review":"I love the look of this Brita, and I was super excited to get it (I have a growing collection of purple kitchen stuff). However, as others keep mentioning, the top falls off VERY easily, and the part you flip up to refill it comes off the hinge all the time. Even being careful, I still manage to make a mess every once in a while - the worst part is, if you've overfilled the Brita (bottom is full, some water on top still left to filter), and go to pour, the water on top pushes the top part off, getting water everywhere and get unfiltered water in whatever you were just pouring).Oddly enough, the top fits perfectly if you put it on backwards, but doesn't pour very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made but expensive.","review":"I just bought one of these pitchers and I don't think it's possible for me to be more unhappy with it. The thing cost $30 and the lid will not stay on it. It comes off when you're pouring water and causes water to spill everywhere. Neither the main lid nor the water refill lid stays in place. If you buy this product you will be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"I've been using this Brita \\"Grand Pitcher\\" for about half a year now, and it constantly irritates me. What I find most maddening is how slowly the purified water pours out. They only allowed a very narrow passageway for the filtered water to exit the pitcher, as you can see in the picture. So to empty the pitcher, you have to just stand there for a while wasting time as it oh-so-slowly trickles out. And if you tilt it too much to encourage it to flow faster, the filter falls out.Just poorly designed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brita Water Pitcher","review":"I have this Brita pitcher at home and now at my office as well. No more plastic bottles -- EVER!!! I also think the Brita filtered water tastes better than bottled water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Flimsy Construction","review":"We purchased this unit and quickly returned it. We have had other Brita filters and liked them very much. Upon using and filling this unit I found that it already had a plastic piece broken off and at that point I had only taken it out of the box. After filling and trying to put the lid on it another piece broke off. That was all I needed. If the quality and flimsiness were that bad I wasn't going to mess with it anymove. To save their good name if I were Brita management I would take this unit off the shelves on a recall and redesign the top and make it more substantial and then start selling them again. My opinion of Brita is now in the basement because of the poor quality of this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe water","review":"Good to have at home.Water taste much,much better.I also love the available colors.I like this system very much.Great price also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, no lid problem","review":"This is my first Brita fileter and I've read a lot of the reviews here about how the lid comes off or the filter detaches, well I can gladly say that mine was fine. The lid is a little lose but it never came off when I pour. The filter sits firmly in it's place and so far I don't have any problems with spilling. The water tastes fine, but I don't have anything else to compare it to other than bottled water. The timer is really just a gimmick. It's not based on the volume poured and just reminds you to change the filter in two months, plus you can't replace the battery. Not a huge deal. Overall good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design... Let me count the ways...","review":"Too tall, instead of fat, so you can't get it under the tap without contaminating the pitcher bottom from your kitchen sink (usually the germiest place in any kitchen).Lid-opening button is in a concave area where water sloshes, so unless you wash your hands each time you fill, you're putting germs in with each refill and slosh.Didn't I buy this to get germs out of water, not put them in!You can't pour from it while it's filtering, like my old first-generation Brita.After 2 months the white insert that holds the filter got VERY stuck in the pitcher. No obvious tool would get it out. My choices: make an L-shaped tool to remove it or return the pitcher. I returned it.I miss my original Brita pitcher!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MADE IN CHINA","review":"Just a heads up for those that care. The product is made in China, and when I buy stuff that comes into contact with anything I put inside my body, I always buy things from first world countries because the laws are stricter there. I rarely hear about products being recalled from the USA, Canada, Britain, Germany, etc because of health risks (eg lead paint on children's toys). And I've recently found out that the screening procedure for products that are imported into my country are laughable. And that of the ones that do get checked and rejected, a large majority come from China. Finally, China is the only country that consistently tries to re-import products that have been rejected by govt officials. They just re-box them and and try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can SEE that the water isn't clean...","review":"I really should've read these reviews first, but I just bought this model from Walmart. Our water well developed a leak today, so I bought this filter pitcher to use until its fixed. The water from the faucet is pretty reddish/brown from rust leaking into the tank, but the water in the filtered part of the Brita is still at least 50% as reddish/brown. So apparently the Brita is great at removing miniscule microscopic elements from water, but it can't remove rust and/or dirt? What a waste, going right back to Walmart."},{"rating":"1","title":"BREAKS!","review":"I think that the water pitcher is not only confusing (my room mates and I had the top on the wrong way!) but it also needs to not break when we drop it.

The set up is easy, make sure you read the instructions which are labeled 1 2 3, that easy. Takes about a minute to fill up the pitcher.

The flip top lid pops off as well.I called Brita and they sent a replacement top which failed within a week. They sent a whole new replacement unit and THAT one has the same issue.Conclusion....Brita manufacturing standards have dropped sharply.

If you don't hold on to it while pouring the lid falls off and water goes everywhere. The filter does not fit snugly in the compartment and if you tip the container to get the last of the water out the filter falls out too. And I continuously get carbon particles in my glass of water, no matter how much I rinse out the holding compartment. I gave up on Brita before and I think I will again. I only got it to try to help the environment a little as I tend to buy gallon jugs of spring water, but I'm not sure it's a fair trade. And it DOES NOT fit in my door compartment which is supposed to be specifically for these sorts of items. Interestingly gallon jugs fit quite well in my fridge compartment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This pitcher is driving me to drink (not water)","review":"I don't think I have ever commented on a product before but feel compelled in this case because it is so over the top. The handle on this Brita filter will NOT stay on. Every time I touch it, not exaggerating here, the plastic handle falls to the floor. When I fill it, it falls off in the sink. When I open the refrigerator, it clatters to the floor. If I look at is funny, bingo. Get the picture? This pitcher is very poorly constructed and I would not recommend it to anyone. Unless, of course, you really enjoy picking things up off the floor over and over again. Buy something else. Seriously. Don't do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design!","review":"This is a very poor design by Brita. If i could give the pitcher a zero star rating, I would.

This forces me to hold the pitcher at an angle while I fill it. The reservoir does not hold enough water to fill up the pitcher, so you've got to fill up the reservoir, wait for it to filter into the main area and then fill it again. If you choose not to fill the reservoir a second time then you've got approximately two servings of water before you have to fill it up again.

I was replacing an older Brita pitcher (that I had dropped and cracked) that I never had this type of problem with. There's no reason to have to deal with this.I returned it. Bought the \\"Vintage\\" model, same capacity, on sale for a great price at [...]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Replacement","review":"Got this to replace our old slim pitcher. Over all it's as good as our old one which we liked because it does filter the taste of chlorine in our tap water, but the top keeps fallen off into to sink which the old one never did! There's no clip or anything to keep it on the pitcher, so each time you tilt it to refill, down goes the top. It's just very annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This pitcher is poorly designed and constructed in almost every way imaginable. I have the same spout problem as the first reviewer. On top of that, I find that the filter gets dislodged, and sometimes floats to the top while I am filtering, thereby mixing my already filtered water with dirty, grey New York city tap water. I hate this pitcher. As soon as I run out of filters, it's going in the dumpster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big problems right out of the box","review":"I just bought one of these. I've used Brita pitchers before and have had no issues with them. However, I can't get the top reservoir out of the pitcher. Moreover, there's a paper booklet stuck in the pitcher. I can't find any instructions on Brita's website about how to remove the reservoir. What a pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like the taste of plastic, this is your lucky day","review":"For years I've used the clasic brita pitchers without problems. Then I bought 2 of these more modern brita pitchers, one with a gren top, one purple. It's been a month now and the water has tasted like plastic from day 1. I keep thinking the plastic taste will go away, but it doesn't. I can't believe more people aren't complaining about the awful taste. Yuk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brita 42556 Grand Pitcher","review":"I think the Brita filters do a good job of filtering the water. I just wish the pitchers were better made.

If you try to pour water before while the upper chamber is filled the lid comes off and the water spills out all over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Bad","review":"This is the 3rd Brita water pitcher I've ever owned. The first two were great (needed a new one because they were left with roommates). This pitcher is unlike them though.Cons-Top cover doesn't fit at all, falling off far too easily-Water leaks out the back handle-Filter comes loose while pouring-Bad filter fit means black carbon particles get in to drinking water belowWe'll buy another Brita, because we have 4 unused filters and are used to the taste, but hopefully the next model we try will work better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"We received this as a wedding gift and loved it at first. As the time to replace the filter drew nearer, the water began to taste really, really unpleasant. It is nice to have the indicator to show when the filter needs replaced but it is difficult to reset after replacing the filter.As many reviewers have stated, the lid is not the best. It doesn't fit on very well, in fact it seems to just rest on top of the pitcher instead of clipping on. Also, the spout often needs to be held open as opposed to coming opened when pouring as it should. When the spout sticks, it makes a giant mess and is unpleasant especially when pouring water in the dark at 1am.We are currently looking into replacing this pitcher with something else. Although the complaints I have sound like minor, trivial things they are actually quite frustrating as the product is not functioning as it should."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought a name like Brita would know how to make a lid","review":"Boy, was I sorely mistaken. I saw reviews on here about the lid, the fact if falls off when pouring. I thought, yeah sure. Well, I found out I spent $32 bucks on a leaky pitcher where the lid does not fit securely, falls off when pouring. DON'T waste your money on this poorly made piece of plastic. Sure, they are pretty colors, but c'mon - the thing is not made well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid Falls off","review":"I bought this because Brita has such a good reputation, and it was an extremely attractive product. However, the lid is very poorly designed, and frequently falls off during use. Everyone in my family has had problems with this. I never had an earlier version of the Brita, but I wish there was an alternative, because the lid issue is a real nuisance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product but Scope for Improvement","review":"Getting access to good tasting and pure water while in college can be hard sometimes. This Brita filter is everything a filter should be. It makes water taste great, has a nice electronic timer and a cool rubber grip. The only problem is that when you fill it with water and pour it without it being entirely filtered, it spills. It would've been better if one could get the filtered water instantly. This product keeps me hydrated and has taught me patience."},{"rating":"1","title":"How hard can it be?","review":"I have 2 brita water filters in my home. Both of them leak after i fill them and then pour water. They have hollow handles which for some reason get water in them, then when pour the water it leaks out of the hollow handle. My floors are wood and tile, they become damaged or they become slippery when wet. How hard can it be to design a water filter bottle that doesn't leak? Too hard for Brita apparently. Still they are major provider of these type products. I hope they improve or someone else enters the space and designs something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid not staying on","review":"Everything you have read about the lid not staying on this model is absolutely true. I bought it at Kroger on a whim before reading the reviews. After trying it out at home, I immediately noticed that the lid did not stay on --even before I tried filling the pitcher up with water! Note that one reader has suggested a rubber band solution, but why use a rubber band for a brand new product that is not that cheap? Personally, I would rather not buy it in the first place. There are other models that dont have the same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap lid","review":"I've been a loyal Brita pitcher owner for years and years. We bought this new one and after only a few days the spout lid broke off. After another week the middle of the lid snapped off. Now the whole rest of the lid won't stay on and there is nothing on top at all. We paid over $30 and I am NOT happy at all... Plus my kids can't stand the black specks from the filter. Might be time to change our filter system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black residue swimming around?","review":"*What are the little black particles swimming around after I fill it with water ? (It's not from our water, they're coming from the filter) Maybe it's something to help purify the water, but I don't think we're supposed to be consuming them.*The filter (which came with the pitcher) doesn't fit as it should, so it leaks what ever residue builds in the top compartment?*We CAN'T drink the water filtered in this pitcher.*The lid doesn't fit quiet right, but it hasn't presented a problem thus far (maybe I've become accustomed to lower standards since we've been manufacturing everything in China).I had high expectations... I might anticipate this level of performance had I purchased it at the Dollar store, but for $30? I should have known better, after all, it is plastic. I only paid $65 dollars for a real glass electric kettle made in Germany... a plastic pitcher shouldn't cost $30. Talk about an exponential profit margin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JP","review":"I purchased 2 of these within a month. The first one that I purchased, the lid did not fit properly. It would leak water when pouring. I returned it for another one, only to find that it was made the same way. I promptly sent Brita an email questioning this DEFECT. They basically told me to STUFF IT. That they were all made that way. It's funny, the Brita pitcher that I replaced, was made much better than the new ones. I do not recommend this item, it is of very POOR quality, and you will not be happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible user design","review":"Does it's job in cleaning the water. Instantly tastes better.Does take a few minutes for the thing to fill. You fill the reservoir in the top and wait for it to drain to the bottom, come back a few minutes later and repeat until filled.It has a filter use counter in the top that measures the number of pours and then tells you to replace the filter. The filters are expensive - bad for the consumer and good for the company. I would guess the counter runs a little on the short use side.The design is horrible though when pouring. The lid doesn't anchor to the top - it simply lays on it. Tilt to pour and \\"BAM\\" the lid falls off onto your glass of water. I have cleaned up more filtered water than I have drank with this.I'm not sure what that does to the filter counter - probably throws it off.Really BRITA - how did this make it through user testing?I would tell you to look at some of the other models."},{"rating":"2","title":"tips and tricks","review":"The instruction manual says to set the filter in a glass of water and let it soak, to rinse well by hand, and to run 2 pitchers of water through it before use. I'd add this: run 2 pitchers of water through it... and let it sit in that second pitcher (submerged) at least for a few hours.And realize that you're only using half of the pitcher -- the filtration basket takes up the other half, and you don't want to have water in there when you're pouring (the carbon particles float around up there constantly). I'm basically using this to fill another pitcher; it's just a bonus that the filter almost works fast enough to use in real time, so even worst-case I'm never more than a minute away from a glass of water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Filter Anything!","review":"I've been using the Brita water filter pitcher for almost a year now--since we moved into our new home with well water that tested high for nitrates. I recently got an under-the-sink filtration system, and I went ahead and ordered a TDS meter.Our well water from the faucet tested at 440 PPM.The well water that was filtered from the Brita pitcher with new filter tested at 420 PPM.Since we went ahead and installed our under-the-sink system, our water from that system tests at a mere 40 PPM.Don't waste your money purchasing this $30 filter pitcher with $20 refills of filters. If you seriously want clean water, choose something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it but we're still using it","review":"We bought ours at a Target and the lid does not stay on and would fall off if not held in place. Also the orange plastic piece that snaps on the handle persistently comes off. We would return this if it didn't involve a 40 minute train ride out to the Target near us. Maybe the ones sold on Amazon are of a different stock and are not defective.

A few years ago I replaced my old one because it was looking old, it worked fine. With the new one that I got it developed green mold once in a while so that I would have to scrub the pitcher monthly. There were parts of the pitcher that I could not clean that remained green colored. So I scraped the pitcher and drink water from my tap now. I did some research and found many other similar complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad design","review":"Months ago I bought a similar pitcher at Costco (called Vintage model.Today I opened the box and washed the pitcher with soap. Here are the 2 major flaws:-> An opening at the top of the handle allows water to go inside the handle-> The water inside the handle seeps from the bottom of the handle to the outside of the pitcher.We have another pitcher bought years ago. The design is not as flawed as this one but it is still hard to clean properly because of too many ledges, nooks and crannies where water stagnates and allows bacteria to grow (check for slightly pinkish color). I am also unhappy with the large amount of black deposit in the filter holder and in the bottom of the pitcher.I still have plenty of filters to use - thanks to costco:( but when I am finished with this supply I will look for another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"The ergonomics are terrible, the lid falls off at the slightest angle, the filter also dislodges at moderate angles, and it lets carbon bits get EVERYWHERE.

It does a great job of purifying the water since my tap water taste foul. I don't have the lid problem as other customers have, however i do notice that charcoal does float up to the staging area every now and then. The charcoal doesn't bother me as long as it doesn't find a way into the bottom storage area. I love the taste of the final filtered water and it has made my budget a ton cheaper. So far I have been using the same filter for two months and the filters seem pretty cheap if i only have to replace them every 3-4 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"This pitcher is very poorly designed.

It falls off when you pour water. It even falls off when you move the pitcher. It's easier to just throw the lid away, because the water is going to slosh out whether there is a lid on it or not.

For instance blue roses have been around for decades if not centuries. Her descriptions of characters are haphazard at best and non-existent at worst. If she wishes to continue a career as a writer I strongly suggest that she at least read a few books in her genre and take a few novel-writing courses. This could have been a charming story if the plots were not so muddled; she had stuck to one main plot and no more than two sub plots. The preponderance of sub plots scanty clues, sloppy introduction and description of action of the characters make this book scream amateur, leaving the reader to wish the bleach had spilled upon the only copy of the manuscript before a publisher could read it. I would urge anyone about to purchase this novel to reconsider and look into a cat who book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Appetite to Read More","review":"This review is for the audio version. This is the first book I have read of this series. However, this book is the fifth in a series and the main character went on and on about her ex husband. This is after she has already remarried so I can only imagine how the first four books must have dwelled on it. I thought the premise of this book was interesting: catering a low fat luncheon for a cosmetic company. However, the book was downbeat mixed with corny and I didn't care about any of the characters. I also didn't like that the author would negatively stereotype people if they were physically unattractive.

Most glaring was Goldy's best friend being named \\"Maria\\" rather than \\"Marla\\" as she is called in the other books in the series.

I thought I was ordering the same exact item, but was sadly wrong. The plastic on these was quite a bit thinner than the others I bought. I went ahead and put them up anyway. They didn't even stay attached to the adhesive backing! The adhesive stayed stuck to the cabinet, but the plastic spice holders fell away.This product is a flimsy excuse for spice rack organizers. I was happy with the speed and delivery from the company, but did not receive the quality product I thought I had ordered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spice rack organizer","review":"A very good idea in concept, but fails in reality. The plastic clips hold the spice containers ok, but the adhesive strip on the back is very weak. It won't hold the rack and they fall to the counter. We have 12 of these and 10 failed.

They hold the weight of the spices with no trouble and are easy to get spices out of. The only caveats are that it really works well with the McCormick style bottles that have a skinnier neck. Generic bottles that are wider are more difficult to get into the clips. And make sure you get them where you want them before you put them on. They don't come off once they are even lightly stuck.

The size can't be beat and I can bring it anywhere and listen to music discreetly. Originally, this was a 3 star review, because of the crappy included earbuds. However, with some equalizer settings and a good pair of headphones (Sennheiser CX 300 B), this nifty gadget cannot be beat.

Its just so easy to take with me and slip in my jacket or pants pocket when I'm not using it. One minor qualm the headphones, while comfortable and easy to keep in place don't provide the best sound quality.

I dare say that you will not find a better workout mp3.There are other negative qualities that might turn some people off. Not being able to select specific songs means that you will be clicking the forward button god knows how many times before you find it, constantly having to sync with itunes to get your playlists into it, given the mood your in (unless of course you like having Metallica followed by Barry Manillow) and like I said earlier \\"honey, have you seen my shuffle?\\"...lolAll in all good value, you can't go wrong with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"I bought this item for use when walking/running and during downtime.

I was concerned about the size, as it is not much larger than a postage stamp; however, the bright pink color makes it easy to find.

I will probably purchase directly from an Apple store or buy an mp3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst player I've ever used","review":"The shuffle is the perfect size to use while running and that's why I chose it. Unfortunately its a horrible player.It doesn't allow use of a standard mini-USB cable to upload songs. It requires the special base that you will need to tote from location to location to access the player and you have to use iTunes software rather than just simple drag-and-drop. Also finding a song can be a pain - you may have to click and listen, click and listen.... over a hundred times to find your song. I prefer my previous mp3 player that is also very small but allows you to drag and drop, uses a standard mini-USB, doesn't require a special base, doesn't require proprietary software, and has a small back-lit display to help find specific songs and has an FM radio and was cheaper.I can only recommend the shuffle if you like iTunes software and only need to access the player from one single computer where the base is located."},{"rating":"2","title":"ipod shuffle 2gb","review":"Very small, so it is easy to loose but good for the $$, bought as a gift for a runner/biker and seems to like it a lot.

Unlike the other types of ipods, it clips directly to clothes so your hands are free. It only plays songs at random, so you cannot select specific songs. However, this is perfect for a younger child or during exercise. It's also not so expensive, so you don't feel like you have to protect it as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Went bust after 2 months","review":"Not very happy with my Shuffle purchase.

I figured I would purchase the same one because I liked it so much. I got this in the mail and it looked like it was in good shape, but upon use the battery life only lasted about 1.5 hours where my old one would last almost a day without continuous use. Since apple has now put out a new model of the same thing, I recently bought one. These things are tanks otherwise, I use it when I hit the mountains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks great, sounds great ... song choice limited","review":"The Shuffle looks great - I have a cute little pink number. It sounds great - doesn't matter what I plug it into, sound quality is awesome. Is lightweight and great to train with at gym - I usually clip it onto a gra strap and then don't touch it again from start to finish of a workout. The problem: If you particularly want to listen to a song you have on it, you have no chance With no screen display, scrolling through tracks is hugely time consuming and frustrating. Conclusion: a great product if you just want to use it while running or at the gym."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ipod fan here","review":"My wife and I use Ipod shuffle still to this day. They are good for the gym and great for running. This is good for people who don't need a screen to know the song and can just listen to full albums or a playlist. Monster Cable has some good headphones these fit in and it makes it great for running. We have 4 (pink, orange and 2 silver) and carry then running.

Could not bare to get a new one that had a computer voice talking so rushed to get this before they were all gone.I am glad I did. As far as all the bad reviews on the base I don't see the problems with it. I would imagine if you are careful it will last forever. If not there are loads or aftermarket adapters for next to nothing. I have been using it for the gym and it is fantastic. Sounds great with the supplied headphone but sounds fantastic with my better Shure headphones. The best part is that it converts larger songs down to 128 and that was a feature my large generation ipod doesn't have. I was actually able to fit almost 500 songs on it and trust me, that is more than enough music not to hear the same song for a long while.

For the same price, you can get a full featured MP3 player that holds 2 to 4 times as much music. With that being said, what the Shuffle can do, it does fairly well. It's also very tiny, so that might be a plus to some. I give it 4 stars for not costing me anything, and working well.Edit: The average price of the \\"Shuffle\\" has dropped below $50.

The jewel colors of the newer ones are attractive and cheerful on any outfit. With the sturdy clip feature, the Apple shuffle can even hide beneath my clothing when wearing it on the outside is inappropriate. I like Apple shuffles because they hold just the right amount for a long walk, interminable times in a waiting room or a quick research visit to the library. Whenever I get a song stuck in my head, the Apple shuffle loads it easily and plays it in my ears until I have become satiated with the annoyance and it disappears. I keep one Apple shuffle loaded with songs that cheer me up and motivate me for doing chores around the house. Versatile and handy, the Apple shuffle is my pick of the iPod line up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupidly overpriced","review":"When you consider the Sansa Clip 4GB has twice the storage for the same price, trading the OLED display for an Apple logo makes no sense whatsoever.NOT recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy...","review":"I have had my shuffle for over a year now.

You also can't organize folders - all types of songs go into one long playlist. At 2gb, it holds a lot, so you may have to go through a LOT of songs to get to the one you want.

The size of this iPod could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you look at it. I carry a small purse without a lot of stuff in it and I had a hard time finding the thing. The perk to having a smaller iPod is that it doesn't take up a lot of space. One of my other gripes is that there is no screen there to tell you what is playing and how much of the battery you have left.

The exercises are impossible to understand as the author has employed the use of a wooden art class figurine to illustrate poses. The photographs of this wooden model do not have enough contrast to serve as illustrations and are thus totally useless. Buy Yoga, Mind Body Sprit by Donna Fahri for a much better explanation of body mehanics and with higher production values."},{"rating":"2","title":"A priceless introduction to Somatics","review":"I give this book a 10 star rating. I just love the Cat Stretch. There are live demonstrations of it on Youtube. I have been doing it daily for 3 months and with each passing day I feel more release of chronically tight muscles. I've had faster results with Somatics than with Egoscue. If you don't have the advantage of seeing a Somatic Educator (which I believe will give you even faster results) then the individual exercises in this book will suffice. A great compatible book to this one is by Craig Williamson called \\"Muscular Retraining for Pain Free Living\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Body Exercises that make Choropractors obsolete","review":"The principles of Somatics absolutely address all your aches and pains whereby you take control to put yourself back in place by training your muscles.

Their bodies are on \\"auto-pilot\\". Hanna makes this clear to the reader and then discusses how the reader can re-awaken their brain circuits and change their body programming, releasingmuscular tension, using the exercises in the back of the book. Granted that the wooden figures showing the exercises can be difficult to discern, it is worth your patience to work it out.Your body will thank you. I have adapted many of the movements to my table work sessions and always assign one or two movements as homework. You can do much on your own.

This is a story about the power of love. I also enjoyed the setting -- Nantucket -- and the whale and cooper industries.I've always felt that there's several people you could be happily married to -- but there's probably only one real love of a lifetime. And that is the case in this book. Even though Laura enjoyed being married to Dan, her heart had always belonged with Rye.Have read all of LaVyrle's books and put this one in my own top 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting premise, but falls a bit short","review":"The concept of a husband long suspected lost at sea returning to find his wife married to his best friend is certainly an interesting concept, but ultimately, I feel, this story falls short of its potential. I did not feel sympathy for Laura and felt that her character was weak and did not inspire empathy or compassion. Rye, while I felt sorry and empathized with his situation, was rather annoyed by his lack of respect for the Laura-Dan situation. In the end, I liked Dan best of all and felt that he conducted himself the best given the situation, and actively felt sorry for the man. Not really how you want to end a novel, feeling sorry for a man other than the hero!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The idea sounded very interesting, but","review":"the book went on and on. All the descriptions of the town, weather, ocean, people, etc were too boring and I started to skip paragraphs and pages to get to some kind of action. I couldn't see, what was so special about Laura to have 2 such good men fell in love with her. Seemed to me, she didn't want to make any decision and was waiting for either one of the them to give her an ultimatum. That way, she sort of didn't have to decide for herself. And, actually, Dan was the one who started the legal proceedings, not Laura. Last couple of chapters were easier to read, since there was something going on there.That is the first book I am reading by this author, and I am not sure if I am going to read any of her books again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could say I liked it,","review":"but I didn't.

I've enjoyed this album thoroughly with its emo-ish vocals like \\"a bullet in the head, the sweetest kiss.\\" The lyrics aren't plain and repetitive, as someone else wrote on this page.

The UK remix is powerful. Anyone who doesn't like this one has no soul and definitely cannot dance. It's pure energy and power. The horns are tremondous. How anyone can hear this one and not jump out of their seat is beyond me. The rest of the album is average to above average at best.Still a must for any 80's R&B fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring movie with boring acting","review":"I am usually very open to movies of any variety, but with The Life, I was bored almost instantly. The movie is very slow, and the acting, when the movie focuses on the actors, is very weak and unsubstantial.I did find the interviews pretty interesting, however, when they interviewed people who lived a life of stripping, prostitution, what have you. It was interesting to see why some people did it, whether they had to to make ends meet, or whether they just enjoyed the work. You can find some interesting perspectives, first-hand, but I would recommend finding a book or something with a little more substance that details the oldest profession in the world, if you wanted to learn more about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the 86 minutes.","review":"This was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I could not even watch the whole thing. the plot line, if you can call it that, was so vague it could not be followed. It was more a bad documentary of prostitution than a movie. To top it off, it wasn't even the movie I was looking for. There is a Canadian film by the same name starring Katharine Isabelle that I was looking for and got this piece of trash instead.Don't waste your time and money on this. Darryl Hannah and Dinese Richards should be ashamed of making such a film. They are both quality actors and this was so beneath them."},{"rating":"1","title":"the life of boring","review":"The life more like the boring, don't even know how it made the top downloads if you want to see interviews with a bunch of hookers and gigolos from around the world that's what it is there is so little movie part in there save your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Life pretty much sucks...a horrible concoction....BLEH!!","review":"Denise Richards (Valentine, Wild Things, The World Is Not Enough) and Daryl Hannah (Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2, Splash) are barely even in this damn stupid movie about sex and life. There's a lot of subtitles and a lot of stupid s**t that goes on in this horrible mess of a movie. Richards is studying on sex so she interviews people, who pop up and talk and never stop and they dont go away and this movie never stops. The director must of been on lots of pot when he came up with the ideas..using real people to speak and we have to suffer threw subtitles reading about how these people like to have sex, what positions they like, how to do it properly and so on and so forth. Just cut the malarkey and shut the hell up.....probably one of the worst movies out there so far...a gargantuan BOMBBBBB. Richard and Hannah are wasted"},{"rating":"1","title":"One good actress, one boring film.","review":"This movie fails all parameters but for Denise Richards' acting; here she displays a dramatic range not apparent before, for which the movie deserves a star. The movie would have been a hit about 1972, but modern audiences see cinematic sex as patronizing. This film at once attempts to titillate us sexually and educate us about the evils of prostition, but fails as both eroticism and intellectual stimulation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meditation on prostitution","review":"Half movie fiction, half documentary, this film is presenting male and female prostitutes and porn stars trying to make a distinction between the two professions. In the midst of prostitutes confessions as to how they got into the oldest trade, are two female characters: young graduate student in anthropology (Denise Richards) and her neighbor failed actress/high class prostitute (Darryl Hannah). As every prostitute has a story on what got them into a trade, so do these two major characters. While one is already a high class prostitute, the other is being carefully guided into becoming one. Interesting meditation on how people get into the situations like these and why they get stuck in there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Denise Richards Strikes out","review":"A bad movie.

But really the film is not good at all, it is slow, the elements don't match. It is sometimes hard to follow. It is really not worth buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"POINTLESS","review":"The film starts to run, people talking about their sexual adventures and experiences with occasional glimpses of the friendship of Hannah and Richards , Hannah is a high profile whore and Richards is a college student who needs money to continue her studies and shes desperate for that reason however the story is pontless too, people interviewed keeps talking again and you see no point, and continues and.......No point, and Continues and.........No point and then i get disturbed watching an idiot fourthysomething with teenager attitude and he states (nobody asked him by the way) that he is 24 years old!!!!!! what an idiot!!!! i dont know how the person who interviewed him could not laugh till a heart attack risk, im not saying all films have to come to a conclusion but this subject requires at least one.This film sucks!!!!!!!HM"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a point to this movie?","review":"Every store should have a DVD shredder for movies that suck. Rental stores should offer refund upon return of this movie and immediately throw it away. Adding Darryl Hannah and Denise Richards to an already horrible story line just to sell DVDs is a disgrace. Trying to do 80's style cinematography to add artistry and color just made this movie suck more. Maybe the book version tells a different story if there is one. Save your time, money and eyesight by avoiding this storyless video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive","review":"Deceptive package. The amount of time spent by the two female leads onscreen is basically an afterthought. Way too much time is spent interviewing real hookers/pimps/gigilos. Can you say boring?! There are also issues with the captioning/subtitles way out of sync with the film. Low tech 2ch sound, grainy picture. It is worth watching to see Denise Richards get 'doggied', although way too briefly. For rental only by hard core fans of Richards and Hannah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"I only gave this movie 1 star becasue I wasn't able to give it zero (0) stars. Fans of Denise Richards and/or Darryl Hannah will be disappointed. Reading the plot you think it's a twist on Wild Things. Basically it's a documentary talking to prostitutes. Richards and Hanna are in the movie for about 5 minutes total screen time. Pick yourself something else to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time","review":"My objection was the implication that the \\"stars\\" played a part in the film. I felt that the picture was completely deceptive. Ms Richards and Ms Hanna had less than 15 minutes (maybe a little more but not much and possible even less) and were clearly there to fool the viewer. It was an interesting documentary about prostitution and it might have been an interesting and revealing film if the the stars had been left out and it was done only as a documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated touchy-feely","review":"I'm aghast that this is still around after all this time.

I would lose all of the music on the player for no reason and finally the thing just died after about a month. The company was great and gave me a new player to replace the original piece of crap I bought. They didn't give me a hard time or didn't question me at all. I was very pleased with that.I still have the replacement and it's been at least a year.

The mood is a little somber, but Isham's trumpet work shines along with Lande's piano. When it first came out, I remember that reviewers likened Isham's trumpet sound to \\"Middle Miles Davis\\". That may be true for the Miles' sound from \\"Neferttiti\\" or \\"In A Silent Way\\". The highlights are the tunes \\"For Nancy\\", \\"Jami's Birthday Song\\", and \\"A Monk In His Simple Room\\".I understand that this CD is only available from used Euro imports. I cannot understand why ECM has not reissued this album in the U.S. There are other fine ECM albums from that era like Timeless (John Abrecrombie), Gnu High (Kenny Wheeler), Return To Forever (Chick Corea), and Watercolors (Pat Metheny) that have been reissued. This album is in a class with those respected releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"When I first tried this stuff, I really didn't expect what happened.

Cracking jokes in pidgin French, broken English, and whatever random syllables seem to be laying around at hand, these folks make no sense, but they sure have fun.

They met at the Rhode Island School of Design. I've heard many comparisons to the B-52's and that fits, except that when the one French member of the band, Celine Dijon, sings she takes us beyond a 60's French pop reenactment band into, can I say it, greatness.

It's not really a book - it's a collection of dim-witted aphorisms related to men's fashion. There is an average of 4 such phrases per page (\\"The Hawaiian shirt: no\\" or \\"Expensive shampoo smells really good\\") x 150 pages = 600 common sense proverbs in all.

Even more irritating than the lack of substance is that there is no order to the book - it's just a random scattering of one-liners. A simple index or table of contents would have tripled this book's usefulness. As it is you'd have to take notes or create your own table of contents if you wanted to use it as any sort of guide.

Yes, as some reviewers have noted, it's a quick read (wait: that's bad?), but the shelves are already sagging with self-important books that purport to be encylopedic guides to fashion, and how many men have time to sit down and read an encyclopedia? Amazon's page clearly indicates this book's compact size and modest price--I mean, how big a book do you want for ten bucks?.

Speaking of boring, has anyone seen the suits that are featured these days in ESQUIRE? Tight-fitting rigs that show a big belt buckle, too many buttons, tight legs, and probably being worn by some young guy with a three-day growth. Experts on style?

This is a sexist belief that I strongly believe we need to leave behind with the Twentieth-Century.Anthropologists are beginning to realize how our world would be a much safer place if only men felt more free to express themselves and their feelings. I don't think that it would take a genius to realize how the limited-expressiveness in male \\"fashion\\" is related to the limited-expressiveness of male life in-general in this society.In an age when men are *finally* beginning to break free of this fashion slavery, the last thing we need is a booklet full of conservative rants deisgned to turn-back the clock, disguised as fashion advice.

Having followed Equire's mission to educate men in sartorial style--not fashion--over several decades, I could not help wonder whether this book is a reflection on mens' loss of attention span or that of the authors. First, the pluses: the book is short (nominally, 152 pages; given the white space, about 65); reads quickly (if it takes you over an hour, you fell asleep); and wit (\\"Shaving does not require so much foam that your face resembles a meringue pie\\"). The minuses: zero historical context and questionable advise; e.g., [Re rings] \\"Silver or platinum or white gold, not yellow gold\\"(One cannot be well dressed wearing a gold wedding band?).

I did not want anything to expensive because in the shop they would get dusty and take everyday abuse. During my surch I found Fluance, I had never herd of them and took a chance on them. WOW they sound great, plenty of bass, great sound stage. I've had Polk bookshelf speakers in the past and these sound almost as good at half the cost. They fill my 500 square foot shop with great sound, and I listen to all types of music from classical, to country, to rap, to blues, to rock and they all sound amazing. The best part of all I can no longer hear the hate radio, and I'm sure he can hear all my tunes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good speakers for the price","review":"I am an audiophile and currently own a high end system in my living room. I was looking for small secondary system for a den and found this speaker at attractive price. The speakers are bigger than expected but the enclosures are very well made using good materials.With the sensitivity of 89, 14 watts t-amp makes wonderful sounds!The bass is little weak side but highs and mids are very clear and produce transparent sound.For the price, I don't think you can get better speakers. I can say that it'll be really hard to find better speakers even at $300."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Find","review":"I had been looking for some bookshelf speakers for a while when I stumbled across these Fluance SX6s. I had never heard of Fluance before, but after reading the positive reviews I decided to roll the dice. First, the packing was great. No way these were getting damaged in the shipping process. Equally awesome is the lifetime guarantee that comes with them. Speakers are the right size and weight for a bench set up. Still breaking them in, but like what I'm hearing so far. And for under $100 I'm definitely a fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price!","review":"Bought these to go with a yamaha rxv673 for fronts on a small home theater with a polk 10 sub the mids and highs are good and the polk handles the lows.Very pleased with them!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Band Just not True grass","review":"I saw this band in concert opening up for George Jones last year and I rushed out and bought the cd only to be disappointed. On their cd they don't play the same energetic truegrass that they did in their show. I reccomend buying one of their older albums instead of this one. This Album is far too watered down for a true bluegrass fan's taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best Album Yet!","review":"This band just keeps getting better and better! On this, their latest effort, they broaden the scope of their music with songs about topics in the headlines every day as well as songs true to their mountain roots.Also the addition of Clay Jones adds yet another dimension to the already diverse sound qualities that make up Mountain Heart. The vocals are always first rate, but somehow they seem even tighter and more heartfelt this time around. If you like great bluegrass music without any pre-conceived titles or boundaries then you'll love this CD. It includes traditional as well as contemporary styles of bluegrass while still capturing the Mountain Heart passion and \\"sound\\" throughout. A must have for any bluegrass fan or just a fan of great music. Pick this one up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Force of Nature by Mountain Heart","review":"This dvd was a gift for my brother.

So I bought the CD, and it is vastly different from what I heard. In my opinion, the songs on this CD are closer to country than real bluegrass. I gave the CD to a friend who also loved their Telluride set, and he just gave it back to me without even listening to the whole thing.

It is as fresh and vibrant today as it was back then. The musical arrangements are brilliant, the songs top-notch and it shows that Astrud Gilberto was not just a singer; she was a musician.

It is the only cd I own that I don't have to skip a track. Each song is so original and full of emotion that you never get bored. The cd has a wonderful mix of up-tempo beats and moving ballads. If you like pop/rock music, you won't be disappointed by Lifehouse's No Name Face. I know that I still haven't been able to pick out my favorite song because I just love them all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Absolute Best","review":"This CD is my favorite our of all the many CD's i own. I can't say enough good things about it to express how much i love it! I bought it in July and throughout that month, everyday, that was the only CD i listened to. Even now in November, I am still listening to it constantly because whenever I have time to listen to music, I will always listen to this disc countless of times before I move onto a next. The lead singers voice is amazing and the back-up music is great with lots of variation. You are able to emotionally feel things through their music and their music is REAL, unlike most of the pre-fabricated music out there. It's not \\"pop\\" or a fad that's going to come and go, their music is timeless and I will always love this disc!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty, real, irresistible","review":"This is one of those CDs you got for free somewhere and didn't remember you had until months later. It's raw, it's real, but it doesn't grate your ears or your stomach. Lifehouse manages to ride the line between angry rock and easy listening by being honest and up-front while letting you know it's OK to share the gamut of feelings present in the songs. It's like listening to someone tell their story and nodding your head in eager agreement. This is one CD that won't grow old with time even as you change and grow within your own life, because the emotions here are part of that thing called Life."},{"rating":"2","title":"music for the soul","review":"it's been a while since i've heard lyrics and guitar riffs that have uplifted me with such grace and power as \\"No Name Face.\\" You'll notice that a lot of these reviews use the word \\"uplift\\"...and there's simply no better way to describe the experience. Jason Wade's voice is mesmerizing--almost surreal--and it completely embraces you. Like Creed, the group has Christian undertones...and yet the lyrics are multidimensional enough to be relevant to anyone who listens, whether or not they're a believer. As for my favorite track: \\"Everything\\" breaks the heart. The first 4 minutes are slow and soothing...and then *BOOM!!* you're hit with a TIDAL WAVE of raw emotion. Jason's voice brings tears to the eyes. You have to hear it to believe it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing new band","review":"I, like many people, really liked the song \\"Hanging by a Moment\\" when I heard it on the radio. I'm a huge fan of matchbox twenty, so I went to the concert and had the pleasure of seeing Lifehouse perform live (as the opening act). They were UNBELIEVABLE! They sounded SO GOOD live. It wasn't until after the concert that I bought the album and now I only wish I could see them perform live again so I could appreciate it more. This is one of those rare albums where I liked nearly every song. That is very rare for me. I cannot believe the lead singer (and writer and musician) is only 20!!! This is a young band, with enormous talent. I look forward their future work & seeing them again live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD !!!!!","review":"Lifehouse is a great band, i love the singers voice, it's original and very nice. The songs all have a message in them, and they really mean something. To me, the most romantic song is \\"Breathing\\", just listen to the words in it and you'll understand, but i also like faster songs : \\"Sick cycle carrousel\\", \\"Somebody's else song\\", \\"Somwhere in between\\", \\"Hanging by a moment\\" are my favorite songs but that doesn't mean i don't like the other songs because i do !! It's a real pleasure to listen to this album of a band who's just beginning, but i'll bet Lifehouse will become very famous one day, that's sure..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"I must say, the lyrics on this CD stand up for themselves, they are beautiful.

They need to write better music to go with their awesome lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Name Face","review":"This is a must have disc for anyone that likes plain old rock and roll with a good messege.These guys have a very strong future.I look forward to thier next disc.They also put on a great show!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"\\"This is the best CD I have ever listened to!

The composition of each song is simple yet so moving. If you're tired of all the bubblegum pop and boy bands that have infiltrated the music world, then your ears are more than ready for this. I bought Lifehouse on the mere sound of Hanging By A Moment but was in for a greater treat when the rest of the album proved to be way better than the single.Wanna start your day off on something inspirational, almost spiritual, with a rocky edge, spin this CD for a listen. You wont regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifehouse shines its light for new artists to see","review":"Straight out of the box, Lifehouse is a young, unpolished, and yet superbly talented group. With the hit single, \\"Hanging by the Moment\\" listeners are grabbed, and hopefully tempted into the purchase of the entire album. Rest assured this purchase is not in vain, as the slower tracks such as \\"Somebody Else's Song\\" and \\"Simon\\" are just as much a part of this bands sound as their radio-rocker single. Lead singer Jason Wade tends to sound a bit \\"Creedish\\" at times, but the deepened tone of his voice shows edge as well as a soothing tone. I highly reccomend this album, and I cant even imagine where this band could go as they learn even more about themselves and their music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrong Track List","review":"Just thought i would let everyone know that the track listing is wrong, it should go:1.

The debut effort from Lifehouse is extraordinary especially since I'm an eighties music fan... .What a relief that Lifehouse shows such promise and produced a compilation of amazing energetic songs(Hanging By A Moment and Sick Cycle Carousel) to the soulful ballads(Everything and Somewhere in Between). The incredibly gifted Jason Wade exudes tremendous maturity for his age with his inspiring lyrics . . . just listen to Everything and in his words - \\"how can you not be moved\\" as you become enraptured by the powerful words and music.This cd definitely rates a 10!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome C-D","review":"No Name Face is an awesome C-D and Lifehouse is an awesome group!

I have read a few of the other reviews, and no one seems to give the last song, \\"Everything,\\" the recognition it deserves. It is by far the most beautiful song on the album. I have to listen to it at least once a day! I would highly recommend this CD to anyone, it is an incredible CD. Good work, Lifehouse!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not original","review":"I bought this album having only heard \\"Hanging By a Moment\\". Unless you are deaf, I don't see how you couldn't like that song. It has great lyrics, catchy hook, everything you could ask for in a song. Well, there is nothing else on this album even close to being as good. If I had to pick my second favorite song, I guess it would be their new single \\"Breathing\\". \\"Somebody Else's Song\\" is also OK. The main reason I gave this album 4 stars instead of 5 is becasue even though this CD is pretty good, it sounds like a lot of other stuff I've heard before."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD you can buy!!!!!!","review":"This CD is my all time favorite!

I happened to catch the tail end of their \\"Hanging\\" video one day and made a mental note to search out their CD. I had no idea what a goldmine of music it was to be.From the opening track to the last spin of the disc, this captures what music should be- riveting melodies enhanced by thoughtful lyrics.I find it difficult to compare it to other groups currently out there,as I truly think they're head and shoulders above the rest. To name a favorite song is difficult,because literally every one is memorable-but, \\"Breathing\\" has got to get some air time out there. I have not taken this out of my car CD player for over 1 month now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD I've Ever Come Across ...","review":"The first time I heard \\"Hanging By A Moment\\" last year right after 'No Name Face' was released, I instantly loved it, so I ran out and bought the CD, and I have to say this is the first album I have ever had that I actually like all of the material on it. All the songs from the deep love song 'Breathing,' to the hit-you-hard-there 'Quasimodo' are wonderfully written and preformed. If you want a really, really good CD, 'No Name Face' is a must have ... and no body I know disagrees. Lifehouse is for sure not going to be your typical one-hit wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE!","review":"I'm absolutely in love with this CD!

Hanging by a Moment is a wonderful song! I was a little afraid about going ahead and buying the CD without hearing any of the other songs, but I had heard a lot of good reviews about it. So I went ahead and bought it- and what a great choice! No Name Face is easily one of my favorite CDS, along with groups like 3 Doors Down. I love the CD! It looks like Lifehouse has a promising future ahead- I know I'm a fan of them now. I would love to find out some info about them if anyone knows anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal.","review":"Being a fan of these guys since the Blyss days, it is easy to say that I do and always will love them. No Name Face is just THAT album, the one that will change your life in some way. All of Jason Wade's songs are incredibly brilliant, but the 12 tracks on NNF tower above the rest, the highlights being Simon and Everything. I haven't gone a day in 4 and a half years without listening to NNF, and I encourage everyone out there to make it a regular part of their lives as well. You will laugh, cry, reflect, dream, and feel new with this album. Jason's incredible voice and words reach down into the deepest parts of your soul and pull all of your emotions, good and bad, to the surface, where you can clear your mind and free your spirit. This band is worth every second of your time and every cent in your wallet. I also recommend Stanley Climbfall, their second release, which is an amazing upbeat rock album. Look for their new self-titled CD on March 29, 2005. Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"review of the import","review":"hey, i reviewed the normal US version of this album and gave it 5 stars also. the album and the band are great - if you're here, i imagine you're wanting to know about the 2 rare tracks added at the end of this cd (that make the price DOUBLE).What's Wrong With That is lifehouse's weakest rare track, and the only song of theirs that i would say i'm not a fan of.Fool, however, is an amazing song, as good as some of the songs on the actual album.Personally I can't recommend this import - if you like Lifehouse and want to hear some rare tracks, look around the internet and download them. Some of the others are Revolution Cry, The Edge, You Belong to Me (from the Shrek ST), Crown of Scars, Fairytales and Castles, Mudpie, and the amazing Storm. These songs were, like many of the NNF songs, written during their former incarnation as Blyss. They are worth seeking out, but it's not worth the extra money for this import."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifehouse rocks.","review":"I bought No Name Face in June 2001.I haven't stopped listening to it.I bought it having heard only \\"Hanging By A Moment\\" on the radio. I expected to like about five songs off of it - I certainly didn't expect to become a crazy Lifehouse fan like I am today.All the songs are gorgeous, but by far the one that stands out the most would definitely be \\"Everything.\\" It's the most beautiful song I've ever heard. It absolutely moves me. Close behind it are \\"Breathing\\", \\"Somewhere In Between\\" and \\"Only One.\\" I'd have to say my favorite is \\"Everything\\", because it's just so beautiful.I've noticed people compare Lifehouse to Creed, and I think it's pretty close. (Only thing is, Lifehouse is way better in my eyes.) Lifehouse's songs have spiritual meaning in them, which I think is great - whether you're Christian or not you can enjoy their beautiful lyrics.It's certainly not a waste of your time and money. If you've been questioning buying NNF, DON'T QUESTION ANYMORE! GO BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic debut!!!!!","review":"I just got Lifehouse's debut CD No Name Face and I have to say it is one of the best debut albums I've ever listened to. All the songs are filled with emotion and you can tell that the lead singer (forgot his name) has really experienced all the things he's singing about. My favourite song is the new single Breathing, because it is just such an innocent song and one that anyone can relate to. Other favourite are Hanging By A Moment (of course), Sick Cycle Carousel, Somebody Else's Song and Only One. So if you haven't got this album yet what are you waiting for? Go out and buy No Name Face today...you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD will blow you away","review":"I bought this CD with the faith in the song \\"Everything\\" that I heard on Roswell. \\"Everything\\" blew me away and so did the rest of the album. These guys can't be compared to sound like anything. \\"Hanging By a Moment\\" isn't really the greatest song on there, and if you liked it, prepare to be blown away in my likelihood. No Name Face deals with sensitive issues and plain old love and still manages to knock you off your feet. This is a must buy for anyone who enjoys any style of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"The single \\"Hanging by the Moment\\" is very misleading of the band.

This cd contains intraspective, highly intelligent lyrics that are numbing at times. The songs are beautifully crafted and written. Mr. Wade is definately a promising young songwriter. The music is reminiscent of Matchbox Twenty, Creed , Pearl Jam and even a little Vertical Horizon. Lifehouse maintains its own identity, however, and produces a solid product. Standout tracks include \\"Hanging By a Moment\\", \\"Sick Cycle Carousel\\", \\"Trying\\" and \\"Quasimodo\\". No Name Face has a lot of mellow moments, that need close listening. These are NOT the Backstreet Boys......"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Hanging By A Moment\\" is all they have got.","review":"I am a 21 year old male and this is my take on this album. \\"Hanging By A Moment\\" could be in my top 10 songs of all time but that is all this album has to offer. When you listen to the other tracks it sounds like a completely different artist. I would have bet money that \\"Hanging By A Moment\\" was done by a completely different artist than the other 10 tracks. My advice is to not waste your money on this album. The other tracks are horrible. If whining and moaning is your type of music then you might like this album, but if you are buying it because you think that all the tracks are like track 1 then don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO MUCH POTENTIAL ..SO LITTLE TO SHOW..","review":"HANGING BY A MOMENT HAD TO BE ONE OF THE BEST ROCK SONGS OF THAT ERA....IT WAS FRESH....CATCHY AS HELL!!..KILLER MELODIES...SO HOPING THE ALBUM WOULD FEATURE MUCH THE SAME I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I GOT THE CD...HOWEVER THE SONG \\"EVERYTHING\\" IS AWESOME... MAKING THIS ALBUM STARTING + ENDING WITH A GREAT SONG BUT FILLER IN BETWEEN..WAIT FOR THE GREATEST HITS FROM THESE GUYS........"},{"rating":"1","title":"One hit wonder","review":"Ummm yeah... that one song you hear all over on the radio is the only good song on the whole cd. Not what I expected. I have owned this cd for a while now and tried a number of times to listen to it, but I can't get past the second song without hitting the next track button a few times and then the eject button. Most bands have one or two ballad type slow songs for the females, but that is all this cd is. It's like the cd was written for the top 40. They probably figured if they release a whole cd of alternative-slow songs at least one will be a big hit and get played over and over again. Don't expect more than the same type of songs repeated on this cd. I am not saying this is the worst cd I have ever heard, but there are a lot better out there. Save yourself the money and just buy the single. I don't expecet to hear much of this band after this cd wears out."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, banal, and bad. Perfect for radio.","review":"If Wade would just shut his trap, the songs would be tolerable, barely. His voice is so pathetic. And the drummer is so leaden. These guys definitely are tailor made for FM modern rock radio. FM modern rock radio [STINKS]!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How many Eddie Vedders are out there?","review":"Great, we're still stuck in this quagmire of post-grunge unoriginal pop music. Same old story...perfect that Eddie Vedder voice, learn to play guitar, create that perfect surfer-punk- baby-face look and WHAM!..you're the next hit band. If you like what you hear every day on top 40 radio, YOU'LL LOVE THIS BAND."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the best of alternative rock","review":"No Name Face is an excellent C.D. When i first heard Hanging By a Moment it was in one word ... phenomenal. I knew that i had to buy this C.D. as soon as possible In the end however, track number 11, Quasimodo became my ultimate favorite song. This C.D. is a stupendous buy and i would reccomend it to anyone who likes to listen to real music with meaningful lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved every single song!","review":"I am not exaggerating when I say this, but I loved every single song in this cd. The songs kind of grow on you because the first time that I listened to it, the only song that I liked was \\"hanging by a moment\\". After listening to it a few more times however, I began to like the other songs as well, even more so in fact, and now I am absolutely addicted!The lyrics are well written - very introspective and sometimes even poetic, without sounding like a personal diary. The melodies are also great - not too heavy on my ears, and Jason Wade's voice just rocks! Sometimes I don't even bother trying to understand what he's saying because the way he sings the lyrics is enough to make you feel what the song is all about.My favorite track is \\"unknown\\" - i like the guitar intro, the chorus (which is really catchy), and the lyrics. But like I said, every single song in this album is worth listening to, so go out now and buy the cd, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Will Move You","review":"This must be one of the greatest CD's I've ever listened too...it's that good! My friend told me about them right after the CD came out when someone bought it for him. After getting myself a copy, I was blown away. There is not one bad song on this CD. Every song sounds perfect and you can connect with them on so many levels, both spiritually and emotionally. I've played this CD for almost everyone I know and not one person has told me they don't like it. The best song on the CD if I was forced to choose would have to be \\"Breathing.\\" The lyrics blow me away every time I hear them. Another standout song is \\"Everything,\\" an awesome song to close the album with. It is so moving and so touching...you have to listen to it for yourself. You will not be dissapointed with this one. It's an instant classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best cds I've ever listened to, period.","review":"That pretty much says it. I don't have to skip one track on this masterpiece- i can enjoy it all the way from Hanging By a Moment to Everything. If you're into Creed, 3 Doors Down, Dust for Life, & anyone else in that nature, or if you're looking for some nice easy-listening alternative music, you'll LOVE this cd. If all of Lifehouse's cds are gonna be like this, then they're my new favorite band."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can anyone call this \\"rock\\"????","review":"Warning to consumers grazing along looking for \\"Rock\\". I see review after review labeling this release as rock. I'm not saying this is a bad effort by Lifehouse because clearly I would be wrong since there are over 600 reviews with a 5 star rating. The production is really good. But personally, using my definition of rock ... you can't go to sleep listening to rock ... rock wakes you up ... this effort in its entirety is not rock ... not even close.Really I think the amazon review nailed it best with \\"melodies that mark Lifehouse's radio-friendly sound are not unlike those of matchbox twenty or Live in their softer moments\\" and \\"think Crowded House at their lilting best\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\" 15 minutes of lame\\"","review":"This CD is a double take of repetitive lyrics and melody. The never mood of the music never breaks away from a group of melancholy love sick guys. Each song sounds exactly like the one before; and as far as variety, tragically the listener will find none. It is sad that the only \\"winner\\" on the entire work is the first song. But one can only listen to one song so many times. Overall this CD would be one of the worst and least original sounds to hit the industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay CD but not nice in person","review":"This is just another poor example of how stupid people want to be famous. These guys are jerks in person and their cd is of pretty much poor quality. In my personal opinion it's a no good buy but the choice is yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to rate as 1 star to offset all the stupid 5 stars","review":"Compared to their latest album, this album is terrible. This album really only has 3 good songs, the rest are sung horribly, with a musical background that is pretty much not cohesive, and incapable of flowing correctly. It's like someone took a chainsaw to the rest of their songs.This is seriously crap compared to their latest album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD used t be cool...","review":"I used to love this cd #12 was me and my GF's song we ent out for 2 yrs and now i hate this cd i broke mine than but another one just to break it this cd is truly homoriffic.....sorry i would like it but it kills me to hear it but i loved everysong i used to fall asleep to it at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man, what a great sentimental album!!!!!!","review":"This is by far the most sentimental cry making album in the history of lifehouse!!It takes me back to sad times and really makes me feel like I'm stronger now.This album is such a powerful yet beautiful thing.Any music lover today, can't miss this one on their collection!!!!!Specially if you've or are going through hard stuff in life!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifehouse's \\"No Name Face\\" stands out","review":"Lifehouse's debut album \\"No Name Face\\" is a promising emergence of a group that surely will have a lasting musical career. Released by DreamWorks October 31, 2000, \\"No Name Face\\" soars above all with its undiluted, honest lyrics, wistful melodies of the guitar, and singer/songwriter Jason Wade's soothing voice. Wade delivers lyrics with conviction on songs such as the title track, \\"Hanging by a Moment,\\" and other outstanding songs, \\"Simon,\\" and \\"Quasimodo.\\" This debut album begins and ends with songs brimming with such raw emotion that it leaves the listener begging for more. Lifehouse's \\"No Name Face\\", with its truthful lyrics, ranging from painful to uplifting, and melodic tunes, is a first album that marks the start of Lifehouse, a group that, as evident from this debut album, will be hanging in there for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An explosive album with great songs for dancing and relaxing","review":"If you need an album to get you through a day or year this is the one to buy. It has songs for every single mood you are in. First track Hanging By A Moment is one great example where you are on top of the world (It was also the most played song in 2001) It also has songs for those of us in love \\"Breathing\\", \\"Somewhere in Between\\" and Everything\\" also songs for those of us that feel lost and alone \\"Simon\\" and \\"Quasimodo\\" the entire album is great. If you are only able to buy two cd's this year and you don't already have this one. Buy two copies because you will wear them out!!!Emily"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Having released four albums now, Lifehouse has not managed to recreate the magic of their debut, and I doubt they ever will. Every song on this album is an absolute gem. Every song speaks to you as if it knows your thoughts. The melodies are amazing. This was Jason Wade at his finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great addition to your precious CD Collection","review":"I bought the Lifehouse Album \\"No Name Face\\" all thanks to a good friend of mine. And it wasnt because of their hit \\"Hanging by a Moment\\" which is a good song but radio stations always do a good job of playing things out. Anyway, she made me listen to \\"Somewhere in Between\\" and that same afternoon I got it. This is one of those albums that you dont need to press the Skip button because you dont like one or two songs. Also, its an album that can stop listening to and I dont get tired of hearing it everyday. The lyrics are deep but give you space to have your own interpetaion of them. If you're into Pop or Rock or both this album is perfect for you. If you're into Soul Searching Songs, this album is perfect. Hopefully you'll get this Cd and tell you're friends and family to help Lifehouse become one of the greatest bands ever. Trust me you won't regret it and it will help you in any problems you've got. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not one of these 12 tracks is one to skip!","review":"I have been in love with this group ever since I saw them perform \\"Hanging by a Moment\\" on the Craig Kilborn show in December. I immediately bought \\"No Name Face\\" and I'm pretty sure I've burned tracks into it listening to it so much. Every single track is hard hitting, but soft spoken. The words hit home for me, and that's what I love so much. All of the songs are from personal experiences, and are intentionally left open for interpretation however each listener feels. Jason Wade's voice is melodic and seems almost effortless as it jumps into your ears. I've seen Lifehouse twice in concert, and they are AWESOME live. I got to meet the band, and in addition to being the greatest new band to hit the scene, they are also the nicest guys in the world! This CD is awesome, a must have for anyone with good musical taste. You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too soft","review":"I have been hearing \\"Hangning By a Moment\\" mostly on a local alternative station.

Reminds me of Matchbox 20."},{"rating":"2","title":"was a hater now a lover","review":"The first song I heard was \\"Hanging By a Moment\\".

Jason Wade wrote amazing lyrics and the melodies are awesome. I know almost every single word to every song. You just don't get tired of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a REALLY great album","review":"Every track on this album is like a walk in a dream. Just something you can get really lost in when you're driving to work or just stuck in traffic. I've never owned a cd that I enjoyed every single track on... and this just does it for me. I sincerely never had a favorite band until I picked up No Name Face. I remember hearing the first single on the radio, Hanging By A Moment, and looking on the internet for any information regarding the band Lifehouse. When the first single came out, they didn't even have a single web page up yet. I thought maybe I had mispelled the band's name, or misunderstood hearing it on the radio. Now, here I am, buying... yet again, another copy of this album after losing another 2! The songs will open your mind and touch you on a personal note. Careful people, this one will make you think. Everyone can relate to every lyric, if listened to correctly ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah, blah, blah ... yada, yada, yada","review":"I was bored. It's not that this band lacks talent, it just seems to lack innovation. The first single was grossly overplayed which didn't help a song I was already bored with. This whole CD just sounds too much like everything else on the radio that's in the same genre. Again, this isn't a \\"bad\\" CD, it just lacks pizazz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen Closer!!!!","review":"This CD is about love, but it's about love for GOD, not a girl.

This CD shows a lot of growth from Buck. He focuses on a range of subject matter throughout this album. On \\"Slow Ya Roll\\" and \\"Buck The World\\" he gets introspective, talking about hood life and how tough it was for him and his family. He has loud, anthemic songs like \\"Get Buck\\", \\"Buss Yo Head\\", and \\"Lose My Mind\\". His voice glides with ease over \\"I Know You Want Me\\" and \\"Hold On\\". All 18 tracks on here are good if not great. I personally like his first cd slightly more, even though this cd offers more diverse subject matter and a larger variety of songs. The whole cd is great from start to finish. It is the best G-Unit cd to come out since, well, his last one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad","review":"after the first couple of tracks on here, the album starts getting pretty good. i mean its hit or miss with most tracks on here, the whole g-unit thing is kind of played out, but buck still manages to bring his A game. i noticed about half way through the album why i liked young bucks style so much...he sounds exactly like tupac, i mean 2 pac had far better lyrics but their delivery is very similar. maybe thats why i liked this cd so much....the beats were great, hardcore bangers and very deep bassy grinders, a couple of lovey dovey songs on there, but all in all a good effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUCK THE WORLD","review":"THE SECOND CD FROM YOUNG BUCK AND THE BEST CD OF THE YEAR.

As someone mentioned in another review, the production on this CD is good enough of a reason to buy the Album.Young Buck style is a good blend between G-Unit gangsta gangsta and the southern slower and more melodic sound. This is good music to bump in your chevy with the top off during dem hot sunny days. There's a few skippers, but mostly good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really what I waited for","review":"After getting Buck's album I have to say that I am not impressed with the lyrics.. The beats are nice, but they should be with Dre in your corner. Throughout the whole album Buck rarely changes his delivery or rap pattern. Has he not learned anything from Lloyd Banks second album. This album is OK but simply does not have the energy of his project. I respect Prodigy and Lil Flip more than buck because it seems like he cannot do an album without 50 cent. Buck is from Tenn but spends half his album talking about New York. If you need something to listen to desperately or you just listen to beats then you should buy it.

It kept appearing whenever the watch would change temperatures for about two weeks, and now I've noticed that the alarm function has started failing too.

One good thing: The chapters were short --- just right for bedtime reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Clancy Obviously did not write this one!","review":"I agree with the others who panned this. It is full of obvious errors, and they show the gross ignorance of the author. The one that got me and sticks is his description of the men in the Sampan using the oars to get close to the yacht. They 'oared' there. Oared is not a word. When men use oars to move a ship, boat, or any floating vessel, the term used to move it is ROW. You row a boat, you use 10 foot oars in a viking ship to ROW the ship. One paddles a canoe, but one does not OAR a boat. Obviously this book was thrown together in as short a time as possible, given minimal proof reading, and then published. Tom Clancy should be ashamed to have his name put on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly lousy book.","review":"I snatched this book off the english book rack at the Munich airport thinking it was a Tom Clancy book.

Bought this DVD on-line, spent money on a full set of snowboard gear at local sports store, and went snowboarding. I also paid 3 hours of 1 to 1 instructor. While this DVD can't beat a live personal instructor, it allows your skill to progress when not physically snowboarding. The video will help you to get off the lift chair the correct way. It will also show you how to ride either goofy or regular. This DVD gave me an edge over other first time snowboarders. It also helped me to progress from novice to intermediate in snowboarding. Bottom line: Watch this DVD, then get a personal instructor."},{"rating":"2","title":"COVERS THE BASICS!!","review":"Covers most everything you would want to know as a beginner Snowboarder.The Progressions are well explained; and demonstrated for leftys and right foot riders.

It makes good sense to preview this before you try to get on a Board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough Detail","review":"I'm a lifelong skier, but after seeing all those people on snowboards having so much fun, I finally decided to try it for myself. I bought this DVD hoping to accelerating my learning curve. On the plus side, Kurt the instructor is a lot of fun and he gives you a lot of exercises to practice. However, there's just not enough detail. For some people, learning to do toeside and heelside turns may be intuitive, but for me, I need much more detailed directions. All he pretty much says is to dig your toes or heels into the snow! On the slopes, my instructor went over a lot of things (weight shifting, hip positioning, etc) which Kurt never mentions in his video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere","review":"Dated teaching materials.

Incompetent physicians, critical patients, demanding families, lazy co-workers, and of course the constant surprises, are all highlighted in hilarious quips. I love how Heron makes nursing sound as challenging as it is. I have been working critical care for only a short time but its amazing the power that your knowledge has over determining a person's outcome. Heron highlights different scenarios and what interventions she had to do to make sure that the patient's condition improved. She is an extraordinary nurse and an excellent author. This book would rattle many would be nurses, while getting an appreciative nod from experienced ones. Its a great book and Heron should be proud of this work. It really shows people how hard nurses work and that there is a lot of compassion in this field."},{"rating":"2","title":"A witty, thought provoking and poignant book.","review":"This book was given to me by a friend, and I really enjoyed it.

However, her writing is somewhat choppy and even slow in places. I felt disappointed at the end of this book, somehow let down by her lack of 'depth' and insight into the suffering that she witnessed daily. Her clinical evaluations and uplifting sense of humor were a treat, but spiritual and psychological observations were not easily found in this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgets Who Nursings worse enemies are","review":"I found the book entertaining, because like Heron, I used to work as a nurse and am now a full time writer. I also lived and worked in the Bay Area, and know the hospital that she writes about. However, Heron seems to find enough people to lash out at, but she seldom mentions that nurses are their own worst enemies. Nurses rarely if ever stand up for themselves, they are great at complaining among themselves but when it comes to doing something about a problem--well, nobody wants to rock the boat. Nurses are great at backstabbing, they don't stick together--in short, nurses are treated without disrespect by doctors and hospital administrators because they tolerate it without a peep. So it always bugs me when high and mighty nurses complain about everyone under the sun except themselves. As for Heron's writing, it is okay but a little melodramatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus and Elohim; Are They the Same God?","review":"The points this book tries to bring up can be more so asked about the differences between Jesus and Elohim.this book asks; \\"how it is possible that we see a total contradiction in the message of the Bible and the message of the Quran?\\"The fact is that Jesus contradicted Elohim on the laws of divorce, sabbath, defense, dealing with adultery, parents, food, etc...This book also ignores that the momentous 10 Commandments from Elohim are reaffirmed in the Quran while they are abolished in the NT, you can't get more contradictory than that. Elohim punished millions of people in the OT for not following the 10 Commandments, now this book wants to tell us they never mattered?Allah is more similar to Elohim than Jesus ever was, yet this author time and time again displays a grave lack of knowledge of all three Testaments.John B"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book best suited for the trash bin","review":"The title sounds impressive, but again the neophyte author, \\"Sherly Isaac\\" humours us with her bad English and convulting, repulsive arguments.

Go read any of the articles about Joey, not this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting, carefully-crafted, heavy.","review":"A gut-wretching biography of a beautiful man who could never get a handle on his life. It tells us a good bit about the exploitive gay-porn industry in the unhappily meteoric career of Joey: quick fame, over-exposure, and sinking star. The destructive catastropes of drugs, AIDS, self-destructiveness all come home in the life of one of the hottest bottoms in the porn trade. The final third of the bio moves with an inevitability that is good, but sometimes pretty obviously worked. You won't forget this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragic or Pathetic","review":"I expected this book to give insights into the porn industry and its ride to ruin, but I didn't get that. All I came away with was a junkie who sold his body, used dope when people treated him like an object, then died. The author kept a neutral attitude toward the pornographers that was journalistic, to be sure.

The problem here is bland writing, an obsessive dwelling on the boring \\"tragically doomed\\" aspect of porno, and completely unsubstantiated research."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Parable for Our Gay Times","review":"With the explosion of porn distribution on the net and the constant rise and fall of \\"stars\\" being basically anyone paid to be naked for an orgasm in front of a camera at any time in their lives, the story of Joey Stefano is a cautionary tale that many ought heed. This entertainingly written and fairly well researched biography is a brief but revealing text. Perhaps Stefano's life could not carry a longer book, either. In any event, the reader will join him on a fast down escalator into self-destruction that shows the reality of low self-esteem, emotional insecurity, and short life span (in the marketplace or, like Stefano, literally) that often marks the human fabric of this industry. Well worth the investment of time and money, not least because a number of the people in the book, like Chi Chi LaRue, continue as active presences in the business of the meat market."},{"rating":"2","title":"LONELY GAY PORN SUPERSTAR GETS THE RECOGNITION HE DESERVES I","review":"He had AIDS...most didn't know this. He wanted love and fame and friends...he got fame, maybe just a few friends. He did drugs...and ended up where most who do drugs get close to before falling off as he did. This is a hell of a book. What it lacks in photos it more than makes up for in the new art of voyeurism that is the porn industry and the authors of books who are brave enough to write about a segment of the American population that the mainstream fears to tread into. Four stars--FOUR BIG ONES FOR OUR JOEY! f fletcher"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad End For A Good Person","review":"I had always been a ardent fan of Joey Stefano and was very saddened by his death. His young life was tragic, depressing and too short. Much of what he went through is detailed in this well written book by Charles Isherwood in no holds barred graphic detail. Although an insightful look into the world of the gay porn industry, what struck me more than anything else was that Joey Stefano was a good person, albeit, with his own personal demons to battle (as we all have) which ultimately gained the upper hand and destroyed him. Another thing evident in this biography is that Joey's purported friends were anything but. When he needed them most he was cast adrift and virtually on his own. I hope Joey has finally found the peace he sought in his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Fit","review":"Great idea, but should be adjustable to fit all window sills.

The only thing is they could feel more secure - after reading some other reviews I'm thinking they fit a bit funny because we have newer vinyl windows.

I keep 2 on my bedroom window, and my wife and I will sleep with the window cracked and don't have to worry about any intruders. I didn't give it 5 stars because if someone is strong enough or applies enough force/momentum the lock will move, it's not easy and it will make a lot of noise, but it still can be done. Though, if one did someone get in my machete is a great second line of defense. Hehe."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these locks!","review":"Fantastic product - it gives you everything you want and for super cheap! Yes, you do have to have the 'right kind of window', as other reviews advise. As long as you have a piece of metal or wood that you can attach it to, it should work (I'm not sure about the measurements to make this work). My house is 23 years old, and it worked beautifully on all but one window that was not well renovated.They take less than a minute to install and make it virtually impossible for someone to open the window without removing the lock. I placed them so the windows could be opened about 2 inches (from the inside for ventillation).

Actually, I bought a 'double,' which is to say it is a bar with two little screws, not one, for about $2.47. The item itself isn't great, I'm using it on patio sliders and what I've noticed is this item is only as good as the window frame it's installed in - in the case of my slider door that's not great, as the frame is very thin. If someone were to wrestle the door they could still probably rip it right off, even tightened down maximally. So it's more of a deterrent in that regard. For windows, though, or sturdier door/window frames, this is probably a very practical and economical solution. I have installed one along the top and one along the bottom of the door frame. Since I'm installing this to secure the slider with a 'dog patio door,' which prevents the slider from locking the usual way, I am definitely going to back it up with a security bar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, but doesn't work for me","review":"These window locks are good, but don't work with my windows.

Incest is a freaky subject, and the scenes with the normal looking people freaked me out way more than the guys from the Caveman commerical did.

The manifest \\"horror\\" in this film..., two mentally warped idiot twins born from incest..., looked like little more than hunched over stage hands in overalls with shaggy hair. They carried hand axes that were too small to chop wood let alone bones. Yet they seemed to make short work of cutting people up.

Films like Friday the 13th and Madman are what I grew up on. That being said, Lake Dead is not a tribute to such classic B-horror films: it's an insult. The plot is absolutely twisted, the acting is horrible, and the effects are pre-70's. If you are trying to cash in on the fans of 80's horror, take a few notes from films like Hatchet.
