My first time at visiting the hilarious, wild, thought provoking and wonderful Discworld. Since this book I have read all but the most recent of Terry's Discworld series and with a couple of rare exceptions (Intreresting Times being one) they are truly the pepperoni slices on the pizza of literature! Mort will forever remain my favorite, closely followed by Guards, Guards, as we follow the misadventures of Mort in his apprenticship to DEATH (just having DEATH 'speak' in capitals is funny). And who knew that HE liked the odd curry and hated people who were cruel to cats. No series of books has made me laugh out loud so much, and NO humorous book has made me care about its characters to such an extent that the climatic fight leaves me not wanting to read on, but having to!

But Mort realizes that this job could be killer on his love life and that by defying the rules of reality for love he had just messed things up big time. A story full of Death, love, Death, accion, Death, hourglasses of life, Death, magic, Death, scythes and of coarse DEATH.I loved this book alot. We got to see a big side of Death, WHO ALWAYS SPEAKS IN CAPITAL LETTERS. Mort remindes me of me, and there is nothing better then finding a character in a discworld novel that reminds you of you. My only problem with the book was that the book seemed to drag on sometimes and it could have been a little funnier. Overall, it was one of my favorites.I recomend this book much more for Teens of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT BOOK","review":"If your an old Prachett fan and you like DEATH, then read this book.

This one though is slightly better than most. I think the main character Mort should make return appearances in future books and to my knowledge he hasn't.Basically Mort becomes Death's apprentice. I don't want to say anymore but I have a feeling that this part of the series contributes significantly to Death's ongoing stories as the most recurring character in teh Discworld series.

I am very dissatisfied. There is nothing here that you can not learn by reading the Trade Station manual.

There are also some strategy examples which are slight modifications of the ones appearing in their previous book, and some interviews with system developers, that are unfortunately about 2 years old. What can you learn from the answer to questions like \\"What do you think the hot markets and stocks are this year?\\", when the answers are two years old?In summary, overpriced and almost useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails to live up to expectations or its price","review":"The information about TradeStation is easily replaced with the manuals available from the company. The trading systems included have some interesting features, but the design and analysis is far inferior to what you'll find in, say, Conway & Behle's \\"Professional Stock Trading: System Design and Automation\\".

I've read this book 3 times now and each time I read it I find things that I missed the time before. If you like her other books, then this one is definitely a must have.

I expected more after reading Carried Away. I strongly suggest if you have a gift card then buy this book but not with your own money."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE TIME","review":"This book entices you with a potentially interesting plot and potentially interesting set of characters, but its clear after a few chapters that this won't turn out to be much of a mystery, and that there really won't be much logic to anyone's actions. I don't know exactly what the author had in mind when he thought up this, but its clear he had plenty of help from all the TV shows of the 60's and 70's. I could swear that some of the characters and scenes were borrow ed straight from them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ERRATIC WRITING","review":"I don't think the author remained consistent throughout the book, and this left me with a very cold, empty feeling when I finished. The book started out as a mystery, but changed almost midway into a character study and finally into an old fashioned, get-the-bad-guy-while-being pursued-for-a-crime-I- didn't-commit kind of book. None of the storylines was adequately developed and the romatic/erotic aspects were totally out of place. The author needs to come up with a hopefully original and creative concept and be disciplined enough in the writing to develop it completely, and resolve things completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ABLE TO EXCITE OR THRILL THE READER","review":"You wonder why the author chose this set of characters in the locale. It could have been a terrific murder mystery, but the murders were absolutely preposterous and poorly thought out. The characters were so illogical and unbelieveable it was difficult to really get involved in their actions. Every hero has to have his \\"ghosts\\" and the one for this hero had some potential, but the author developed this in such a plodding and unrelenting style that it left little room for the reader to understand. The ending was a weak and dull conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAVES YOU WITH A BIG EMPTY FEELING","review":"This book is so poorly written and developed that you really don't end up with much when its over. The mystery is quite weak, and judging from the comments of other readers, it is very predictable and unsuspenseful. The characters are very unrealistic and are unable to emerse the reader into their emotions and actions. The American lady, in particular, comes across as someone with deep-rooted problems and how she and the Chinese lawman could hit it off is totally unreal. The symbolism of the mystery to that of the theatre escapes me and was quite muddled to me. The motives behind the entire plot are absolutely ridiculous and impossible to accept. So, you're left with a strong feeling as you read through the book that everyone--the characters, the villain, the author--is just going through the motions to arrive at an ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH! I should have read the reviews before buying this book","review":"The reviews of this book were dead on. Never again will I try something from this author. I have never read such a dull and mixed up mystery with so much potential and such a terrible job. Plot, characters, theme, were all tired and borrowed from other works. Not a book I want to remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS WAS ONE THAT I DIDN\\"T ENJOY","review":"The author lacked the strength and forcefullness to pull this off corredtly. The descriptions of life in Shanghai were dull and weak stereotypes of what you'd expect. The characters were predictable and exactly what you'd expect. In fact, the problem with the whole book is that the author really didn't come up with a creative approach and instead, took heavily from TV shows of the 60's. I dont think this book is worth reading for those reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"LACK OF BELIEVEABLE CHARACTERS MAKES THIS A MESS","review":"I think the author wrote himself into a corner with this, and didn't have the creativity or the energy to work himself out. That an Asian lawman would fall for a western woman is a bit of a stretch, especially if the woman is a grieving widow whose husband has just suffered from a serial killer. Naturally, the woman has to be a tall, gorgeous blond, but I found the situation wholly preposterous and insulting to both races. I don't know why the author had this in the mystery as it really had little to do with the outcome of the novel other than offer the reader some cheap titillation. I wish the author had stuck to the real issues in the thriller and kept it at that..."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING AND BELOW PAR","review":"Started out interesting but quickly sank into a boring and unrealistic mystery with run of the mill characters and plot. The ancient theatre metaphors were ridiculous. Characters were boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO WEAK OF A BOOK ON TOO MANY FRONTS","review":"Not a particularly good mystery. Not a very accurate or plausible police procedural novel. Not a very good exploration into modern day China. Not a good character study. In the end, this book fails to capture much attention and the characters are forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and compelling","review":"Although there are times when the menace of Shanghai's social setup makes for uncomfortable reading, I found this book to be utterly enthralling. I would rate it right up there with Andrea Camerelli's work as not only a good mystery, but a satisfying window into another culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP THRILLS THAT ARE POORLY DONE","review":"I felt the plot was preposterous and the characters were predictable and boring. I didn't like the attempts to get into the background of Fong as they were way too melodramatic. Couldn't get into the book at all, and the author's style was way too complicated."},{"rating":"1","title":"WEAK AND UNSATISFYING ENDING","review":"The idea of murders in a foreign country solved by the local police is not new, although the Chinese slant should have been interesting. I found that the author didn't really develop the characters enough, and the global conspiracy issue was old and trite. Love affair was completely off-base and ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNINTERESTING AND PREDICTABLE","review":"This book has many flaws and inconsistencies so that it is very difficult to appreciate either the murder mystery aspects, or the erotic love aspects. Female lead character is wholly unrealistic and superficial--I don't think the author really developed her at all. Male lead had many potential interesting aspects but none of these materialized. I thought I was reading a made for TV script that had all the cheap elements of teasing the reader (viewer). Skip this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT MUCH EXCITEMENT AND UNORIGINAL","review":"I found the book terribly predictable and very unoriginal. The mystery theme was very weak and not really well thought out. Any global conspiracy that I would imagine would have a better means to achieve their end then what Rotenberg would have us accept. The characters were like paper dolls and never seemed real."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH READING","review":"Like other readers, I found the plot to be quite unreal and illogical. The motive behind the murders was really a stretch. Some of the characters were memorable and striking, but the overall plot was way too predicatable and boring.

It seemed to me that the author didn't take the time to really labor at making the locale and setting right to the reader. The love interest was totally preposterous, although, the authors' predictable style was so blatant, you could see this was coming for miles. When it did occur, it was by no means interesting or even facinating--just another boring event to get over with so we could move to the end of the book. Why did he write this way???"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A BORE!","review":"Not enough originality to this one. Boring plot and characters.

The book was a tease--it promised so much and ended up with nothing. I can't see why some like the gritty style in describing Shanghai or in describing modern China for that matter--nothing really unique there. The lawman Fong seemed to be interesting at first but the abrupt changes at the end were unworthy and deceiving. Definitely not my cup of tea..."},{"rating":"1","title":"FORGETTABLE","review":"The plot was quite simple and easy to predict. Characters were rather one-sided and not worth caring about. Some interest in the descriptions of Shanghai and China, but you could have gotten much better from National Geographic. No one has commented yet on the love angle and, without giving away the plot for other readers, I have to say that I for one was a bit uncomfortable with it. The author could have made this more understandable and even acceptable if he had bothered to explain more, but the suddent, almost impulsive nature to this made it all the more cheap and depressing. I wonder what was the purpose of all this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR CHARACTERS AND IMPLAUSIBLE PLOT MAKE THIS A DULL READ","review":"I was disappointed with the overall character development. Way too much profanity (and unnecessary at that) and the author didn't create credible characters at all. Most seemed stilted, or worse, a copy out of a old B-movie. The ending was a sham and I felt cheated. So many holes in the plot that it simply wasn't worth the time. I understand that the author is planning a second novel using the same Fong character and I hope that it is a better attempt because the overall characters and setting are intriguing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very poor novel","review":"Not very well written, very predictable and boring plot, and the charcters were unoriginal and unimaginative. I don't know what the author was shooting for, but this certainly fell far short of the mark for good mystery reading. The \\"love\\" part of the novel was so predictable it was outright boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD BAD","review":"What a terribly predictable and dull book. Not much excitement on any level, and the preposterous conclusion was very very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"MUCH WORSE THAN AVERAGE","review":"Plodding storyline with very limited characters in a intriguing but poorly developed setting. I found the entire mystery to be quite poor and unsettling. The characters weren't real to me and their actions seemed so illogical and unfounded. Not enough surprises in the book and the overall motives of the murders was so far-fetched, it seemed to me that the author just didn't plan this out right. It just proves that you can't believe everything you read--especially when it comes to what the publishers write on book jackets."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A VERY GOOD MYSTERY--NOT A GOOD LOVE STORY","review":"Very poor murder mystery and absolutely little to hold the reader in any kind of suspense. Since it was clear who the murderer was, and eventually how he would get his due, all that was left was to have some sort of identification with the lead characters but that was virtually impossible with the way this author depicts Chinese policemen. Others have mentioned the excessive profanity and meaningless incidents and I would have to reluctantly agree. This author needs to take a hard look at plot elements before he subjects us to another murder mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"A POOR MYSTERY ON SO MANY LEVELS","review":"This book takes a fairly interesting concept and gets it totally confused with an overly-intricate plot. Chinese characters in a chinese locale trying to solve an international crime--this should have been remarkable and worth pursuing, but the author had a very weak plot and his involvement of the lead character with a foreign woman sure seemed unnecessary to me. Halfway in the book, the style changes abruptly to the foreign woman's point of view and for no good reason. I don't recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT MUCH OF A MYSTERY AND POORLY DONE AT THAT","review":"This should have been an interesting mystery. This should have had enough interesting characters and locale to keep the reader riveted. Instead, after a couple of chapters I found it very boring and predictable. No excuse for the gore and profanity. Real people don't act like that (let alone Chinese police) and the author's attempts to describe Shanghai read like a poor National Geographic. I wish the author could get a tighter reign on his imagination and find a way to get the mystery across. By the way, the \\"love\\" angle was utterly ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"CONFUSING AND WEAK ENDING","review":"The book synopsis seemed interesting but I suspect the publisher took too many liberties in describing the essence of the book. This book fails to involve the reader and the entire premise of the mystery is pure rubbish. The characters are never developed completely so that its hard to be too sympathetic with any of them. Writing a murder in modern China complete with the drive to a market economy and the overtones of communism should be an interesting book, but I think the author just couldn't develop his thoughts fully to make this book worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE TIME TO READ THIS BOOK","review":"Below average plot and unreal characters. I was disappointed with the entire book and felt that the author really needs to sit back and think more carefully before he writes again. What could he have been thinking about? I would sure appreciate his toning down the profanity in the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIDICULOUS MURDER MYSTERY","review":"This book reads like a first draft. I wish the author or at least the publisher had taken more time to have key elements better developed. The main characters had the potential to be interesting but instead, the author never developed them enough, and instead left them 2 dimensional. Very weak plot and the tie to a wider \\"global\\" angle made me think that the author never took the time to really think this one out. So much potential ... but the book really misses the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Book","review":"This book was so poor and defiicient in so many areas. I don't mind a dark book every now and then, but the author simply wasn't disciplined enough to make up his mind on what kind of book he wanted to write. The plot wasn't slow, but the plodding writing style made it seem that way. The characters were so artificial, it seemed like everyone, including the killer, were just going through the motions until the climax. The climax was a horrible disappointment considering all the effort taken to lead up to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and uneven","review":"Why didn't the author just write a book about his novel approach to teaching actors and leave it out of this book? My husband and I both just flipped pages to get past the endless blah blah blah about acting. Had ZIP to do with the story. That riff and the Canadian director all very weak and unformed. We've been to Shanghai so it was interesting on that level. But the rest of it was tedious. Every once in a while the police detective said something that sounded like a glib American. Just not gonna happen. When I finished it, I had a visceral dislike for the whole thing. Why are the reviews negative? How about it's a poorly written, and strangely pretentious book. Based on his bio, a little too autobiographical?"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT MY CUP OF TEA","review":"I was attracted to the book from the publisher's comments and the book jacket. First few chapters were uneven, but somewhat interesting but then as I delved further into the book, I began to realize that the mystery was really no mystery at all, and the characters were a totally unsympathetic lot. Ending of the book was very predictable with few surprises. The author did keep the gore down, which I appreciate, but he had unnecessary profanity and the erotic elements seemed uneven as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better to spend your time reading a different mystery","review":"The book certainly can't provide much of a mystery to the reader because everything is clear after a couple of chapters. The characters are so one dimensional and cardboard, its obvious that the author just borrowed them from somewhere else, added in a couple of details, and tried to convince the reader that they are believeable. The love affair is so juvenile and clumsy, the reader will be bored or embarassed over that section. So, in the end, this book really doesn't provide much entertainment on any level."},{"rating":"1","title":"READS LIKE AN OLD MOVIE OR TV SHOW","review":"I think the author really couldn't think through things to come up with an original mystery thriller. There were few things in this book that could excite or thrill; most of the action was very predictable, and have been in countless grade B movies or old tv shows. Absolutely no mystery or supense in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"WEIRD","review":"I don't know what the author was trying to do with this one. The book sure didn't get your attention through the mystery, the people in the plot, or the plot itself. The imagery and prose wasn't particularly unique, and in fact, it seemed quite boring at times. The love/erotic interest wasn't particularly believeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNABLE TO HOLD YOUR ATTENTION","review":"Totally unoriginal plot and theme--I've seen this before on countless TV shows from the 70's. I think the author was not able to succeed on any level--plot and characters were boring and the action was so very predictable. I was unable to feel anything after reading this, other than the irritation of having been taken in by over-enthusiastic comments from the publisher. This is a book that is easily forgotten within seconds after finishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good documentary","review":"First off the production values are off the chart. The video looks to have been shot with a 3 chip or maybe 35mm. The lighting is consistent. The interviews are insightful and interesting. There are a couple of unfamily appropriate moments involving the import models doing some dancing, but would still be pg13 fare. Very nice interview with Sasha Singleton that makes her appear meaner than she probably is. Only downside would be the last 15 minutes ending with the focus on the guy with the Cavalier. Doesn't have much racing action or car show scenes outside of what seems be the same Hot Import Nights show, but tells a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Window into a Window","review":"Milton Brener has done it again with his fascinating \\"perspective\\" of the evolution of man's mind, feelings, and art. He makes a strong argument for some of the heightened brain capabilities spurring the development of greater \\"realism\\" in art - as the eye sees it - and its connection with a deepened humanity. New feelings in man, new techniques in mind, new ways of expressing them on the canvas. Always thorough, Brener's thesis is supported by a mountain of evidence. As well drawn as a great canvas, some of his historical examples are so clearly and interestingly written, that they very well may stick in your mind for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"watch out!","review":"I was looking for a book with lots of illustrations to work through how actually to understand the perspective in specific paintings--Donald Weismann's wonderful THE VISUAL ARTS AS HUMAN EXPERIENCE gives a good start, and the National Gallery of Art book on Vermeer gives some further clues, but somehow when I'm on my own I just can't figure out the vanishing and distance points, etc. So this book looked perfect from its description. But the reason I'm dissing it is not the content (though it clearly isn't detailed in the way I was looking for). I just glanced through it, but am returning it right away without reading it because it's such a ripoff. A small 200 page paperback, on crummy paper, with maybe 30 black and white illustrations, for $35.00!!! They should be ashamed of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK!!!","review":"I bought two of these locks. Within seconds one broke after the other.

The package arrived in a bubble wrap mailer after almost 2 weeks. When I took the swivels out of the factory packaging, I noticed that one of the swivels was bent at the swinging point of the swivel so that it made the swivel look cock-eyed when on the gun. The other swivel had a loose plastic cover on the turning/locking screw and made it difficult to cinch down. I think Uncle Mike's better start letting some people in the USA start making their stuff again because this was terrible workmanship. I will probably start buying only Blackhawk products again. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because they did fit on an old shotgun and OpticSale.com did refund my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"OpticSale is the worst vendor on Amazon","review":"Do NOT buy anything from this vendor.

As one who loves to exercise and who training to become a personal trainer, I always go with the high intensity workouts. Denise Austin is perky (immensely), but sometimes when I'm tired her contagious smile is helpful. The ab workout is great, and I love the lower and upper body sections, also. However, I rated this DVD 4 stars, because of her Cardio workout segments. Even the high intensity workout is too repetitive and without difficulity! If you're looking to get flat abs, a tight butt, lean thighs, and sculpted arms, this DVD is for you; but if it's cardio you're looking for, I'd recommend another DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!!","review":"I made up my own workout program with the selections on this DVD and it was great - I had a great workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent program","review":"I really like being able to select my own workout every day.

I never did a Denise Austin workout before and decided to try this based on what I had read. As soon as I turned it on and heard Denise talking, I could understand what everyone meant. She may be sweet but I found her voice and what she was saying completely unmotivating. Even worse was the fact that I was bored stiff. I felt like when I worked out at Living Well Lady back in the late 80's. I couldn't even finish the segment. I had to turn it off midway. Instead, I'd recommend the Kathy Smith Matrix- Body Sculpt. I ordered both at the same time and absolutely love that one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Been using it for years","review":"Not consecutively, I'll admit--but when I get the urge to work out at home, this and Billy Blanks are my go-to. Denise does a great job cheering you on, explaining moves and what muscles you are using, reminds you to stand straight and tuck in that tummy, she is fantastic. I have several from her collection so it was no surprise when this became one of my favorites. This is not a hardcore P90X/Insanity type workout--this is a nice beginning for those who are out of shape, out of breath, and not too coordinated. 5 times a week, in the morning before the kid wakes up, and I feel fabulous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This was my first experience with Denise Austin. Whenever I had caught a few minutes of her show on TV I always thought, \\"What is WRONG with that woman?\\" But, now that I've experienced her workouts I really enjoy her personality. She is peppy and encouraging and you can't help but feel energized by her enthusiasm.As for the workouts, I am doing all the low level stuff because I am not in shape at all. They kick my butt, however, not in an exhausting painful way. I feel really worked out and stretched after doing the aerobics routine and then all of the toning and stretching. The aerobics section has variety but is not so complicated that it is hard to follow (like a lot of other aerobics workouts).The customize option is really wonderful because you can vary intensities depending on your fitness level or, if you're pressed for time you can just do a couple of segments.Get this DVD--you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing part?","review":"I have yet to use this DVD as it just arrived in the mail today, but it promises \\"an accompanying booklet with diet pointers and recipes;\\" when I opened the DVD box, there was no booklet inside.

Very disappointed that I didn't receive the entire product I paid for....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for beginners","review":"If you're just getting started, then this DVD should provide a good workout and a program you can grow with, going from low- to high-intensity. But for intermediate and advanced exercisers, this DVD won't work. Even after doing all the high-intensity sections, I barely worked up a sweat and certainly didn't feel as if I'd worked out at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY BASIC!!","review":"I was really excited about being able to customize my workout and that is why I thought this DVD would be a good one for me. I found it to be very boring and also very basic. The abs were pretty good, but that is it. I like to be challenged and this did not at all. The advanced is not advanced. It is much more of a basic, simple, no sweat workout. I recommend Sharon Mann 123 the works if you are looking for a customized workout that will be good for all levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not like it one little bit","review":"Let me start by saying that i have only done 3 of the available workouts, but I was not pleased. I found the cardio extremely boring, and the medium intensity upper body workout completely lacking in the \\"Workout\\" department. I have only been exercising since the beginning of the year (less than two months) and the medium intensity upper body didn't leave my muscles feeling anything at all. I have been doing a variety of other vidoes that I do enjoy. I also feel that her moves and techniques are stuck in the 80's. Not that they necessarily are less effective, but they bore me to tears. Maybe her style is for older people who are new to excersing. (I am 30) I do not recommend this at all. I am throwing mine away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Denise Austin Workout","review":"This was my first Denise Austin workout video and still my favorite. It allows you to pick which areas you want to work on and what intensity. As you become more fit, you can increase the intensity of you workout. The stretch/flexiblity isn't as good as it could be, but is a standard Denise Austin stretch from the other videos I own. I also wish the abs different levels of intensity, but understand why not.It is still one of the best Denise Austin workout videos out there. No frills, great workout option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's your chance!!! Blast away that fat!!","review":"I love Denise Austin!!! If you work out with her you will definitely feel and become fit! She is the best on the market if you ask me. Her dedication to fitness is incredible and inspiring. I guess you can tell I'm a huge fan and have a wide variety of her VHS and DVD's This one is a favorite. I don't like the cardio much. Not easy to do in my living room and movement changes are awkward. I love the arms, legs and abs segments. Great for a quick work out before work. Overall this is a great workout DVD. I will keep this in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denise Austin's Personal Training System","review":"I truly enjoy this DVD. There are so many combinations you can choose from that you will never get bored with your workout. I like that you can choose your workout levels and make the decision on how long or hard you want to work out. Some people don't like to listen to Denise, but I enjoy listening and having her push me to do my best. Looking at Denise gives me hope that if she can look as good as she does in her 40s I can too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weights recommended","review":"I bought the DVD without knowing that weights are recommended for the weight exercises. I think it's importat to know that small dumbells are used for the upper body workout. Anyway, overall the DVD is good because you can customize your workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denise Austin Video","review":"This video is great since you can customize your own workout routine. It allows you all combos and also you can choose levels of intensity. The only thing that would make it better is location. On her lifetime workout shows she's either at the beach or resorts so it's nicer to look at & somehow more motivating. Her workouts are easy to follow & she's definitely a motviating woman...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal Training System","review":"I love this DVD. It is great because you can continue since you can do low, intermediate, and high intensity. I am using the low intensity since I am a beginner. I love the abs routine and I am already getting a more flat tummy. I alternate with the Shrink Your Female Fat Zones....along with walking. And, I like the custom workout option. This DVD is great for beginners...and I can continue to use as I get stronger. It's a great DVD. I like Denise's perkiness...it helps. It is hard...but you can do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay for beginners","review":"I have several of Denis Austin's DVD's and have always been a fan of hers. However, I found this DVD to be very old fashioned. I used to teach aerobics 12 years ago and she was using alot of the same moves I used back then. I do like how you can personalize your workout, but this is not a DVD that I will use very often."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Letdown","review":"I bought this based on all the great reviews and was very disappointed. I have a couple of other Denise Austin videos, but this is my first with aerobics. She should stick with Pilates. The movements did not have a natural flow at all and I got the feeling while I was trying to follow along that she forgot the script and was thinking up moves along the way. I would call the aerobics beginner, except for the difficulty in trying to figure out what Denise is doing.The toning is better, but still beginner, not intermediate, even at the most advanced level.The ab workout was quite good and was a decent challenge, but her rhythm is off. I also really liked her stretch at the end.The progammability of the DVD was awesome, but it's not enough to redeem the lousy aerobics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the beginer","review":"I especially like how you can customize it to fit your style. I need different intensities for different areas of my body. For example, I can do 10 mins of high intensity toning on my legs, hips and butt. Then I can do 10 mins of medium intensity toning on my arms and upper body. There is also a cardio workout (high and low intesity), ab workout and a stretch workout. Although I'm not sure if this is the best workout for those who are more advanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denisa Austin Excellent!","review":"This is a great Dvd by Denise Austin.

It is easy to follow. I like Denises perkiness. I know this is something people complain about but it never bothers me. I like that this workout is simple and has exercises for each part of the body.

Overweight","review":"If you are anxious or apprehensive about exercising - then this DVD is for you!This is a perfect DVD for those of us who have more than 50 lbs. to loose. The segments are only 10 minutes long - not at all overwhelming. You can add as many 10 minute segments to your workout as you want.You do not need ANY equipment - not even shoes! I did this workout on the first time in my PJ's - without even a brassiere!The exercises are the same as I did when I was in the Army - basic stuff that even the most uncoordinated - like me - can easily do.This is a great DVD to build your self-confidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have for Home Exercisers","review":"I have had this dvd for quite awhile & I really like it.

Total ability to customize is a great advantage. Work part of your body or all of your body on any given day. I do wish the aerobics segments were about 10 minutes longer but if you want a good aerobic workout try Denise's \\"Ultimate Fat Blaster\\" work-outs."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"Love the high intensity routine (and the low intensity one too, but I do the high one when I want a more heart-pumping workout). The breakdown of the toning components is fantastic, and I totally love the legs + abs toning segment (and ok, the upper body / arms segment too!). Very good instructions, and I have always appreciated Denise Austin's enthusiasm and sincerity and passion in her work. Her personality and/or style of instruction have never annoyed or bothered me once.If there's only one exercise DVD to own (in terms of workout + range + value for $)...it'd be this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Stretch...","review":"I love this DVD. I like that I can pick and choose what I want to do. The high-impact cardio workout wasn't the most intense workout I have ever done - but it was FUN! I actually look forward to doing it after work! I mistakenly thought that maybe the abs workout would be easy, but it is a tough, effective workout. The yoga-inspired stretch is the perfect way to unwind after exercising. It's only about 10 minutes long, so I'm trying to end my other workouts with that, too. Finally, Denise Austin's attitude is amazing. Every stretch is \\"wonderful\\" or \\"my favorite.\\" She loves what she does and that attitude is contagious! (In fact, I am writing this minutes after doing the dvd because I wanted to share it, too!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workouts on this DVD!","review":"I've been working out with Denise Austin for at least 10 years. I have several of her videos and DVD's. I also used to do her \\"Daily Workouts\\" on Lifetime. That being said. I took about 2 years off of exersise to battle cancer and when I was healthy again I wanted to lose the steriod wait I gained. Who'd I turn to? Denise!I know some people don't like the way she talks, but I like that. If she were dead silent it would be boring. This DVD is great because 5 months ago I started off at the lowest level. And I struggled. Now, I'm doing the higher level of cardio and I'm still only on the middle difficulty of the arms and legs!The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wish it had a low level ab workout. I cannot get through the ab workout and I sometimes feel that I didn't accomplish anythng. But this is a great DVD especially for those trying to get back into shape!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed...What's All the Hype???","review":"I bought this DVD based on other reviewer's comments and it's 5 star rating. This DVD may be good for beginners but if you have been working out don't bother!!! The routines are boring, monotonous, and very uninspiring. Also, the routines are not long enough to actually have any effect. I have other DVDs that are set up like this in which you can choose which routines to do and even those, in 10 or even 8 minute intervals, give me more of a workout than this. The only good thing about this DVD is that you can shut out Denise's voice and just follow with the music. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, Denise, give it a rest","review":"I was used to Leslie Sansone, so Denise Austin's method of diving right into exercises (with very, very few reps) without any warning was rather alarming, as were her unnaturally white teeth. Add that to the excessively bouncy movements (which I'd always been taught were dangerous) and a cardio section I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and I realized the only parts of the DVD I thought might be useful were the abs and upper body. I returned this one after viewing different bits of it, realizing that I'd never follow through."},{"rating":"1","title":"workout dvd","review":"The compact disc had perfect video but no audio. Would have cost more to send back then I paid for it so settled for no sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me!","review":"I really thought this would be a great dvd and I tried hard to like it, but I just can't.I don't like Denise Austin - I find her way to cheerful and I don't think she looks or sounds anything like someone enjoying her workout. I even think she looks a little insane. There's something about her eyes. No, she's just not for me.Although I really like one segment on it and that's the upper body workout with weights. It's a great segment and that's the one part of this dvd I've ever used (with the sound turned off)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a joke.","review":"Those 3 to 5 minutes routines are jokes. There is no way we can get \\"fit\\" in that time. There is no such a miracle. Definitely, this DVD does not worth the money. It might work for someone that has never worked out in their life. Maybe it is good just to start. The 20 minutes aerobics is not that bad if you don't have anything else to warm up with."},{"rating":"1","title":"bleah","review":"i guess it's ok if you have never exercised a day in your life, and you want to start. anything is always better than nothing, so go for it! but, as far as anything past complete beginner goes, it's a huge disappointment. denise is pretty awful at transitions, which are essential in ANY workout. to jump the way she does from step to step without any intro or explanation or guide isn't a good way to work out.buy ANYTHING from minna lessig, she is the best of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"The power adapter is good - the equipment isn't","review":"I bought this power source to be used with the Tascam CD-VT1 vocal trainer.

I challenge you to try and adapt a full-length book into a cartoon series or movie and keep it within the time and budget restrictions. For those who are die-hard Redwall readers, the movie or the series might be a bit of a disappointment. I have a personal rule - never expect the movie to be exactly like the book. With this said, our family enjoyed it very much, and I believe that this was intended for a younger audience - those that don't or can't read the Redwall series for themselves. If you want straight-up Redwall, stick to the books. If you want an enjoyable cartoon with a heroic and noble storyline for your young children (ages 5 and up), then get this."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this film!","review":"redwall \\"the movie\\" is nothing but a chopped up version of season one of the series. save yourself a couple of bucks and get season one instead. i was shocked that they tried to pass this off as a unique story even in the previews for season 1 they attempt to sell you on \\"the movie\\". it's the exact same story except with 2 hours of footage chopped out! you can't take 13 episodes of a series, squash it into 90 mins and still retain development standards and then on top of it have the gaul to charge more for this butchering! i'll calm down now but please grab season one instead and get the nearly 5 hours of story the first season deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scheme","review":"This is basicly 13 episodes of the tv series condensed into a 75min movie.

It's much lighter than you'd expect it to be. Which can be good or bad depending on what feel you're used to. As usual, very sharp and pretty easy to keep that way. Also had the nice handle, superior grip.The one problem is the same as the other knives I've bought from them, possibly a bit more so. The back/top edge of the knife is very sharp angle-wise; ie. they don't round over the edges slightly like they should. As a result your hand can get a bit rough if you end up using it for an extended period of time. If you have the capability you can simply file or grind over the edges yourself.Otherwise, it's a great knife and I highly recommend it for an easily replaceable kitchen addition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality","review":"Its a Must have for Any non professional, or an student chef, Exelent Knife well balanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the money, a little lightweight","review":"I got this for my wife to use after she kept stealing my W��sthofs and not cleaning them. :D It's much more pleasant to use than the crappy, stamped garbage knives she used before.

She still casually reads it on occasion for basic references and for fun.The appeal of the book is that it has the right mix of educational and entertainment value to actually teach her how to read basic hangul and speak some Korean phrases as painlessly as possible from a book. Hearing her reading the later chapters is a treat in itself. Making out in Korean, indeed...The romanization is a bit off at times, requiring me to correct her. But even I have to admit I learned a few slangs myself that I was previously unaware of (I'm a 1.5 generation).I have to conclude the book was perfect for us, and it set out to do what I hoped. Not to make my (now fiance) fluent in Korean, but to increase her appreciation in Korean culture and bring us that much closer.

Well, this game doesn't do anyone any justice. Unfortunately, I found myself doing the same thing on all of the levels. There are zombies-not scary- that are really the citizens of the city, and their are also robots. The robots are annoying and takes a while to get used to constantly shooting them before they go away. The weapons that you get to choose from are only a couple and they are nothing special. This game is EXTREMELY repetitive and you loose intrest in it very quickly. I do not recommend this game to any one or even any child because even your kids will even complain about how bad it is.

We can only get one side to get a seal on it at a time and then the other side basically goes part way around his head and so water comes into the other side and I am sure it is probably somewhat blinding to have part of the frame almost in the way of his other eye.

Full of religious references and spaced out beats this is one of the most original albums I've ever heard. Vinnie Paz (mostly calls himself Ikon on this release) shows just how great of an emcee he was back then, and he's done nothing but improve by leaps and bounds. Stoupe delivers some truly original beats in the 14 or so original tracks. I gave this 4 and a half stars because the bonus tracks are really lacking the usual Jedi Mind Tricks punch. On their own, each track is good, but put into this album they are just out of place. I give them leeway though because the bonus tracks were recorded when Paz was still in his teens, and were included just as a treat for JMT fans.

This CD is really a re-release of an 8 or 10\\" release way back in '97. If you enjoy Jedi, this is a great pick because it gives some flavor that you probably haven't heard before. IKON is strong on this album, from intro to end. STOUPE takes a less central role on this CD, which was a little dissapointing, but still this is a great CD. Song 12, \\"I Who Have Nothing\\" is one to remeber. I would suggest picking up a different Mind Tricks CD if it is your first, but if you are alredy a fan, don't hesitated to drop the fifteen bucks.P.S. This CD has a few bonus tracks not on the original release. BUY THIS CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Opinion","review":"Although I do not own this album and was turned on to it from listening to artist like El-P, Mr. Lif, etc. from the samples I heard they sound like (and when I say sound like I am referring to their lyrical content) a mix of early Sunz of Man(Soldiers of Darkness), The Gravediggaz(The Pick, The Sickle, and The Shovel), and Scienz of Life all put together to create this group and all of whose music I love, so I am going to purchase this album based off of that and I think who ever else is thinking about buying this album should keep this in mind also.

The book is very handsome - a marriage of excellent prose and wonderful visuals. --Al Bernstein"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Terrific book\\"","review":"It is a breath of spring time. The pictures are superb. I am a student of the game and have seen so many baseball books but there are so many photos here that I have seen for the first time. It is such a terrific book, with such great text, so much to read. I thought I knew most of the history of the Red Sox and Yankees, but I learned a lot reading it. The oral history component is special - from former New York City Mayor Rudy G thriough all the fans, players, managers, everyone has a lot to say. Harvey Frommer has written all those sports books - more than 30 - but this book with his son Fred as co-author may top all of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a garden themed bedroom","review":"We ordered this picket fence to use in our daughter's butterfly garden themed bedroom. We used the picket fence along one wall above the baseboards and added some silk gerber daisies. It looks so adorable. After considering our options for a picket fence in her bedroom, this was the best choice. It's scale to the room was appropriate and it's safe (no spliters or sharp edges). We screwed it into the wall and used white plastic screw covers to finish it out. It arrived in excellent condition and in relatively no time. Great product and great service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well","review":"The picket edge fencing pieces were easy to attach to each other and arrange in our garden.

This book describes how he got in the business, and how he has succeeded. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found his stories about Olivier, Newman, Redford, etc. very interesting, and I think Goldman would be the perfect person to be seated next to a dinner party -- his anecdotes are funny and revealing. Those looking for guidance on how to make it as a screenwriter will probably be somewhat frustrated by the book, although Goldman does discuss in detail his writing of Butch Cassidy. He also has an interesting section at the end of the book that consists of an idea for a screenplay accompanied by comments from directors and other screenwriters.

I think it complements nicely the other house catalog reprints from Dover. While the illustrations and plans are smaller than those in some of the other books such as the Sears 1926 house catalog or the Aladdin built in a day catalog, it does show 500 houses. It also has some interesting articles concerning the state of domestic architecture circa 1925 or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"West Coast Pilates Towel/Mat video","review":"If you are passionate about Pilates, you probably have bought every video you can find.

Miss Manners writes in such a convoluted manner that i had to read everything twice before finally having somewhat of an understanding of the point she was trying to make. Why this book wasn't written in a down-to-earth, normal manner is beyond me. I have read other etiquette books that are very well written and straightforward; this is not one of them.I will give her credit for at least pointing out basic (and extremely unnerving) etiquette no-no's such as saying \\"you look terrible\\" to a friend, co-worker, etc., regardless of how she/he actually looks.If you want to read this book, don't waste your money. You're better off borrowing it from the library or from a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll be Honest - I haven't read it","review":"I haven't read this book, just read the magazine and reader reviews, but the idea of a book that tells us to replace honest communication of facts and feelings with vapid pleasantries is sickening. If your friend is pregnant and doesn't want to be, why *shouldn't* you say \\"You can still do something about it\\"?!! Don't tell her it's \\"wonderful\\" - it's not, and you both know it. If someone asks you \\"How are you?\\" and you tell them \\"terrible\\" instead of lying with \\"Just fine, thanks,\\" then it's their fault for asking! If they weren't prepared for an answer, they should have ignored you - that's what they want to do anyway. I'm 20 years old and maybe too idealistic. Maybe I'll slip into the same rut of self-delusion and public acting that most adults are in. But for now I can say with perfect honesty: Miss Manner's idea of \\"communication\\" is sickening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming, entertaining and HELPFUL","review":"This book was highly entertaining and I found myself using the lessons Miss Manners taught me almost immediately.This book was referred to me by a freind who had read it in her book club. I have a DREADFUL father-in-law and she told me this book would help. She was right! He came to visit shortly after I read this book and I found myself being able to POLITELY let him know that I thought what he said or did was inappropriate. It not only helped my relationship with him but with my husband as well- who, in the past, was always forced to keep the peace.For a book about manners I really thought this would be a chore to get through. I was wrong! Miss Manners is very witty and I found myself laughing out loud throughout this book. I'll be buying some more of this wonderful author's books in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended tales of the weird","review":"Highly recommended. This is the first collection of ghost stories by M.R. James, one of the masters of the form (though in truth some of these stories would probably best be regarded as \\"weird tales\\" rather than ghost stories per se). The effect of the stories is created by a combination of factors: the author's clear feel for moldy, musty old places, and his knack at describing them; the articulate manner in which the stories are narrated and in which the scholarly characters express themselves; and the fact that limited description is given to the supernatural creatures themselves, so that the reader's imagination is sensitized to the horror of what is (not) described. This collection includes some of James's best-known stories, including \\"Oh Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad,\\" widely regarded as his masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mixture of Creepiness and Eloquence","review":"James' collection of ghost stories is eloquently written and impeccably paced. Although the Kindle conversion was less than kind to the book, the stories are still as good as they once were.Between stories of missing children and rooms that are and aren't there, James sparks wonder in his appropriately creepy tales. While they are not perhaps \\"ghost stories\\" in the modern sense, they are plenty scary.I did see a review earlier stating that it wasn't as good as Dan Brown books. I would advise anyone who enjoys to Brown, Koontz, Palahniuk, King, etc. to perhaps spend some extra time going through this, as it is not immediately accessible to people accustomed to fast-paced \\"exciting\\" writing or explicit prose. However, it is still a fine collection; I would rate it above any of these.Short, creepy, and well written; certainly a good collection to pull up on a lazy afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"E-Books are Great","review":"Love the stories. Great for people who love to read ghost stories.I haven't read the whole thing yet, so I can give detailed info, but all-in-all this is a great free e-book.Recommended for people who love to read books that make them think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment!","review":"This book is NOT scary. Written in the tone of early 1900's. Tells \\"about\\", not \\"as it happens\\". Very disappointing. I wanted scary and ended up with tedious and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the download","review":"These stories were better than I thought they would be. I figured, because the book was written so long ago, that the stories would be quite bland. I was wrong. There was only one story that I didn't particularly care for but the rest were fun. They weren't frightening and aren't gory like what we have become accustomed to today but they were fun. The writing was good, not great and there were, what I felt, details that added nothing to the story but overall, I enjoyed it.

I've actually read Esther Derby's \\"Agile Retrospectives\\" book (which was good), and so I decided to buy this one.Unfortunately it was plain bad:- boring, too simplistic and style-wise poorly written- very basic. Meetings facilitation, one-on-ones, delegation, portfolio management, check-lists for new employees - is this all what management is about?- not a single word about leadership. The authors lost me almost instantly by writing that \\"We don't buy the fact that management is different from leadership\\" in the Introduction. It is actually different and what they're describing all the way are just pure management techniques.- a very limited, fake setup describing a mid-level manager that manages a group of managers. How about managing a technical group directly?Wasted money, wasted time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pragmatic Advice on Management","review":"Behind Closed Doors confronts the unspoken myth that star individual, technical performers will naturally want to be and, conversely, know how to be star managers. Technically-skilled folks don't transform into gifted managers on their own. They need help. This is an excellent book full of specific tips and pragmatic advice on the most fundamental and key aspects of management. I'd recommend this book to any first-time managers, managers new to a department, anyone managing by the seat of their pants, or anyone thinking of making the leap from technical to management.I found the narrative style helpful in that it shows managers just how to hold a meeting or discussion with their direct reports. There is plenty of specific advice that can be implemented today, without delay. And should you want to dig deeper into a topic, the bibliographies at the end of each chapter make it easy to find additional resources."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greate Management 101 book","review":"Practical approach to management.

It is easy to read and written in such a way that you can instantly start applying its concepts in your environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent at best","review":"This book is a \\"by example\\" style book. It makes up a fake manager in a fake office with fake situations and tries to use that to emphasize its points. This makes it easier to read than a text book, but has the downside of making it both very prescriptive and very limiting. Most of what is recommended will not apply to you unless you fill the same role as the fake manager they follow in the book.That said, the book does recommend some good practices. But over all, I found it to be too focused on special cases and not broad enough for its techniques to be extended and applied in circumstances not specifically addressed in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I am a new manager and this book made me see how many things I'm not doing or what my manager is not doing either. This has caused me to wake up and begin trying to push for some changes in building teams instead of the groups that we are now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure why this book has good reviews","review":"First, let me say that I have read many books off the Pragmatic Bookshelf. Many of the best books I read during 2006 were published by these guys. With that said, this is by far the worst book I have read in recent memory. It is very simplistic and not very engaging at all. It's like a Fischer Price introduction to management. I did read most of it, but only because I was trapped on an airplane to Norway. Incidently, I left the book on the plane. It wasn't worth the shelf space in my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"great shoe, a bit uncomfy though, would buy again!!","review":"the shoes are gorgeous, great red color, great design, great quality, but yes unfortunatly a bit uncomfortable...might bring them to get stretched out; or i heard taken a walk in the rain, then sitting back someplace (not to warm) and letting then dry on your feet works.

This album is yet another example of why.If you liked FLAvour of the Week and the FLA releases that followed, then this is more of the same. Leeb's music lacks any real vision, and often is quite boring. I certainly hope rumors are true that this is the last FLA album, because Leeb has already managed to kick the corpse around for too long.I admit, some of the soundscapes are nice, but I've often heard better. Check out the last two releases from Xorcist for some nice soundscapes, or any Download or In Strict Confidence release for some electronic wizardry.If you're new to Front Line Assembly, chek out their albums from the early and mid-nineties -- \\"Caustic Grip\\" through \\"Hard-Wired\\" and everything in between are all pretty darn good."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"Some good music here....unfortunately it is bogged down by irritating, monotonous and unimaginative lyrics. After track 3, I found myself scanning forward to find a little variation in the songs. I found very little.One good thing though, I have a nice c.d. case to add to my Dave Mckean collection.Bill Leeb just isn't as good without Rhys Fulber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Assembled without due care and attention","review":"I normally tolerate the levels of cheese in frontline, but I think the Leebster overstepped the line here somewhat, around about the point where he wrote a song about birds taking flight and quiet moments to himself called Everything Must Perish. What?? This pushed it over the critical point for me. There are parts of this album I like - I dig conscience, backlash would be pretty good if they'd thought of some more ideas for it (it has a nice little minor key melody which is unfortunately repeated ad nauseum) and the song Epitaph's not bad, but apart from that it all sounds a bit predictable. I'd recommend a Fulber era album (Caustic grip to Hardwired) over this any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd saved me $1000!","review":"I saved about $1000 by downloading the mp3s of this album. How did I do that?Well, it's quite easy to explain. Front Line Assembly is no more than a giant batch of stolen drumloops, keyboard presets, a hollywood sound fx sample cd and hillariously bad lyrics and vocals. I saved $1000 because that's probably what I would have to spend to buy all the albums by the artists that originally wrote most of the drumbeats and sounds that you hear in front line assembly's recordings.Bill Leeb should get himself involved in the online pirating of sample cds so he doesn't have to wait until his albums make him money before he can afford the latest ones to make new albums with. Then he'll have cooler sample cds than \\"Hearts of Asia 2\\" to use for delerium as well : D"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very cool album!","review":"Epitaph was my first ever intro to Frontline Assembly and was well worth the extra money I forked out for it (I live in Adelaide, Australia). Some of the tracks get a little close to doof-doof, but overall FLA's frenetic and chaotic industrial vibes make this one awesome CD. The atmospheric machinescapes in this album are excellent, the intros for the songs alone are almost worth the money.I highly recommend this CD to any industrial fans out there. Good stuff, and a kudos to FLA for such a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"these open wounds will never heal","review":"i have never felt worthy enough to write a review about FLA but after reading THESE REVIEWS I FEEL as though i now can write a review........ this album is nothing but genius... it is everything FLA has ever done --- - - it is CAUSTIC GRIP with IMPLODE musical style---- -----this album is better in production-- better in lyrical sense-- ----- yes -- nothing is more GODLIKE than EPITAPH---- by the way make sure to purchase RUDYS new cd ---- -- WREATH OF BARBS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"Overall, this album is very solid and very great sounding. My two favorite songs are definitely Backlash and Conscience. Leeb and Peterson were very successful in creating a dark and moody album...FLA in the truest form. So why only 4 stars? I hear everyone saying that this is a very \\"angry\\" album with vocals that help you to focus that \\"anger\\" and release it. Am I missing something? I found this album to be quite peaceful actually. Earlier albums like TNI, Caustic Grip, Millenium, etc. were a lot harder and angrier than this. Here, Leeb's vocals are not that harsh, except in maybe one or two songs. He whispers a lot, but that's not a bad thing, it's just not \\"angry\\" like everyone says it is. I miss that by Leeb. His \\"angry\\" vocals were some of the best in industrial. But all in all, this is a good album. Definitely worth the buy...even if FLA did steel some loops or drum samples. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"European dance clubs in 1997 - history lesson","review":"This is club dance music.

I can only criticize the CD sleeve, which gives little tribute to the DJ and tells nothing of his story. Track 2, \\"Hong Kong Affair\\" by Sergio, hypnotizes and seduces; \\"Outrageous\\" by Stix & Stoned, throws one's hips out onto the floor; and \\"La Batteria\\" by Baby Doc, is a narcotic nightcap of instrumental dance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great knife","review":"My husband and I have several of these knives in varying sizes.

Every time the grip was squeezed to activate the laser and discharge the weapon, the dot drifted about a foot to the right(at 25'). I was able to stabilize the dot by gluing a small wooden shim between the frame and the laser cylinder. I suspect the problem may be the age of my handgun - it is about 40 years old and Browning may have altered the frame width over the years. Nevertheless, I feel that the manufacturer should have been aware of this problem and warn-off customers with the older model handgun. I also found that the grip pressure required for activation was a serious distraction for forming a sight picture and lowered my accuracy with the weapon.At the same time, I purchased a small, frame-mount, bolt-on laser for my wife's Sig Mosquito which has worked flawlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really shows up in my lighting display","review":"I purchased this ghost light to use within a lighting display I was putting together for Halloween.

Most of the tracks here suffer from too much mope. Take (Track 7) for instance which sounds like a horrible country B-side from Pablo Honey. Don't even get me started on (Track 13), five minutes of needless guitar dissonance and incoherent mumbling.The album is entitled Demolition, meaning that songs are meant to be taken as demos.

It's easy to see why these songs were not previously released.I actually dislike this CD the more I listen to it, and have decided to shelve the sucker away with my group of '80's music that never get played.I hope Adams is spending more time on his writing & less time doing commercials for the GAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"This is just NOT a good album.

The results of these collaborative efforts are a growing awareness of the true complexities of the natural world. As one of my colleagues is fond of saying, \\"Mother nature always bats last\\".

One would hope, in view of the author's promotional statements that just one brand new equation - if only a little one, or even a new trivial one, would have resulted from the 10 years of work. Alas, I find none. The author appears to be overwhelmed with the importance of his work and his book. I fail to see why.

Obviously the man is human -- self-congratulatory and egocentric -- but he is clearly gifted and brilliant (much to the consternation of his mediocre-by-comparison, intellectual elitist critics, no doubt) and presents a strong critique of modern day science as well as some intriguing new discoveries about how complexity can arise given simple starting conditions.

It's weird, but true, that a correct theory cannot have both of these features. Many experiments have tested Bell's theorem (it passes).Wolfram's cellular automata theory is realistic, so it must be nonlocal. He admits as much (near p. 545, or so), claiming that there are non spatial \\"threads\\" connecting separated objects.

The second is obviously true to any programmer. The third seems kind of trivial for the grandiose claims made.Speaking of grandiose claims, I keep trying to find the \\"new kind of science\\" promised in the introduction (and the hype).

The principle states that there cannot exist a process on the universe that can compute something that cannot be computed by a Turing machine (or a cellular automata, or any other universal computational device). The fact that every machine is Turing-equivalent is not news to computer scientists. The PCE extends Turing-equivalency by hypothesizing that human beings, quantum mechanics, complex systems, etc. are all also Turing machines. Of course, this hypothesis can't be proven, nor easily disproven, so the contributions in this book remain merely inspirational.In general, the book seems to me to be a big dissapointment.

I will provide two of many examples that support the title of this review.1.) Chapter 10 pp 552 a section with the purpose of defining randomness. Stephen begins by outlining the failure of previous attempts to define randomness. Then he leads the reader to believe he has found the answer. Then he proceeds to identically fail to advance the notion of randomness in any way whatever.2.) Chapter 2 pp 223. \\"One might think that starting from such randomness no order would ever emerge.\\" Who thinks that? Certainly not I. This book is replete with examples of Stephen starting from a baseless assumption and then showing how his book lifts us from this state of ignorant belief to novel enlightenment.

Things pick up, but it never has the zip, or for that matter the humor of the later books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this for Real?","review":"Loved Plum Island and thought Up Country was a masterpiece on many levels, then couldn't believe The Talbot Odyssey was written by the same author. I suspect it is a parody, a spoof of a bad Robert Ludlum novel, and I think DeMille was pulling our legs when he inflicted this silly, overwrought item on his unsuspecting readers. Not even a glimpse of his wry humor this time...just wanted us to keep on suffering to the totally predictable end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"DeMille is my favourite author and I really enjoy all of his books. Word of Honour is still my favourite followed by Plum Island and Gold Coast. One thing about Demille that I like is that each of his books are different. Talbot Odyssey is a 'spy' novel similar to Ludlum. Although it was a little more off-beat than his other novels it was filled with action and heroic efforts. The characters were interesting and the story kept you guessing (and paranoid. I wish there were more DeMille novels to read because he's spoiled me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spell-Binding","review":"I've read many of DeMille's books. And like all of them, this is is fast-paced, with excellent character development.Like another of his books, \\"Charm School,\\" this story has cold war, spy theme. But one thing that is different is that the plot is based in New York, instead of Russia. And in this story there are double agents within CIA and KGB.With any novel, I always set out placing myself in the drama. DeMille makes it easy to be there.Your heart will race. You may even say a few, \\"Gotchas.\\"And you will really be there amongst the drama, the spy life and the historical context."},{"rating":"1","title":"When is it going to start?","review":"The topic is boring.

The Talbot Odyssey is a compeling drama that grips the reader from start to finish. The various twists and turns in the plot keep the reader guessing until the last minute. A very entertaining novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"countless flaws and bad logic","review":"have read all of demille's books, this is perhaps the worst one ever written by him. so many holes, countless flaws...the whole book just read like a poorly and blindly patched quilt. in order to give some twists to the plot and scenario, demille had thrown in so many nuts and bolts but simply failed to make all of them match or connet together properly. when you have read something happened in the former scenes, he later seemed to totally forgot what he had already written and the same situations came out almost like nobody knew it had already happened. nearly a half century's mole hunt just turned out to be more ridiculous page after page. i just wish that demille could re-read what he had written in this book and would not turn a blind eye to what he did to this lousy work-maybe the only one-by facing himself in the mirror, slapping his both cheeks for what he had done and, so poorly done. any viewer who gave high praises need to enroll in the logic 101 class pronto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of paper","review":"Well, sorry there are no negative rating options. A minus fifteen would have been appropriate for this one...I grabbed this one off the shelf because I sort of like this genre and his Charm School was not too bad, except that even that one was eventually spoiled by few way-below-the-belt remarks.So, after being engrossed in a most ludicrous plot, of what is actually supposed to be a novel, for most of the space between bookcovers I threw the waste of paper straight into trash 50 pages bofore the grand finale.I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW HOW IT ENDED!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SCIENCE FICTION","review":"REMINDED ME OF A STEPHEN KING BOOK, WHERE THE 1ST HALF IS HALFWAY SANE & THE 2ND HALF GOES OFF ON A TANGENT THAT MAKE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FOLLOW.

Really smart-type of comedy and a lot of good dramatic appeal. I really can't put to words just how good this show is, but it is up there with seinfeld as one of the greatest sitcoms ever. Too bad nobdy watched it when it was on TV, but i guess a show called Sports Night that has nothing to do with sports is destined to fail.

For all those West Wing fans out there - buy this!! You see how the characters of Josh and Sam were developed, also Jed and C.J ad a little bit of Toby. It's funny, it's smart, its quirky and it grows on you. Very few faults - some episodes are sometimes slower than others but on the whole it has few peers - it's like season one and season two of The West Wing but better - that's how good it is. I guess because I know a lot more about government and politics than I know about how to produce a show, this show hardly ever disappointed. Watch it with a group of friends or with family - it's like good food or champagne - it's best shared!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Miss This Show!","review":"This was one of the greatest programs on TV, and it figures that TV execs and the public did not realize that fact. Fast, snappy dialogue and characters that you grew to know and love were what made this program so addictive and a joy to watch. I do love West Wing, also Alan Sorkin's work, but Sports Night was my all-time favorite. In view of the current (2002-3) obsession with \\"reality shows\\", it breaks my heart that a quality program like Sports Night was canceled, especially after such a short run. Thank goodness my brother and his wife bought me the complete boxed set--now I have something great to watch when all else on TV stinks..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Sports Night you remember","review":"This is not the version of Sports Night you watched originally on T.V. This is the syndicated version that they dubbed over with a laugh track. It is very, very disappointing.Sports Night was my first introduction into Aaron Sorkin's writing, and it was darned good. This version is distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer beware","review":"When this show first aired on network television it was freshly original. I do not remember a laugh track. However, the dvd has added an annoying laugh track that makes it almost unwatchable. Unfortunately there is not a menu item to remove the laugh track. I had intended to buy several copies of the series as gifts. But after watching the first two episodes I decided not to. Wait for the series to come on dvd without the laugh track. It's a shame that first class television can be so easily ruined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discs Flawed","review":"These discs won't play properly on any of the DVD Players that we have tried them on -- a Philips Magnavox and a Samsung.

How can we return these to the manufacturer for a good pressing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Smartest Sitcom, Ever!","review":"Alright, when Sports Night first came out I automatically never gave it a chance since, at the time I hated sports. I remember watching it at least 4 times, and laughing, but never really relating to the jokes. Then I remember when it first came out on Comedy Central and I told my mom ...that it was back on the air, but I still didn't watch it. But now that I am older and I come home later, since it is now on at 3:30 in the a.m. where I live, I look so forward to watching every episode every night. It is so smart, and witty, ..., I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sports Night - The Complete Series","review":"The names Aaron Sorkin and Thomas Schlamme (and the excellent teams with which they surround themselves) linked to any kind of production means a quality show. Sports Night - as far as I am aware - never made it across the herring pond to the UK. So when it came out on DVD, I couldn't wait to buy the boxed set.It's brilliantly cast. The dialogue sparkles. The storylines entertain, inform, delight and never fail to broaden our understanding of the human condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Does Not Have Closed Caption!!!","review":"Loved this show when it was on TV and loved the original 1998 boxed set -both of which are closed captioned - so I was shocked that the special 10th anniversary edition did not have closed captioning. If you need this vital feature buy the 1998 boxed set!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sports Night complete set","review":"Even better in a format I can watch sequentially than catching it on tv a week apart. Outstanding acting and writing, can't believe this show was cancelled. Very timely and holds up even a few years later. Opening shot of the twin towers very sad. This was well worth the price, and a show I can watch over and over and catch something new--layers of writing here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-quality presentation of a top-quality show.","review":"This is a very solid presentation of one of the best shows ever produced for television. Great picture and sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular television","review":"The show is an emotional rollercoaster, because in every single episode you will laugh aloud and come this close to crying. I could go on and on about how great the script is, how great the cast is, how it's underappreciated and ended in such a way that never really fully resolved a lot of loose ends......but I think it's safe to say that if you watch this show, you will care about it. You'll care so deeply you'll feel a pang of pain in your heart when you think how there never will be another episode, how this specific ensemble will never be back together, and how a show that could've been one of the greats never got out of the sophomore slump (even Cheers got 3 seasons to establish itself before getting decent ratings!).You don't need extras on this DVD, you'll be fine with the \\"play all\\" feature, because watching this show from end to end is the most we could ask from television."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't say enough good about the series","review":"Aaron Sorkin is an absolute genius! The cast had chemistry and talent oozing out of their performances. Sadly, fans will never get a new episode. (Mr. Sorkin, if you ever come across this, I would actually watch a Sports Night reunion show!)The multi-layered discs are a problem in my traditional DVD player and I plan to call the 800 number about that. However, I have discovered that I can play the DVD's in my laptop without any problems. If you have a DVD ROM, try running the discs in that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorkin's 'Sport's Night': Even better than 'The West Wing'.","review":"Sports Night is one of those shows where one moment you're trying to figure it out and the next you're wondering why you didn't watch it to begin with, before it was canceled. (Thanks to ABC)I have NEVER seen a show so smart, yet funny... so charming, yet heart warming. I am SO glad this show is coming to DVD and I don't even know what the extras are yet.\\"Six Feet Under\\" star Peter Krause is one of the main characters but my favorite character is Jeremy, played by an amazing actor by the name of Joshua Malina.I plan on watching this box set over and over again because of the high replay value it has and I hope you do too. Highly Recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sports Nite","review":"This was one of my favorite shows, its good to see that it still holds it own, and never should have been canceled. We all know that Sorkin went with West Wing, But this was just as good.The DVD package is no frills, with nothing but the episodes for both seasons. I did notice some rough edits that were a little annoying, but other wise, the show still sets the bar for what a dramady can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"What more can I say...","review":"Everyone else has given you complete and comprehensive reviews of these DVD's and I agree with all of them. My fiance never heard of the show before I purchased the box set and she even scolded me for spending the money, but guess who was glued to the set and begging to watch \\"just one more\\" before we would go to bed at night.The show is so captivating that the episodes would pass without notice. I couldn't believe we had watched all 45 episodes in a week, but I guess we didn't get too far from the living room.Take my word; spend the money if you've ever seen ONE episode. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"a stepping stone perhaps, but....","review":"I bought Sports Night for 2 reasons. I was already a fan of the West Wing and Sports Night had lots of positive press. Bad move! The press is greatly overrated, with the comedy torturously predictable. It does try hard to blend drama with comedy and it covers some interesting topics and themes, but ultimately the drama is sabotaged by the less than average comedy. Whether it is the setting or simply Sorkin has improved, but the final product doesn't compare with the West Wing. It now sits half watched under my TV......DISAPPOINTED"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Box Set, Finally, Hopefully NBCs Version, not Comedy Centrals","review":"I am hoping that this box set will not be based on the Comedy Central release that the first box set was.The original show, when it aired on NBC, was not filmed in front of a studio audience and therefore there were no audience laughter, etc. When Comedy Central aired it they added a laugh reel as if it were filmed in front of an audience. I don't want help with where I should laugh so hopefully the new box set will not have that.The show was great, I still watch the original box set shows and still love the dialog and characters, oh and the sports discussions are great too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with disk","review":"I admit I'm not great at electronics, but when I play the disk, it keeps repeating the title track over and over. I got sick of listening to the title song. Finally I hit SOMETHING and the first episode started playing. I brought the disk to work to play on my computer, and the same thing happened. When I finally got the first episode to play, the disk stopped at the same place 3 times and froze out my computer. It's a shame, because I love the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand it.","review":"I cannot understand the appeal of this show. I'm obviously in the minority with these reviews, but here's my two cents.The word \\"witty\\" keeps getting thrown around here. Talking really fast back and forth to each other is not wit. Restating the other person's sentence quickly in a conversation is not snappy. It's repetition. And it gets old.I do respect the effort to try something new. Most TV is garbage and new ideas are not welcomed with open arms. But this show failed for more than this reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly amusing","review":"I caught a few episodes of this show when it aired and laughed a few times. The problem is that it could never decide whether it was a comedy or a drama. As a drama it was a complete failure. There is nothing interesting about a behind-the-scenes look at a sports network. Who cares if the lead story is \\"Martinez has a no-hitter going into the 7th\\" or \\"Kordell Stewart demands to be traded\\"? As for the comedy- it consisted solely of characters exchanging sarcastic remarks. That gets pretty tedious after a while, even if the characters are somewhat attractive."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is comedy?","review":"I have tried to like this show. I have really tried. I watch episodes of this show mostly to try to figure out how anyone could think that this is funny. In the case of this show, people seem to confuse fast moving, dry, humorless dialogue with witty banter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most under rated show ever","review":"I have been a fan of this show since it started, seen every episode and have been eagerly anticipating the dvd release. This is easily the most under rated show ever, I dont know HOW only 2 seasons were televised and now you can only see it 3 in the morning on comedy central, anyway. If you like witty, smart, thought out comedy. Actors with the most on screen chemistry (as well as the best) Ive ever seen. Not to mention some of the best drama, scenes that actually suck you in ........ ok, getting cheesy now. Trust me you will understand when you see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give this a chance","review":"Sports Night is the greatest show to have ever been put together. No other show in our history has come close to matching it in cast chemistry, wit, comedy and drama all in just a half hour show. From the creator of West Wing, no, the West Wing is from the creator of Sports Night. I have not been able to watch the West Wing because it reminds me of how great this show is and it ticks me off that it was pulled. And now they put out this great dvd with all the episodes put together. It's great. the only complaint I have is the laughtrack. it doesn't belong there."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't have to like sports to love this!","review":"Before the West Wing took off Aaron Sorkin was busy creating that same smart, fast paced style for Sports Night. This is among the best shows I've ever seen and is another one of those tragic losses in TV History: a good show that no one except me seemed to watch (e.g.,: My So Called Life).This is both a comedy and a human drama dealing in funny (and sometimes serious) ways with the mixed up lives of its characters. Smart and highly entertaining!I was counting the days until its release when I heard it was coming out! 45 Episodes in all! Sadly they don't seem to be lasting too long as it's hard to watch just one at a sitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nectar of the Gods","review":"The circle is complete. Perfection has been achieved.

They admit they're having problems with the discs, and currently have no solution to the problem. (they say they'll contact me when the solve the problem, I'll beleive it when it happens) The discs freeze in my JVC DVD player, and completely lock up my roommates Toshiba.If you too are having problems with them, be sure to call the 800 number on the disc to report the problem. hopefully if the get enough complaints, they'll fix it.Other than the defects... it's a great show. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sports Night: The Complete Series 10th Anniversary Edition","review":"My son introduced this series to me when I was visiting him in another state.

I can't believe this series was ever canceled. Worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorites","review":"I think \\"Sports Night\\" is the best series Aaron Sorkin ever did - better than the overrated \\"West Wing\\" and much better than any of its ratings-challenged successors.The cast is stellar (a whole bunch of future stars came out of this series), the writing taut and the tone generally light, although it falls into Sorkin-preachy sometimes. I bought the anniversary release for the extras, which are terrific, having already bought the series the first time the series came out. (I'll give that copy to a friend.)I still think of Felicity Huffman every time I hear \\"My Boogie Shoes\\" on the radio. ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where Sorkin Perfected His Style","review":"I loved this show when it first aired, but it was really interesting to rent and watch again post West Wing. I think the show still holds up, although I don't love the laugh track on there, mostly because it isn't needed. And there are some serious pacing issues on the dialog and storyline. But this is still a wonderful show with rich characters. It has that fast paced Sorkin feel, and I love the sports center feel. Oh how I wish this show had ran longer than it did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The best show ever!(if you like unfunny uninteresting bores)","review":"While a critical fave during its run, take your cue instead from the millions of Americans who found something better to do with their time than waste it on the most overhyped show ever produced for network television. The characters and dialogue are terribly annoying and not realistic in the least. It's not funny, it's not dramatic, it's not witty; but it is a 30 minute rant on things your likely not to care about (that's all the dialogue is -- rants from characters that offer nothing compelling.) Maybe I should have watched more episodes, but I could hardly stomach what I did view. It's a shame so many of you call this \\"quality television.\\" Keep in mind before you buy this, there's a reason it was cancelled so quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sports Night","review":"My husband was very excited to get something else that Aaron Sorkin did because he enjoys West Wing so much.

It is brilliantly written and acted. Far from being about sports, Sports Night is really about people.If the quality of shows determined their running time, Sports Night would still be on now. It is better than the so called \\"Must See TV\\" shows.If you are a fan of quality drama, check this series out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with many of the reviews here in that Sports Night was an excellent show with great characters and writing. I've waited a long time for this collection and it is nice to finally have copies of all 45 episodes on DVD instead of the blurry, worn copies I have on VHS.My only comments that are negative have not to do with the show, but the physical collection of discs and features. There are NO special features at all on the discs, which is disappointing considering the lag time between the show aired and its release on DVD. Also, the sound is only in 2 channel stereo, as opposed to 5.1 Dolby Digital, which one comes to expect purchasing DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary!","review":"Peter Farb's book should be brought back into print: unfortunately, he's dead and so there's nobody to promote the book so probably no publisher will be interested.

The treamill style floors, the horrible boxes, and the dual sides are just plain annoying. No cover and way too much going on.Relic is a horrible map for everything, especially sniper matches. Same thing with Gemini and Backwash. Terminal is tolerable at times as long as it's a slayer or sniper match.The only other decent map is Turf. It's actually somewhat fun to play CTF or Bomb Assualt but anything else is just annoying.The new maps I think are just not fun. The way they are set up just scream \\"leave game\\". It's funny, because when Elongation comes up everyone groans and complains about what a horrible level it is.

They are great. I like these maps even more than the original ones that came with halo 2. My personal favorites are relic and terminal. Terminal is great, because there is the infamous train of death, and the sword is in the middle of the tracks, amongst other things. This provides entertainment because you get to see people trying to get the sword, and then being smacked halfway through the level. These maps are all very good for different reasons. There are some larger levels (terminal, relic , containment,and gemini) and some medium sized maps (turf and sanctuary),and finally two smaller ones (warlock and elongation). All of which were worth the wait, as long as you play the right gametype on the right map, (snipers on relic). I enjoy these maps a lot, and it is about time those without xbox live got a taste of the cool new content.

The pack is $50, but you can buy Halo 2 for $20, Halo: CE for $10 at the most, and these maps are free on Live.I just don't get why this is still as much as it is.

It is composite leather and has great feel. For $23 and free shipping, it's hard to beat. One minor comment is that this ball ships without any packaging. Usually, new basketballs come in a box, but this arrived loose, so if you are planning to give this as a gift, it may not work. It was also a bit dirty, which is no big deal, since it gets dirty using it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After seeing the positive reviews, I decided to give this ball a try. I liked the ABA look and the ball felt good to the touch, however, it was totally dead. It didn't dribble well at all.

So it might seem a little heretical to suggest that after any number of volumes of this work that there was a sense of extreme focus, or even a clinical approach. This album goes along way in rebuking that notion, showing the artist's wickedly droll sense of humor, along with a welcome experiment with some decidedly psychedelic tinge, indulging in the powerful counterculture zeitgeist.It is this unexpected quirkiness that adds real personality and affection to the steady underlying brilliance. This is a very interesting project, and highly recommended to those who would prefer their Fahey clothed with a little offbeat style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outrageous","review":"\\"That whole record was a hoax. On all the songs that say it's me it isn't and vice versa.\\" - John Fahey A lavish autobiographical fantasy, an absurd exercise in self-gratification, or self-deprecation, hard to tell; a labour of love for sure, a financial disaster, definitely, a grand folly, a lovely indulgence, a holiday from seriousness, a mosaic of diverse musical traditions and a discographical nightmare; \\"The Voice of the Turtle\\" is all these things. The most rococo expression of Fahey's sense of the absurd, with its lying notes, self-mythologising and lunatic picture book, this is a serious joke. With those notes, and that picture album so lovingly subtitled, the sleeve in all its gatefolded glory - \\"the author age 17\\" , the quote from the Bible which everyone including Fahey knows means turtledoves, not turtles, this record comes at you like a conceptual piece, a bold encryption of a dream of a possibility.

There are a myriad of valuable and beneficial books out there for the grieving process when one loses one's pet but the author's vague references to pseudo-heartfelt sentiment left me unconvinced. How often do we need to hear about the digestive habits of one's pet I ask you when it is reduced to the level of flatulation?? We get it already. You miss your dog.

Would not philosophy lose it's very nature, it's treasured autonomy, and so become a mere plaything of theology, or worse still be taken hostage to a narrow apologetics? Dooyeweerd's rich analysis of the dynamic structures of our world guided by the christian confession of the radically non-self-sufficient character of creation (including philosophical thought), empties such suspicions of their foundation. Long before post-modernism challenged notions of pure reason Dooyeweerd showed the inter-dependence of the various modes of human experience including the rational, and argued that a truely open philosophy does not hid its commitments behind metaphysical claims to objectivity and neutrality. This is a truely original work of philosophy and worthy of serious attention (yes critical attention) from philosophers both within and without of the christian tradition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Une philosophie pr��-th��orique","review":"Cette lecture offre le d��but certain de l'apolog��tique r��form��e, voyant son apog��e dans les post-dooyeweerdiens.

I appreciated the safety-first focus and the author's friendly tone. Also, the stories, some of which are classics, made the book entertaining. It is unfortunate I didn't read this book a couple of years ago when I was launching into this line of work.

Personally I'm loaning it to all the guides I work with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enriching outdoor adventure","review":"Alex Kosseff's Outdoor Leadership is a thoughtful and thorough review of the leadership qualities required for safe, fullfilling outdoor adventure. The book presents a balanced emphasis on the leader's need for hard or technical skills and soft skills such as dealing with group dynamics and caring for the participants. I read this book from the view of a parent who led his family on many wonderful wilderness adventures for which we were not completely prepared and found innumerable ideas that would have made the trips even more rewarding. Kosseff's use of stories from his own experiences and those of others tranforms a potentially dry subject into thoroughly enjoyable reading.

Well, no call. I left 4 subsequent messages over the next few days, and still no call back.

In fact, I came back and bought two more for family members.The pen has two functions, a fine brush on one end and a soft \\"scrubber\\" on the other. The scrubber end has a cap, so you do not contaminate the soft pad (which is treated with solution to wipe away harder to remove spots from your lens). The brush end is telescopic. The yellow slider on the side positions the brush in or out of the pen, so you can easily remove any lint or dust that may have gotten on your lens or filter.A must have for any photographer, especially one that is on the road or mobile. You can clean your lens easily and quickly without needing wipes (that you throw away) or liquid lens cleaner and wipes.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming","review":"Although I had high hopes that I could carry this cleaning tool with me during my hikes, I've since decided that it's almost worthless. The main cleaning \\"tip\\" is too large to reach the oculars of my Nikon binoculars (nice going, Nikon!). And although I can use it to clean other lenses (objectives, camera), the results are uneven and unimpressive. As a long term Nikon user, I'm very disappointed that they've put their name on a product that's as mediocre as this one. Surely there's a better alternative for a compact cleaning kit that I can carry in the field! I certainly won't buy another one of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use lens cleaning device","review":"This is a easy to use lens cleaning device.You use the bush end to remove any debris from the lens, and the pad end to remove fingerprints and the like.The bush is retractable and soft enough not to damage lenses.The pad is treated (coated) in such a way as to remove fingerprints without leaving smudges.I have had excellent results using the Nikon Lens Pen on my Sony DSC F-828 digital camera. However it is important to note that the pad end is much too big to use on the electronic viewfinder (or anything else less than about a half an inch in diameter).The Nikon Lens Pen appears to be identical to many other LensPens out there (they all seem to be identical except for branding and coloration). Perhaps they are all manufactured by one company (perhaps other than Nikon)?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for Nikon","review":"Obviously this just isn't for Nikon; I use it with my Canon and my Sony HD Video camera, too.

The padded side returned that \\"new\\" gleam to the lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Right","review":"Gets the job done! Compact and useful, the lens pen clears larger debris (so as not to scratch the lens) before more detailed polishing with opposite end. There are definetely more effective items out there; there are also cheaper alternatives that will likely produce similar results, but the value on this is down the middle. Great size for a bag, and the \\"everlasting cleaning fluid\\" means that the brush will wear out, break, or get lost before you ever need to do \\"maintenance\\" with a fluid refill. The Nikon stamp on this is a nice touch, but don't be concerned that another product without such stamp is inferior. I have used this product on Nikkor DSLR lenses as well as several binoculars, spotting scopes, and rifle scopes with no major problems. Overall, a reasonable buy to protect the much larger investments we place in other equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good deal","review":"Interesting. The Nikon lens cleaning brush I received was bundled with a bonus puffer and was packaged for the Japanese market. No English writing on the packaging whatsoever. I got mine from seller: DeepDiscountscoThis was a great deal. An unexpected two-fer.Puffer and brush both seem to work great.

The overall design is compact, and I like the retractable brush. However, the pen itself is not very effective at cleaning glass. The tip is shaped like a suction pad. Rubbing it repeatedly over smudges or residue does gradually start to remove them, but it's much slower and less effective than a microfiber cloth. In some cases the lens pen also leaves behind a light streaking, which is again easily removed by a microfiber cloth.I think I'll keep the lens pen for its retractable brush, but in retrospect it would have been better to get a standalone brush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half good","review":"I love the brush portion of this item.

Returning immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brush works fine... tip-side will damage you lens!","review":"I was only attracted to this lens pen because it's a Nikon product and it had a bunch of good reviews on it. However, when I received the item it was in a used condition (although I paid for a brand new one from \\"Shopit\\").Aside this, the brush works fine, I use it to clean dust particles off the camera and lens.The downside of it, is the tip brush usually aiming at cleaning finger prints and tough marks on your lens glass. When I first received the item I opened the cap where the tip is located. I applied it on my finger and I had a black ink-like circle on it. So I thought I might have a bad copy as it was used. Nonetheless, I checked other reviewers comments and it seems that everyone is facing the same issue. So I preferred not to use it on my lenses as it can damage the expensive glass.Better use a microfiber cloth along with a rocket blower to clean the lens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brush only","review":"The tip for cleaning lens will not last long while the brush is convenient for removing dust and other fine particles. Also good for mirror system. Just don't count on the tip holding up, purchase a micro cloth and air blower. (I purchased a nasal aspirator and works well. Also much cheaper than a camera bulb)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"While it seems like a great idea, I was very disappointed in it's actual performance. The brush is a great idea although I already have several of them in my camera bags. The other end that is supposed to remove smudges and fingerprints proved to be just about useless in my opinion.After 'cleaning' two filters with the Nikon Lens Pen, I used a micro fiber cloth to actually get the smudges and film off both sides of the filters.As far as I'm concerned it's not even worth giving away as stocking stuffer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tip fell apart on first use","review":"The brush is good, but (very big but) the felt tip on the smudge eliminator side fell off on the first use. The glue used to adhere it to the rest of the pen was wonky. Possibly just a manufacturing problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Util y practico","review":"Sirve para lo que esta hecho. Muy practico para limpiar y quitar el polvo, Es economico y llego en tiempo y forma."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't leave home without one!","review":"If you are a photographer or user of binoculars, a great method of cleaning your valuable optics. The specially treated circular object [not the brush end] is perfect for cleaning the eyepieces of binoculars. This cleaning brush is available, if I recall, at lower price without the Nikon logo. If you like to spend money and want something bizarre for cleaning your optics, get a 1 inch Staticmaster brush. At least for about six months the polonium radioactive strip will blast any static helping attract dust to your optics. The Russians bought ten of them, ground up the radioactive elements and put the substance in the food of a spy who had defected to the West. He died a miserable death. No end to what strange uses an optics cleaning device can be used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good way to scratch your lenses","review":"I am surprised Nikon offers this item. If used VERY carefully you can use the brush to remove dust - but - don't try to wipe the surface of your glass with this device unless it is brand new, as grit can and will get in there and produce fine scratches on the surface of your expensive lens if you are the least bit careless. Better to not get your lens dirty in the first place. Barring that, there is a much better way to properly clean a lens that involves rolling tissue that you can find on the internet that costs nothing and can prevent scratches while removing even severe grime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this normal????","review":"I've had my pen for just a few days, and when I gently touched the pad end it left a dark black residue on my finger. Probably a dumb question, but IS THIS NORMAL???? I'm a little worried this black material will transfer to my lens. Has anyone had this happen? On a positive note, it seems like it would be good at cleaning a spot from the extreme perimeter of your lens, where it meets the metal housing. I would appreciate any comments."},{"rating":"2","title":"No camera bag should leave home without it!","review":"I LOVE THESE \\"PENS\\"!!

Often my lens collects little bits of this or that when I'm walking around with my lens cover off. Even with my UV filter protecting the lens, I want to clean it off periodically so my images are clear. I like the two parts of this pen. The brush works great for loose bits of dust while the soft pad (hidden under the cap) is great for smudges or fingerprints. The pen is small, easy to use, and does exactly what I needed it to. I'd highly recommend this to all of friends looking for a simple cleaning solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have Lens Pen","review":"With a soft, retractable cleaning brush to wisk dust away at one end and a lens cleaner tip on the other end, this is a really good, practical product for the person who is serious about his or her photography. Plus it can be carried in a camera bag with no appreciable difference in weight, or in a shirt pocket.When I bought it from Amazon in December '08, it was listed at $7.99, so it appears to have gone up a few cents in price. I can tell you that I saw this pen for $6.50 at WalMart just yesterday, June 24th '09.Price not withstanding, you need this pen. I bought it; I use it; now you go buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleaned the Smudges, Very Handy And Convenient, Especially For Travelling","review":"I ordered the pen and when it arrived, I sceptically used it, thinking it would do a so-so job. It actually did clean the smudges, and the round tip for cleaning the lens felt just right, without going into the black outer edges of the lens. It has a brush for brushing the dust off before cleaning the lens. It is also very convenient, and can be carried easily in your camera bag without taking too much space, which is a plus especially when travelling. It would be a great alternative to using sprays and cloths. Try it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, but identical to cheaper Sigma PLE Lens Pen","review":"This really works for a camera, in my experience, as most of the other reviews also proclaim.

It did clean the lens reasonably well, but I would think it would get dirty pretty quickly, and there is no way to clean it or replace it. And in my case, I won't care, since it fell off after a few uses (yes, I was treating it gently and not using any solvents).I think there are much better choices available, unless all you want is the retractable brush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"Nikon Lens Pen Cleaning SystemThe brush works as advertised, but the other end is rubbish. I've ordered two pens and both came with the same defect: The foam tip is lodged in the pen cap. The remaining part of the tip is felt-like, but is covered in black stuff.

The wind had fine sand particles and water with it and all of that stuck to my lens. I came back to my car and tried to clean the lens with this pen. When I used the brush it made it worse. It spread the water and sand all over the lens. Then I used the other end for quite a long time to clean the entire mess.

Even if you can guess from the begining where Tommy Lee and Rachel are going to end up you'll want to go along for the ride!It's the kind of story LaVryle does best - the rediscovery of love once lost.

The way this is accomplished is that the development of theories are addressed through the history of their development. It's amazing to see a topic like this comprehensively treated in an almost narrative manner. Aside from the enjoyability of the read, you get the benefit of learning two things at once: (1) The Theoretical Bases of Indo-European Linguistics, and (2) the history of the scholars and their work (or how (1) got that way). Essential for anyone interested in IE Linguistics or the history of scholarship (bonus if you're interested in both)."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful rendering of this song...","review":"the original song was great, and in this version she gives a very sweet & restrained cover. i'd buy the cd just on the strength of this one song.real class"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather listen to the original","review":"If I never knew Bryan Ferry's version of this song from his Roxy Music days, I'd say her rendition was excellent.

Yet he repeatedly stresses that most Arabs are willing to accept Israel in their midst, as if accepting Israel (with its package of policies and human-rights violations) is a prerequisite for being considered a 'moderate'.Generally a good read; a book that I would recommend. But I should point out that the political and social situations in the Middle East are so erratic that you'll have to keep reminding yourself that this book, having been published two years ago is an analysis of the past, not current-affairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Purple brings down a storm","review":"A score for getting the two for the price of one.

Non-fiction accounts can be difficult to read, but this was more like a fictional story. The book was hard to put down, and I couldn't wait for the end. However, I felt the ending was disappointing; the story seemed to just fall off a literary cliff.

Harr's first-hand knowledge gives the book and characters a depth rarely seen in non-fiction. His writing draws the reader into the heart of the story; the reader feels he is not merely an observer, but a participant.

I found the ending of this book to be miserably dissappointing... despite the fact that its a work of non-fiction and is bound to the truth of the story, at least to some extent... perhaps the person who ought be held most responsible for this tedious novel is not Harr, who does write with some distict clarity of prose, but Schlichtmann, who's outcome in the story is... well... booring! oh well... check out john grisham or something... dont waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most suspenseful story I ever read","review":"Others have summarized the plot and given their opinions about corporations and our legal system. I will just say this was more suspenseful than any suspense novel I have ever read. And I have read a lot. Perhaps some of the power comes from the story being all true. Harr embedded himself with the plaintiff team while the case was going on, and also got as close as he could to the other people, the families, the defense, etc. As you get closer to the end, the roller-coaster of emotions becomes more and more excruciating. I never experienced anything like it. Hope is followed by disaster followed by hope again, etc. Will any justice be served? Will these mothers whose children were slowly poisoned to death by men dumping toxins upstream get any compensation at all? Will the perpetrators get any punishment at all?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Legal Thriller","review":"This book is the best I have read in a long while.

The famalies of these children press charges against the organizations not for money but for redemption and so that they know they can't do whatever they want and they will have to pay the price.

That gives it a most interesting twist. This book made me happy, solemn, extremely angry. And though you know who you're supposed to be rooting for, the fact that it covers so many angles makes you wonder exactly who the \\"good guys\\" are.I was disappointed in the movie. I had looked forward to watching it, but should have realized the things I loved about the book--diving into the minutia of the case--wouldn't have made a compelling movie.

I watched the movis a couple years ago and new the basic premise of the story, but Harr does a marvelous job of building momentum throughout the book and I could not stop reading the book at night. It was just too exciting. There was excellent information about legal work, environmental catastrophes and the greater Boston area (for which I will admit a certain fondness). I learned a lot from the novel and got excited about the law, which is not an easy feat.

The print is so faint as to be illegible in many places, and instead of editing out the (usually visible) page edges and expanding the size of the reprinted page to approximate the size of the paper on which the reprint is done, we are left with tiny print and two-inch margins (!) on each page. It seems to be a scan from a lousy photocopy.Much of the book is simply unreadable and so I can't recommend it in its present form.

I agree with the reviewer who said the set's only fault is that it is missing the small chef's knife, which I did order to fill one of the empty slots in the block.

I had read that there are a few empty slots in the block, so I additionally had purchased the 6-in. Chef's knife and the 6 1/2-in. Santoku knife with my order. I placed a pair of kitchen shears that I alread have, in the bottom slot. So, I have a full set of very nice knives.

We found that these are as effective, comfortable and durable as knives that we pay much, much more for. They may not be quite as razor sharp as some of the other products we use but then, one of those knives can cost more than this entire set and these knives are much safer for someone who doesn't cut for a living.The knives are also more tolerant to dishwashing than many professional level blades.

I just today learned that even if a knife product says it's dishwasher safe, to still hand wash. That said, these have predominately been through the dishwasher as that is how they were advertised. They've rusted a decent amount (as read in another review, comet will help remove) but my biggest complaints is they will not stay sharp. We used the blade sharpener and that helped a lot at first, but now I'd have to say my butter knives would do a better job than the steak knives as they will not sharpen at all. Even the utility knives which don't get nearly as much use are almost worthless.

The KitchenAid set had oxidized to the point that they appeared rusty and were an eye-sore. I could not remove the oxidation so I removed the knives.The Oxo replaced them and have performed as beautifully as they still appear. They are not the high end in terms of price but they are attractive and designed well. The handles are pliant and comfortable. The blades razor sharp. The compliment of knives is more than adequate for any culinary adventure. If Consumer Reports is correct, they are by far the best buy in the mid-range knife class. Of course, if you need a designer name, there are many inferior knives at much higher prices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharpeness & comfort","review":"I had a oxo paring knife and used it all the time for almost everything. Oxo always designs ergonomics into their products and this set is no exception. Almost all my experiences with kitchen cutlery are compromised by comfort, even the most expensive knives aren't ergo right where the handle meets the blade. With some duration at a slicing task, the area at the inside upper forefinger lets you know about its non-ergo shape. Not so with oxo. All the knives in this set's thinness and sharpness combined, allow little pressure to be used to do the job, a safer condition. Some people think really sharp knoves are dangerous. Use your knuckles against the upper part of the blade to protect your fingers,no hurry,no worry. Oh, the price, $69, it's a no brainer.

His favorite so far has been the 8\\" chef's knife - he uses it for everything.The knives are lightweight yet well-balanced. The grips are comfortable and durable. They are VERY sharp and caution should be taken when using them. Everything about the whole set is clean and professional.

As I use one a couple of times it becomes so dull that I can't use it anymore. I am SORELY DISAPPOINTED in this product, and I don't understand how so many people are calling them excellent. I am certainly no expert, but hey, I expect a new set of knives to last at least a year or so.

The knives in the set are extremely sharp but I did order a Presto Pro Eversharp to keep their sharp edge in the future. I'm not much for using the sharpening rod which comes with the set.Only negative comment I have is that the steak knives don't quite match the quality of the other knives in this set.

The watch was sent by my jeweler, a reputable jeweler with whom I have done business for years, to a Seiko watch repair who said the watch was no longer being manufactured and that they had stopped making this watch something like 10 years ago. Also, to fix the watch would be $87.50, the \\"standard\\" price to refurbish Seiko watches. Since I only paid $125 for it in the first place, I didn't think it was worth it.

The grey covered very well (which is why it gets 2 stars instead of 1). I don't really like the formulation -- the gel colorant is quite drippy. I also like that it only takes 25 minutes to process.

However, my hair is darker and has a deep red (almost purple) hue to it. I dislike it!!

Really chicken at the thought of having pink hair at 60 :) After a couple of times at the salon, it was time to give it a go. Began with RA (think that's the number), found it too dark for me then next time mixed that one and 7LA. Pretty good results, just wanted lighter.Second time doing this one by itself and very happy. Would prefer a little more red in it. My hair comes out lighter than the box but all in all, hair is in great shape, very healthy, natural looking color.

I decided to try Loreal's preference brand b/c of their \\"fade resistant\\" claim. I have used light ash brown on my hair (Garnier) w/ good results. So my experience w/ Loreal Preference was not great.1) when I was applying the color my eyes were watering & stinging, and my scalp was burning.2) The color is lighter & more red than the light ash brown I used from Garnier.With Garnier, I have NEVER had a problem w/ fumes or my skin burning.

I browsed online for an alternative and passed by this one. In all honesty, I wasn't expecting it to be true to its label and actually stay permanent. I figured well if the other one didn't work well, maybe this one will last longer. Amazingly, this dye in ultimate black seems to really be permanent and I love the color. It's not expensive and the color comes out nice and black. After about three months with the dye, I can still say my hair is black (but faded a bit).

Little mess and it saves her hands a bunch of straining. It is well made and I have no complaints. I would definately buy it again.

She has written another bad Thomas and Charlotte Pitt book. I think I will stick to her other series. Perry used to write good, thought provoking books on the hypocrasies and horrors of Victorian society. This book is about how to preserve the status quo. The evils of change. Baroness Orczy would love the book, which glorifies the Royal family, even while admitting that they are nothing more than useless drains on the budget. But they provide \\"glamour\\", so let's keep them. Gag. And the people who would like to get rid of them, and set up a more equalitarian society, are portrayed as power-hungry monsters. Pitt and Charlotte used to care about the little people. No more. They have become reactionaries bent on preserving the status quo. I guess once Pitt became a fairly wealthy man, he forgot his roots.

The action was extremely limited, being confined mostly to Gracie and Tellman following people around London and eavesdropping on their exchanges. The constant harangues about loyalty and political freedom that issued from nearly every character's mouth were tiresome and sanctimonious. And the author's writing has gotten sloppy -- lots of repeated phrases, cliches, and even a couple of remarks that could never have been uttered by people living in the 19th century (someone is said to \\"do a Marie Antoinette,\\" and a person with an unwholesome interest in a third party is described as having \\"a thing\\" for him/her). A very disappointing effort, in short."},{"rating":"2","title":"BACK TO THE OLD STYLE","review":"I look forward to every Anne Perry novel, and also the excellent audio recordings of her novels. The last couple of books have had a bit too much of stilted moralizing. I am happy to say this new book is much more like her earlier novels--exciting, vivid, a real page turner. I like the way Perry gives different regular characters the focus each time. If anyone found this \\"jack the ripper\\" info intriguing, read Robin Paige's \\"Death at Whitechapel\\".

The mounting on the wall is not very stable, again blamed by the flimsy plastic construction. But most importantly, there is no locking or tightening mechanism for the clothesline, so even a weight of a wet t-shirt will cause the line to sag a lot.

I came to M. Kat Anderson's book after we nearly lost our home, which is neatly tucked between two pieces of reservation land; I got infinitely more understanding than I thought possible. She has given us a timely, well researched work, that gives homage to the people who came long before us.This book will sit on my shelf, next to \\"1491\\" (another must read, Americas before Columbus). The land nourishes all of us, regardless of race, color or creed. We need to learn from the past practices, to better care for the land. Many environmentalists use \\"pristine\\" when describing wilderness, and it is a misnomer. Without fire, there are no sprouting redwoods. Controlled burns are necessary.

I have to say that these iPods either have batteries or hard drives that die in what seems to be a short time frame. Apple did offer me a 10% discount on my next iPod if I turned in my old one, but to be honest, I found that a laughable offer give how much I originally paid for it. They also wanted me to buy the $60 extended warrenty (so that it would cover two instead of one years). Apple, if you can't make a product that lasts for two years, then either take it off the market or improve your quality.

However, I recently upgraded to the 4G 40gb and was sorely disappointed. After putting the same music on the 4G unit (and using the same pair of headphones) I was struck by how poor the sound quality was compared to my old iPod (or other MP3 players). I would disagree with other reviewers who say the poor sound quality is only noticeable to audiophiles--it is glaringly obvious: the sound is shrill, hollow, with little bass and obvious distortion on higher volumes. It is so bad that I am returning my 4G unit and sticking with my 2G version."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my iPod and the deal I got","review":"I bought this 40 GB iPod for $195 refurbished at Small Dog Electronics. It has a one year warranty. It's my first iPod and is a dream (especially once I figured out the shuffle).

Decided it was the coolest thing I had ever owned. And then I dropped it. I had it in my back pocket and went to sit down. Fell out of my back pocket onto a tile floor and shattered the display. Keep in mind it fell less than 2 feet. For a portable device that is meant to take everywhere, you have to anticipate an accident like this. Extremely disappointed in the durability of this product. Thought about packaging it up and returning it saying it arrived like this, but the chrome back is so scratched after 3 days of use, they would never buy it. Not sure what I am going to do, but feel sick about losing 400 bucks in a 2 foot fall. The unit still works, but I can't read the display well enough to move through the functions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Price","review":"Apple Computers should be ashamed of themselves. I received my 40 GB ipod as a 2004 Christmas present and the problems began after only 6 months. Though I sould say, I really loved my ipod before it crapped out on me. I see a lot of other customers have had similar trouble with this thing and I just want to cast my vote of disapproval. The problems are: The computer/itunes not recognizing the ipod. The hard drive spinning up but never starting. The hard drive crashing and losing all data resulting in having to reset the ipod to factory settings and reinstalling the software and after all that having the same problem happen again.After hearing all the horror stories about Apple's customer service I figure it's not worth trying to repair. Since this model has been discontinued, there's no point in telling people not to buy it now. I only hope that the new ipods are better. I'll be reading the reviews very carefully if and when I decide to get another ipod.

I have wasted over $600 on these Ipods as well as another $100+ to repair one of them. They are great for storing mass amounts of music... but they are very tempermental, and seem to breakdown unexpectedly and for no reason at all (i never dropped them/ no water damage/ hardly any scratches). It's as if these were put on some sort of timer to shut down on you after a while, so that you HAVE to go out and buy another. I really love the idea of an ipod.. but when I buy one, I'd hope that it would last me a LONG time cosidering how much they cost. But they fail on you as easily as any disposable item you can buy... and quite frankly, its too much money to spend on something that lasts no longer than a plastic fork."},{"rating":"1","title":"ughhh...","review":"Mine broke after just over a year.

The maps are rudimentary -- not something one would want in the confusing SF bay area. The guidebook gives great ideas on places to go but won't help you really get there -- sections on using public transport (essential in a city where there are 300,000 cars registered but only 200,000 parking spaces). The accomodation information is sorely lacking; there are few options for those who don't want to pay over $80.00 a night to be in SF. The sections on public safety are also lacking in complexity.

A great buy for anyone visiting San Francisco and those already living there too to get to know their city better (in fact, now I make sure I buy a DK guide for every location I visit!).There is a version that comes with a larger map and quick cue cards in a leather binder/pouch as well.

I wish i could give it a zero! oops I forgot I have to be careful what i wish for! LoL, the point is rent the first one! Not this one. I made the mistake of buying it. The acting was also really really terrible. The movie wasn't even scary as the first! Didn't even come close to the original. The cursing was just awful. every five seconds there would be a cuss word! It was the most awful horror movie i have ever seen! some cursing is alright but there should be a limit!

The first one had better special effects which helped it along a bit more, however, the acting lacking in some characters was made up for by the believable Djinn (played by Andrew Divoff) and a few other minor characters. I really enjoyed the few special effects that they had and the ones they used really had to be played back again because the more you thought about it the more spooked you got. I enjoyed this one almost as much as the first, the first had fewer laughs and more hooror in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wishmaster 2 is horrible","review":"Wishmaster wasn't that great.

If anything, Dr. Williams strives to pin the blame for various historic Vatican scandals on a cardinal, the Mafia, or other convenient scapegoats, etc., as a PR effort to minimize \\"damage control\\" to the Vatican's reputation for scandals in WWII history, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vatican is worse than the mafia!","review":"At least the Mafia does not pick on little boys and sexually abuse them.This book is non-fiction, but is as entertaining as fiction.It is sad but true, and quite sickening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless","review":"A shameless retelling of history to suit one's own agenda.

The author bases his writing on information that is so slanted it is ridiculous. I could go into countless criticisms of what Williams writes, but to do so would be a waste of my time, and I won't begin to give credence to his falsities. For centuries, critics like Williams have tried to undo the beauty of what is the Catholic Church. Williams' book is nothing but a self-serving harangue against someone and something that he obviously hates. However, the Church in all her Wisdom, Honor and Intellect will far outlast morons like Paul Williams.

I loved Apocalypto and it's one of my favorite movies. I wasn't so much amused watching this copy and paste version of it that was adapted to Korean culture. Sure the writers mixed the plot around and tried to make certain scenes from the movie seem different but it's the same story only remixed. Even right down to the ending where in Apocalypto you saw the invasion of Christianity and in War of the Arrows you see a European guard on a Korean border. Was this a good movie? It was okay. I can't exactly give 5 stars to someone elses ideas that they stole. If anyone says this movie is nothing like Apocalypto or is original they are lying through their teeth. Please watch Apocalypto then this copy of that movie and you'll understand. This movie basically removes the Mayan culture and replaces it with Korean culture. I'm surprised they didn't get sued for this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good little action flick","review":"Some good action sequences. Sergio Leone was watched. Mel Gibson too.

In fact, the title is somewhat misleading, as not all of the stories follow that particular moment in history. There are stories of being an immigrant, learning a new language and new life, of dealing with loss, of coping with prejudice when you're just a small child, among others. Each chapter is a look into the lives of new characters with new experiences, each in their own time and in their own situations.These stories don't just convey what it was like to be a random person in the past, they miraculously convey all of the emotion behind those experiences.

I got a few vague ideas and whole lot, not for me. Perhaps with some strong scrutiny, I'd use some of the spells.The book reads like the joke is on the reader who takes the whole thing seriously.

Before the cleaning it was working just fine (no sounds/signs of wear). I'm very disappointed in the quality of the motor and am not sure I can justify the replacement cost - 3 fountains over 2.5 years is too frequent for me.I'd like to know of others experiences with motor failure - did I get a lemon?

I bought the cleaning tools recommended for it but, without a dishwasher to put the parts in, its just a big pain in the @** to clean. My cats love the running water though so I knew I had to get a fountain of some sort. My sist has the Platinum one and she showed me how easy it was to clean! I bought it, my cats LOOOOVE it, and I'm very happy I bought it.There is a review on here by someone of the different types of drink fountains and that review also really helped me to pick the Platinum fountain.

I also had the stainless steel one (veterinarian designed) with up to 6 water drippings. It really only worked well in two. So I just usually had to use the two hole one and then it was a juggling act to make them both flow. So, I got this one and all my cats love it. They love drinking out of it. I just wish there was other choices besides plastic. If I had to make a negative comment that would be what it would be. If you could make a stainless steel one that would be the optimal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obnoxiously Big!!

I had the previous non-platinum version prior to this and this is much much bigger especially because of the reserve tank. Pro: you don't have the fill the fountain as much, but next to my cat's food bowl, it's obnoxiously big.Also, my previous drinkwell (non-platinum) did not make any noise when in use, however when I set mine up, motor on mine was very discernable. I have the water fountain in my bedroom and I purchased this product b/c of it's \\"silent motor\\", but mine was not quiet and I had to send mine back.Perhaps my shipment was defective, because other friends I have talked to said that their fountain was silent, however I did not want to take another chance with a $40+ product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...he likes it!","review":"I bought this with some trepidation as my 18 year old cat is very difficult and I wasn't sure if he would drink from it....not only does he drink from it (it took about a day...), but he seems to be drinking more. This is great because he has kidney issues. I also was worried that this pet fountain would create a mess, but it is great!! Highly recommended (by my cat!)UPDATE ON OCTOBER 23, 2011--The fountain broke...the motor no longer works......I am not sure how to fix it and couldn't contact the drinkwell corporation. This was a lot of money to spend on something that worked only for five months!!!!!Also, it was a pain in the neck to clean.

I decided to try this fountain and the results have been good. It is easy to assemble and not too crazy to clean. The cat was afraid of it at first, then would smack the water. After about an hour of splashing around she started drinking it. Since then she has had no issues and has been drinking much more water now. The occasional water gurgle will startle her when she is drinking, but nothing too bad. My only complaint is the pump noise could be better. It is no louder than my refrigerator hum, but my fridge tends to hum louder than most since it is about 16 years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for cat who likes running water","review":"We bought this so the cat would stop drinking out of the faucet. She loves to drink running water and this was perfect for her. The only noise it makes is the water sound (you can't hear the motor). The cord has a pretty good length and has a connector in the middle so it will disconnect if someone trips or its pulled rather than dumping the water. The tank is a little hard to fill, it leaks a bit while I put it back on the base."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tried and True","review":"My cats love this fountain. This is the second drinkwell fountain that I have purchased. I gave the first to my daughter and I tried one of the ceramic fountains for myself.

I replaced the ceramic with the Drinkwell and my cats are drinking again. This one is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for our cats and small dogs","review":"Doesn't scare any of our smaller pets. I like it because it keeps our animals constantly hydrated.

They like to play in water faucets, and this was the closest to the real thing. The water stayed clean (except for twice, it turned brown even after the filter was replaced.. so I just emptied the fountain and refilled to fix), the shape of the fountain compensated for the bulkiness, making it pretty easy to find a spot for it in the kitchen, and even though it had a slight hum, we got used to it fairly quick... and then the water slowed to a dribble.I have only had this fountain for a month and a half.I cleaned it and still nothing. I adjusted the speed of the water flow.. still nothing.I have read other reviews saying that the pump will stop working from hard water (I don't have hard water) and you have to order a $20 replacement. If this is to happen every month and a half, the fountain is better off in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Cats Love It","review":"I have 2 cats and they both drink from it.

I originally bought the smaller Drinkwell fountain but found that I was having to fill it up every day. I wanted something that had room for more water so it would last longer between filling it up. I got the Platinum fountain and for the first few months it worked great but now the only thing coming out of the unit is a little dribble of water. It seems like every time I go to clean everything it works less and less.

I heard good things... and bad about each one. We finally decided to go with the Drinkwell Platinum, and couldn't be happier. The fountain is so quiet, that you barely even know it is there. The loudest sound it makes is when my kitty is drinking from the waterfall, it makes a slight splashing sound in the bowl... but still, not even an issue. The unit is a little on the bulky side, but we just hooked it up in the corner in an out of the way location and problem solved. We clean the fountain weekly and do not have any issues with the water level or clogging filters. However, the fountain is a bit challenging to clean, with lots of little corners and grooves to get into. However, we are planning to get the brush kit that Drinkwell made for cleaning and that should make the job much easier.

My bold cat will lick the stream occassionally and my shy one is still a little afraid of it. I also gave it one star because my water comes from a well and it is not treated with chlorine (like city water) therefore, there is a \\"scum\\" that builds up over a few days. Which brings me to my third complaint with this product .. it's very difficult and time consuming to clean .. lots of tight corners and deep pockets .. I have to soak it in bleach to feel comfortable it's clean. I will stop using it and stay with the good old fashioned bowl, which my cats like better anyway.

So we decided to purchase this to give him his own fountain of water. He loved it, but because I did not change the filter every month (I would remember 6-8 weeks), he was getting sick with vomiting. So if you plan to buy this, you MUST change the filter every month and CLEAN it thoroughly every WEEK!!! Because of the need for a clean filter every month and the need to clean it weekly it was too much work so I am only giving it 1 star. We have decided to go back to the regular water bowl and run the faucet for him when he bothers us for running water to play and drink in. When we took him to the vet for the vomiting, our vet said she does not like these fountains for pets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"We've had this for a few months now, so it's time for a review I think. I have 2 kittens (8mo old now) and a 35# dog who use this as their only source of water. It seems to make it about 3 days before I need to refill. The kittens really took to the pouring water- one drinks exclusively from the pouring part. It was not as hard to clean as I expected, and I can be done in less than 5 minutes. It's also pretty quiet, and can only be heard in the same room."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy it!","review":"I'm returning this item. It's impossible to get apart to put the filter in or clean.

They were a little unsure at first but they got past the little bit of humming the pump makes. I like the adjustable volume on the amount of water coming out of the fountain. Splashing is very little, I think most of that come when the kitties are drinking. The fountain is super easy to clean. I held back that last star over the filling of the fountain. We only fill it with spring water so pulling out the reservoir and filling it is sort of a pain. The reservoir will not set upright at all so if you plan on setting it down you have to empty all the water out of it. This is what is know as form over function. Good thing is that the reservoir holds plenty of water so you don't have to fill it too often.

We checked all the parts and the assembly of same and tried again several times but were not successful in getting the water to remain in the reservoir for even a few minutes. The seller attempted to correct the problem but to no avail. Please don't let this review sour your opinion of the entire Drinkwell line or even this product!

Still a pain to clean well, they sell a brush set for cleaning, but if you all ready own bottle brushes or something similar there's no need to buy the special set. Expect to replace the whole thing every 2 years or so, scale deposits will ruin the pump and make the plastic discolor and deteriorate some, even with regular cleaning. The harder your water is the quicker this will happen, and since I don't want to poison my pets, a commercial descaling product is out as it will more than likely bond with or alter the plastic in some bad way.Huge volume lasts several days, best plastic fountain on the market for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pump broke within 3 months","review":"I bought the water fountain less than 3 months ago, and was very happy with it.

I thought they would like the Drinkwell Platinum Fountain. We tried it for over a week and they avoided it. If I turned the pump off, they would drink so they knew it was water. I think they did not like the noise of the pump and/or the water flow in the fountain was too fast. When they drink from a faucet, it has to be a fast drip. There is a flow adjustment on the Drinkwell, but at the slowest, it is still faster than my cats will drink from a faucet. I returned the fountain."},{"rating":"1","title":"noisy pump","review":"The pump started out being fairly quiet with very little vibration. After only a week of usage, the pump noise become unbearably loud and the whole unit shook from how much the pump was vibrating. My cat refused to drink from such a noisy fountain and would only drink when the fountain is unplugged. I tried taking the whole unit apart, including disassembling the pump, and cleaning the parts, but nothing worked. Also the way the water stream hit the bottom of the unit would always cause some splashing. The flying specks of water further discouraged my cat from drinking from it.Now the fountain is sitting in a cardboard box, catching dust in a corner of my room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the high price","review":"I bought this product so my cat would have cleaner/fresher water to drink instead of the standard bowl of water. I work long hours and not intentional I'd forget to change her water bowl everyday. Her water bowl after about 2 days would be dirty with food and slimey. The machine is bulky and noisy. I've never seen her use it, the equipment still gets slimey, however there isn't any food in it, so I don't think she is using it. Unless I'm doing something wrong, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I really liked this product until I got crack in the water reservoir and couldn't get a replacement.

I want the best for these two guys and so I read the reviews and thought this was going to give them good, healthy water.

It's so loud, I have to keep the laundry door closed at all times (it has a kitty door) to be able to watch TV 2 rooms away. It's ridiculous! Whomever engineered this obviously doesn't have cats nor do they care about quality. It is very inexpensive and easy to build a simple and quiet water pump these days so there is no excuse for this. It's going back! So unfortunate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea - - bad execution","review":"It is a nice idea, but one word - leaking...Glad I also chose to buy the Drinkwell Platinum Fountain Mat....or there would have been water all over the floor.

I have to stop the fountain at least twice a day to dump out the water inthe tray so it does not over flow. I have contactedthe company directly about the problem. They were not friendly at all and told me that I would have to pay to ship it back to them, and let them inspect it before they would replace any parts on the fountain that may or may not be under the warranty. Yep, like I am going to do that.....Also, having something electronic sitting in water so it doesnt leak all over my floor.... huh? you do the math. Also the motor stops about every 3 days, so I have to clean it out all of the time. If you want a high maintenance, messy water dish... this product is for you....PRO: Our cat does love this fountain. Thats about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This has worked well..","review":"I got this for my cats when I moved into a new house. I had a sink drinker, and it was harder for him to drink out of the new sink, so I thought that I would get this as a treat for him. So far, it has worked well for about two years, with routine cleaning. When I clean it, I rinse it with Scope mouthwash as an anti-bacterial agent, then rinse it with water, then fill it with water filtered through a Pur water filter. This seems to keep the bacteria film that forms on the walls and bottom at bay for a lot longer than just using tap water. The pump seems to be holding up well, but it has formed a crack in part of it's body, but I just be gentle when cleaning it, and hopefully I won't have to replace it anytime soon. The rear reservoir arrived cracked in shipping, but it was quickly replaced. The cats love it, and I have used it with and without the filter installed. The cats don't seem to notice much difference, but I replace the filter every once in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doggie fresh waster","review":"We have 5 chihuahuas. They need a lot of fresh water each day, and this fountain provides it. You need to know that it should be cleaned twice a week, especially if you have more than one dog or cat using it.

No more worries about hydration."},{"rating":"2","title":"My cats love it","review":"They love it. They drink out of it and never drank out of their old fountain.

I am glad I did because my little dog loves it! My larger dog that prefers to use the toilet whenever possible, uses it sometimes but he will come around! This is an excellent product for the money! It is quiet and you can set how you would like the fountain to be (large stream or a small trickle). If you are thinking of buying one I reccomend this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I like it more than my cats do","review":"I have two cats, who both like to drink from the spout in the bathtub.

Wonder if I can return it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO BIG!!!","review":"We have 5 cats and wanted to change over from the original pet fountain to this one since it claims to be quieter and better, but it is huge and makes the same amount of noise! If you care about your cats like we do then you will be unhappy to hear that there are a lot more parts to take off and clean and even though we bought the Drinkwell cleaning kit - it won't even reach all of the corners in the back tub! You literally cannot clean the lower corners unless you make your own cleaning tool or improperly bend one of them.Drinkwell is the only filtration system recommended by vets, so I would still buy their systems over others, but even with 5 cats this is way too big, too hard to clean and disappointing.We are sticking with our old model (even though it has begun to leak) and we are just going to replace the ring or motor if needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain","review":"The fountain is well liked by my two cats. One of my cats in particular, would only drink from the bathroom sink. The water is not filtered and has a lot of chlorine in it. I wanted a more convienient and healthy alternative. She, as did my other cat, loved it right away. The only negative has been that it is made of plastic. I wish is was made of a more healthy drinking material. You will have to wash it at least once per week ( the whole thing). I myself, have found it best to thoroughly clean it every 4 days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but can get messy","review":"My cats were basically indifferent to the fountain aspect of this product, to my surprise given that they love the shower so much. But I was pleased to have a fountain that continuously filters water and holds a good deal of it (very helpful for going out of town on short trips). I was disappointed, however, at how quickly the fountain gets scummy (I have two cats, so I'm sure that makes a difference) and the filter gets clogged, causing the water to run over it instead of through it. This basically defeats the purpose and causes a bit of a cesspool effect on the back side of the filter. Cleaning is straight forward enough, though, I have found that all pieces except the pump are dishwasher safe. I would recommend running the pump through some very dilute water/bleach solution to kill the scum that builds up around/inside it (rinsing very thoroughly before using again in the fountain).Overall a good product - a bit cumbersome, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to clean and quiet","review":"I received the larger, dog version from a friend to see if my cats liked it. One did, the other did not - too loud and \\"scary\\" and also too high. After much research, I bought this smaller cat version. It is SIGNIFICANTLY more quiet than the dog version, and my smaller cat is actually starting to use it. The big cat adores drinking right from the stream!I was concerned about the time and effort to clean it. I was shocked how easy it is to clean. Parts pull off easily and it is pretty intuitive how to put it back together. I did also buy the brush kit, and the long skinny brush is perfect for the pump infeed tube.Great product - glad I overcame my concern after trying the dog version and gave this one a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent fountain, but a little high maintenaince","review":"This is a wonderful way to get your kitties to drink more water, especially if you don't want to be running to the faucet each time they meow at you. LOL. The fountains do require a certain amount of maintenance to keep them running. You need to disassemble them and clean them weekly but I think it is worth it to keep my furchildren hydrated...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, humming a tad loud","review":"I'm glad I purchased this water dispenser for the sake of cleaner & aerated water for my cats. They were a little wary of the humming it produced, but I think their thirst overcame their apprehension. Eventually it just becomes another hum like the refrigerator or computer, blending into the background. I think since it's on my tile floor, I could place it on a small piece of thin dense foam (like the ones used in exercise routines) and the hum would be unnoticeable. With the added tank on the backside, the supply is ample, and I'm glad for the charcoal filters to rid their water of slime which was typical of their other water bowl that had stagnant water. I would definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Fountain We've Tried So Far","review":"The Drinkwell Platinum is great. We were constantly filling up our old one, but the reservoir on this seems to last my two cats for quite a while. I also really like the pre-screen before the pump. It keeps all the cat hair and various bits out of the pump, which means it is much less likely to break. Runs quietly and no loud gurgles and sputtering like our old Petmate, and the cats love it. The only issue we have with it has been mentioned several times, and that is that it appears to splash a bit too much and there is always water around it on the floor (easily enough that it could damage wood floors). I suggest buying the $12 mat that is made to go under it as the lip on it keeps the water from spreading, or find something else waterproof to set under it. This is definitely the best pet water fountain we've used so far, and is a much better price on Amazon then from the pet stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs up for Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain","review":"I have one cat that will not drink standing water and so I invested in the cheaper fountain probably four years ago. My cat liked the fountain but I sure hated cleaning the darn thing! I have arthritis in my hands and had a devil of a time getting the electric plug out of the bottom of the fountain.A few months ago I upgraded to the platinum version. I'm really glad I did for a number of reasons: the reservior is a great feature, particularly when I go out of town for the weekend; the fountain is MUCH easier to clean and I'm doing so on a weekly basis (I don't want to admit how infrequently I did it with the harder-to-clean version). The flow adjustment is much more sensitive too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cats love it!","review":"My 2 cats both love the fountain. The fountain does tend to get dirty more quickly than I would have thought though - it gets those slimy walls like a fish tank. It's true that it can all go in the dishwasher, but it's kind of a pain to empty, wash, and refill.I love that I don't have to fill the water reservoir very often and that my cats seem to be drinking more water, so it's worth it to me to have to go through the cleaning process.UPDATE: I have had the fountain for about 2 years now and the motor is dying (probably from sucking in cat hair, etc.). I was happy to find that replacement motors are available for this fountain online (didn't see these on amazon, but a quick internet search helped find them), including a motor that has a sensor to shut off when the water is low. Hopefully this will extend the life of the motor, but replacing after two years isn't too bad. Motors are $18-25 depending on whether you get one with the sensor or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Miracle Worker","review":"My cat ended up at the emergency vet on a weekend with a $750 bill. He had a urinary infection from not drinking enough water. My Vet recommended purchasing a fountain. I researched various fountains on the Net and settled on the Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain. Nothing but the best for our boys. It has been a life saver. He loves his fountain along with his brother and voila no more infections. You do need to clean it thoroughly once a week and we replace the filter every week also. This weekly maintenance is the most loving thing we can do for them and a lot less expensive than vet visits and meds. We don't mind at all. Our fountain is about 2 years old now and it still is working like new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets dirty fast, hard to clean","review":"Our cat and basset hound both love the fountain. The wife and I don't however as it gets dirty quickly and is a pain to clean. The filter and filtering gate do a poor job of collecting the countless crumbs from dinner that the basset hound leaves when she gets her after dinner drink. I realize this could just be a factor of our particular dog, so take my criticism with that in mind. In a matter of days the main spill reservoir's bottom is covered in food fragments. To clean the unit, you have to pick it up and hope to not spill too much water on your way to the sink as you tear the whole contraption apart to clean out all the little crevices that collect grime. Then when you mop the mess you made, you get to refill it, and try to get the wimpy pump primed so it will flow. Every week when I clean it, I get more upset at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot be easily cleaned","review":"I bought the Pet Fountain to replace a well used previous Drinkwell fountain. The previous one was more than 8 years old, and eventually the plastic started to break down from sun exposure thru the window (even though it was still working!) Based on performance of my previous fountain, I expect this one to last many years. I also found the Bio-Bag Medium filter cartridges (look in the aquarium section of your pet store) fit the fountain and are cheaper than the original filters.UPDATE: After having this fountain for a while, I'm very unhappy with it. The water tank grows algae and there's no way to get a brush in there to clean it. Poor design. The pump collects scum inside it, but again, there's no way to clean it out either. After cleaning, it seems difficult to re-prime the pump and get the water flowing again. The previous design was so simple, I don't know why they had to mess it up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"great until it died","review":"Ordered in November, R.I.P. April 25th. Worked great until it went belly up. Cats loved it.....not worth the price if only lasts 5-6 months"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought This Fountain Again! My cat loves it!","review":"I bought this fountain again after the motor in the first one conked out after a few years. My cat loves drinking from this fountain and won't really drink from anything that has still water. Unfortunately, he also likes to play in the stream so I put down an indoor/outdoor mat that dries quickly so the water doesn't muck up the floors. Oh, he also likes to take the top off the top reservoir so I have to place a piece of scotch tape on either side to keep him from flipping it off. My two Vizsla dogs also drink from the same fountain but I only need to fill the the back reservoir once a day. It's fairly easy to clean, which I do about once a week due to the cat playing in the water and some of his fur collecting around the motor casing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product - 5 cats approve","review":"I have 5 cats and if you try and use regular bowls you either have to put multiple bowls out or have to change/clean the main dish a lot. Smaller bowls tended to get tipped over and became messy quite quickly. The Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain is fantastic. The cats have clean, filtered water all the time and I believe it really helps their overall health because they are better hydrated. It does take some additional time and cost (new filters) to clean the unit but the trade off for multiple bowls and the improved quality of life for my cats is worth every minute. No complaints about anything other than the cost of the filters. Mine does not exhibit the leak when adding the reservoir and the top secures rather nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"We bought this for our two new kittens and it is great! The filter keeps the water clean and it is true that the sound of the running water draws them to drink more. We adopted the kittens from the Humane Society and one was a little dehydrated. She didn't drink much from the bowl but once this arrived, she started drinking more and now she is doing much better. We take a lot of long weekend ski trips and wanted this so the cats will have fresh water while we are gone for a few days; I think this will be perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountian","review":"Outstanding. About every 2 years, you need to replace the pump (approx $19.00). Great for Cat or Dog health. Pumps are hard to find, so go here, [...]. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"this fountain has changed our lives","review":"I love this fountain and so do my cats! I know for sure that my cats drink more water now. I used to watch them sniff their regular bowl and then walk away. Now they drink much more and sometimes even just watch the fountain as entertainment. The only time the motor seems a little louder is when the tank is almost empty. It can go almost a week though with no refills. It has a huge 128 ounce tank. My only complaint is that I dropped the tank once and it immediately broke! Replacement tanks are available for only about $15, but still I wished it didn't break so easily. I have dropped my humidifier tanks before without breaking them so I don't see why this one had to break. Other than that, it is sooooo great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your cat's own little piece of heaven","review":"I've had a family cat or have been around roommates' cats for 20 years. Most of them have pawed at their water dish because they can't see the water (cats can only see 3 colors) and have flocked to the sink (aka \\"sink drink\\"). I bought my current roommate's cat one of these and he LOVES IT. It took him about a week to get used to, but he no longer stands in the bathroom waiting for somebody to turn on the faucet. I liked it so much that I bought one for my parents' kitten as well and have recommended it to many cat owners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge Reservoir!","review":"This is the second fountain that we have bought and I wasn't sure if my cat would like this type (rather than the water sliding down type). My cat loves it and due to the huge reservior I do not have to fill it up every day like my other one (petmate). It is also the easiest reservior to lift out and to fill that I have ever seen and I am very pleased with this purchase. On my petmate model you have to lift off a top and then lift out the reservior - somewhat of a hassle. The reason that I did not give it five stars is that the noise is louder than my other one. Don't get me wrong, it is not very loud, but it is louder than my other one (probably a function of the type of fountain more so than any flaw)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, not bad.","review":"I bought this because my cat refused to drink out of his bowl and begged for water every time I went to the faucet. I don't see him using the fountain too often unless I put some ice cubes in it (yes, he is very spoiled). But overall, it is not bad. It is very quiet, holds a lot of water, and is fairly easy to clean. The only problem is that it sometimes leaks a little puddle. However, this might be my cat's fault."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just fine","review":"I would have given this a five star rating but it is a little tricky to avoid getting a bit of water on the floor when refilling the reservoir but its really not bad at all if you have the good sense to put your hand under the nozzle as you pick up the reservoir. I'd buy it again and recommend it to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My cat and I liked the fountain a lot. But then after just a year the motor stopped working well. The water just dribbles and the lever that should make it flow more and less no longer works. Now after I have had it less than a year and a half the dribbling water is splashing out and off the mat onto the wooden floor. I have tried all sorts of cures - new filter, taking it apart, etc. Nothing is working and I have little choice but to get rid of it. My cat is going to be so sorry to not have it, but the Drinkwell is too expensive to replace every year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked 5 whole months!","review":"Our last fountain (not the platinum one) lasted 4 years, and then we replaced it because those years of hard water had led to buildup that I could no longer get off. It otherwise still worked.This arrived in early March. A week ago it started making a terrible noise. Thinking it just needed to be cleaned, I unplugged it. A couple days later I cleaned it, plugged it back in, and absolutely nothing. It flat out will not turn back on. It apparently lasted just long enough that I can't dispute the charge with my credit card. We'll be looking at different types of fountains."},{"rating":"2","title":"to fix it","review":"For those of us with hard water try washing with white vinegar. Then run the base thru the dishwasher. Also if you pull out the small plunger on the lid prior to turning the water reservoir over it will stop your leak problems. A small strip of clear packing tape will keep the lid on and not show up. If you turn an end under it helps make it easier to remove later.. My only problem has been cleaning it often enough. When I don't the hair trap plugs up and the water runs over until the reservoir runs dry. But thats my fault not a design issue. I am ordering a new pump because mine finally died. A great product overall. I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This","review":"I have had this for almost 2 years and love it. It needs to be cleaned once a week but that is fine. Buy the cleaning kids it makes it easier to get in the small areas.

One of the cats always jumped up on the sink whenever the water was running and tried to drink from the stream. Now he has a stream all the time and no longer jumps on the sink.

I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improved it a bit too much.","review":"I've had Drinkwell fountains for years and loved them, as did our cats. Time for another one, and upgraded to the Platinum model. It is bigger, with a better design in putting it back together after cleaning; however, it is really big. You have to have a very large sink, or clean it in the bathtub. It is very difficult to hold in one hand while wiping all the crevices with the other hand. Putting a filled reservoir back on the fountain requires more graceful moves than I have, so water goes everywhere. I liked the older model much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the extra for the \\"platinum\\" version","review":"We wore out the originalDrinkwell Fountain, after at least five years of hard use under two slobbering cats. We liked the original fountain just fine, especially once we added the larger bottle sidecar, but it did require maintenance. Every so often it would stop up, and we had to take apart the \\"works\\" to clear out cat fur and other gloop from the system. Not an awful job, but not fun either.This one is far superior, and I'm glad we spent the extra money on it. It's quieter -- less like a water fountain on your kitchen floor than a quiet background burble. It holds a LOT more water, probably twice as much. And its construction makes it clear that it doesn't tie up the \\"moving parts\\" with the water flow; I don't expect that we will to have to dismantle the unit every six months. (And by \\"we,\\" of course, I mean my husband!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Easy to setup and get going. Remember to have enough water in the unit before powering on (follow the directions) to prevent damage.

Also, when you go to refill the bowl, wayer goes all over the place, & while it was running, my unit would spash water on the floor. I finaly just unpluged it & used it as a regular water bowl until I got a real stainless larger one. I think I can find a lot of better uses for the $60 I spent for this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks nice, but that's about it","review":"after about a year of use, this thing falls apart!!! On top of that, it's a pain in the neck to clean. it doesn't come apart so that you can clean the area where the motor is - which just happens to be where the most debris collects! We bought this just about a year ago now and the thing just started to die. The water doesn't flow out like it should. I called customer service and they suggested ordering another replacement and sending this one in for repair - at my expense no less.

For whatever reason, he didn't seem too interested in drinking out of it. In a side-by-side test, he preferred drinking out of his regular water bowl. No way for me to test it, but it could have been the noise of the unit. At the higher flow settings, the fountain is quite noisy, and even at lower settings, it's certainly audible.Eventually after about 2 months, the fountain just stopped working. Because it wasn't doing me much good anyway, I decided not to bother fixing the item. Could be this works well for cats (and some dogs), but I'd be cautious of the noise and durability issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud continuous noise (from pump, not water)","review":"It works well with respect to pumping the water. HOWEVER, the cheap vibrating pump it uses makes a loud, very annoying (at least to me) continuous hum.

I couldn't figure out why he just wouldn't use this thing after a few days and finally I just emptied it out and left it to sit empty. Soon mold appeared right above where the water line would have been. I wonder if it hadn't been there in small amounts despite cleanings and the cat could detect it. For that reason , and the fact that my cat was not into it so it was a huge waste of $$, I can't recommend this fountain. Come on people, stop making everything out of cheap plastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ended up Replacing It!","review":"I did use this fountain for a couple of years, so I'm not complaining about its construction or design. My cats love drinking from a fountain. Mine liked it when I left the top piece off of this fountain. My complaint is that this one is made of plastic and gets slimey feeling after only a few days. Also, some cats (mine) suffer from chin acne and eating/drinking from plastic can aggrevate this condition. It does go thru the dishwasher, so if you don't mind cleaning it every few days, it is a good fountain and has a bigger resevoir than most.

Great price too"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I bought the Drinkwell Platinum fountain for my two (now) 6-month old kittens. Before I bought it, the male kittie would knock over water bowls so he could play in the water. I kept buying progressively larger and heavier water bowls. The last water bowl was a large ceramic dog bowl. Eventually he grew large and strong enough to flip that over. I did some research online and learned about pet water fountains.The kittens like it and drink plenty of water. Cleaning the water fountain is a bit of a pain, but it beats mopping up water every day. That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of five. The kitten no longer tracks water around the house. Now he flips over the dry food bowls and plays kibble soccer with his sister."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Fountain - needs cleaning","review":"I upgraded from an older unit which served us well. I have no problem the the reservoir - it stands nicely in the corner of the sink. I did notice that if the inlet screen gets dirty and restricts the flow to the pump, the pump will pull water from the reservoir and overflow the unit. Keeping the screen clean avoids the problem, but it is probably a good idea to purchase the tray, which seems to just hold the overflow should it occur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drinkwell Platinum","review":"I like this fountain and it certainly does encourage my dog to drink more water. The only reason I do not like it is that it needs to be cleaned fairly frequently or the motor gets plugged with hair even with the new filter. I do not find it hard to clean, so I still think it deserves 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"good water fountain","review":"while the quality of the materials in this product could certainly be better (the motor), it is still of above average quality.more importantly, it has encouraged my cat to drink more, which is ultimately our goal here.as a bonus, my cat has started to hold her paws under the flowing water when grooming herself. while the hair filter over the pool intake does a good job of catching hairs, the charcoal filter inside it filters the more fine grained materials. depending on the quality of the water you put in this device, it does a good job of recycling water.if you are concerned by this, you should get used to cleaning this fountain regularly. i dismantle mine weekly and wash it thoroughly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overflowing Drinkwell","review":"I should have read the reviews before buying this. I had the original Drinkwell and loved it. I gave it away and bought the Platinum. I actually wanted the original, but the store no longer carried it so I thought what could be wrong with Platinum. The water pressure never equalizes as it says and then the bowl overflows. I went to a different store and found the original so I bought it and the overflowing platinum is on it's way back to the store!

Of course the item SHOULD be covered under the 1 yr warranty.....EXCEPT if you have hard water....tough luck for you- not covered.

However, it was quite noisy unless it was filled to the brim (that's the function of the clear plastic reservoir on the back). It has reached the point where the water cascades over the brim like Niagara Falls (then it's quiet) or else it is not leaking but makes so much noise my wife can't sleep with it plugged in. We are replacing it with the Drinkwell original, not as pretty but more reliable. Both fountains will get noisy unless they have enough water to make them happy. Why Drinkwell can't fix this is a mystery to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"drinkwell pet fountain","review":"Both my cats love this fountain.Now I don't have to turn on the tub faucet to let them drink.They totally prefer running water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This is a great buy for pets.

It did take him some time to adapt to it, but he is now drinking out of it, except he doesn't seem to drink the water stream like I was expecting. I added the cat grass adapter to it a few weeks ago, and it is growing very quickly. The water capacity is great, and it's very easy to set up.I bought the Platinum because of the advertised near silent operation and the water capacity. The motor does make a noticable hum, but I've had to set it up in the dining room, which is just off of the living room, so there aren't any walls to block the noise. It did start running louder last night, but I followed a recommendation on their website, shut it off overnight, and it's quieted down again this morning. It does need to be cleaned out regularaly...my cat's a Himalayan, so I don't doubt that it's picked up some hair in the filters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good bargain","review":"I received the unit as promised and 2 of my 3 cats starting drinking from it right away. My other cat is slowly getting the hang of it but still likes a morning treat from the bathroom faucet. I did not find any problem with the noise of the pump as in other reviews. It does take a little getting used to lifting the unit without causing a mess, but it is easy after you get the hang of it (just have to always grab the entire unit from the bottom). The instructions suggest putting icecubes in the reservoir but I found it easier and the cats prefer putting 3-4 cubes directly in the water dish (they seem to enjoy the noise of the cubes as they hit the water flow). The exact unit was $69 at local pet stores, so the price is right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"It took about a day or so before my cats caught onto this, but they now love it. I hear my cats over there drinking water straight from the fountain stream all day long.And this is silly, so don't judge: I was trying to show my cats how to use it when I first turned it on and they were still afraid of it... and I must say that the filters make the water taste great!My cats are both drinking much more water now. It's also pretty low maintenance - filling a reservoir twice a week vs. changing out the water in the old water dish twice a day.There is *some* motor noise, but not enough to bother me. I also enjoy the trickling water sound in my home."},{"rating":"2","title":"My cat loves it","review":"This fountain has worked very well for several months. I take it apart and clean it about once a week with vinegar and hot water. I replace the filter about every 6-8 weeks and this seems to work very well. The only reason I give it 4 and not 5 stars is there are some minor design changes that could make it better; 1:It would be nice if the tank was flat on top so that it would stand for easier cleaning and filling though this may encourage some cats to stand on it. 2: There are some places that are tough to get a brush into and clean. Realy these are very minor issues and my cat realy loves it and when I am ready to get a dog again I will not hesitate to purchase one for him.Update 1-13-2012: Still no complaints and still working well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing and expensive","review":"It worked well for a while. It is difficult to clean without special brushes. After a few months something stopped working so that the reservoir will suddenly dump all of its water into the system and the whole thing overflows.

I ordered the Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain since it got the best overall reviews. We've had ours for 4 weeks and we are both very happy. It only took about 30 minutes for her to figure out she never had to ask me to turn on the tap again. She always starts at the fountain; then drinks from the bowl and then switches back to the fountain and she is drinking more water then ever.

My cats really love it, the screen in the front catches a lot of cat hair and other gunk which means you have to take it apart and clean the pump far less frequently than with my old fountain. Still working with no problems after owning it for more than a year, my only complaint is that the linkage in the cord is really close to the plug side, not the pump side. What this means is that if you have things between your fountain and your outlet, you have to go around them to disconnect the linkage. If that link was closer to the pump side you could more easily disconnect it for cleaning purposes. It is a small thing to complain about, and it seems that every fountain is like that, but when you have to reach behind your fridge to disconnect it every time it needs cleaning it gets pretty annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome fountain","review":"This fountain really helps entice the cats to drink more water.

Quickly over time the flow started to slow down more, and after my last thorough cleaning the motor died in one day.I would like to return this item, but they are only going to refund a partial refund, and I would have to pay to ship the item out of pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. Nearly impossible to clean, and very fragile.","review":"I tried to return mine to Amazon but the return window is only one month; it broke at nearly exactly two months. So I can't return it. The problem with this unit is its poor design for cleaning. Since the biggest reason I bought it was for my cats' health, this creates dirty water fast. And for some strange reason, the power cord separates at about mid-point, which means you can't run this behind any large appliance to get to that last available outlet.This is a good idea, but it is most definitely not ready for general use. My wife and I are terribly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"This was very easy to set up. It runs very quiet....can't hear it at all on the current setting. My cat loves it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE!","review":"This water fountain was HUGE and scared my cat more than helped. Was not expecting it to be so large."},{"rating":"2","title":"MsLynBr","review":"This is our purchase of a second one! We bought this for our out-door cats (5 of them) as the 4 in-door cats drank more water from this then their bowls. Drinking more water promotes their kidneys to function better and we are hoping that means less trips to the vets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pet fountain!","review":"I was so happy to see my dog drink so much water! he loves it. First he started drinking from the bowl, then ventured to the stream. In the next few days he was drinking twice as much water as before and was drinking from the top of the stream! What a great product, even when he is not drinking the trickling water is a soothing sound! LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Cat loves it!!","review":"Not only does this provide a clean water supply for our cat but it is a source of entertainment as well! She loves to play with it and gets very concerned when we turn it off to fill the tank. She immediately goes over and waits for us to get it running again. This is easy to clean and is quiet except when our cat moves the lever to full throttle. Even then it is still not very loud. We are all really happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"On second Platinum, and this one is failing again.","review":"My two cats love the Drinkwell Platinum fountain. I have been very fastidious about keeping it clean, making sure there is no algae, and changing the filters.The first fountain failed after about 14 months of use. I contacted the manufacturer, who informed me the pump had failed, the item was out of warranty, and essentially I was out of luck- but they'd slightly redesigned the pump to make it easier to clean and so the failure rate was less. I threw away the first one and bought a second- and less than 9 months later, same problem.I won't recommend or purchase this item again, and will be looking for a replacement. I'm hoping to find an equally adequate product, as my cats have used this product since they were teeny kittens, and won't just drink out of a bowl now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get the cat to use it!","review":"Our cat loves climb up on the counters and drink from the sink faucets, but of course, someone has to be right there to turn the water on and off. We thought the Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain would be a terrific alternative, sort of a self-service water fountain that he could access independently. For some unknown reason, he just doesn't want to drink from it. If anyone else has had this experience and found a solution, I'd love to hear about it. Otherwise, it's pretty much useless to us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat completely uninterested","review":"The item was in perfect condition however my cat refused to drink from it. I tried to remove his old water plate, then he stopped drinking water completely. The fountain being on/off made no difference. I got this in hopes that it would attract my cat to drink more water but it had the opposite effect. He began drinking water regularly again the moment I returned his old water plate. I suggest you be wary that if your cat isn't already a flowing water drinker this item may or may not interest your cat. (My cat never tries to drink from the sink)"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"Worked ok for a couple weeks then started leaking. Also, I don't think it ever really filtered. Ended up tossing it and buying a different kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog and cats like it","review":"Got this when I got a dog so I wouldn't have to keep filling water dishes. The cats like running water in the sink anyway. This thing works great! It was really easy to set up. It was the second fountain that I got. The first was $20 more, smaller capacity, and took forever to set up.All the animals like drinking out of the stream rather than the pool at the bottom, and I like that the filter keeps hair and debris out of the fountain. There's a variable speed setting, also, but I don't see too much difference between full speed and low speed. The water noise isn't as bad as I thought it would be. Most of the time I don't even notice it.It's also hilarious to watch the animals try to capture the water stream. I'm sure they'll eventually figure out that they can't actually grab it, but until then, I'll be laughing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it til it quit working!","review":"I received this item along with the cleaning brushes I purchased seperately. I have not even had it more than a month and the motor (I think) has stopped working. I took great care in making sure I cleaned it and followed the instructions on it's care and use. I hope the company will contact me regarding this product and possibly replace it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drink Up","review":"Absolutely the best in animal watering systems. The capacity is much more than the older model with the separate, optional water bottle. As a result, the cats can go about a week between refills. They love to drink from the flowing water, and as an added benefit, there is the sound of water trickling, which is supposed to be good for your blood pressure, or karma, or something like that. Easy to take apart and clean. I recommend buying the brush kit that is made for the Drinkwell Fountains. It has 3 different sizes of brushes which make cleaning easier. Also, another option is the carbon filters, but I have used this product with and without the filters, and the cat's have never said a word about it, so I take that as a good sign."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to clean and very loud","review":"I loved this pet fountain when it first came because it holds a lot of water, which is great if you go on a short vacation. It was also easy to set up.However, the water gets dirty very quickly (I have two cats) and it's a pain in the butt to clean this machine. It holds so much water that it's heavy to carry to a sink and inevitably water spills on the floor. The sloping angle of the clear reservoir in the back makes it difficult to fill because you can't really set it down on anything - you have to hold it with one hand while filling it with water.Finally, the machine has become very loud over time. We try readjusting various components, which seems to make it quieter for awhile, but it's quite mysterious to me why it will suddenly starting humming very loudly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I have been using this fountain for about a month now and have not cleaned the motor which they recommend to do every week and it works great and it is quiet. My cats all 5 of them like drinking water from this fountain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drinkwell fountain","review":"I got the Drinkwell Platinum pet fountain. The seller information was easy to read and helpful. It arrived in a timely matter and in good conditon. I like the fountain, especially the resevior. You don't have to fill it very often. As with the original fountain, when it gets low it makes a lot of noise. My cat seems to like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow much better then the original","review":"All i can say is way better and wow. At least so far lol. Had the drinkwell original first which started leaking on me pretty quick my warranty got me a new one and they upgraded me to this . Much bigger water reserve and the better design by far. Ill let you know if this one leaks at all on me but the motor seems to be better designed on this one so i doubt this will be a issue now. But make sure to always have something under these im glad i did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runs fine but poorly engineered","review":"This product runs smoothly. It is so poorly engineered, however, that we stopped using it after about two weeks and will be returning it. It is very heavy, especially when full of water. There is no place to grip the machine, so it is hard to lift or move. You need to clean it out periodically, of course, but the opening from the water tank does not seal itself when you remove it, so all the water spills out on the floor unless you carry the whole thing to a place with a drain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Water Fountain Wonderful!","review":"After using the Cat It dome water feeder and struggling to keep it clean and full - a friend recommended the Drinkwell and what a difference! It is very easy to clean and doesn't have a lot of pieces to get filmy. The motor is inside which helps as well! Plus you fill it and forget it for a week! I highly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky cat fountain...","review":"Ever hear of the \\"find Waldo\\" game? Well, with this fountain, it's \\"find the leak\\" game.

Since I have hardwood floors, I purchased a jumbo foil roasting pan to keep the fountain in just in case I forget to clean it and it overflows.

It is fairly quiet and the cord is about 3 feet and may limit where you can set it up. The water seems to stay pretty fresh and never runs dry. I still clean the base once a week as it can become slimy. I am not convinced the filter adds benefit and sediment/food particles settle to the bottom of the dish. I doubt I will purchase more filters. The convenience of not having to tend to the water bowl frequently is wonderful. The reservoir tank drips as it is inserted into the base. A big minus since not user friendly for children. The flow adjuster lever is very flimsy so use a gentle hand. This is still new to my houselhold but am pleased to see a happy cat and hope it holds up over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this","review":"This fountain is very easy to use and has been perfect for my two cats who loved to drink from my facets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than catit water system.","review":"Bought this because the CatIt fountain was getting too much slime IMHO.

He now uses it without a problem and likes to drink from the stream of falling water. I like it because I can go a few days between reservoir fillups and somehow the water stays relatively cool. I've only cleaned it once so far in the 1 month that I've owned it, but it was pretty easy. The sound of the water flowing is a little noticeable at first, but it's nothing that's going to keep you awake at night or anything. The pump is also pretty quiet... no worse than a fish tank anyway. If your pet prefers running water over the typical water dish, I'd recommend giving this product a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drinkwell Pet Fountain - Motor crapped out 8 months after purchase","review":"My cats loved this Drinkwell fountain:Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain 168oz. The motor started to fail about 6 months after I purchased it. Now it produces a tiny stream of water and makes a lot of noise. There was only a 1 month return period. For a $48 isupposedly \\"quality\\" item, this is unacceptable. I purchased this from B&J; Pets & Aquariums, Inc. through Monster Pets.

Stay tuned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pet Fountain","review":"Both my cat and my dog love this. It did take a day or two for the cat to warm up to it though. I love everything about this item except for the cord. I think they should provide a protective cord covering for this item. After all....it is for pets and they like to chew. Knowing this I put a protective cover over the cord when I installed it, but the little brat found the only place on the cord where the cover wasn't!

I live at downtown San Diego, which is on the sea level. It's all about the defective reservoir.

My rescue cat was not drinking water and developed a urinary infection. After trying other fluid introduction to no avail, the future looked grim. I noticed his underbite. Although slight, it interfered with his ability to comfortably drink from his bowl. Running water in the tub allowed him to drink, but the waste of water was crazy. AMAZON TO THE RESCUE - AGAIN! The fountain was delivered quickly. It was very easy to set up. I placed it on a plastic placemat, but the splashing is minimal and due only to my cat. It makes no more noise than a decorative fountain you'd see in homes. It did not scare the animal & his water intake is 100% improved. Having purchased the cleaning brushes enabled me to clean the unit expediently & with no difficulty. Our local water department increased chlorine levels & the filtration system eliminates the slight odor. This is one item any pet owner would be smart to purchase. It is well worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good buy","review":"I have this item for a few weeks now, It seems well made and of good quality and am very pleased with it so far.

I didn't notice my cat using it any more or less than a bowl of water. However, the issue I have with the product is that you need to clean it at least weekly and that takes about 10 to 15 minutes to clean it properly (yes, I bought the cleaning kit for this unit). After doing this for about 6 months, I decided it was much easier to just dump and refill a bowl every day which only takes about 15 seconds. If cleaning the unit only took a couple of minutes, I would probably still be using it. Perhaps Drinkwell could improve the design to eliminate the time it takes to clean this unit and then it might be worthwhile. For now, I'll stick with the ceramic bowl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud, but gets the job done","review":"The cats seem to drink more water than before (so it does the job for which it was purchased), but this thing is LOUD.

Well, that's not now it turned out. One of my cats is kind of skittish, so it was not a surprise that she rejected this thing, but my male cat drinks out of the faucet in the bathroom sink, which seemed to be the indicator of the readiness of a cat to use the fountain. I tried EVerything to get him to use it and he WOULD NOT. I have passed it along to a friend who has a cat and hopefully she will use it. I don't intend to pay for return shipping on this, so LET THIS BE A WARNING. Not every cat will use this. BEWARE of buying this online and then being stuck as I am - either springing for the return shipping and getting back a fraction of my investment or giving a very pricey gift to a friend.

I purchased it so when I went away for a weekend I would know my pets had enough water, but without a water source, it's still a finite amount. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy for Convenience Sake","review":"I bought this fountain for the sake of convenience, but what I did not realize was that scum would quickly build up on the inside surfaces that are in contact with water. After about a week or two, the inside of the bowl would feel slimy, and I would feel the need to clean it. Even using a dishwasher to clean it I found it was too much work to be worth using, so I switched back to bowls filled with brita pitcher water, and now the fountain has a spot in the top of the storage closet. My cat did not seem to drink more or less when the fountain was in use. I'm not sure whether the scummy buildup on the plastic is harmful to cats or not, but it just made the fountain seem gross.Other than that, the fountain seemed to work very well. It is a good design, and the plastic is of high quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really nice.","review":"I really like the pet fountain. Easy assembly.

The pump is about as loud as a fridge and randomly gets very loud, where I can hear it from the other side of the house. Takes a small tap with my foot to make it quiet down.Needless to say, the cats are scared to death of it. They have not tried to drink from it, and when they walk by it they try to put as much distance from it as they can. Just I begin think they are not as scared of it, it gets VERY loud and they start to freak out again. For $40 bucks, this is ridiculous.

Really isn't very loud if you put everything together properly and let the water balance. It's a similar noise as any other small desk fountain. You will hear a motor and the water running. The loud noises only happen when the water levels are wrong. It's rather large and does splatter a little tiny bit.However, my cat won't touch it. Sniffed and then never drank from it. After giving her no water for a bit less than a day and her obviously willing to die of dehydration rather than drink from the fountain, it's now, sadly, part of a give-away box as I'm well past the return date.So, to owners who haven't used 'fountains' before with their pets, try it fast... if your pet won't drink from it, send it back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Buy","review":"I have had this fountain for almost 2 months now, and my cat still hasn't used it. I know it says it may take time for animals to get used to it, but Im beginning to think this was not a good buy. My cat continues to drink out of his regular bowl, and will wait for his regular bowl even if he is thirsty. Im not saying its not a good product, but in my case my cat is either too picky or scared to drink out of it. Out of my experience, I give it two stars for being nothing but a cute decorative fountain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good feeder with large reservoir.","review":"We had purchased the smaller Drinkwell pet fountain,Drinkwell Original Pet Fountain, and felt it was little on the small side, so we upgraded to this fountain. We have two large cats, and live in a dry climate (Nevada), and found the other fountain just didn't have enough of a reservoir to keep us from having to constantly refill it.This fountain was easy to assemble, and it runs quietly with the motor properly adjusted. The cats seem to enjoy it, too - most cats seem to like to drink out of \\"running,\\" water. Additionally, we have had relatively few problems with it mechanically, but sometimes it can be difficult to fill the reservoir and get it back on the fountain without spilling. It's not a REAL problem, though, as the spilling is usually minimal given some due care.Other than its cost, it's definitely a step up from feeding cats out of bowls of water, and it's been generally been a nice, reasonably-priced addition to our pets lifestyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good with time...","review":"I have had this product for over a year now, and it has caused me so many problems. The first months were great, but the cleaning process is tedious work and takes much effort. After about 8 months, there was a giant pool of water around the fountain. I kept using a towel underneath it, but it would mold easily. I am still using this product, but only because if I use anything smaller, my cat will pour out the water by picking at the bottom and tipping it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Silent. Decently attractive. Lots of water. Nice stream. Captain Janeway, our persian, seems to like it. Our of her bowl, she would use her paws to drink, but this seems to attract her directly to the water, especially the stream. She still cannot figure out how to get her head in there without the water hitting her on top of the head, she seems worried about that which is hilarious! Otherwise, bought it on gold deal and it was definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our kitties LOVE this fountain!!","review":"I got this fountain because I'd been having trouble keeping enough fresh water available for my three kitties. Years ago I'd had an older version of this same machine, which had broken after a period of use.It was nice to see that this machine comes with instructions (and encouragement) for cleaning. I've found that our machine doesn't need to be cleaned as often as they recommend, but it's EASY to do, and I'm delighted knowing that I can help ensure that the machine will last a good long time.My oldest kitty was terrified of the machine at first, and wouldn't get near it even when tempted by treats. After just a few days, though, she joined her little \\"sisters\\" and now happily drinks from the running water. I was surprised how much more water they drink from this bowl than from their other ones. I expect their health has improved with increased hydration...I'll also say that the motor is a little bit noisy, but it doesn't bother our family."},{"rating":"1","title":"No improvements in this model","review":"I owned the original Drinkwell fountain, and loved it. I even ordered the larger dog size water canister. LOVED it. When it broke, I decided to try what I thought was the newer upgraded model. Thought is the key phrase. To start, the water canister is horrible to fill. You have to hold it while you fill it. The round shape causes it to dump over in the sink. 2nd, After I filled it, I kept finding pools of water around the fountain. Apparently, it leaks? Needless to say, this no lives in the garage NOT being used. I got tired of cleaning up the resulting flood, and of hearing the loud motor noise. Miss my old one, but this one isn't worth the $$$."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plastic, not platinum","review":"Our cat no longer lies in wait demanding that we turn on the bathroom sink faucet, so we love the fountain. I do wish itwere available in stainless steel, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this","review":"When I bought this I paid twice as much as the previous fountain expecting a better product. I had it 88 days and then the pump quit working. I wrote the company to ask them to send a new pump and 6 emails later they refused to honor the warranty. Buyer beware. This is a disreputable company with a poor product. I went ahead and ordered the Petmate replacement pump as recommended by other Amazon customers. This fountain is a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"So noisy!!!","review":"The machine is in the kitchen, and I can hear it running in my bedroom which is 30 feet down the hall. I used to have the Petmate one, and that one was great. I got this one because it holds more water. It's been great not to have to refill it, but not worth the noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it! But only at the sale price I bought it for!","review":"I bought this Drinkwell approximately 2 weeks ago and at that time it was on sale for $41.44, today I see it's back up closer to its MSRP (Manufacturer Suggested Retail price). I love this thing, my cats are so cute drinking from it and I'm happy knowing they're well hydrated with clean water. They tend to make their own water bowl rather messy by dipping their paws in it all the time and I was changing it at least twice a day. This fountain is actually pretty easy to clean so far, my cats don't seem to get it too dirty. I actually regret purchasing the Pet Fountain Cleaning Kit, I hardly used it in the cleaning. If anything these brushes made the cleaning more awkward minus one spot they were good at getting. But as much as I love it...I wouldn't pay the MSRP, this item was perfect at exactly what I paid. I rarely spend $70 on anything, much less a fancy cat bowl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drinkwell Platinum","review":"The animals like the moving water and it's fresh and aerated. This is my second one. On the first one, one of the plastic parts on the motor broke when it was not that old and I was unable to buy that 5 cent part on its own. I was told I had to buy the whole motor which was nearly the price of the whole unit. After a lot of searching I was able to buy a metal washer the right size and kind of fix it so it was usable. I hope the second one holds up a little longer. I have a male cat with bladder/urinary issues and I think it's important he has water available that's fresh and attractive to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hit in our household","review":"I really like this product, and so do my three cats and two dogs. It's easy to clean and fill, and pretty quiet, other than the sound of water falling softly. My pets line up to drink from the spout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most cats will like it - in time","review":"Excellent product. Most of our cats like it (we have three) but one wouldn't have anything to do with it for several weeks. Perhaps she thought it was too big and intimidating. The only negative point is that the electrical cord it too short. Our old fountain, a Petmate, has a cord a full 16 inches longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"my cats love it","review":"The reviews that give the unit the lowest grade tend to complain about noise. I agree that the unit is too noisy. I'd be willing to pay more for a silent or near-silent motor. Fortunately, the noise doesn't both my cats. They have stopped begging me to turn on the faucet in the bathroom so that they can drink from it. I got the unit so that they could have 24/7 access to water that they will drink, and that mission was accomplished.THREE MONTHS LATER: I never want to be without one of these fountains again. Not only has it stopped my cats from drinking out of the bathtub and sink, but I don't have to refill it every day. They drink more water. It's easier for me. Win-win."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Capacity but Noisy","review":"I've had a Petmate FreshFlow in the past which didn't work out very well because the pump died several times and my cat figured out how to flip open the top and drag the wet filter all over the house. The Drinkwell fountain keeps the filter far enough away from the water that my cat isn't tempted to rip it open or if she is tempted she hasn't figured out how to open this one's lid. The capacity is incredible! I don't have to worry about it running out and damaging the pump while away on vacation. My only complaint is the noise level. I never heard the Petmate pump unless it was clogged or out of water. I hear the Drinkwell pump all the time and it's loud enough to keep you awake at night. I just hope the pump doesn't die out on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"cats love it","review":"I bought the Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain here on Amazon because they have the best deals here. I am very happy with the product, and so do my cats. It is very quiet, and seems to hold a LOT of water as well. My cats have always liked the fountain, and this is a great way to keep their water fresh for days/weeks on end. Every so often I do have to add more water, and like that it is dishwasher safe. We will likely be Drinkwell customers for life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My cats love this thing!","review":"Let's get one thing straight...My cats love this thing. And if they are happy....we then so am I !I have learned a very hard lesson though....hard water is tough on this unit. So now I used the same filtered water in this as I drink myself. I have one of those Brita unit that holds more than a gallon and use it to replace water after cleaning and when it needs filled. NOW it stays clean the amount of time it should and the motor didn't strain from deposits inside. Love the new thing they have that makes it start back up after a power outage!! yes! Glad they're improving! Wish I'd bought at Amazon to save on shipping but I was not enlightened at the time. Filters are bought here. And when I need a new unit it will be too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Great product!! I've told everyone at work about it and their first question is always - does the noise bother you? My answer is that we have a fish tank so we don't notice it. It has a pump and trickling water just like the tank. My 4 finicky cats love it. One will only drink from the stream and the other 3 got used to the bowl very quickly. I slowly took away their other water dishes. They most definitly drink more than they used to. We have to clean the hair filter daily (2 are long hair!) and the water lasts for 6-7 days. It's soooo nice not having to change 4 water dishes every single day!!! It is also amazing how much hair the filter catches. I wonder how gross it used to be for the cats to drink from regular bowls. This product is extremely user friendly. We absolutely love this purchase!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it.","review":"I like this a lot - its easy to clean, and easy to refill.

This product is a winner in our household!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than a running facet...","review":"Simba (our cat) wants to drink water from facets, my water glasses, toilets, and anywhere that is not his water dish. So I jumped at the chance to buy this product (after reading many many Amazon reviews of this and other similar products). I was a little concerned about the pump breaking as others had cautioned, and about water noise.I have had no pump problems, and I believe this is because I make sure that the reservoir is always kept full so that the pump does not pump air (which damages it). Also, I clean it monthly (not weekly, as is recommended).The water noise: was not a problem until my partner accidently broke off a piece of the lever that controls the water output. Now it's loud and irritates me. It's in our dining room and I have to shut the door there when I go to sleep to have peace. Lesson here: be careful when cleaning the machine. Don't break that lever.Otherwise, great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Resevoir Problem","review":"I have had this fountain for over 6 months and it has worked great up until now. I don't clean it as often as I should and that has not been a problem. One time the water wasn't pouring out of the spout so I opened it up and saw that there was hair around the motor, after I removed that, it seemed to fix that problem. The one problem I am having is that sometimes, if I let the fountain go too long without refilling it (like if I've been a way for a few days)when I refill it, the reservoir continues to fill the fountain until it is overflowing, it doesn't stop itself. Has anyone had this problem or know how to fix it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!!!!!","review":"This is very deep on the inside! go for this product i just love it. its very roomy and easy to zip b/c your toy/others go to the bottom and you can't feel them b/c of the padding wich is great! i'd love it more and give it five stars but the zipper is easy to zip but small so like the other review be jental with it! ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not as advertised","review":"I returned this item because it is not as advertised.

However, mine came cracked in two places because of the very poor way it was packaged. Shipping it back would be half the price of buying it in the first place.

I didn't find much in it that clearly represented any Methodist beliefs as they are taught by Wesley and the Church. What I did find was a sort of fuzzy Liberal American Protestantism that has little to do with the mainstream of Wesleyanism. You would do much better to read \\"John Wesley's Message Today\\" by Lovett Weems Jr. OR \\"Eight Life-Enriching Practices of United Methodists\\" by Henry H. Knight III OR \\"A Pocket Story of John Wesley\\" by Charles A.

You won't get to know any great Methodists well from this book. You also won't learn much about Methodist doctrine.You will get a watered-down, highly liberal slant on what the United Methodist Church is up to today, with a little skewed history tossed in. If that's what you want, order it. If you want to find out about Wesley, order a biography or his own writings instead.

I'll have to buy a good Kensington T-bar lock to replace it.It does seem to work properly with the slot in the other end of the chain and the steel cable seems to be good.

The last one is a KEY (!!!) lock with a black-plastic covered cable. I'm amazed that this vendor would dare show pictures of 3 completely different locks presumably representing what you are buying. The one you get smells of machine oil and is cheaply built - probably $3.00 in Chinatown. I'm extremely disappointed, as now I need to return them and repurchase good ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Description says the cable is 6 ft long. Not on what I received. One of the locks wouldn't fit the locking slot on the laptop, I worked on that now it fits. I figured the cable and locking mechanisms were worth the $8 and I could make them work. I do wish they would have the 6 ft. cable can't make it longer. Now my real complaint. Shipping costs. The cable is listed as weighing 2 lbs. I received three and the USPS label said the weight for three was 2 lbs. I paid $16.47 for shipping and I would guess that was twice what it actually cost. Wish there was something other than not to buy we could do to make shipping costs realistic. Appears to me what they don't make on the product they make up on shipping and that ever elusive extra called Handeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"FALSE ADVERTISING!","review":"This lock is falsely advertised. It did not have a 6 foot cable, it was missing an essential lock piece that was not even in the packaging, and the locking mechanism did not fit my notebook's lock slot. This to me is unacceptable.

I'd bet it could be dismantled with a flathead screwdriver without harm to the computer.

Shortly after this set was released, the band was involved in a car accident that sent Nathan Shepard (keys, sax) back to his native Australia for rehab. John Grey's wife was also seriously injured. But the music is aging well. \\"Nare Sugar\\" is one of the grittiest funk grooves. If it doesn't get your toe tapping, you'd better check to see if you have a pulse. Mofro takes their time, not rushed to compact the music into a pop formula. This allows the jams to expand and build to full-blown hurricanes. \\"Whitehouse\\" is a jewel with its soulful vocals and Shepard's keyboards. This is an excellent set that will not fade away. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked from the beginning","review":"It's not too often that I find myself humming and singing along to a new album the first time I pop it in the CD player. This album \\"Blackwater\\" was a chance find - a friend at work had it on his desk and offered to let me borrow it for a listen. I was hooked the first time I played it. You can't help but move to this music and their down-home earthy sounds that make you smile to be a Southerner. Reminds me of just hanging out listening to great soulful music in college when people knew how to kick back and just have a good time. Plus great lyrics that really make you respect home in the South. Can't wait for their next album due out in 2004 and to see them live!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"In an age of over-produced copy cat CD's Mofro brings something different to the music scene - honest music.

This CD belongs in the collection of every Southern funk music lover. In fact, buy two cause you'll wear the first one out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Permanant selection","review":"It is rare that this disc ever leaves my player. I have been hooked on MOFRO since the very first time I heard them, when my ex brought back a demo tape to use for her audition. When she went out on tour with them a month later, 'Blackwater' was the only thing I listened to, 24 hours a day. Now, over 2 years later, and after seeing them live well more than a dozen times, this CD is still a permanant selection. If perchance it does make its way out of the player, it's usually back in no less than 48 hours. No other music has ever touched me in the way that MOFRO has, all the way down to the very bottom of my soul. The purest spiritual ecstasy I have ever experienced it at a MOFRO show.

The book offers realistic, doable advice for women of all ages. It covers topics such as fashion, food, entertaining, and beauty. She has some great advice especially when it comes to dressing chicly, decorating your home on a budget. It also has some nice sections on being spiritual and giving back to your community, which I think is rare in books like this. It also encourages women to be modern women.

From what to keep in your closet to how to repair your faucet to investment to friendships to snapping out of a blue spell, her advice is flawless. Johnson's own drawings, full of charm and character, enliven almost every page. Amazing - this one beats out \\"The Go-Girl Guide\\", \\"The Bad Girl's Guide\\", and just about any other book you can think of that tries to tell young women how to live.

Reading more than one chapter a week is not a wise idea, as it is a bit overwhelming but if you take it slow, this work is a wonderful collection of tips and tricks to live a healthy and successful life. I especially appreciate the parts of the book where the author talks about how being single is okay. . . I highly recommend this book. Okay, so it can be heterosexually-oriented, but it does incorporate some experiences for and about lesbian women. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny as hell & very practical!","review":"I am in my late-30s and thought the title looked catchy, so I bought this book. I love to read, but don't really own any self-help books. I thought this book was very cleverly written - funny as hell & very practical!

It is light, funny & a good buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Find!","review":"I've had this book for YEARS and STILL love it!

This book is great for a girl who has just graduated from college or is living by herself for the first time. Definitely something for the younger, less experienced ladies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to expectations","review":"After reading the reviews that others left, I excitedly ordered this book & then impatiently waited for it to arrive. I dug in as soon as I got the package opened, but I was sorely disappointed when I read through it. To me, it was a very shallow book with very little of substance to it. I was looking for something that would truly be helpful to me in choosing clothing for my job, in getting relationship advice, in knowing how to be a success in my 20's........all I can say is that I am disappointed in myself for believing the reviews--that these things could be found in this book.

Consisting of barely 80 pages, it starts with a short introduction of the nature of Maya writing and its decipherment, both of which you will find in more comprehensive and understandable form in Michael Coe's \\"Breaking the Maya Code\\". It then switches very fast to some rather specialist examples completely unsuited for the beginner. In the end, you get 1 (read:one) sample text, and that's about it. On the positive side, which is as thin as the book itself, Houston mentions some interesting details, like the stylistic variations among glyphs of different regions, which are rarely found in other volumes, but these tidbits of valuable information hardly constitute a reason to purchase this book.

He witnesses a murder and gets involved with a bunch of chicks that can materialize swords and have other strange powers. He has a unfortunate past that he has somehow forgotten. He is also the key to saving the city from the murderer.Chaos;Head is a very strange anime. I was kind of confused for an episode or 2. It's hard to figure out what's real and what's not. If you try not to figure it out and over think it you'll probably enjoy it more. The animation and the voice acting are good, and the story is pretty involved. The saving grace of this anime is the cast of characters. The characters are pretty cool and interesting. I actually enjoyed it more the 2nd time around. The story is very heavy and not for everyone. I think every anime fan should watch it, but I would try to rent it or watch it on youtube first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Story","review":"I found the art and story line well done.

It kind of grew on me after the first few episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good...but the game is FAR better","review":"As someone who's played the visual novel (Japanese story-based video game) on which this anime is based off of, I must say that the anime is disappointingly lackluster in comparison. Which isn't to say the anime wasn't great, it was. But, the game is just so much better. So, I can't exactly warrant throwing down $40 on this when you can purchase and English patch the game instead.Seriously do. It's an AMAZING game. (For anyone who's played any other visual novels, I'd say this is second only to Ever 17: The Out of Infinity...and that is saying a LOT)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If you are like me, you have stumbled across Chaos;Head due to the anime Steins;Gate, both having been created by 5pb. and Nitroplus. However, Chaos;Head does not measure up to Steins;Gate in any sort of positive way. In a nutshell, Chaos;Head is plagued by: inconsistent animation that varies from mediocre to garbage; a cast of ridiculously unlikable characters that you will be cheering to get the axe; and an overly ambitious plot that eventually devolves into what feels like fan-fiction. It is hard to believe that this load of tripe came from the same studio that gave us Steins;Gate. However, I recommend you save your money and wait for the eventual release of S;G on Blu-ray...I know I wish I had done the same!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor story, good animation, sort of cool premise.","review":"The animation and music are very good. Some attempt is made to make deeper characters. However, the story and plotting is poor. It copies elements from other animes, like bleach (the D-sword). It was a neat idea to make the main character a hardcore otaku, but it doesn't culminate into something more for him. In short this anime lacks meaning and narrative. It goes off on its own tangents, and sometimes it goes nowhere. There isn't much reason to watch this. Its mostly a generic crap anime. It would have made a better video game than an anime. If you are looking to spend money on anime there are other places you should put it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"If you're into animes with lots of action, then this one is not for you.

The best thing about this book, however, was the dialog. The author did a good job with Medieval \\"speak\\", giving the reader the impression of really being there.

Most burn brilliantly with the earthy essence of the Southern Appalachians, and most are like kindling: they burn quickly. His poems are conversational and simple, and they deal with such subjects as farming, lumbering, and ramblings through the forest. They have intellectual weight but are not self-referential, since Morgan writes about real life in the mountains. A lovely book, and an absolute bargain for only two bucks--while other poets are asking fifteen dollars for volumes of poetry of a similar length.

You'll need to get your GM to allow the new rules and combat options first.There are 5-6 pages on new combat options called Manuevers and action types. While very interesting, they could potentialy slow down the pace of combat as you figure the points required for each manuver. They do seem balanced, an example being a manuver that sacrifices attacks to deal more damage.There are also some very unique prestige classes. The combo of new prestige classes and unique manuvers can really help to differentiate your character, especialy for a combat oriented one that would like to specialize in a specific weapon.Masters of Arms has a prestige class for every major type of weapon, including: Axe, Bow, Dagger, Sai, Cloak, Glaive, Sword+Shield, Rapier, etc. In fact, there are 35 weapon specialist prestige classes.All in all, an excellent fighter/combat orientied book of prestige classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album","review":"This was a very moving and up Lifting Album.

I also searched for the remote that was optional and it wasn't cheap ($25) so I said, \\"don't really need it\\". I am a litte concerned about the way cameras are being designed, I don't like the sliding cover as you know things wear out in time. So I am keeping my old camera for back up.

Geez, I was awestruck at the amount of poor writing and overinflated depictions of life in I-Banking. Spare me! I was shocked that the authors made it out of high school much less college and prestigious business program. (I should apply to the school and tell them you can't tell me \\"no\\" because you said \\"yes\\" to this guy, and look how he writes and openly acknowledges he's an alumni member.) Spend your money elsewhere. Find folks in the business. You will fare much better. This should get negative stars for a poor attempt at a marketing/advertising book attempting to be substantive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sooo much fun!","review":"I bought this for my gf because her old one was stolen before we got together, and she LOVES it! I got it to use primarily on her because she enjoys being spanked, but I've let her use it on me a few times and I'm starting to enjoy being spanked with it myself. It doesn't hurt like you might think it would, and the 22\\" length is perfect to get some good velocity for the really satisfying whaps. Plus, the many-strand design means it can alternately be used as a tickler as well as a spanker - it feels simply amazing having the strands gently go up and down my spine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great service... lousy battery","review":"The service was quick and reasonably priced.

After the show closed, I got my hand on a copy of the whole musical and I haven't stopped listening to it for about a week.The ability of Ahrens and Flaherty to put you in such a distinct place and time is so evident here. The music and voices are about as Irish as you can get. Each of the singers are perfect, the stanadouts being Jessica Molaskey as Mrs Patrick, and Steven Pasquale as Robbie faye. My favorite songs in the recording have to be the two I already mentioned, \\"Our Father\\" and the haunting \\"Confusing Times\\"No, it's not the multilayered, epic story of Ragtime, and it doesn't have to be. \\"A Man of No Importance\\" is a lovely, heart-wrenching story about a man looking for his honest place in the world, and will make a fine addition to your showtune collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"A man of no importance song book.","review":"A MAN OF NO IMPORTANCE was listed as a book so I was quite surprised when it showed up as a songbook.

However, the metal is so flimsy I couls bend them back with my hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stupid Lip","review":"I would give this a 5 star rating but the rack had a lip on it which did not fit my power conditioner.

Great rack as long as you don't need to modify the metal lips."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT!","review":"When I bought my rack shelves I was somewhat concerned that, at these prices, they would be maid from tin foil.

In the past, someone had installed boiler values as taps--intolerable--where a wall-mount faucet should have been. Unfortunately, wall-mount faucets are harder to find than I thought. And where you can find them, they are pricey. I was just looking for something basic. This was what I needed, and I'm glad I found it.The faucet looks better than I needed it to. It's a good buy. BUT:1. The spout on the faucet I received is different. The one in both Amazon's current picture and the picture on the box has a straight spout. The spout on the faucet I received is more curved and the treaded opening of the spout is more obliquely angled.2. There are no instructions with the faucet, which is too bad, because you cannot install this without a 15/16\\" hex wrench. It really would have saved me a lot of time if that were indicated somewhere before I wanted to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth taking out of the box.","review":"Let's start with it looks good, feels nice and heavy, and it's cheap. Those are the only good things about it. Unlike any other wall mount faucet I have installed, the part that connects to the supply lines is two piece. The thing is actually threaded in the middle and goes together with an o ring. This probably would not matter except that it has to be tightened to the supply on one end and the faucet itself on the other. Since you have to tighten in opposite directions, you loosen up the center and it leaks around the o ring. I finally had to remove the whole thing, tighten both connectors with two pair of vice grips, and then clamp a pair of vice grips directly on the joint to keep it from loosening up while I tightened everything else. Two weeks later, the threads stripped out on the cold water side of the faucet.

The crazy plot is centered around a surburban housewife, Beverley Surphin (marvelously played by Kathleen Turner), who lives with her husband (Sam Waterston) and her two fine teenage kids (including Ricki Lake) in a beautiful Baltimore home. However if anybody annoys her, even for the most trivial of matters, she kills them. Such hilariously over the top incidents include her childs tutor telling her that her son is not as academically clever as other students - for this she runs him over. An arrogant middle aged woman that is always continually rude to her son at his workplace in a video shop -for this she again kills her. Sounds absolutley preposterous to read about but this crazy black comedy actually is very funny throughout, thanks to a fast and furious dialogue and an excellent performance from Kathleen Turner.

A brilliant twist on bland sitcom suburbia (Kathleen Turner fits the title role perfectly) mixed with biting commentary about the media hype surrounding trials (and especially since it came out shortly before the OJ Simpson trial).Waters' DVD commentary is always funny and insightful, especially herein.

That's not a big deal when you read it, but it is kind of weird to hear a voice that sounds more like Sean Connery coming out of Pierce's mouth. The action and story, however, are really exciting and fun to play. It's not only FPS, but you are also driving levels as well. My favorite part is that you actually get to drive in a submarine car like what was in the movie \\"The Spy Who Loved Me\\". Overall, just a fun game that Bond fans will love, once they get used to the weird voice of 007"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, Tedious, and outdated","review":"I've been playing games since I can remember, and right away one thing sticks out like a sore thumb when I put this in my xbox:the ai is a joke.

A lot of things that you should have control over are watched via cinematics.The graphics work, the sound is ok(bond is ruined by the terrible impersonator, a suprise after Buffy), and unlike Goldeneye, there is no consitent hit detection or blood.So I guess you will love this if you are the type who lines up to get DAD when it came out on DVD, otherwise halo,unreal,rtcw,and moh frontline all do better jobs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bond Ever","review":"This game rocks! You are Bond and you have to fight villains. At times the game can be predictable (i.e., what Kiko does), and it contains some innuendo (i.e., Zoe adjusts her hair after leaving a dark room w/ Bond), but it is great & the multiplayer is sweet. My only complaints are a) not enough levels, b)Goldfinger ... in multiplayer. Other than that, 007 is back on top!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on the 5 star reviewers","review":"Shame on everyone who gave Nightfire 5 stars. This game has the feel of the playstation one. The gameplay is identical to Medal of Honor (Frontline), which was released some 1 to 2 years ago. There are no fantastic graphics. I bought into all the hype the reviewers were giving. This does NOT contain the quality that Halo, Ghost Recon, or Splinter Cell type games have. I almost feel that they should give Nightfire away free as door prizes at the cinemas.

This film starts off ok and then goes straight down hill. Road Kill takes place when a Truck rams into a car filled with four people and causes them to crash. They then go after the driver and Truck which has stopped not far from the crash only to find no driver inside. **SPOILERS** The Truck requires blood to run, playes hypnotic music causing them to leave the Highway and drive off road, has some Wolf Heads' Symbol they never explain, causes visions... Very disappointing and very lame. Waste of time and quite frankly this has been done several times before such as The Mangler. This series overall was to be as the 8 films to die for but comes up short. Way short. Pighunt was at least entertaining enough to watch if you want something a little different. **Check out \\"Grimm Love\\" and \\"Fragile\\" probably the best two films out of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Sucked!!!!","review":"Ok I know the characters in horror movies are suppose to have a certain amount stupidity, but these characters were unbelievably stupid.

Also the burial locations of important people from both sides are given with biographical information about them.Now, if you're not planning a trip to St. Louis, it's still good reading.

The scene with Jupiter and the ghosts is also pathetically staged and acted. The absolute best parts of the production are the several scenes in Wales with Imogen (Innogen). The background winter haze with bare trees is the only evocative backdrop that the set designers could manage. On the positive side are the performances of Helen Mirren as Imogen. the two lost brothers and the Roman consul. The key part of Imogen's husband Posthumus is dreadfully performed. The parts of the king Cymbeline, Iachimo and to some extent Cloten are not effectively managed either despite the reputation of these actors. The rest sort of sleepwalk through the play.

The user guide is in 15 different languages as usual these days, but clear enough.The grill looks good, and works better. The wheels are durable plastic and so is the table. The rest is aluminum and is quite strong. The storage rack holds a 10lb bag of charcoal, the chimney lighter, a bag of wood chips and a few other odds and ends. The hooks in front are nice for the utensils.The last Weber I had wasn't this nice, so I am grateful for the extra attention that was put into this grill such as the vent on the lid has a handle that doesn't get too hot and the handles at the bottom for the bottom vents, plus the workspace and bottom rack for storage.If you like to charcoal grill or want to get back to it, this is the grill to start with. You will be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's easy to use!","review":"I am a novice griller, but this Weber grill is great! I admit, I do need some help in controlling flame/heat, but it is fairly easy with this grill. I do admit, that even though clean up is fairly easy, when sweeping the ashes from the grill into the catch pan, not all of the ashes make it into the pan. The one-touch system doesn't allow a thorough \\"clean sweep\\" of the area, so, you're left with remnants of ashes that have to be pushed close to the holes so that the one-touch system finally can sweep them away.

You cant even see where you are hitting your ball when lining up to hit because of the blurriness of objects.

For most of the year I was wondering why there wasn't much in the way of golf. Then I saw TW PGA 2003. I rented the game and was immediately hooked.Perhaps the best feature of the game in the analog swing. Gone is the silly scale where you push a button in a feeble attempt to hit the perfect shot. The swing is natural and the wide range of adjustability allows countless shots from anywhere on the course. The Tiger Challenge mode was riveting. Where else are you able to go head to head with great golfers until you think you have the skills to beat Super Tiger on his dream 18.

The gameplay is phenomenal and the course selection is a blast. I love the 3 newly designed courses. My only beef with this game is that it is way too easy. After completing the Tiger Challenge, the tournaments are breeze and you will be shooting in the 50s almost every round. Sure you can turn off the automatic spin and the power drives, but this game should not permit someone to drive the ball 400 yards and be on every par 4 green in 1 shot. Despite the fact that this game is easy, it only got that way after several hours of gameplay. It was well worth the effort and the [money]. EA Sports did an excellent job with this title and I look forward to next year's version. I would love to see additional courses and a little harder Tiger Challenge.

Overall I liked the film better. I've read that Clive Owen is one to pare his lines, and doing this in the film improved Larry, making him more sympathetic. The script does, however, have details that I wish had been included in the film. I thought Julia Roberts was outstanding as Anna, but Anna's character in the play seems more fleshed out, and I loved it that she and Larry divorced and she got a dog to love! Alice/Jane's film character, as played by Natalie Portman, was riveting, but I wish they'd included the stuff about her scar in the film. I just didn't like Dan's character in either version, but I have to say that I thought Jude Law was brilliant in the part of Dan, and a perfect antagonist to Clive Owen's Larry."},{"rating":"1","title":"artistic license?","review":"Though I found the illustrations to be beautifully rendered I had to questions why the boy who clearly and beautifully resembles John Denver's son in the book, why does the father look nothing like John Denver? Did the illustrator/artist think it was beyond the grasp of the children of this generation to grasp a white father to have created such a beautiful brown skin boy with an afro? There is a tiny pic of them in the back of the book. I guess he figured they wouldn't read that far, or put 2 and 2 together.

The soap woudld not come out when you pushed the button. You had to push it 20 times to get any tiny micro amount of soap to come out at all. So it was more work to use it than to just do it the old fashioned way. Finally we just cut the dispensing part open wider but then all the soap poured out. It was also a major hassle to refill. The hole is so tiny you cant get the soap in. IT DOES NOT WORK.

Other than that, the product is exactly what we were looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Quality","review":"I bought this game as a gift for my 8 year old son. The \\"old-fashioned\\" concept seemed like a great idea. Within 1 day he was disappointed and crying. Among a variety of minor problems, the largest problem was the poor quality of the plunger and especially the bat mechanism. Trust me, it doesn't hold up. The batting mechanism is held together by cheap wood that isn't sturdy and the few metal parts are thin and also cheap. The tiny screw holding the bat firm constantly comes loose and then it strips after 1 or 2 tightenings. Most of the items are glued, making it nearly impossible to even access most of the items. I suggest staying away."},{"rating":"1","title":"spend the extra $$$","review":"Yes for $13 dollars you really cant complain about quality, but if you're looking for a sub that's going to put out some deep bass these are not for you!

With the diversity of the music i listen too, both of them work great. I can listen to anything from rap to rock, country to classical and they sound great. And like i said, its only running 400 watts. Ive pulled up next to people at stoplights and they thought that sound was coming from 2 12's. Just the same, i am very impressed with it, and as long as your not looking to compete, this is great for someone to just throw in their car for a little extra bump."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I bought two of these.

There's nothing inspiring about this book.It gets the technicals right, talking about the relationships between vampires and ghouls, talking about ghouled animals and a slightly interesting note, Mandragora (ghouled plants).There's a chapter with expanded rules for making a ghoul character then what's found in the book.The book just isn't compelling or that great."},{"rating":"2","title":"the devil is in the details","review":"I love this book and can't believe the bad reviews it has received here. This is a modern gothic/dark romance, and perhaps not for everyone. If you like Barbara Michaels modern gothics, or Mary Stewart's Thornyhold, you'll like this. MZB builds on her knowledge of San Francisco, and puts a wealth of detail into the book, that makes you see and hear and feel the setting with the characters. I could totally relate to the main character, on her own, buying a house with a questionable history, and struggling to deal with a supernatural world thrust upon her unwanted. This is a book to curl up and relax with, and feel a little chilled at reading. MZB also considered this book at least equal to anything she'd written. It is also part of a series that begins, I believe, with Dark Satanic, and has several novels after it, but this stands well on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"It was difficult for me to believe that MZB had really written this book. I found it slow and full of irrelevant details. I also did not care about any of the characters. I managed to finish it, but only because I have loved some of her other work and kept hoping she could save this one. Alas, I felt very disappointed when I finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have been a long time admirer of the Mists of Avalon, so when I came across this novel in a used bookstore, I was anxious to give it a try. What a HUGE disappointment!! The characters were so unbelievable and the dialog cringe-worthy. What teenager do you know sounds like Scarlet O'Hara? \\"Why, there's an herb garden in the backyard! Why, it's lovely!\\" **rolls eyes**. Like other reviewers I found the characters unlikeable as well. Too bad, I really wanted to like this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Hated it. Zimmer's style, so wonderful in \\"Mists of Avalon\\" does not translate to the modern world at all. The story was weak, and there wasn't one character I liked. Emily, in particular, I wanted to throttle. She was an eighteen-year-old who acted like a six-year-old, did nothing but whine, sulk and eat. I kept scribbling disgusted comments in the margins. But to be fair, I did finish the book. And if the characters drove me to respond, I guess that says something..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending makes this book a HUGE disappointment.","review":"MZB does it again, making us accept a poor plot because of her beautiful prose (i.e., the Forest House) which is unusual considering her enormous talent (i.e., Mists, Darkover). But even with the quality of her description and storytelling, the ending betrays the readers. When I struggled to the last page, I was so disgusted that I threw the book across the room. This book is a huge disappointment, don't pay full-price for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck. Psychotherapist Buys Haunted House + Evil Boyfriend.","review":"This story was boring and not even written believably, with boring characters and only a vague description of its interesting setting, Haight St in San Francisco. The main crux of the whole matter is that something terrible happened in this bargain of a house the psychotherapist main character buys. And surprise, surprise, it's devil worship--perpetrated by her inexplicably irresistable new boyfriend who is also her younger sister's mentor."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I bought this because the Mists of Avalon was so well written and plotted.

Mostly, they're not very good; mine has been buried in my \\"useless gadgets\\" bin for years. I doubt this one is any better.But I am puzzled that the owners of D50 and D70 cameras would expect to be able to adjust the aperture of such a lens. THERE IS NO APERTURE DIAPHRAGM on a mirror lens. It is always wide open. There's little point to complaining about something that is inherent in the lens type; if you can't accept it, don't buy it. I'm surprised that the owners didn't complain that their meters didn't work, since the lens is not advertised as an autofocus unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy, Great Lens","review":"Crazy. I purchased this lens along with the .22X Fisheye. The price was unbelievably affordable. However, I not so many days before purchased a new Nikon D40 with the standard 18mm-55mm and the 55mm-300mm Zoom Nikkor Lenses and immediately fell in love with the camera kit so I wanted to \\"dress it up\\" a bit. I was originally searching for a set of UV filters when I happened across the this set of lenses. The price grabbed me. I knew the cost of the 500mm lens alone would set me back twice the price of what I paid for the camera kit itself. So I took a chance and leaped at gut instinct. I am not disappointed. I've taken some great pictures and plan to take more. I'm a novice photographer and plan to have this camera set up for a long time. But in the event my heart turns towards another digital camera I plan to include this lens and 47th Street Photo in the package. For Beginner, Novice and Amateur photographers this is a good buy and a great lens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good with Nikon D70","review":"Shipping was slow on this item, but it arrived in good condition. I agree with the reviewer with the D50. This lens is very delicate to focus. It's very light weight and feels like you could damage it with the slightest bump. I'm guessing the quality control may not be great. This lens uses a mirror and there was a piece of the black plastic sticking out onto the surface of the mirror. And, also like the D50, my D70 can't adjust the aperture with this lens on, only shutter speed. I'm sending it back tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"foggy pictures","review":"I own a Nikon FM10 and bought this as a special offer. Wrong choice. Difficult to focus, with foggy pictures at the end. Simply a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful!!!!! I Have a Nikon D-50","review":"I recieved this lens in new and good condition. I can not get this lens to focus clearly on my Nikon D-50. Also, the focus adjustment is very sensitive and difficult to use without a tripod. Therefore I don't think sporting events would be appropriate for this lens. Even on infinity beyond the minium focusing distance the image is not clear. I may have recieved a lemon. But it is very cheap indeed. I can't adjust my camera, apperature, with this lens on, even in manual, just the exposure time. The downloaded picture with the picture info says F0 at 0-mm. I will work on the problem and see if it can be resolved. I am new to the Digital camera SLR but not to photography. On the other hand this lens has a lot of potential if you can get it to focus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works","review":"Makes it fairly easy to wash your blinds.

Well I recently picked up the final six volumes in this collection (vols 37-42) and I have to say they are as delightful as the first 36 sets. Volume 37 features Ancerl and the Czech PO performing Jiri Pauer's Concerto for Bassoon & Orchestra (1949), and Isa Krejci's Serenade for Orchestra (1948-50) and Symphony No. 2 (1956-7). The recordings were made in 1956, 1957 and 1963 respectively, with only Krejci's 2nd Symphony in stereo. Ancerl was best known for the music of his native country and for showcasing the works of 20th Century composers, so it is only natural that he championed the modern Czech music presented here. All three pieces prove a challenging listen, but they are thoroughly enjoyable. In all, this title is part of a fitting to conclusion to a great series and a great conductor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome,chalenging, addictive game","review":"Really fun game if you can get past the car driving levels and the third block-pushing level.

This is a MUST HAVE game no matter who you are. I thought Halo for X-Box was the best 1st person shooting game out there for all the systems, but now it has met its match.

It had excellent controll and beatiful graphics and simple gameplay. Perfect. Unfortunatly, EA Games has bought the 007 license from Rareware. NightFire, the James Bond action adventure title, is not based on any movie so the developers could make up there own Bond story. This game has one of the most Oblivious story line. A man wants to destroy the world and Bond is sent to save the world once AGAIN. The game has Excellent graphics but the levels are boring and unathousiastic. Though the vehicle levels are fun, there are only 2 cars to choose from. You can also ride in a helicopter and a snowmobile. Classic Bond. This game is good for a rental for it is so short I was able to beat it in under 3 hours. Average game but EA STILL CANT BEAT GOLDENEYE. So my recomindation is RENT BEFORE YOU BUY THIS GAME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy, rent","review":"So, this game is really not that good. The graphics and sound are stunning, to say the least, but that is where the good news ends. The levels are laced with cut scenes, so you're not playing all that long. The enemy AI is obscenely lousy, even on the 00 Agent setting (example: on level 11, you walk into a room with a mechanical door that makes all sorts of noise, and the fellow at the control station keeps looking straight ahead.). I also found the controls to be some what cumbersome, making it difficult to shoot. Also, should you decide to get it, make sure you turn 'Auto Aim' off. The computer will point you directly at the midsection of the enemy, where they are conveniently most armored. All this said, it took me about 3 days to beat it on 00 Agent, and I don't believe I played for more than 2 hours in one day. The multiplayer is okay, in that you can team up with your friends or AI bots and play against another team of AI bots."},{"rating":"2","title":"this game was alsome","review":"This is the best 007 game yet.

It arrived about 3 weeks after I ordered it, and was nicely packaged. The price was reasonable. My only complaint was that it was not even shipped for over a week after my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Coffee","review":"This coffee is better than most of the K-Cup brands out there. I prefer the Coffee People Black Tiger Dark Roast more though. It has a bit more of a bolder flavor. Give them both a try. Either way you will find them both to be much stronger and richer than the other K-Cup coffee's out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth..but not so bold","review":"I love my K-Cup coffee maker and have tried many K-Cups. This is a good cup of coffee but not as bold as I like. It is very smooth and not at all bitter. If you like a \\"in your face\\" coffee this is NOT it. If you like smooth with a little punch give it a try. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry, bitter coffee","review":"Unfortunately, this coffee is strong, but not flavorful. It's OK (not great) if taken black, but once cream is added, it somehow makes the burnt, dry taste of this coffe even more pronounced. I am looking for a coffee that has a rich, nutty, full-bodied flavor even with milk. It's hard to get any flavor at all with K-cups because of the almost non-existant brewing time of the Keurig machine. Due to this problem, one has to buy very strong K-cup roasts to get any flavor at all. However, I am sure that there is a K-cup out there that is strong enough to come through the quick brewing process and taste rich and flavorful rather than just burnt-tasting and nothing else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mmmmmmm, good coffee.","review":"Now this is a cuppa coffee.

The last two k-cups tried, the seal broke during use and spewed coffee grounds. The cup of coffee was ruined, and the Keurig k-cup coffee maker required a thorough cleaning before its next use. We've been using our coffee maker for last 14 months, multiple times per day, with a variety of coffees. However, the problem as experienced, was limited to the Coffee People Extra-Bold organic. The cause of problem: the seal was not properly centered on the cup during manufacturing process, leaving a small gap that exposed the coffee grounds. I love this coffee's flavor and hope its manufacturer gets the container-seal problem fixed--for good! Next time, I will open the box of k-cups at the store to make sure there are no defects, as described. Or, if I've purchased them through Amazon.com, I will ask for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corn Brush","review":"Didnt work as I thought it would.

I have the ARs hooked up to an old Harman Kardon receiver which I have attached to a computer. In my opinion, they sound awful. They are bright, brittle, have NO bottom end (which is understandable given the size of the drivers) and are not musical in the least. I suspect I'll be happier replacing them with a $79 pair of computer speakers. The only reason I have not is because I don't have any place for the HK receiver and I could not in good conscience give 'em away.Strengths:Small size, cheap.Weaknesses:Sound awful.Similar Products Used:Mission bookshelf speakers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick Start Your Storytimes","review":"The 50 thematic programs in this manual are designed to charm two-year-olds.

Young T?rless is his first novel, as concise as it is memorable. Rather than a sprawling overview of the fall of the Austro-Hungarian empire, this chilling little novel focuses on the insecurities and corruptions of young man in a boarding school. Whether you take an interest in it for the metaphors of international power struggles (no coincidence that the \\"feminine,\\" exploited boy is Italian), the sadistically expressed homosexuality of these upper class kids, or the psychological study of adolescent angst at the turn of the 20th century, it's a compelling read. It was made into a film in 1966 by Volker Schl?ndorff, with music by Hans Werner Henze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Verbose","review":"Overall, I liked the story of the book, however, it took too long to tell the story. Perhaps, I wanted more of a salacious read, but the overly dramatic whining and pining, really struck me odd and annoyed me so much that I began feeling like I was reading, \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" instead of a book written by one who attended a military school.

It is enjoyable for adults as well as appropriate and fun for kids. My 8 yr old daughter enjoys it and is able to effectively use it.Your mission is to build a town, make friends who refer you to people they know that you can have move into your town. Town's people request things for you to add to their neighborhood and ask you to do them favors. (i.e. create a playground in the area, go shopping for them, and help them find their way home)The more organized you are in building your town the more effective your game will be.This game is great to help people learn organizational skills.Give it a try..... It is a fun yet easy SIMS like game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"I was so excited when I found out there was a game that involved building a city other than simcity, etc. I bought the game quickly and played it only to be so let down. The game really has nothing to do with building a city other than chalking out roads. The game is kind of unique because you have to manage city problems by inviting in new residents, etc. but overall you just walk around and talk to people over and over again. The game really wasn't my taste, and I ended up selling it very soon. The graphics, intrigue and lure of the game maybe more suited for children under 15, but older than 10 (in my opinion) I wouldn't really recommend this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I bought this movie right after renting it long time ago.

A bunch of acting school drop-outs plan to stop him.I am still looking to see a great indie film and although this isn't it, there are some good things about. The sound and film quality are very good for an indie project. Honestly, the downfall of all these no budget films it that they can't afford to hire quality actors or screenwriters.

She \`fleshes' them out in fantastic stories framed in fact.As in her previous exploration, The World of Fairiesshe offers a delightful insight into the phenomenon of Angels and draws interest from the Bible, the Quran, and the religions that they inspired. Buddhism, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Paganism too are shown to have their angelic features.I would highly recommend The World of Angels.It is well written, evocatively illustrated, wonderfully researched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Amp","review":"This amp works really well.

When these arrived in the mail, I opened them up to make my first pizza. Unfortunately, the pan wouldn't fit in my toaster oven. So I moved my pizza onto a piece of aluminum foil and I had a perfect pizza.The next time, I made 4 pizzas so I put them in my big oven. Unfortunately, the tortillas did not \\"cook\\" all the way through. I used store-bought tortillas so they were already pre-cooked, but I still liked to cook my tortillas to get rid of that residual raw dough flavor. These pans are nice and sturdy. However, that means that they are so thick that they don't allow the dough/tortilla to cook all the way through. I can only imagine the amount of raw dough you would have if you were to use real pizza dough. They should have drilled holes into the bottom to allow for even cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best yoga mat I've tried!!","review":"There's hardly any smell.

My mat had to be made of rubber rather than some plastic/vinyl product leaching who-knows-what chemicals into my sweat-soaked body. It also had to be extra padded for holding certain positions and cushioning my joints. Plus, the mat had to be sticky enough to allow for a very sweaty practice. This mat is check, check, and check for my wish list! Not to mention it is made in the U.S.A. and the rubber is biodegradable, unlike vinyl or plastic which sits in the landfill unchanged. I probably don't have to worry about recycling this mat for the rest of my life, as I have had this mat for two years and it shows NO signs of wear. It is still sticky and I never slip.

My only complaint (and it is a small one) would be that Corbeill makes no attempt to distinguish between humor, invective, the laughable, the ridiculous, and so on. The conflation of these terms is a weakness, because I think there is a genuine difference between humor and invective, the latter of which Corbeill discusses at length.

The mouse in game performance was similar between the icemat and a regular black mousepad. In my opinion the regular black mousepad was better. The usage of the icemat is uncomfortable because my wrist is in contact with it and I can't move the mouse as easily as there is lack of space.Second, I did not like how the black painted surface underneath peels off easily, when I took off the elevating stub supports that make the bottom surface not touch with the desk because it keeps wobbling when I use the pad with the elevating stubs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ice Mat","review":"Update 8-26-12Still going strong with no scratches.

I researched and decided on an Ice Mat though I was taken back at the price. But I figure I've saved money ending his mouse pad buying days. He was skeptical when he opened the box, asked if Amazon had a return policy! Minutes later he was deliriously happy. Still is, 2 years later. It's easy to clean, he hasn't scratched it yet.

A good action/adventure read with bizarre mutants and situations - this is what a long-time Deathlands reader loves, great job!! The adventure is fast and furious and I love when they don't always have those damn luxury places with baths and plenty of food - BAH! This is Deathlands and its bare-knuckles survival, and thats what this new writer gave us. Good work and keep it up and can't wait for the next one, I just ordered it today in fact.

Granted I did enjoy the technology that was involved, the Kite system mainly.However, Several things really bothered me about it. First and foremost the mutants. Evolution takes millions of years to create new species. How could an entire new species, these mutated friendly water beetles, appear as a stable race in less than 100 years? Again this is the Deathlands but things are starting to get a little silly.I understand that you are trying to go for a more Science fiction feel but... How about a little explination on how these things happen?My biggest complaint is that there was not even an attempt to explain how Silas got back from the past, where he had been trapped after Dark Emblem.Another, lesser complaint is that Ryan had indeed seen an Aircraft before.

They never seem to mention in the description if these CD's are mixed, this one is. Some of the mixing is a little off beat and the songs are not leveled the same, so when one song is mixed into another and the first song is turned off the song that is now playing sound lower and feels out of place. Also the songs sound bland and are not direct master transfers. If your a dj looking to build your collections with full lenght separate tracks, skip this cd (and the 2nd Vol as well).

The script sparkles with wise-cracking dialogue, and the action proceeds headlong in unpredictable directions. It is the sort of movie that the phrase \\"never a dull moment\\" was coined for. The two leads did full justice to their parts, but they lacked the star status to impress the critics. If Claudette Colbert and Cary Grant had been cast, or Jean Arthur and Jimmy Stewart, they could have performed no better, but this film would now be assured of its place in the annals of screwball comedy instead of being neglected and almost forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technical to read; in poor condition","review":"My rating has more to do with the condition of the book.

This one is as current as you can expect, and it approaches the field of science in a much better way than any other textbook I have seen. In particular, most earth system texts approach the field by morphing from a traditional discipline. Usually, it's a geology textbook revised to include atmospheric, oceanic, and climatic studies. But earth system science requires an interdisciplinary approach from the start, a problem based approach. Our global environmental problems need this approach, and this book covers them in a reasonably detailed and accurate manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced for the quality","review":"Nice costume, size is not adult small (more like 8 year old size).

If your a fan of the movie, or not, I would recomend buying it.Don't get me wrong, the clean up on the film is astounding, but thats all you get. The fun of DVD's for the most part is all the extra s@*t you get. More often than not, I enjoy watching those more than the movies themselfs. My theory is, that this company put out a generic release to see what the response would be, and maybe if its strong enough they might do a 'special edition' of the film.

For a movie released in the winter of 1986, it grossed 4500 dollars in its first week at the box office in the US, and grossed over 4.5 million in France. This movie made use of such high tech products as, the Digital Radio Blaster, and the flame retardant racing helmets, capable of allowing only your skin to burn yet saving your hair from a fiery death. I love movies that have a supernatural twist, yet I wonder why the spirits chose Chrysler as its provider for the ghostly super car? Also the car is powered by two vibrating lightning laden shoeboxes, strait from Chrysler's special engine division.

While some take pride in quality, others like Mike Marvin just peddle dribble to put their names on it and say they accomplished something. The brain numbing mellow dramatic acting was enough to convince me, that the schizophrenic next to me might actually be sane without medication. Now that I think of it, perhaps it was the medication I was missing to fully understand just how horiffic this film really was. I'm not sure if it was the \\"super natural Chrysler\\" car or the fact that people were blown up and burned but retained their hair, but this movie just flat out bombed hard. No wonder I saw this movie on at 2am. Enjoy this one with the schizo close to your heart and a big purple bag of medication.

The plot, albeit a very interesting one, is very minimal, and it gets real boring after getting know the characters for a few minutes. Then, the same pattern repeats until each of them is dead. Same goes for the scenes. It's just a cycle of races with a different character and a different car each time. The result is as predictable as it gets. And that's about it of the movie. Charlie Sheen is lucky to escape the film because he had the best character that was mysterious and intriguing who happened to have the best looking car. Sherilyn Fenn isn't so bad herself playing as Keri Johnson. Poor Randy Quaid, what is he doing in it?

I bought it two years ago (Oct. 2004) and have since had it replaced 6 times. I bought the Apple Care Protection Plan (one year extended warrenty for $60) so that I could continue to get replacements when mine would inevitably break. Most recently, I called Apple to find out about my once again broken Ipod, and they informed me that my warrenty had run out, and it would cost $230 to repair it, so I might as well go to the Apple store and buy a new one. To which I replied, \\"I will never buy another Apple product, because I have never had an item that held up as bad as this did.\\"This was one of the worst purchases that I have ever made. I DO NOT recommend buying and Ipod, I would instead recommend the Creative Zen MP3 player, which is much more reliable and MUCH better made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, unstable tecnology","review":"Its great to carry your music anywhere but this ipod software is a littlebit unstable and slow.

This update comes several years after this ipod died due to my own negligence (I accidentally dropped it). I loved my old 20gb ipod classic. Navigation, sound quality, user interface and features were all fantastic. I replaced it with a 5th generation/30gb ipod classic which was fantastic. That ipod is now almost 4 years old and it's getting wonky. So I just replaced it with a 6th gen/16 gb Nano.If I could change the star rating on this review I would have given it 5 stars.

On long walks, I get Creedance Clearwater or Paviorati to get me moving faster. Lotta Lenya and Marlena Dietrich - singing in both English and German and on and on - on buses, walking, and on back porch, smoking a cigar while listening Haley Westener or Billie Holiday.

To make a long story short, I got about 2 cds worth on it before turning it around and selling it. The fact that it holds 10000 (approx) songs on it is amazing, but the sound is awful. The high end is terrible, and the bass doesn't exsist, not to mention the volume control doesn't go up high enough (at top volume, I can still hear everything around me). I tried replacing the earbubs with something more highend, but no luck. The sound was still too low. If you're not an audiophile (like me), then Ipod might work for you, but I dont like my music to sound hollow and crappy. What a waste of $$$.

Whilst in San Francisco I popped into their apple shop and asked if it would work on a USB 1.1, as that is all my lowly laptop has. The man (of course it was a man - he looked at me in shock when I said the words \\"backwards compatible\\") said it would only work on a 2.0. Well I took the risk (it is such a beautiful machine) and low-and-behold, it works on USB 1.1. While it may not be as fast as USB 2.0, there is hope for all you Ipod fans who have yet to upgrade their USB ports.I am, however, very annoyed by the fact that Apple sales-people, who are meant to know the products, can tell people such rubbish.As for the Ipod itself, everyone else is pretty much on the mark - it is downright fantastic"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$!!!!!!!","review":"OK first off don't get me wrong, the ipod is an pretty neat piece of equipment.

No one I have talked to has been able to come close to the advertised 12 hour battery life but I have personally been able to get about 5-7. From some of the other reviews I have noticed something about compression of the mp3 file makes the difference. I will have to play around with that and see what happens. Nevertheless, 5-7 hours is still plenty of time for me between charges to get my listening done - still worth it to me.Having one for myself, I am planning on getting one for my father, and I'm sure this will by far be the best birthday present he has yet to receive.

You will be givin 5 songs to choose from, and in those 5-8 seconds you have to click on that song before the time runs out. Its a really cool game even if it sounds dumb in writing. The shuffle songs on the Ipod is great, its like having a radio in your pocket. The one thing is, if your giong to get an Ipod, GET A CASE BEFORE YOU BUY THE IPOD.

It is extremely overpriced for the quality it delivers. There are mp3 players that hold just as much and are of much better quality than an ipod and cost hundreds less. I've had my ipod for about a year and the battery drains over time. Fully charged, I get about 2 hours of music from my ipod before the batterys dead. No EQ or backlight on. It was about 12 hours of battery life when I first got it. AND APPLE IS CHARGING 59 DOLLARS TO GET THE BATTERY REPLACED!!!! Thats pure BS. Why should I pay nearly $60 dollars so they can fix their own mistake!!!! Mine also shuts off at random times, in the middle of songs for no reason. This isn't just my ipod, my friends ipods have been having alot of issues too. Buy a Creative Zen, it's cheaper, better quality and has alot more features. JUST BECAUSE IT HAS THE APPLE LOGO ON IT, IT DOSN'T MEAN THAT YOU HAVE TO SHELL OUT 300 DOLLARS FOR THIS!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very unreliable piece of electronics","review":"Sure, everybody loves these, myself included. But do your own research ... these are incredibly fragile, flaky devices. My daughter is on her second one in a couple of years. Her first model, a 4GB lime-green model, lasted one year and a half. Two months ago, she bought a 20GB model, and after two months, it is fried, dead, kaput. But talk about Teflon products! Nothing seems to be able to stop the momentum of the iPod.My advice: you better buy the extended warranty. The iPod is warranteed for one year, but, as I understand it, if it breaks after 6 months, you have to pay Apple a $29.95 shipping and handling fee to get it fixed.So, in effect, you've bought an extended service warranty by default it it breaks after 6 months, which seems rather fraudulent to me, since it is supposed to be under warranty for a full year. Very dishonest on Apple's part.\\"Caveat Emptor\\" ... the words never rang truer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best depending on what you want","review":"With this new update, Apple further cements the iPod's status as the best overall. Its battery life of 12 hours isn't the best, but I squeezed over 14 hours out of the battery many times and there are external battery packs on the market for the iPod. The interface is simple and I never needed to read the instruction manual to use the iPod. The click wheel is so intuitive, I don't even need to LOOK at my iPod (except when scrolling through my library).With this new price drop, I recommend ths iPod over the iPod mini. While the mini is smaller and lighter, $50 dollars more gets you 5 times the capacity.However, thte iPod isn't perfect. It's quite susceptible to crashes and there is an issues about potential audio defects, which you can learn more about at www.ipodlounge.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Warned!!!","review":"When my iPod was working I thought it was great.

I've put most of my CD collection on it--I haven't bought anything yet from iTunes. It's great to put it on Song Shuffle and transition from the Beastie Boys or the Dead Kennedys to Irving Berlin or George Gershwin. I'm listening to more music than ever, and my even more technophobic husband has been won over as well. We no longer lug CDs with us on trips, just plug in the iPod. If you don't feel like listening to a song, just skip to the next one. I don't even bother with play lists--with days worth of tunes on it (and it's not even close to filled), I love the constant surprise of hearing a song I don't expect.

If your ipod needs service (and trust me, it will) Apple will send you a refurbished unit and they won't even switch out the hard drive. So you'll be reloading all of your data back to the device.The battery in an ipod can only be replaced by Apple. After about a year, your battery will wear out. Send it in for a new battery, and you're gonna get a refurbished unit, and you'll loose all of your music.Also, they break easily. I have heard a lot of reports of broken LCD screens and problems with head phone jacks. These weren't broken by mistreatment, these machines are just not durable at all. They are not made to withstand every day use. For the price, consumers should expect a whole lot more.Do some research before you buy.

I'm told by the techs that it's the hard drive and cannot be fixed.Moral - if you have trouble, go ahead and try to reset /restore but do it quickly and if there's still any sign at all that the ipod is having problems send it back. It wastes precious time trying to do it yourself while under warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the apple care protection!","review":"I will say this, I loved my iPod, it WAS a great little device. When I purchased it I passed on the Apple care protection, figuring those are usually a waste of money. In this case it should be a requirement. Before making a purchase of an iPod, keep in mind what will happen if it fails after your warranty has expired. Apple will not repair it. You send them your old iPod and $255 + tax and they send you a used iPod with a 90 day warranty. So basically your best option is to throw the iPod away and buy a new one. So much for the legendary Apple support.If you still think the iPod is a good deal after adding the $60 Apple care protection plan, then by all means go for it because it is a great little player, but make sure you get that protection plan. My hard drive failed 2 weeks after the warranty expired and the best thing I can do with it now is let my son take it apart to see what's inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"the iPod isn't worth its price.

It claims to have \\"near cd quality\\", but there's no noticeable difference. It holds numbers notes and functions as a hard disk for storage. With all this and about a hundred cds, I've still only used up about a fifth of the room. As far as iTunes goes, its a great, HONEST way to buy music, only a dollar per song, and cds are usually only 10. I was a little worried about making several 1 dollar transactions on my credit card, but you can buy cards at electronics stores that make the whole process credit card free.

I don't know enough about global music yet to say whether or not they are \\"traditional\\" songs remixed with a dance beat, but they are enjoyable.What you have here is music with Arabic, Indian, African, and Latin influences. There are probably more, but I am not schooled enough in the subtle nuances to define them. I like everything on the album, but stand-outs are: Kese Kese, Clewe Mawele, and the Dilruba remixes. Dilruba is a Niyaz tune that has been remixed in a very smooth and danceable way. Ciew Mawele is a Issa Bagayogo track that has been given a downright hip and funky feel to it. If you haven't heard Issa - you need to.This is a really good introduction to global dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Spend my Money","review":"Based on what I saw about this book it seems the \\"editors?\\" \\"Authors?\\" of this children's book were hybridizing the engenious works of Issa for their own gain.Not that it was conscious but I was searching for a SERIOUS collection of the works of Issa.Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"The seller is a cheat and a lyer","review":"I purchased the product in the picture and the seller sent me two bottles with 15 pills each and I payed 35.99 for 30 friking pills what a cheat and then he wount even send me the real product i payed for.

I lost a good amount of weight on the original in years past, but this version doesn't work at all. When I returned product and ask for refund, had to go through Amazon to get it since vendor did not respond.Note sent to me that photos #2 and 3 show the product without the gel (I never noticed there was more than one photo) - and the Johnson product (which doesn't work). Shouldn't photo #1 be a photo of the actual product you are ordering???SCAM - Bait and Switch....classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mad Dog and Glory","review":"If this movie did not have Robert DeNiro and Bill Murray in it, you probably wouldn't finish watching it. It's hard to understand how someone would have read the script or seen the rough cut and said \\"people are going to come see this.\\" The plot is standard-issue \\"man falls in love with hooker with heart of gold and has to save her from the mafia\\" stuff. DeNiro's character is not really likeable and Murray's is overplayed a little, though still fun to watch. If you don't love either of these two actors, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting","review":"I am still waiting for my order which was already paid (as it appears on my VISA statement): 3 DVD (Mad Dog and Glory, Five Easy Pieces, Tully). I sent a claim to you earlier with no response. Would you please forward this letter to the people in charge? I am really worried. Maurice Elia"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yukk!","review":"I could not believe that a talent of the caliber of Robert De Niro could make a bad movie, but he's proved it can be done with this one. This thing is so bad it even makes Bill Murray look good, and that takes something on the order of a miracle.I am still a big De Niro film, but I am giving this one a pass over.De Niro Yes, Mad Dog No."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert De Niro Mr. Nice Guy???","review":"Offbeat to say the least in a film i regret seeing still to this day. De Niro plays a lonely police photographer who saves the life of a mobster(Bill Murray who\`s charcter is funny and stupid at the same time)decides to reward his bravery by giving him his girl for a week. But De Niro falls in love with the girl and refuses to let her go thus making the Gangster an unhappy man. Once again de niro tries hard to shake off his gangster image by switching personnas it failed as did the film at the box office. But Uma Thurman is one attractive woman who woulden\`t want to fight over her? Her acting talent isn\`t much put to good use here and has come a long way since doing this film that didn\`t do much for her career at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movies","review":"What is there to say. I do like the ensemble cast in Mad Dog. Plus the comedicpart with David Caruso in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Known Gem","review":"I found MAD DOG & GLORY completely by accident. I didn't even know it existed and, judging from the little written about it on this page, not many people do. However, a bored look into DeNiro's filmography got me interested in watching this.I wasn't disappointed. DeNiro plays a quiet cop (ironically nicknamed Mad Dog) who saves a small-time gangster (played with zest by Bill Murray) during a holdup. As thanks, Murray \\"lends\\" one of his bar girls to DeNiro for a week. However, DeNiro's character falls in love with the girl (Glory, played by Uma Therman) and refuses to let he go back to Murray.That's the premise. It seems like a basic love story, but the complexity of MAD DOG & GLORY lies in its characters and dialogue. Scenes that would otherwise drag with tedium are injected with a strong script and characters that are well crafted."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I ever read about software development - bar none!","review":"Developers should read this, especially seniors and this aspiring to management, in order to understand their current projects, help their leads and prepare for management.Existing team leaders should read this and ensure that they are doing exactly what the book says.Project managers should read this, to understand the development process better, as should upper management.The distilled wisdom of many projects tinged with common sense and clearly presented - I am going to buy every book the author has ever written.Must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome record from my favorite deejay","review":"I was an avid listener of Meredith Ochs' radio show on WFMU until I moved out of the New York area, so I got this CD to hear what she's been up to. Very nice work. Trouble Creek is a little country, a little blues and a lot of rock 'n' roll. Meredith was my favorite deejay because she told edgy and entertaining stories on the air, and her lyrics are the same way -- there's a lot of mystery in them, but they are still accessible. I love her sweet voice, and the band provides excellent accompaniment."},{"rating":"2","title":"great roots-rock from Hoboken","review":"I first heard The Damn Lovelys on the CCR tribute album Chooglin'. Their version of \\"Hey Tonight\\" sounds a little dreamy yet rockin' with a bit of a Blondie thing going on. So I bought Trouble Creek, it is fantastic. The singer has a strong voice that reminds me of Kirsty MacColl but with even more emotional range. The band is damn tight, dishing out catchy hooks with plenty of slide guitar that brings to mind The Allman Brothers. Overall, the album sounds a lot like a Sheryl Crow album yet the lyrics have much more depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discovered them on Mountain Stage","review":"If you're looking for something beyond the usual alt-country fare, this disc is for you. I bought Trouble Creek after hearing the band play on Mountain Stage, a radio and tv show where I find out about a lot of new artists. The disc, though, exceeded my expectations. The Damn Lovelys have a strong pop influence that sets them apart from all the same-y sounding roots rockers out there -- they really know how to write a melody.You can hear the Dream Syndicate and Tom Petty in their hooks and jangle, and the Bangles, Cowboy Junkies and even a young Lucinda Williams in the vocals. Frontwoman Meredith Ochs has the same sweet quality as new singers like Rachel Yamagata and Jem, but her songs have more resonance. This CD has been in my disc changer for a month now and I don't plan on taking it out any time soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent concert from an excellent singer","review":"This is an earlier concert than the 2006 \\"Concerto em Lisboa\\" and Mariza'a growth as a singer is evident. Which is not to say that this concert isn't excellent, just that her voice has gotten even better. This DVD has introductions to the songs in Mariza's charmingly-accented English, which are somewhat helpful if you don't understand any Portuguese. And it does have a wonderful, playful version of \\"Ha festa na Mouraria\\", which in my opinion is better than the version on her CD because of the difference in the Portuguese guitar accompaniment. All in all, this is an excellent DVD, another well-crafted work from an amazingly talented young woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy Favorite From a Teen In The 80's","review":"Unless you were a teen in the 80's and a fan of 1984, you may not like this flick. It catered directly to us, and perfectly so. I remember reading the book, then seeing Dead End Drive In and thinking Yes! Now I understand!Of course, after watching this movie as an adult, I now look back and think, WOW we had no sense of style in the 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable fantasy flick from down under","review":"Dead End Drive In is an interesting film from genre filmmaker Brian Trenchard-Smith. It takes place in the not so near future. Unemployment and crime is rampant so the government decides to do something about the unruly population. Crabs, a runty delivery driver get's caught up the madness by being cheap when he's on a date with his runaway girlfriend. Sleaze and violence follows. Remember, it doesn't pay to be be cheap!Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trippy","review":"Those Aussie's can do 80's as well as the next guy and they prove it in this one. It don't really come off the total end of the world, but there is some breakdown of acceptable behavior, and some Car fun, stunts and the like."},{"rating":"2","title":"very satisfied","review":"received item promptly; it was very easy to install and looks good. the price was lower than other places I shopped for products that did not look as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Agent","review":"This game includes many possibilities, and is over the top fun. New guns, and new weapons. The Missions are action-packed and very entertaining. New enemies! Here are some tips:*When playing Capture the Flag, (if two players are playing) Have a person to get the flag, and a person to guard your own.*When just playing Nightfire Arena, set booby traps such as using a tribomb and locate it down where the feet of a person would be.*Do not use Heatseeker alot, because this will usually not work the best.*Use Sentinal gun,(a big dark green one).(These guns are in explosives 1)I hope these tips were heplful to you.

Well it does have some strong points like the amazing graphics,but the controls are sooooo sluggish. For example when your running and you turn it will take you ages to finally face the right direction. You'll find yourself dead in about 4 shots and they changed the aiming system, the result isn't to great.I mean is it possible that EA will ever make a good bond game??"},{"rating":"2","title":"gift for son","review":"This was a gift for my son who LOVES this game.

The worlds in multiplayer are fun and cool. THIS GAME ROCKS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"007 Nightfire.... When I bought Nightfire I thought WOW! this game is going to be a blast! I beat the game on operative the day I got it. I thought to myself okay, minor setback, I'll try 00 agent. Beat it the next day. I think this game deserves a one star. I have to admit, it has good graphics, but the A.I. is laughable, and the game has very low replayability. Get a good game like GOLDENEYE 007 or Halo. Those rock! I mean come on guys, a Mexican guy takes over a space station that has 8 nukes! What? Why does Bond go? Just blast the stupid thing. Another thing, the MP5K is only in burst! It is supposed to be full auto. When you shoot the bad guys its just like shooting concrete. No blood either. Don't buy Nightfire!

I love the new guns and gadgets. I reccomend this game for any fan of Bond or shooting games. The graphics are awesome, the fun factor is great, the cars are cool, and the different types of play are fun. All the levels are not just first person shooters. Multiplayer is the funnest compared to other shooters, but they need more unlocked characters in M-16 team. Other than that, it is a fun game.4 1/2 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nightfire rocks","review":"From the cool cinematics with Bond girls and bad puns, to the awesome driving with the V12 Vanquish, this game just rocks. You get to use a whole bunch of guns and gadgets from the movies, just like you would expect from a great Bond game. Though it's not based on a particular movie it feels like it; one scene where you drive on ice reminds me of a scene in the latest Bond movie, Die Another Day. The single player is the best of any first-person shooter of I've ever played. The multiplayer is nonstop fun when you have some friends over.Gamplay: 5/5 - Great funGraphics: 4/5 - You might see someone inside a wall or maybe some jagged edges, but very goodSound: 5/5 - The Bond theme never gets oldReplay Value: 5/5 - This game is on the TV screen everyday in our householdMay be not as good as Goldeneye, but it's a close second. This is a must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better than Goldeneye","review":"Nightfire is definetely the best Bond game yet, definetely outstripping Agent Under Fire.There is a superb crew of new charachters who all have a part in the game's continuity. Unfortunately, oneof the Bond babes got blown up by a rocket launcher in Agent Under Fire.All new weapons, including a rocket launcher that you can guide yourself. But when I beat the game and got the gold PPK (Called a PP7 in the games) it put me off when I replayed the game because it's so shiny.The plot is simple, after rescuing a french intelligence agent, Bond infiltrates the villain's Austrian castle and rendezvous with the deep cover agent, the French agent Dominique. THis is when dead Agent Under Fire charachter Zoe Nightshade comes in,and you proceed through the missions, getting double-crossed, heatbroken, but that's resolved when you meet AUSSIE chick Alura McCall.A definite must for Bond fans, but if you just want a nice shoot 'em up a lot mission game, try Red Faction II."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nightfire game appropriateness","review":"I think this is a great game. A friend asked me what age this game is appropriate for. I would say ages 11 and above.This game has great graphics and relatively no gore.I would definately get it for a middle-schooler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best James Bond game I've ever seen","review":"This game is so much better than the last one (Agent Under Fire). The graphics were sweet and smooth. I played the first player for about 5 months, then it got a little repetitive, but the multiplayer never lost it's fun. I kept coming back for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I think this game ia great! I got it for Christmas and I still think it's an awesome game. I like the special multiplayer features like the helicopters and tanks. I also enjoy the characters from all the classic Bond films. it's pretty cool that they have Pierce Brosnan's voice into the game. This is definitly th best Bond game Ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST 007 game yet","review":"At the store i had a choice between nightfire or Agent Under Fire. Agent under fire was ...less that Night fire so i was going to purchase Agent under fire for that reason. But then i checked the back of the two games and found out that by getting night fire you are getting your moneys worth. so i would recommend Night fire"},{"rating":"2","title":"BeSt BoNd EvEr MaDe","review":"Let's face it this is the best game so far for gamecube. Bond really does look how he does in the movies. The graphics are supereb. This game is a must for the Bond fans. Even if you are not a Bond fan you will still love this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe Better Than GoldenEye","review":"I bought this game without previously renting it, which I was a little skeptical about, but after only playing one mission, I was convinced that I had made the right decision. The play control is great, and the variety is amazing. There are three types of missions, shooting, driving, and \\"rail\\" missions where you move on a track. Also, the mission variety is great because each mission is long, involved, and very fun. Your gadgets always come in very handy, and the weapons are very cool, and very fun to experiment with. The multiplayer mode is amazing too. The sheer number of scenarios, including GoldenEye Strike, is mind-blowing, and you can play as characters such as Jaws, oddjob, Goldfinger, Xenia, and Wai Lin, as well as many others from almost every Bond movie. If you like First Person Shooter games, this is a must for your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor game","review":"This game has horrible graphics.

It has only one character to be so rent it if you like but don't buy it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This game was the BOMB!!!!","review":"James Bond: Nightfire has GOT to be the best James Bond game yet! With new weapons, and new gadgets, 007 will surely get the job done. with old friends like Nightshade, and new enemies too.

Thats IMPOSSIBLE!As I said in my Agent Under Fire Review Agent Under Fire is better then Nightfire see ya!"},{"rating":"2","title":"yay!","review":"This is deffinatly the best Bond game out there right now. The missions r long and they r alot of fun. The guns r sweet. And the multiplayer is fun 2. And its sweet because u can have up to 12 albots in 1 multiplayer game and still have 4 players. I still wish they would make these bond games longer though. Otherwise this is the best Bond game they have made yet! (that is until Everything or nothing comes out)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Easy","review":"I bought this game after christmas of the year 2002, and it wasn't worth it in any way. The levles were too easy, the controlles were terrible. The only good thing was the Multyplayer. If you want a good first person shooter i say go for Time Splitters 2.

There is nothing in it worth making the switch from Quark. I bought a copy, but only in order to open files from the people who skimped and bought this rather than Quark.

The writer doesn't seem to have tried very hard to learn the program. A) ID does support bold and italic for fonts that have the style -- that's what \\"character styles\\" are for. Those who prefer \\"fake fonts\\" shouldn't be using a high-end typesetting program. B) Image resizing is done by percentages (context menu in Windows, not sure about Mac). It takes a bit of math, but it allows you to size images _precisely_. C) If you insist on using EPS output, the \\"Package\\" command sends all the linked files to CD, but PDF is a better option most of the time. D) Who leaves all the palettes turned on?

Quite simply, the jokes are not funny. It's not even jokes, exactly. It's just still mannequins saying crazy stuff. The only line I can actually remember is the Mother standing there, waterring the garden, while the kid was hit with the water hose.

Designed to fit the pocket of a pair of hemp jeans, the hemp manifesto lists 101 ways that hemp is making a positive impact on society. Icluded are all the fascinating facts about the plant--how the Declaration of Independence was written on hemp paper, how the U.S. government grows marijuana and supplies it to eight people free of charge; how hemp seeds are the most compete source of protein and essential fatty acids nown in the vegtable kingdom; and many more. The Hemp Manifesto gives people the most important weapon in the fight for a healthy future: the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"found it enlightening","review":"This book opened my eyes to a lot of the uses for hemp that I did not know about. The title is a bit misleading, though. Some of the supposed 101 ways hemp can save the world are not really that, but actually tidbits of interesting trivia about the foolishness of the war on drugs. One of the entries talks about how the Reagan administration sprayed some chemical on a section of forest because there was hemp growing there. I wouldn't really consider that as one of the ways hemp can save the world. Entry #101 doesn't even say anything, it just says \\"You tell us. Have you thought of another way that Hemp can save the world?\\" So actually a more accurate sub-title would be \\"90 ways that Hemp can save the world\\". But it's a good book to have nonetheless.

How wrong I was...Halfway through the book I had no idea where the plot (or lack thereof) was going, the characters were flat and unreal, the prose was boring, and there was almost no mention of anything fantasy-related other than the story of the ghost girl, and that was just an old story told among the dorm tenants...Tithe and War of the Oaks were infinitely better retellings of Tam Lin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tam Lin","review":"This book is so boring. I don't think it could be considered as a fairy tale. There is not much fairy tale in there. Too much literature reference makes the book so dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one who just didn't like it?","review":"I have no disagreement with this book on the grounds that it doesn't do justice to the original ballad, which, after all, I wasn't especially familiar with until after I read the Dean version. But am I the only person who finds the characters cold and difficult to really believe in? I was hoping that this book would sweep me into fantasy right away, and when it didn't, I tried to become engrossed in the lives of these college students in the seventies. But I just couldn't do it. They just aren't believable enough to be interesting and aren't fantastic enough to grab your attention until the very end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"I wouldn't even give this book one star, but the guidelines won't let me keep the rating slot blank.Yes, the writing is good and the characters realistic, in a sense, but ultimately I found the whole exercise tiring.The entire novel seems to be one long list of references and allusions to poetry, novels, plays, etc. While I almost always enjoy it when an author alludes to other works, it seemed to me here that in Pamela Dean's case, she was just being facetious, showing off, flaunting her lofty high-minded literary knowledge. Like she's alluding for allusion's sake. Yuck, yuck, yuck.Also, none of the characters in the novel seemed truly... well, NICE. They weren't mean, but they weren't wise; they were somehow very irritating to me.I don't know. I think the novel has a certain style and type of characters that many will find easily entertaining, realistic, insightful, and wise. Myself, I couldn't stomach it."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious and long-winded","review":"I actually have read this book 3 times: once before entering university, once during, and once after leaving. Perhaps my experience as a 1990s student at an engineering school spoiled this book, or the fact that the characters in the book reminded me of the people that most grated on me in high school: theater people. Also I happen to live in the Northfield MN area-at least she got the Carleton student ethos right. :o("},{"rating":"2","title":"Questions to be answered","review":"Basically I agree with everyone else who's given it 5 stars. It is an alltime favourite of both me and my sister. Its intricacy and magic is enchanting, and the literary refernces are great fun to follow up. I was wondering though if any of you other fans could help me with some difficult questions. 1.The Keats thing - was he a tiend to Hell? I've never been able to figure it out. 2.Peg - what's her connection with Margaret Roxburgh and Victoria Thompson? - what's her connection with the rest of the Classics department? Is she one of them or not? 3.What are the meanings of the Melinda Wolfe things? 4. Do Victoria Thompson and Margaret Roxburgh save their lovers before killing themselves? I have half formed theories on all these questions, but it'd be good to have them confirmed. Email me if you're interested in discussing it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best for its college setting","review":"This is one of the first real-world-setting fantasies I read. I was not familiar with the Tam Lin story at the time I read it. While I kept turning the pages, I thought it was just a tiny bit flat -- almost too pat, that is -- but what I enjoyed the most was the evocative flavor of the liberal arts college setting.Some of the drama majors/male characters seemed a bit \\"over the top\\", though, in my opinion. The Janet character seemed to come alive in a way the others didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read...","review":"Pamela Dean weaves together a beautiful narrative of college life and the mysterious ballad of Tam Lin, crafting a book that is full of infinite delight. If obscure English Literature references annoy you, this book is not for you. However, if you are instead intrigued by oblique Shakespearean references, as I am, then definitely READ this book! Pamela Dean contrives to build a wonderfully suspenseful and ethereal atmosphere, and sustains it throughout the book, immersing her readers in the mystery that is present in both folklore and college life."},{"rating":"1","title":"No stars. Can I actually give minus stars?","review":"This is the WORST bit of fantasy I've ever read. The characters are wooden. The diologue is painful. And even as you get more than half way through the book, NOTHING HAPPENS. Nothing. No really. I love Terry Windling but I am surprised at her putting her name on this rubbish."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting","review":"I enjoyed this book very much, but have a few problems with it. It is definitely worth reading, but not for love of the ballad. There are a few plot inconsistancies, but those are easy to ignore, and not too bad compared to some books. In order to read it and enjoy it, you must disgregard any expectations of a wonderful retelling of the ballad, and read the book only for it's own literary value, which is great. There were things that could have been better explored, but the book on the whole rose above that. It was also inspirational to me to pursue my life-long love of English (which I just mangled horribly). Much as I love the book, I must say it was not the almost religious experience I had hoped for, and I find that Tam Lin still lacks a retelling to do it true justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent adaptation of the Tam Lin legend","review":"I was first intrigued by the Tam Lin legend after reading the Jane Yolen picture book of the same title. I found this book, part of-and perhaps the best of- Terri Windling's Fairy Tale series, at the local bookstore and bought it, took it home, and read it in a weekend. I couldn't put it down. I've read it a number of times since.The plot itself works the Tam Lin legend (included in ballad form in the book)into the like of a young woman attending a small midwestern liberal arts college. Janet enters school as an English major(I was an English major in college) where she finds friends in her roomates and romance in a bumpy relationship with a Classics major.For anyone who loves literature, this book also has an added appeal, Pamela Dean recommends many, many books, plays, and poems through the character of Janet. Some were books I'd already read, others I've read since. I can't recommend this book enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable to the thelemite","review":"The Eye in the Triangle is subtitled, 'An Interpretation of Aleister Crowley' and Regardie explores the inner being on several levels; decomuntary, psychological and magically. he decoments Crowley's life and through his often complex writings decipher the inner meanings relating directly to psychology and magic to reveals Crowley's innner life and create a sincere portrait of a genius. regardie skilfully weaves the strands together to show how Crowley's thought emerged.

This book I found to be thoroughly enjoyable. It is basicaly the Plan of Life for these Hermits. It is a christian book. It speaks alot about the influence of the Desert Fathers on their plan of life. This is a book of Desert Spirituality. It discusses some basic and simple elements to the eremetical life.

He gets two things overwhelmingly right in this book. First, the problems he includes are \\"just right\\" - difficult enough to make you think and really understand the material, but not so hard that they become discouraging. Second, he shares a piece of himself and brings levity to what could be very dry subject matter and does it in a way that enhances learning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get past the juvenile humor","review":"I got this book to share with my children as a possible resource for learning to program.I couldn't get past the programming examples about wetting the bed, comments about dirty notes from his girlfriend, and lots of \\"dudes\\". I sent it back without using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to Simple and Short","review":"While looking for a book on entry level ruby programming I came across this. The reviews were good so I bought it. I was extremely disapointed however. First, the book is very small. There simply is not a lot of content here. I did like the type and text and layout.But the biggest problem and the one not mentioned anywhere is that this is not an entry level programming book. This is one step before that. It simply is \\"extremely\\" basic. What I mean by that is that is written for someone who probably has never even messed around with any programming language at all or has a lot of computer knowledge at all. It's like a junior high course to students who don't have a clue. This is great for some, but not mentioned anywhere and surely a disappointment and worthless to anyone who has even wrote a simple hello world program before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good beginners book","review":"This is a fine introduction to programming using the Ruby programming language. It also serves as a good introduction to Ruby for programmers, though the Pick axe book would be better for that. All the basics are covered, flow control, variables, classes are covered in some detail. The text is jovial and clear.This is a fun book that is easy to get through. If you have had trouble learning to program in the past you might like to try again with Ruby. It's a very friendly language and this book makes it even easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good intentions but not very pedagogical. Too confusing for beginners.","review":"This claims to be aimed towards absolute beginners.While I admire the intentions of this book, it fails to deliver since it is not at all pedagogical enough to be for absolute beginners.Having programmed some Assembler and Basic back in the Amiga-days, even I was just able to follow along halfway. Then, about in the middle of the book, it turns too complex and confusing too quickly.I found 'Beginning Ruby: From Novice to Professional' to be much easier to follow than this book.But still, credits to the author for good intentions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"The image was much smaller on the poster than I expected and it was difficult to find a frame to fit it."},{"rating":"2","title":"the original death metal band!","review":"in 1981 the template for death metal was formed,venom\`s debut album(that\`s what we called them back then)welcome to hell was released.this was something i\`ve never heard before,venom was a 1981 version of the sex pistols,couldn\`t really play their instruments that well,this was stated by the band themselves in many interviews,vocally and lyrically brutal,(both kinds)but visually amazing,i remember back in the day ,when video was just starting to ramp up venom always had visually the best video\`s(old schoolers will agree)but what venom created was a whole new world for music,every death band out there past and present owe this band for their pioneering efforts and creation of a style of music which lives today,black metal,the album, is the best offering of this iconic band,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Once this was pure evil!","review":"When I was young, Motorhead was the hardest thing around. Then came Venom! I bought \\"Black metal\\" on LP and in fact I liked a couple of tracks. Now (long after I sold all my LP's) I saw this album released on CD, and I decided buy it again, for old time sake...I must say that the metal genre surely has developed, or at least gone further we could imagine back in 1982. By today's standard Venom are no longer the heaviest or meanest guys... With hindsight we can clearly see that Venom weren't even that talented in the first place but the title track \\"Black metal\\" sure have something special.I guess you can buy this album for nostalgic reasons but if you're unfamiliar with Venom I guess you'll find it all rather ridiculous. The production isn't good, but for me who haven't heard this album in almost 15 years it was quite a pleasant experience. Maybe another 15 years will pass before I put this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable","review":"These guys stink and, guess what, they always did. I was around when they were in their 'pomp' and they were a laughing stock among most metal fans then.Anyone buying this hoping to hear proto-extreme metal will only find a group of hamfisted village idiots churning out puny, clich��d hard rock with comedy vocals, muddy production and playing that most teenagers could now better. Only their image got them any attention at the time. The music is seminal in the way dial-up is a seminal internet connection or a grain of sand is a seminal pearl.If you want seminal, stick to Celtic Frost, Bathory, Mercyful Fate, early Slayer.

No melody, no interesting lyrics, no anything. All of the song titles are practically the same, and the lyrics to each song are just flat out horrible, they're all sending the same message over and over only each time using two or three different words (satan, hell, black, metal, etc).Anyone who considers this \\"good\\" or \\"elite\\" music cannot possibly have the slightest good taste in music whatsoever.I myself like some hard rock and even some metal, but unless you like listening to pointless lyrics assisted with blairing guitars, i wouldn't reccommend buying this Venom album or any other Venom album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't expect an exact sim","review":"This isn't exactly a simulation of the sport, but that does not mean that it is not fun.

Even if there is some good production, there's little quality songwriting after this first track. Tracks 2 & 3 have good moments, but each have at least one overwhelmingly cheesy part that makes you not want to play it for your friends.

They are an average pop band at best. Song writing...ok...musicianship...ok.....production...ok......recording(squash,squash,DSP,DSP)....sucking the great green weenie. On every level lacking imagination, originality, and mind boggling production and adventurousness that marks the thrust of the 70's. I could go on and on. I'm starting to irritate myself though.

Worthwhile To Prog and Prog/Pop Fans","review":"This is a very impressive debut from a sort of prog-rock supergroup. The guitarist/singer and keyboardist are not very well-known, but they are very good musicians. Bassist P. Trewavas of Marillion and ex-Porcupine Tree drummer Chris Maitland don't need an introduction to most who will consider buying this album. What impressed me was that the songs were very melodic with some interesting vocal harmonies. The music and structure of the songs was just complicated enough to avoid the \\"Prog-lite\\" tag earned by Asia and others. However, the first Asia album or modern Marillion are probably the best touchstones to this music. All ten tracks are very listenable, and there is a good variety of song length and texture. This and the new Porcupine Tree CD \\"Deadwing\\" are two of the best albums I've purchased this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poppy Progressive ?","review":"Since the term \\"progressive\\" is getting thrown around so free and loose these days, let's invent a new category and call it \\"poppy progressive\\", then I'll have a label for my files and know where to put this in my cd collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"KINO-PICTURE","review":"ALL I CAN SAY IS HURRY UP AND RECORD ANOTHER CD !

The ex-porcupine tree drummer Chis Maitland rocks and John Beck is solid. Losers Day Parade is the type of song that amazes you with its complexity and amazing drive. Not really Prog but probably better. I hope they make it through more albums than Transatlantic and feel this is a stronger album then either Trans album..

They never seem to mention in the description if these CD's are mixed, this one is. Some of the mixing is a little off beat and the songs are not leveled the same, so when one song is mixed into another and the first song is turned off the song that is now playing sound lower and feels out of place. Also the songs sound bland and are not direct master transfers. If your a dj looking to build your collections with full lenght separate tracks, skip this cd (and the 1st Vol as well). If you just want a stroll down memory lane this CD might work for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"I am a huge fan of author James Patterson and this movie really depicted the images that I had in mind from reading the book by the same name. Tracy Pollan shines as Det. Lindsay Boxer and does a really great job. The movie itself is somewhat predictable to a certain degree but, in typical James Patters fashion, it is full of suspense and twists. This movie is based on the first book of the Women's Murder Club series and fantastic. (I wish they would make movies for the next 6 books that are currently in the series.) If you like mysteries, James Patterson, Tracy Pollan or any combination of these, you will like this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Patterson was probably shaking his head.......","review":"James patterson was probably shaking his head when he saw the final cut of this film let alone the script. Due to: First of all the main highlight of the Woman's Murder Club seires is that it takes place in San Francisco and in this movie you dont even know where this takes place, Secondly the script and the movie as it goes along it goes more and more off the content and story of the fantasic book that it is (like for instance one of the characters of the Womans Murder Club in this movie was invented by the script writers, they repalced one of the characters with a fictional one and the one that is in the club ,in the book, was in the movie but as a side character).

Lindsay Boxer, a cop with major problems of her own. This is a very good adaption, featuring a strong performance by Tracey Pollan as Lindsay in a twisty mystery. The only problem is the mis-casting of Robert Patrick as Nicholas Jenks.

Trust me, gardening is not as complicated as this book makes it sound!The Vegetable Gardener's Bible by Ed Smith is THE definitive title on the subject.Square Foot Gardening by Mel Bartholomew is good for small gardens. Four Season Harvest by Elliott Coleman is excellent for winter gardening. Tanya Denckla's Gardener's A-Z Guides are excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"at best an introduction","review":"I was very dissapointed in the length of this book. Compared to other organic gardening books, this should be listed as a brochure, or maybe as a synopsis of \\"How to Grow More Vegetables...\\" A buyer's money could be better spent. Personally, I would not buy it again. Figuring that it would cost me half of the cost of the book to return it to Amazon, I'll probably just give it away as a gift to a new gardener.

Bill Murray, Geena Davis and Randy Quaid play off each other perfectly. The storyline is chock-full of comedy and I wouldn't expect nothing less from the legendary Bill Murray. A funny movie with a lasting impression."},{"rating":"2","title":"The hands-down funniest movie you never heard of","review":"This is my favorite movie of all time, and I can't believe how many people have never even heard of it.

The only surprise I have is that it wasn't made in the 80's. I only laughed twice: the bus scene and the dark alley scene. The latter is a lot funny if you think back to A Streetcar Named Desire. I am sure there are plenty of more of references including Dog Day Afternoon for other certain moments. Otherwise, there isn't much happening. The plot doesn't make any sense. After planning the bank robbery, they have had the escape route thought out as well. All in all, Quick Change is a big miss for Bill Murray fans; the always reliable Randy Quaid is awful in this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Not Bill Murray's best, but still a collectible!

Not even mildly amusing, yet I got through it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"BILL AT ONE OF HIS BEST PERFORMANCES","review":"JUST TO FUUNY FOR WORDS, RIGHT UP THERE WITH \\"WHAT ABOUT BOB\\", AND AS ENTERTAINING AS DUDLEY MOORE IN \\"10\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"New York-Pre Giuliani Style","review":"This is a very interesting vehicle for Bill Murray. Broken in two parts it's first a heist picture and secondly an anti-Valentine to New York city. The bank job is cleverly scripted that will keep you guessing. The second half which maps Murray and his cohorts escape to JFK Airport contains some delicious brickbats against the Big Apple. Murray, unlike alot of his \\"SNL\\" co-horts, chose some challenging pictures and \\"Quick Change\\" is no exception. There's a hit or miss quality to the proceedings and it's brief running time, 88 minutes, makes it go down smooth like an ice cone on a sweltering summer day in the city. Not to be missed is a downright hysterical turn by a young Tony Shalhoub as a cabbie of indeterminate ethnic origin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, see it for yourself","review":"Without the mass appeal of \\"What about Bob?\\" or \\"Groundhog Day\\", this film is still very enjoyable and entertaining but perhaps is geared to the audience that is a bit more sophisticated than average. Not relying on silliness/slapstick or situation as it's engine, this movie starts out as if it is a serious \\"bank heist\\" action thriller and then quickly moves into the actual plot; three robbers lead by comedy superstar Murray have to \\"get out of Dodge\\".Murray remains the cream of the crop of early SNL stars going on to screen and while others like Chase and Aykroyd play entertaining characters, they don't have the range that Murray does and this film is an example of that. Being both convincingly serious and downright funny at the same time is not easy to pull off. The rest of the cast is great and this movie was both well written and acted, a definite strong recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud, bend over funny","review":"No doubt this is one of my top 5 favorite comedies.

They kept wandering around town after a bank heist and had stuff happen to them in different situations. This never changed for the better. It had potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little disappointing","review":"I don't know if it's because I bought this movie with expectations too great for a comedy released in early 90's. Or because I saw it after having seen all other great masterpieces of Bill Murray including Groundhog Day, What About Bob and The Man Who Knew Too Little. But this one was a little disappoining. In contrast to most the reviews you'll see here, I'll say it wasn't funny. The plot was way too predictable. There is however an element of suspence, which I guess I did not expect of a comedy. So, in a word, a great movie anyway for die-hard fans of Bill Murray. Yes, it should be noted he is still the good ole Bill Murray you'll see in any good comedy. Hope you enjoy it and can beat my impression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to disagree - but I thought it was awful","review":"Maltin's film book says this is very funny, and Bill Murraycan be very good, but I thought this was a waste of talentedpeople, with weak jokes and situations.

It's not for everyone,it is sarcastic humour and the movie is quirky and odd. A great supporting cast and since i have not seen it mentioned on here by anyone it features the late Phil Hartman in a spot with his wife who stumble across Bill,Genna and Quaid helping them selves to their clothes in their apartment. Tony Shaloub plays a taxi driver who can't get the robbers to the airport because he doesn't understand or speak a word of english. Gee i wonder if the people casting Wings saw this movie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Murray Classic","review":"Although not very well known, this remains one of Bill Murray's funniest & most original films. Feeling frustrated with his life and NYC in general, a city planner comes up with the perfect bank robbery scheme, with the help of his girlfriend and best friend. Getting away with the money ends up being the easiest part of their day. Everything imaginable that can go wrong, does as the three attempt to make it to the airport. Quaid is especially good as the dimbulb best friend, and Murray is dead-on perfect as the subdued brains behind the almost perfect crime. Murray also co-directed.Highly underrated, & more then worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right-wing garbage","review":"This is yet another example of right wing trash for cash.

Forget the myriad of other \\"gates\\", this is the mother of all scandals: treason by the President of the United States. To find out that Clinton and his minions are responsible for possibly endangering the very existence of this nation by allowing security secrets to be given and sold to communist China is beyond belief. If someone proposed this as a Hollywood script, he would be laughed out of town. But once again with this administration, truth is stranger than fiction.

Clinton exchanged high level military information and technology to our most dangerous (and anti-democratic) potential enemy (China) in return for campaign funds (obtained from drug and prostitution revenues).In my opinion, he surpasses Benedict Arnold as the greatest American traitor of all time. Strangely enough, both men transgressed because of personal ambition (Arnold was bitter at having been passed over for promotion); even more strangely, Arnold first contacted a Clinton (Henry, not Bill) to propose defection.Thomas Jefferson, the founder of the Democratic Party, must surely be whirling (not turning) in his grave when he sees what Bill, Al, Barney, Teddy et al have done to his party (and to America)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scared of the Yellow Peril","review":"This book is yet another example of how the right wing is letting their anti-Communist fervor get the best of them.

The beauty of this book is that it pieces together very gracefully the extent of the foreign-policy-for-sale (at firesale prices!) of the clinton administration and enables the public to view as a whole the extent of the sellout. we are going to be affected by this treason long after clinton has departed the scene. i hope this serves as a serious wakeup call to the unsuspecting american public that we're pretty vulnerable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"Finally. I commend these patriots for informing the public. Our politicians are not doing the job very well. I believe the facts presented and footnoted by their sources. A sensible person only has to look at the pictures. They are worth a thousand words. To even appoint Huang to a position in the Commerce Dept. is ridiculous. That position should be for people born in this country, not just a U.S. citizen who only obtained citizenship in 1977 and to give this person top secret clearance. Why?

Even yellow dog democrats(a democratic member that would vote for a yellow dog before voting for someone outside the democratic party) will find the documentation in The Year of The Rat hard to refute. The evidence documented in this book is grounds for an impeachment trial and a conviction of Treason for Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore. Clinton and Gore have put themselves before God,Country, and Family. Mrs. Clinton says it takes a village to raise a child.

Set in the present day, this political fiction seems like it's drawn from today's headlines. It's not perfect, and many of the characters seem a little hackneyed. \\"President Clinton\\" is too obviously based on the current President of the same name. Then again, the narrators' voice does a terrific job of satiring the hyperbolic, bombastic tone of Clinton's strident critics who find a way to transform the most mundane facts into evidence of conspiracy or moral failing. In this regard, the writing succeeds wonderfully. Along the lines of Orson Welles' War of the Worlds, the authors have created a fictional masterpiece that many will mistake for tomorrow's headlines. I would recommend this to older teenagers looking for new challenges."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read to see the Real Clinton.","review":"This book documents the corruption of Clinton on an international scale.

In exchange for campaign cash, Clinton sold out our China policy and opened the door of the White House to international criminals.The mainstream press has failed to pick up on this book, but it is probably the most serious case ever made against a sitting president.Just as importantly, it shows that Al Gore is into the Chinese connection up to his ears. How can we impeach Clinton for the Lewinski mess when his successor would be Gore? This is not even a case of the lesser of two evils. Gore has been bought and paid for over the past decade. Both of these guys must go.Defenders of Clinton and Gore after reading this book can only be described as unprincipled.

Since it had a loyal following, and with the recent wave of GBA ports, a GBA conversion was inevitable. This GBA version of Smuggler's Run does not invoke the same type of fun the PS2 version did which was expected, but the overall game feels unpolished due to the tedious missions, poor collision detection, and pop up galore. The graphics are pretty good for the most part, but the pop up trees, rocks, and hills nearly ruin the experience. The lack of options in the game (there's not even a multiplayer mode) really hurts the game as well. All in all, Smuggler's Run pales in every aspect to any other port of the game, but it is a less than half decent game that you might get a bit (and a small one at that) of fun out of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect too much","review":"If you are a big fan of Smugglers Run for the PS2 and I am, don't expect the GBA version to be even close. The idea of the game is the same, but the graphics are choppy and weak. Colliding with other cars and items such as trees and rocks ruin the experience by making you lose total control or making you come to a complete stop. I was especially disappointed with how easy this game was to complete, there really was no challenge at all. There is no option to complete against other drivers, and the whole Smugglers Run feel is just not there.

This book is not that!Instead, it's a meandering, enjoyable chat with a knowledgeable friend about baseball on a summer afternoon on the porch. Vince Staten frames his entire book around a big league game he attended with his grown son, but somehow every facet of that experience leads off on a tangent to a fascinating exploration of baseball stadium and game trivia from the ticket buying experience (which leads to essays on ticket printing and turnstiles), to telling his son about the time a shortstop lost a ball because it bounced off a pebble (which leads to an in-depth interview of a groundskeeper), to a certain snugness in the stadium seat (which leads to a well researched essay on studies through the decades of the width of the typical American backside).These essays have certainly made my baseball game experiences more enjoyable and given me a store of trivia to trot out at parties!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely Done","review":"As the author watches a game with his son, some questions come to mind; he provides the reader answers to them in an entertaining way. I especially liked the true-to-life description of why catchers wear cups (chapter 13). It is a good, easy read for fans of all ages. You'll find answers to questions you weren't aware you didn't know the answer to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightfully enchanting tale...","review":"Gaylen Sharp has masterfully created a world full of believable and inspirational characters in his novel, Tipple's Eve. His creativity is incredible and his usage of detail gives the lands and the characters a sense of reality that is not often found. I was delightfully enchanted from beginning to end and recommend Tipple's Eve to everyone. It is well written, enjoyable, and great for readers of all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"I received the 10.4 frame as a a gift. The automatic on/off did not work & after many calls to tech support I was asked to send it to them. It was found to be defective (I had to call them at least 3 times to get this info)so I was told they would send me a new one. It took almost 3 months and half a dozen calls to get this accomplished. The new one came in a huge box with no packing at all. The automatic on/off does not work on the it either. When I called I was told that the warranty was no longer in effect--even though it was a new frame, the warranty only applied to the original one. I could not get a manager to speak to me. After spending $35 to sent the original back & my daughter's $200 for a defective frame, plus absolutely no customer service--I would not recommend any Pandigital product."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow machine","review":"I purchased this as a gift for my parents for Christmas.

I was very disappointed when all I could see was a bright white screen, and no home menu to start the \\"easy\\" setup. After turning it off/on, adjusting the brightness, and a slight shake the best I could make out of the home screen was a very faint image if you looked at the screen from an angle. I will be frantically trying to purchase another frame now.. And will not be choosing the Pandigital.

I read the review previous to mine and thought I'd take a chance since it had received such a high rating. The screen shots on the package made it look like Grand Theft Auto (which I really like). But much to my dismay, the graphics were bad, the sound was bad, and the gameplay was subpar...not exciting at all. You don't have to take my word for it, though. Buy it yourself and maybe you'll agree that this is one of the weakest games I've seen produced for the GameBoy Advance. Luckily, I was able to return it and get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and Don't buy this game.","review":"I was lucky to get this game as a present because I would have really wasted my money.The game was fun for the first 30 minutes but it quickly went downhill. The same music starts to get annoying and the cars are hard to control because of your point of view in the game. And instead of just saving it give you passwords to write down and memorize. All you do in this game is just...drive!I quickly get bored with this game and I'm even thinking of selling this game to salvage some of the wasted money.Don't Buy this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best (I think)","review":"I bought this game last thurs. and i'm hooked on it. I think its one of the best racing games for GBA. I was a little dissapointed about the overhead view. But the game it self was fun. The PS2 version was better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book about a woman search for her heritage","review":"Another great book by Cynthia Freeman. Janet Stevens is a young woman who moves to New York to become a model. She is naive to the ways of the world and curious about her father's Jewish roots. Eventually she gets married and has a family. Her breakup with her husband puts her back in touch with her roots. Janet goes through a learning and soul-searching process, becoming a more independent woman. She meets another man who becomes an important part of her life. I would also recommend that the publisher re-release this book. It seems that all of Cynthia Freeman's books (She wrote 10 in all) are becoming harder and harder to get. Even the public library has limited copies. I was lucky enough to find a hardback copy of this book for sale at the public library. Her books should be re-published for a new generation of readers to enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic Principles?","review":"When I think of the basics, I think of straightforward info. This book doesn't present information in a way that gives a student a solid foundation of basic statistics. I can only give one star for \\"using technology\\" sections, although it would've been nice if one example wasn't sprinkled over 15 pages when it could've been explained in less than one. This book leads me to believe that someone just took the \\"basics\\" and threw it down on paper with no rhyme or reason.This book is best read backwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy Fever","review":"I just want to write about the play Hay Fever here as it is Noel Cowards craziest, there is almost nothing in literature as mad as Cowards Hay Fever until Thorogood wrote Drop Dead Gorgeous.

The replacement pair failed to function in monaural at all. Although I only had either pair on for less than a minute, I found them uncomfortable, and for me, an uncomfortable fit. I might have been willing to settle for the discomfort, but not without being able to receive a monaural signal."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent history of Egypt","review":"Watterson's book provides a fascinating, and very readable, introduction to the ancient land of Egypt. I couldn't put it down! And, our local library can't keep it on the shelves.Watterson combines the best of the classical authors (Herodotus, Strabo, etc) with the best of current scholarship. She has a unique ability to focus on what is most important and interesting in the long span (5000 years!) of Egyptian history.This book is very well written, very rich in information, and truly a pleasure to read. It is one of the very best histories that I have ever read. I believe that it will soon become a classic textbook, reference, and popular work. I recommend it without reservation to anyone - high school or college student, scholar, or general reader - who wants an excellent history of Egypt from ancient to modern times."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Egyptians","review":"An excellent book, well written by an excellent and knowledgeable author. a must for anyone having an interest in Ancient Egypt"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Covenant books so far","review":"The Ordo Dracul, I have to be honest, is my least favorite covenant. Its position as a hermetically sealed organization causes me to cringe, and the thought of spending centuries in Slave status, serving undead monsters who look down on you, is terrifying.However, that's also some of the appeal of this book. It deliniates the structure of the Ordo Dracul, its purposes, some bloodlines and factions within the covenant, and shows just what makes the Dragons tick.The terror that a reader of this book SHOULD feel is ever-present as you search through the pages, touching on the various practices of the Dragons, and looking into the eerie bloodlines that the Order has created over the centuries.This is a great book, well-planned and thorough. I highly recommend it, especially for those who have an interest in the Order itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yum!","review":"This product is the perfect thing for post-maternity bellies.

The three books should be placed in a bundle for Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another keeper !!! :)","review":"This is a \\"paranormal futuristic romance\\"... The name is quite long but explains well what this novel is about. It can be read as a sequel to \\"Amaryllis\\" or on its own. It takes place in the Earth colony of St. Helens, were people are divided between those with psychic powers (talents) and those who can help them to focus those powers, thus increasing them (prisms).The main characters in this book are Nick Chastain, a powerful matrix talent and casino owner, and Zinnia Spring, a full spectrum prism. They meet because Zinnia thinks Nick kidnapped one of her clients,a stormy beginning for an exciting relationship. What follows is a mad chase for a missing journal, and a developing love story that keeps you enthralled...I really loved this book, and consider it to be a real keeper !!!. I only regret it wasn't longer... If you have at least some imagination (a necessary ingredient in this kind of book, read it now: you won't regret doing so!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I need to get me a guy like that!!!!","review":"Though I have never been a fan of sci-fi futuristic stuff, this book made me almost change my mind. It was an excellent read that made me feel as if I was right there with the action. The paranormal stuff actually enhanced this book and the story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Series","review":"I've read all of novels in the series ie: Zinnia, Amaryllis and Orchid and I still think that this is the best one of the three series. I think that it's probably because Nick's matrix talent is by the far the most interesting of all three heroines. Of course I love Jayne Castle (Jayne Ann Krentz) so I may be a little bit biased. Nevertheless I think the series represents the best of the futuristic romance genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats This","review":"Pieace of junk,not recomended.Dont Know what this item is made for,but it does not work with the PSP"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunting for Hope Brings Us Home","review":"In Scott Russell Sanders' new book, the search is for hope...for his grown children, and for us all. Sanders feels that crying need among our young and gives back his own discoveries in his mid-fifties. In particular his relationship with his college age son are poignant and real. The book seems an antidote of sorts for the lost relationships found in Jon Krakauer's Into the Wild book of Chris McMannes. This is Henry David Thoreau writing here...with a wife and childen...facing the life we all know. He reaches and finds some lasting truths that connect us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope and staying true","review":"How can you maintain hope in the midst of environmental degradation, waste, and human callousness? While not ground breaking, this is a thoughtful, beautifully written book about life's values and staying true to nature. I loved the chapter on fidelity. The author's relationship with his teenaged son while camping and hiking is both humorous and touching. A very good read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even the manual","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I bought it after reading a few reviews and recommendations from NAPP. It seems to me it isn't any much more than the manual revisited with a few extra details. I was hoping for some innovation and some interesting things that I might have stirred into my pot of knowledge, but I found I was reading a lot on basic tool function. It's a manual at best. It is too text bookie, and too long and drawn out over simple things. I got to about the 18th chapter, and put it down. I don't think there is anything that I'd use. I feel sorry that the message is so down as the things that I've read are accurate in the book. I just don't feel the investment came out to be worth it very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"The blurb on the back cover claims this will be \\"the only Photoshop 7 book you need.\\" In truth, it is probably the one book on Photoshop 7 you will never need.It is superficial in every aspect.

Adjustment Layers get three paragraphs.This is the second utterly disappointing book I've seen which is highly lauded by Scott Kelby, President, National Association of Photoshop Professionals.

I certainly didn't expect a bag of the same quality as the one in the film, but the one I received is pretty cheesy. As noted by earlier reviewers, the material used is rather unattractive- not even a pleather, more of a fabric printed to look like pleather that didn't really resemble leather. Its also smaller than I thought, though the dimensions were listed for all to see, so its my own fault. It's not the worst bag I've ever seen, and a younger girl could pull it off, but I know that I'll never actually use it, so back it goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy NOT Flashy La Rue Handbag","review":"This bag doesn't look like the one in the movie.

It is supposed to be a slouchy style so it should not be heavy or it would not have the 'look' that everyone loves about it. It's very stylish and I have recieved many compliments.

I don't think that the person that made this film had even seen another horror flick before because if he had, he would have known before it came out to DVD that his was horrible & that he was going to loose alot of money. The other reviews go into detail about how bad it was. So, I think I will save my breath on the details. I will just say that I expect this movie to be sold for $1.99 very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a real movie.","review":"I have no idea how this \\"movie\\" ever got a DVD release. It is very clearly shot on a consumer level MiniDV camera (auto focus blurring every shot, all outdoor shots are over exposed and grainy in low-light) without help from an external microphone. Every scene sounds like they recorded it in an echo chamber.The acting is by far the worst I've seen in any movie ever. I actually think it's a disservice actors everywhere to call this acting. It's closer to an hour and a half long high school TV station screen test. I can only come to the conclusion that someone got a mac for Christmas and made this in iMovie over the weekend.Clearly standards and DVD duplication costs have lowered. Do not see this movie under any circumstances, it's even too horrible to mock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyday I Want to......","review":"Everyday I want to kick myself for buying this stupid dvd. This movie sucks !!!!!!!!! Awful plot bad story line even worse acting If I could rate this movie any lower it would be negative 10 stars ! The actors looked like they were regular joes paid 5 bucks to say some lines on a movie screen- hell I could have acted better than these actors I would be Julliard compared to the cast !!!!!!!! Take my word for it and please save your money do not buy this movie !!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So horrible it's funny","review":"A few years back, my friend and I found this movie at blockbuster and I wanted to get it because the cover looked amazing and to scare my friend since she's deathly afraid of clowns. Sadly, the movie did NOT live up to it's cover. We waited until it was late and dark to watch it only to laugh out butts off! It's one of my favorite movies to hate. I give it one star cause it's not worth buying unless you want a horrible horrible movie in your collection to laugh at when you are feeling bad. The only reason I bought it was so I could laugh at the horrible acting, the ridiculous actors and the clown chopping of some guys genitalia and throwing it in the face of another guy. So funny XD Like I said, if you just want a great laugh and are making a top ten worst movie list, this is for you. If you want a good scare from a clown, go buy IT. Tim Curry is a scarier clown than this joker"},{"rating":"1","title":"WtfOmfg","review":"Oh my God!!! I have to agree with most of the other peoples reviews this isn't even a movie. It's a great time waster. My cousins and I rented this from Movie Gallery based on the cover which Looked pretty cool.....at the time.

This book gives great detail of the meaning of the text, but then it also excels in making good application of it as well. Hey men, this book of the Bible is the one book God dedicated to romance and loving your wife according to God's Word. This commentary will help you understand this book and also how to apply it in loving your wife like Jesus Christ loves His Church. Only drawback to the book is some of the psychobabble included in it.

None of the metal parts fit together well and the finish is horrible. The cast iron grates on top are uneven and cause your pots and pans to wobble and make noise when you cook. I wish I didn't have to buy a 36\\" range...this is the only affordable one out there and I can tell why. Spend the extra $600 and buy anything but this. Everytime I use it I am disappointed. You really do get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality and overpriced","review":"I purchased the 36 inch stove in 2006. There weren't many reviews online and I went by looks and the decent \\"press\\". The range is as others described - junk. Sheet metal thin, poor engineering tolerances, sharp edges, chincey parts, and the clock broke on day 1. The only decent part of the stove is the cast iron grates. Like someone else I could see the insulation peaking out the seems in the oven compartment. The broiler is especially atrocious. The rail the drawer runs on are built like a cheap $30 file cabinet. The whole thing is built this way. A fair price for this range is $300-$400. I replaced it with a mid level Maytag $800 - something decent but not great. However, it was head and shoulders a better stove. Really like going from a Ford Pinto to a Rolls Royce. This stove is that bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...It's permanently out of stock.","review":"The title pretty much sums it up.

This is an inspired story by the author, Nikki Arana's life. This book has challenged me to stop judging people based on the clothes they wear or how much worldly goods they have or don't have. I want to allow the Lord to show me the beauty He sees inside people.

Not to mention the fatherly support of an old family employee; Poppy. So when Angelica leaves her job with a prestigious law firm to return to her family's ranch, it's no wonder things turn upside down. Now questioning her own beliefs about the plight of immigrants and the poor, she must look deep into her heart and trust God more than ever before. When Angelica meets Antonio (a Mexican worker on her father's ranch)her feelings for him only complicate matters. How can two people from such different worlds ever come together?I loved the novel. Arana's treatment of immigration issues is certainly no dry \\"evening news\\" approach to discussing the subject. Antonio and Angelica come alive on the page. I found myself reading quickly, turning pages as fast as I could to find out what happened next. A satisfying romance that WILL make you cry, \\"The Winds of Sonoma\\" is a definite winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winds of Sonoma","review":"This was an excellent novel.

Not only fired, but blackballed in the entire area. Dejected and yet feeling so right about her decision, she moves back to her California home. Her wealthy parents are mortified that she would trade such an important job for the simplistic and ridiculous job of public defender for illegals and the poor. Antonio, an illiterate Mexican young man, comes to work at their horse ranch just as she arrives home, and she decides to make a difference in his life.This opening book lays the foundation for a very possible, though highly unlikely love story of the decade. Readers will hate the crooked ranch foreman, love Poppy, and wonder just what makes the Amantes tick.There is so much intrigue, so much feeling, so much love and hate in this story, I am recommending this series of 3 to all my Christian fiction reader friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fabulous","review":"Fabulous book.

(One thing I could say about it is that it is the most artificial-tasting candy ever created.) The concept of the idea is a decent one, but in reality, the candy is just plain nasty. It's like the makers of this candy held a control group, but the toxins in this candy killed everybody. So the makers reached inside their mouths, pulled it out, and marketed it anyway (for some reason). Okay, maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration, but still...this candy is disguuuusting!

On the other hand it was poorly written and the rest of the actors and actresses in the movie did a terrible job. It made no sense at all. Some lousy acting kids got mysteriously sent back in time to save a mountain from being blown into pieces. It's funny how the kids were trying to save the mountain from being blown when it already existed in the 20th century. Then the writer made a lousy attempt to make the movie funny by making the kids have all sorts of gadgets and gizmos from the future.

Poor Maria, young, intelligent, beautiful, and gifted so far in her life with financial/career success, is thrust into juxtaposition with the Catchprice family when she is assigned to audit Catchprice Motors. The Catchprices seem to epitomize the modern dysfunctional family, a wild blend of discordant characters commonly saddled with guilt and impossible dreams. Against the Catchprice backdrop, Maria shines like a diamond. Unfortunately, the Catchprices are charmed by Maria, too, and their attempts to bring her into their world are varied and unforgettable.Far busier and more entangled than Bliss, less uplifting than either Bliss or Jack Maggs, this is not a book for the faint of heart, or those prone to depression! But there is still a thread of hope throughout this tale, winding through seamy strands of dishonesty and craziness."},{"rating":"1","title":"advice: read something else","review":"\\"The Tax Inspector\\" is not a pleasant read.

And it is also a time capsule as today's experts have no idea what it meant to have actual plasticity in their hands, instead of today, when it is just the plastic of a keyboard and mouse that the craftsperson feels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iggy in his own words!!!","review":"I've got a lotta love, respect, and admiration for a man who keeps rockin' well into his 50's!!! Thank god some people never grow up! Here is the man who fronted the Stooges, pretty much the inspiration for the NY Dolls, the Dead Boys, and much of the punk movement which started during the mid 1970's. Unfortunately the music industry didn't know what to do with the Stooges in 1969, when they released their first album. If you're a Stooges fan, of course you already know that. Iggy is the godfather of punk. If you haven't already read this book, GET IT NOW. It's a must have for any Stooges/Iggy fan. Iggy starts with his life in the trailor park, becoming a crazy rock'n'roller, gigging with the MC5, working with Bowie. Hey, I didn't know Iggy had Nico living with him! The best thing about this book is it's Iggy in his own words. He's a funny guy! His life with and without the Stooges is definitely entertaining, to say the least! Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best rock autobiographies ever","review":"This nonlinear autobiography of one of the most electrifying performers of the last thirty years is as revealing as it is unrevealing. Iggy leaves out huge gaps of his history, notably because they were horrible times (he was in an institution for awhile). For a clearer picture of his \\"untold\\" biography check out the great book \\"Please Kill Me.\\" The characters in Iggy's life (like the \\"imaginary mexican,\\" roadie John Adams and the girl he wishes he slept with from his neighborhood) make this book all the more interesting, as well as the tales of drug abuse and rockin' with Bowie, etc. Great photographs, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but...","review":"The movie is well done. I liked it.BUTIf you expect Home Alone you are in for a disapointment. Granted - It has the same plot as Home Alone, but that plot came from Die Hard.

And downright miserly in its use of a toner cartridge every year or year and a half, and a new drum every three or four years. Unfortunately, I learned today that Xerox is no longer manufacturing the cartridges. What used to be a $100 original cartridge is now a re-manufactured cartridge going for $236. Ay-yi-yi! Next year when I need a new cartridge, I'll try again to buy a hellishly priced re-manufactured cartridge, because that's still cheaper than trying to replace my \\"old gray mare\\" with a Multi-Function Device (don't ask me what my interpretation is of the acronym MFD!). It's not that a new MFD would be that expensive. It's the damn cartridge cost! Seriously, I think I'll hold a wake for my \\"old gray mare\\" when I have to put her down!

Helen Mirren portrays a prostitute raising a small child, with no clich�� left unmolested. Standard soap opera stuff, sprinkled with dreadful \\"musical\\" numbers at the night club, containing just enough nudity to make the enterprise bearable. This film is full of unintentional laughs, many from the ultra-cheesy fashions and conventions of the era. However, it is almost worth watching just to hear Helen Mirren repeat the line, \\"Make love to me!\\" at random intervals whenever some gratuitous nudity is in order.The quality of the DVD transfer is barely adequate and is presented in full screen format. For fans of Helen Mirren and bad films only, this film is a rare instance where the two converge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost the best novel ever","review":"I eagely awaited the release of this book and read it as soon as it was published in its English version a few years ago. I agree with other commentators on this page who praise the \\"ingenious social commentary\\" and so forth. Indeed, right up to page 98 I felt that this book had the makings of one of the best novels ever.However, after page 98 the magic abruptly disintegrates. I don't know how else to put it. It's a shame. Googling for details of Tatyana's life, you get some clue as to why she could not sustain the magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Russian Dystopian Novel","review":"I'll surely grant that Tatyana Tolstoya is a fine writer and excellent stylist. However, I did not find her dystopic view of a Russian future all that compelling. Margaret Atwood has covered much of the same terrain in several novels, most notably her splendid \\"The Handmaid's Tale\\" with a gripping plot and memorable characters. Unfortunately I found none of Tolstaya's characters of interest, with the possible exception of Benedikt. Anyone interested in reading great dystopian novels should turn to Orwell and Atwood first, before reading this slender tome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Slow to start the plot, this novel is occasionally confusing, and probably 100 pages too long. The post apocalyptic tableau is misleading; this is an overwrought Russian fable. It's best classified in the post-modernist, semi-fabulist genre. I suspect some of its appeal was lost in translation, but I also suspect the Translator may have saved the book by her superb rendering of Russian colloquialisms into English. The ending is a disappointment.There are some redeeming qualities. Several laugh out loud moments of Russian humor and irony. I liked the novel plot device of \\"Olden-Timers\\" who survived \\"The Blast\\", were mutated and apparently immortalized. The descriptions of \\"golubchiks\\" muddling through winter hardship were simultaneously comical and horrendous.Other NYRB books I have read have been outstanding. This book was mediocre."},{"rating":"2","title":"The review from Publishers Weekly is misleading","review":"The review from Publishers Weekly is wrong saying that the world described in The Slynx is the world of permanent winter. The reviewer obviously have not read the book.The book is a masterpiece of Russian language. I suppose it is equally hard to translate to English as to translate Shakespeare from English. Tolstaya's language is not a simple Russian, it is a colorful, rich literature language. Note that the book is written as if on behalf of Benedikt. And Tolstaya in a masterly fashion gives the prose a rural and still noble shade of Russia primordial. It's really enjoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal","review":"Upon first glance this seems to be excellently illustrated, however, what would have made it a truly enchanting experience would be if Mr. Herrington had composed his own angels. Even the untrained eye will notice that many illustrations are simply retracings of older artwork.I do not know the copyright status of the pieces in question. Indeed they may be public domain at this point.But when I buy someone's artwork it is to see their artwork, not their ability to copy someone else's, and in that regard, this book is a disappointment.The actual execution of the book also leaves much to be desired, as the binding is weak. If you go to flatten the page out to colour it in, you risk breaking the spine of the book entirely. Not good if you want to save the book intact for later."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly writen book","review":"With having so many stars, I thought this would be a great way to learn on making rootkits.

Unfortunately a good concept in design is let down by so-so software and slow proceesing. 70Mhz was slow even for its time what with the Jornada 820 at 190Mhz. Most applications tend to hang if too many are opened simultaneously and Sharp's machine does not contain most of the goodies that are standard with the vadem clio.

A ravishing film of urban youth set adrift in the bars and clubs of an ethereally beautiful contemporary Taipei. Like much of his work this draws criticisms for being static, but in truth he is only extremely patient in this study of languor at the end of the millennium.

I greatly enjoyed this movie. The atmosphere of the scenes makes me feel like I'm in interesting places. Some casual, some cozy, some charged with tension and for sure exotic. Shu Qi makes the movie worth a watch indeed. She is quite good in this one. The other performers do a splendid job too. I've long been interested in Taiwan so I'm given to favoring such movies. Having watched many Asian movies I can connect to the story. I rented this video. I may decide to buy a copy for myself. Mabey I'll buy a second copy to send to a friend. Best enjoyed while eating instant noodles with chopsticks!

It truly feels like your watching a surveillance tape of some girl and her troubles that don't appear to be that bad due to the lack emotion and feeling that the story is full of . It's so slow and like another reviewer said it does takes you days to force yourself to watch it. The first ten minutes of partying and pacing from the characters make you want to find something else to do. There's no real plot or conflict in the film to make it a story and by the end of it you just wasted your time. There literally is no excitement or any emotion to make you feel it so all that stuff on the DVD case like the words Deeply Moving is a lie. I don't think it was the acting but more the directing and story were too dry, trust me when say it's not worth watching even once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Millennium Boredom","review":"An extremely poor movie from TaiwanThere is no shortage of cigarettes there.All bar scenes are extremely inept."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use clamping system","review":"I have two Kreg bench clamps, the older model with the larger metal base and now this one with the smaller base. The only real difficulty is installing them into your workbench as you need to rout out part of the bench for them, but once they are in, they are quick and simple to use for a variety of clamping needs. Naturally, they are great for holding joints for pocket hole screw assembly, but have plenty of clamp force for just about anything else as well. Very handy to have one, but even better to have two!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a better way","review":"Anchoring this clamp to a table and then expecting to use it to put together a face frame for a cabinet will give you frustration. It does not move to accomadate the frame so you'll have a time trying to balance the rails and stiles while you're attempting to connect one joint. Some of your frame will probably be hanging off the table unless you have these expensive clamps spaced about one foot apart- very expensive, not practical for the cost or performance. Kreg makes a klamp that comes with the master kit or can be purchased separately, it is simply a vise type of clamp with enlarged pads which you can move to the frame easily without hanging the frame off the table to do a corner. I took a half sheet of plywood and knotched 3\\" X 3\\" cut-outs along two paralell edges where I can pull the frame to the edge of the plywood without hanging off and place the klamp in the cut out to clamp the jiont that I place over the opening and screw it together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ayurveda rocks!","review":"Great book - David Frawley is one of the foremost authorities in the United States and he explains everythingvery well.

It's my DVD, soI may be a little biased, but it really is good! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete","review":"This book is unfortunately incomplete, although its intentions are good. Most people are combination types--kapha-pitta, vata-pitta, etc. but the book ignores this necessary fact in its presentation, and acts as though every person is a pure type. After a long, difficult search, I found this subject addressed AFTER the main body of the material--and not in any convenient or helpful manner. Both authors totally ignored my phone calls and emails asking for help on this issue, which doesn't do anything to inspire confidence or a positive attitude toward the book. Frawley is a prolific author and should do more than just present an overview, which would require a live teacher to make sense of the material."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that good","review":"I have read lots of books on yoga and was very hopeful about this one but I just could not get into it.

The working class face is a public face, even when the camera explores intimate moments.

Obviously from all the relevant reviewers comments it is anything but compatible with OSX and coupled with no image stablization for the external lens makes it fairly useless for it's intended purpose i.e. sports. Classic case of lame marketing and very disappointing from a company such as Samsung."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ONLY Jerry Lewis movie","review":"After watching every Jerry Lewis movie I can get my hands on, and this being one of the first I ever saw, I would still say it is his best. As soon as the little Japanese boy laughs at him, he is asked by the family to stay and keep making the boy laugh. He rather reluctanlty does so, but soon realizes he is having fun, along with Harry, his white rabbit that travels everywhere with Mr Wooley (Jerry Lewis) The Magician, especialy to Korea to entertain the troops. A great movie for adults and children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved jerry growing up","review":"Jerry Lewis movies are always a good time and they always take me back to my youth and saturday afternoon and one of his movies were on television thank you, for letting me enjoy them again anytime i can"},{"rating":"2","title":"cute!","review":"I like most of Jerry's movies.

He needed to read closed captions. We laughed alot and my kids who hated classic movies..they loved that movie. My VHS player no longer works. I bought a DVD with NO English subtitle or closed caption. What about hearing impaired ppls who love to laugh w movies? That is why the company won't make English subtitles or CC? I hope another company would make it that so I will buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jerry's Valentine","review":"Another cinematic treasure from Jerry Lewis that was long in coming to the compact disc market is finally here in a gorgeous blu-ray format. In this movie Jerry is a hard-luck magician that volunteers for a USO tour to Japan. His partner is a white rabbit named Harry that has a mind of his own. Jerry gets in trouble and his antics spark laughter and attraction from an orphaned Japanese boy. Jerry wrestles with the dilemma of his pursuing career versus caring for the boy. This movie includes the screen debut of Suzanne Pleshette.The movie is heart warming and the antics are hilarious. Jerry is abit more broken hearted in this movie by his dilemma but he never becomes bitter or morose. This movie is good family entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"*******Wonderful, charming & Delightful","review":"A movie for the whole family my 7 year old nephew laughed so much it was a joy to watch him enjoy Jerry , the rabbit & the sweetest little boy.

'Doomsday X' is straight forward, hard hitting metal that you can chug a beer to & swing your hair around. The resurfacing of Hoffman is a plus too, giving the tunes the specific Malevolent sound. The instrumental \\"Prelude to Doomsday\\" is a great track midway through also. These guys definately can shred with the best of them. Production is top notch; great for a quality stereo.

It's a pretty good camera, but perhaps I should have bought something else. Here are the reasons for that: 1) the editing is not easy; 2) colors seem to be washed out, along with the focus; 3) camera broke down after 18 months of use. For the last bullet, it appeared to be some kind of internal electronic malfunction, resulting in complete failure when using camera in moderate sunlight situations (the screen goes white): only when the amount of sun/light is fairly low, will it function. Sony can fix it, but it will cost abuot $250 (I paid $400 for the camera).

On the sound track you can hear noise from the recording head moving back and forth, sounds like a woodpecker. This alone made it unacceptable or what I wanted to do.2. I wanted high quality video, but since it records on a small dvd disk, the video is compressed before it is recorded on the disk. This causes some loss of detail in the picture, especially if you're going to edit it and rerecord the video which I need to do.If you just want a camera to record a small dvd which you can then play in a dvd player (and not all dvd players will play the small dvds) this camera might be acceptable. I returned it and bought a Panasonic PV-GS35miniDV camcorder which uses the miniDV cassette tape. Much better video quality because its not compressd, and no noise from the tape drive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this camcorder!","review":"if you think the following you reasons are enough to scare you, then keep away from this one.1) The DVD cover are not able to close tightly, after 1 year of routine use.

However, if you want your video files to be transferred to a computer for editing or to post it on the Internet, forget about it! This camcorder does not come with USB port to connect directly to your computer. Plus Sony does not provide any software to transfer your video files from the finalized DVD.

Even when I connect the device using the power cord. The DVD-R was trapped inside and I am not even able to take it out.Best Buy Geek Squad confirmed my camera is really dead and tried to charge me US $ 100 just for shipping.

It moved around a tiny bit no matter how tight I could get it on the body of my D90. It also would disconnect power a little bit for a split second. Which might be the cause of the batteries dying while my camera was in my camera bag. I'd have full batteries, not use my camera for a week. Then they would be half dead or more when I used my camera. Other than that, it worked. I'd buy one again if I didn't have the money for the Nikon version.

The plastic shell adds little weight to the camera, most of my lenses outweigh it. The convinence of using AA is extrememly helpful, especially if you are in locations where it is impossible or impractical to recharge the lithium-ion batteries. The grips on the battery pack work well, I enjoy using the battery pack to do vertical portrait shots. On the downside, the shutter release is somewhat unpredictable, it doesn't have the feel of the camera's shutter release. At times, I've had to push quite hard in order to take a pic, which can cause blur do to small vibrations. Another downside is the battery pack cover keeps opening up. This doesn't cause any problems with the opperation of the camera, but it is still anoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the Nikon mb-d80","review":"I like the unit overall, but it does feel cheap and the grip is just a bit large for my hands. It is not as nice as the MBD200 unit from Nikon that I use on my D200. But from what I have read on the Nikon forums the Opteka BP-D80 and the Nikon MB-D80 seems to be identical in shape and feel. So for the price I am happy. I like the AF button on the BP-D80. I have taken over 300 pics with it so far and it works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I bought this winter 2007.

Or maybe it is the gang itself, The Wanderers, that is the hero here. The gang members are all textured--they have virtues, but serious flaws, too, and that makes them all the more appealing and believable. But at this point, long after the book was written, these guys all seem like Italian stereotypes. Try Roland Merullo for the real thing, Boston instead of the Bronx. And isn't the outcome a little too predictable? The gang can't last forever. We know it long before the end comes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"I saw the movie first and loved it. I couldn't wait to get my hands on the book. I began to read and was very disappointed. Usually I enjoy reading books, but I couldn't even finish this book. The stories jump around randomly and sometimes its hard to get a sense of whats going on. As for the comparison to the movie, way different: characters are switched around, scenes flow in a different order and it lacks the charm that the movie had. Also this book is very explicit sometimes a bit much. I would definitely recommend the movie but not the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing to me","review":"I have read the 5-star reviews of this book, and do not necessarily disagree with their assessments, but for me the reading of this book was like a visit to a disorienting funhouse. There is some stop and lurch to the flow of the novel, which may result from the individual-short-story format of it. More than that, I found the book to be disturbing. Perhaps it's \\"realistic,\\" but I found the grim depictions of sex, murder, and violence to be too much for me (and more than necessary). I'm not sure why I even finished it, other than that it's a short book and I had already invested the time to start it. This is one of the rare occasions when I'd recommend sticking with the movie version (the movie has more humor and charm than the book does, and it has a great soundtrack)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oster CryogenX Clipper Blade 10 Wide","review":"This blade did not work well for my purpose.

It is little more than a wish list of ideas with no hard data or really useful information. It varies from a few lines to a few paragraphs on each job idea, with little or no information about legal issues, taxes, licensing, zoning or other basics of running some of these businesses. Can you make money doing the things listed in here? Certainly. Will you have a good grasp of how to do it safely and legally? No.If you have absoutely no clue about what a person can do for a business, this book might be of some small assistance in getting you started thinking about it. I don't find it to be of much more value than that.I would recommend instead one of the more detailed books, like \\"The Best Home Businesses\\" by Paul and Sarah Edwards, or even a look at the Yellow pages of a large city.

In comparison, the audio on these two in a surround format is excellent, but the audio here is substandard, hollow and tinny.

You can see in this disc how uncomfortable they looked, for good reason. Sorry to have to say this. Get the Great Woods VHS instead, it's a 5+ (but avoid the butchered DVD version of Great Woods).

Since this review is about \\"The Burning\\", let me focus on it.I found the novel to be too draggy almost from the start. Little attempts to tie together 4 disparate characters from across the country to the appearance of a ghostly train that begins to appear to them (and some others) as the book plods along. The characters were not likeable, nor did I really give a rat's patoot about their problems. Not unlike the engine, the book just takes too long to gather up any steam for this reviewer (a firm believer in \\"too many books, not enough time\\", by the way).Little throws around a few shocks and more than a little gratuitous sexual scenes, but not enough to keep me around for more than 180 pages of this clunker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this???","review":"I can't believe Bentley Little would actually stake claim to this mindless drivel.

The rest ... 0."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice change in style","review":"I have been reading a lot of Little (hey! an oxymoron!!) and have greatly enjoyed his writing. With The Burning he has changed his writing style and it's refreshing. Based in part on the horrors of the great American West and what the immigrants suffered at the hands of the white man, it speaks about racism, also the American Spirit.A great read. Looking forward to much more from this talented author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best.....","review":"I've read all of Bentley Little's books and I was excited to get my hands on his new one. Sadly the book was only medicore. For me Little's books are in two catergories, first the ones I think are really good, interesting and well written (The Store, Dispatch, Dominion, The Association) and second the ones that are so-so (University, The House, The Resort). I guess I would have to file The Burning in the second category. Don't get me wrong Little is a good writer I just found that this book took too long to get going and that the several story lines of different characters didn't fuse well together. However I still find Little's work more often than not worth reading and I will still buy his new books when they come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slacking?","review":"The worst Little book I think I've read to date.

These are so easy to assembly that my 10 year old daughter can put them together and have them fully installed down both sides of our walkway in under 30 minutes. We like that you can get different sleeves for different occasions. They are weather proof and the bulbs last a long time - 3 years for us and we have them out for 2 weeks at Halloweena and for a month at Christmas.Yes, you have to buy the stakes seperately, but they are so well worth it. They are galvanized, so they don't rust and you only need 2 per luminatia. If you put one stake in on each side diagonal from the other, they don't move through any kind of weather.

It's easy to find words you're looking for, and the tips are great.Yes, it's limited and I can't find a lot of words, but I expect that from a beginner's dictionary. My problem is that the dictionary uses the Beijing pronunciation. They should at least have the regular pronunciation and then the Beijing one. Not everyone wants to acquire a Beijing accent (ew!!!). For example, instead of \\"y��di'n\\" (a little, '''they have it as \\"y��di'nr\\" (''''. Many other examples.

That second lather is even frothier than the first. So... expect that party following a party to be richer and wilder.In other words, people with hangovers are worse at keeping their feelings and secrets to themselves than those who are simply drunk.New people connect, old flames are new flames, and current flames are renewed or extinguished.Well, that about wraps up the film.

Basically, a bunch of young adults go to a high school reunion party and decide to extend the party for the duration of the movie. It is a continuous, childish, converstional drone.

The movie opens the day after the party. The partygoers, for the most part, have left their spouses and children at home, as they've come to relive what once was, their high school past.As the group nurses hangovers, while they're cleaning up the mess, they wax nostalgic and dredge up memories and secrets that maybe they shouldn't have, because they involve old hurts. They've never really grown up, these people, and now they are about to.There's a super soundtrack and a super cast, including: Tate Donovan, Ione Sky and the great Eric Stoltz, but for some reason the movie didn't quite live up to the long shadow cast by the Big Chill, a shadow that effects all movies like this. Still it was okay, four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"It's not often I have trouble finishing a movie, but this one just did not interest me at all.

The Lather Effect is the story of a group of thirty-somethings, who were best friends in high school getting together for a reunion party. I have to admit that I was put off right from the start when I saw how trashed the house was. I don't know many people in their thirties that would trash their houses like that. It has a great cast but I found that for the most part we never learned enough about the characters.By the end we knew and cared more but it came so late in the movie that it was a disappointment.

But the music's great.","review":"I was really looking forward to this movie, billed as a \\"Big Chill\\" for those who went to high school in the 80's. I did attend high school in the 80's, but found that the only part of this movie I could really relate to is the music.The movie opens the day after a monster \\"Come as You Were\\" party that, from the detritus, reminded me of the house parties that were the staples of 80's coming-of-age flicks. Unfortunately, I think I would rather have seen the party itself than the aftermath. I couldn't really relate to any of these people who seem to want to go back to high school instead of returning to their lives after their reunion. The actors' performances were great, but the story was dull, dull, dull.The music was great, even though most of the songs were just background fragments, lasting five seconds. The music, not the characters and their endless conversation, made me feel nostalgic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light and frothy with as much substance and entertainment value","review":"\\"The Latter Effect\\" starts off promising enough and has a very good cast. The film though quickly falls apart due to cliched writing and direction. The soundtrack is impressive with a nice array of 80's hits. While they are well used they are used to cover up the lack of comedy/drama rather than enhance it.Valinda (Connie Britton) brings together a group of friends played by Ione Skye, Eric Stoltz, David Herman, Sarah Clarke, Peter Facinelli, Tate Donovan and Caitlin Keats to an 80's party designed to help her relieve the tension in her life. The results should be a mixture of comedy and pathos at missed opportunities much like \\"The Big Chill\\" but its as if \\"The Big Chill\\" were directed by John Hughes never escaping the teenage angst that was a hallmark of his films.The film has good intentions but good intentions don't make a great film. Rent it if you must see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic.","review":"Imagine the dreams you had in high school of making movies about - well - life in high school after you got out of high school.Sarah Kelly and Tim Talbott have acheived their dream, which for viewers of this banal, trite 95 minute movie is a nightmare.The movie opens on a house where a reunion of an 80's high school class was held the night before. The premise that a party could produce so much debris, particularly the truckloads of beer kegs and alcohol bottles is ridiculous. The whole set is ridiculous. The few party attendees who spent the night set to clean the place up - the house is due to be inspected the next day prior to its sale.The stories of the men and women are supposed to tug on our hearts as their life stories come tumbling out. Frankly, they're all self-centered losers who fail to engender any sympathy. None of their dramas are significant or engaging.The soundtrack music is good - and that's the only aspect of this dud that is.Jerry"},{"rating":"1","title":"The horrible screenplay effect.","review":"I would much rather have had the actors improvise, as the written lines of dialogue in this film were what I found to be the most unoriginal, unexciting cheese one could ever imagine. I can't believe the actors appearing in the film didn't drop the script and run when they did a read through. Maybe they did, and this is the 2nd or 3rd set of actors they had to use! Who knows, but I can't believe the senseless drivel I had to sit through watching this.Right from the opening scene, which was way overdone, with all the debris from the morning after of the 80's reunion party. I think someone could party for one month straight and still be hard pressed to leave as much of a disaster area as the filmmaker's portrayed this house and yard.

The set has so many delightful details, such as the tongue hanging out of the wolf's mouth, the numbers labeling each of the pigs in order, and the pop up doors that the pigs hide behind (which are made to look like hay, wood and brick).This toy is probably for children 4 and up, since the material is not stain-proof, and a child who knows the story well and likes to retell it by him/herself would enjoy this the most.Altogether, a very thoughtfully designed product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for those who aren't fans","review":"I'm still bending over backwards to be fair about this book.

I then spent over $45 in parts on EACH of the 5 toilets replacing all the flush valves, flapers and gaskets. These were top of the line Kohler toilets too, not some cheap bargain toilet.

Thanks.My husband bought this product and we tried it, however it doesn't clean like it advertises it does, I wasn't looking to not clean my toilet for three months, that's unrealistic, but I was looking to stop cleaning every three days. This didn't help me with that at all. They are expensive for the lack of cleaning power and to top it all off, they have a rancid sewer smell, I couldn't figure out why my bathroom stunk, I cleaned, bleached, sprayed all to no avail, then my mom mentioned that she tried this product and it made her bathroom stink! So I promptly removed mine, and viola! No more stinky bathroom!

It totally smokes traditional toilet bowl cleaners such as Vanish and 2000 flushes. It does it so well that the only rational I can think of for how these products are still being sold is that Kaboom isn't marketed aggressively.There are three bad points. The first is that the tube from it that inserts into the flow tube of the toilet must be secured (by duct tape in my case); otherwise, it will squirm its way out after a few flushes. Second, it gives the bowl water a disinfectant odor. But over time, it wanes. Third, replacing the refill requires pliers with a very wide mouth.But even with those disadvantages, the advantage of having a bowl that totally cleans itself automatically for months on end without any intervention whatsoever is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"smelly","review":"I just got this product.

I have to say it does a fantastic job of keeping your toilet bowl clean without forcing you to replace the flapper in the tank every few months because the other in-tank solutions destroy it.But, this is the original design. It's impossible to keep from leaking. The O-ring doesn't fit correctly; I added a rubber band to help seal it but even that didn't totally fix the leaking problem.Why is leaking bad? Two reasons. First, if it comes out fast enough it will, and has, shot right out of the tank (past the lid) and onto the floor. Second, it fills the tank faster than it fills the bowl so you don't have as much water in the bowl.I recently replaced this design with the newer one (#35113). They totally redesigned it and it works great. Cleans your toilet and it doesn't leak. Make sure you buy the new one, not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puricle not Kaboom","review":"I purchased three of these units about five years ago when it was sold by K-Mart and was under the Puricle brand name. This was way before the product was taken over by Kaboom so there may be some quality difference between them but my units have performed beautifully with no problems what so ever. I now find that the cartridges have more than doubled in price and are a little hard to find in retail stores and with S/H charges the refills can run over five dollars a canister if you buy online.Still a great product.

In All Day Permanent Red, Logue rewrites the first battles in the Illiad and the result is a fantastic updating of books 5 and 6. Mixing ancient and modern metaphors in his poetry, Logue brings home the juxtaposition in war both as horror and joy. I'm a traditionalist, I don't much care for people messing about with the books I love, but I have nothing but applause for Logue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Free Information!","review":"This type of scholarship book is Free for everyone at your local library!

I was foolish to think my soul had cried enough, for there never will be enough tears shed for those who were lost on that day, or for those who had their families brutally ripped apart by senseless acts of hostility.

There are sad parts which make you want to become the author and change it to a happier scene, and there are other parts that make you laugh or smile. The transmissions between these are so smooth that the book flows very well, like the ocean. This is one of the first books that I really loved, and that I could highly relate to with my life. It was a Newbery Honor book in 2004, which probably makes it very popular in many places in America. It really deserved the honor because it makes you want to keep reading, one page after another"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Good book, my son enjoyed it.

Well, it was the only one that SEEMED good, so I bought it on Amazon and read it. It was in lovely condition, nice and crisp pages, but the text inside it was the thing that really bugged me. It was so slow and fake. It's like, \\"This really didn't happen!\\" So I stopped not even 1/10 of the way through it and gave up on it. It REALLY didn't interest me. I tried to give it a chance, but it was so horrible I couldn't. Nothing personal, Kevin Henkes! Oh, and by the way, this is just MY opinion!

Most of them liked it a lot so I read it. I read it in about an hour and then it was just over. It doesn't really have a plot. There's no middle, or end. It justs starts and you're waiting for something and then it's over. You know how with some books, at the end you put it down and you say, \\"Wow, that was a great book.\\", well with this book when it's over you say, \\"I guess that was kind of cool.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it could have been","review":"I was very disappointed with Olive's Ocean. I identified little with the main character. I found her to be self-absorbed and self-serving. As I was reading the book, I was constantly hoping for more information regarding Olive. I definitely wanted to know more about her. She seemed to be the most intriguing character in the story and yet the reader discovers little about her. I would love to read a story about Olive. From the little that Mr. Henkes lets us know, the dead girl seemed to have more character and more positive attributes than anyone else in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE BOOK","review":"I thought this was a really aweful book. I thought that the emotions she was feeling about the other characters in the book were very unrealistic. Secondly, Kevin Henkes does a TERRIBLE idea of what a twelve year old's writing would be like. Martha's writing is AWEFUL! This book just didn't make sence. I didn't get why she \\"felt her life was changing before her eyes\\" just because her father was mad, her brother went out, and her little sister was crying. I didn't care for the characters at all. Martha had no personality.This was an all around bad book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Got a Good Book? well here's one","review":"Olive's Ocean was a great book. I usually don't like to read, but I was hooked on the book and couldn't put it down. I loved it so much; I really grew attached to the relationship between Olive and Martha. It was a very strong and emotional book that took place in the present and so many devastating things happened. The author was extremely creative with how he ended the book. I discovered many clever happeneings in this book; it just changed how I thought about simple things. Another thing is it made me realize to be thankful for what you have now and in front of you, because in just one second, things could be gone. I found the book satisfying and delightful, the way it ended just sent a sigh and smile to me. I truly recommend this book if you like to read a book just for fun, not adventurous, not mystery, just something nice and sweet to enjoy on a Sunday morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really? For 12-year-olds and younger?","review":"I'm a mom, and this book was on a recommended reading list at school.Maybe it's just me.

The writing is pretty, the relationship with the grandmother is very special, and the characterization of Martha is complete, but... this is not an enjoyable book.Is twelve too young for a first kiss?Amazon won't let me post the bad language -- I may put it in the comments."},{"rating":"2","title":"PCE Student Review","review":"My favorite book would have to be Olive's Ocean. The author is Kevin Henkes. The genre he chose was realistic fiction and the theme he chose was a girl learning to grow up. My favorite character is Martha Boyle. Martha Boyle is a girl that always thinks about a little girl named Olive that died because a truck hit her. Somehow she learns that Olive wanted to friends with her.Mr.Henkes writing style is to express because he is trying to make you laugh and cry. I would want to pick up another one of his books because of the words he chooses it makes you feel like your really there looking at Martha or walking in her bedroom. I love this book because it's a roller coaster of emotions it makes you want to laugh cry and jump in the book and slap someone. Olive's Ocean is a very sad book because Martha has to cope with Olive death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional Masterpiece","review":"This was the greatest book I ever read. It features a variety of emotions; love, hate, guilt, friendship, betrayal, rage, happiness, and the indescribable feeling that comes in when all others fail.It starts when our protagonist, Martha, is given a diary entry from a mother of a deceased classmate. Martha is instantly touched on the death of Olive. During her summer, Martha changes and matures through her experiences with her Grandmother, family, a boy she develops feelings with, and of course, Olive.Olive's Ocean is a type of story that disguises itself unintentionally as \\"average fiction\\" but is deep and meaningful inside. The passages are carefully fined-tuned and edited to create a glowing feeling as you read it. Olive's Ocean is sentimental, emotional, beautiful, and beloved.This book is Newbery Honor worth--and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olive's Ocean","review":"Olive Barstow and Martha Boyle were classmates. They shared an occasional glance at each other but never actually exchanged any words. Olive was a quiet twelve year old girl that had no friends, therefore, no one to understand her. Martha was a creative young writer with an older brother, a younger sister, two parents, a best friend, and a near perfect lifestyle, until one day, a day Martha would never forget, Olive Barstow died.This incredible book will make you laugh, cry, and experience everything in between. I recommend this book to anyone who can handle a little reality in their lives. You will truly feel lucky at the end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Olive's Ocean is Fantastic!","review":"I was very familiar with Kevin Henkes' work before Olive's Ocean - I read many of his picture books when I was \\"The Storybook Lady\\" at Barnes & Noble. I am therefore not surprised at all that he has written such a beautifully realistic yet lyrical account of adolescence. Olive's Ocean is a charming tale about life, love and friendship. It is a very quick read - I read in in just a couple of days - but I know Martha and Olive will stay with me for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review for Olive's Ocean by Kevin Henkes","review":"Olive's Ocean is an emotional and captivating book that allows the reader to relate to the characters. I enjoyed reading this book especially because it takes unexpected turns and lets the reader feel as if they are inside the book experiencing what the characters are experiencing. My favorite part of the book was when Martha uses the ocean water to write Olive's name on the ground where Olive once sat. My least favorite part was when Martha was told about the bet made between Jimmy and his brothers that ended up hurting and embarrassing Martha. This was very disappointing to me. I would recommend this book to young adults who enjoy reading fiction books that have emotion and romance in them because these things are found in this book. This book does not have very much adventure, suspense, or mystery so I do not recommend this book to readers who look for these characteristics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profanity!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I got this book for my son because it is a Newberry Award Winner.

After she accidentally kills her daughter, Evelyn is sparked by voices who tell her to kill every guest that stays at the motel in the future - and now the survivors who have noticed the many deaths occuring, must fight for their lives as the crazy old bat continues her rage on everyone. Complete with creepy atmosphere but essentially bad acting and a bad script, this film is slightly enjoyable for the main fact that it's so corny. Some of the acting is alright, most notably from Major Brock I believe it is, who plays Crenshaw. It's extremely bad, but very funny and sometimes very creepy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the?","review":"So they call this a horror movie do they?

After this, she opens up her own little motel where she is at full insanity and begins hiding out underneath the floors and coming up to hack every guests.This movie is too long and boring. The acting is terrible, which I expected because the cast members have never been heard of.The story is weak and I'd say that this movie is just plain [junk].Trust me, go rent a POLTERGEIST movie. This movie is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"And get my ass killed by some old crazy white woman?!\\"","review":"Where are the mountains at? This film is called MOUNTAINTOP MOTEL MASSACRE but yet there are no mountains, the \\"motel\\" appears to be nothing but some shacks in the woods and I had no idea a body count of seven equaled a massacre. But then again MOUNTAINTOP MOTEL MASSACRE is a little more eye-catching than WOODED SHACK INCIDENT.Not the worst slasher movie of all time I give that honor to the agonizing AX'EM, but not the best either more like firmly in the middle or maybe a little higher if you find a frail old woman you could kill with one punch to be scary.For slasher completist or the very bored only, no nudity, little blood, no scares and mediocre filmmaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Seventies, very Long, very something...","review":"I have mixed feelings after watching this movie. I like it but not as much as other 80's drive-in exploitation. I can't help but feel that it feels like an incomplete movie with a non-ending that implies that the daughter who is killed at the beginning is haunting the motel. The movie feels very inconclusive and from the beggining you never get a good idea of what the hell the daughter is about anyway. Except for maybe that she is obviously practicing witchcraft of some sort. The old woman who does all the killing is just not bizarre enough for my tastes. She should have been a real freak. Her idea of tortuing her guests by putting rats in their rooms is kinda weak. This film is fun but it's not that fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real chiller from the 80's!","review":"Although it is not the best technically made movie, the setting and the plot is so lurid it makes it really scary, especially on a rainy night. The characters provide creepiness and at times corny humor that is reminiscent of a 70's B-movie. Five stars for the effect that it creates which is mysterious,eerie,and a touch of campy humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"doll book","review":"Very helpful book - have really been enjoying this book as I have wanted this book for years, finally got it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"doll value research","review":"Extremely disappointed with this book.

Since Jari's gone, most people were afraid to hear what they sounded like in later releases. While not a masterpiece like Iron, Dragonheads holds its own. Although only half of it is new material, they re-recorded tracks were done here for a reason. The songs Warrior's Quest and White Storm, done by Jari and Toivonen some time back, fit in perfectly with the mood and fell of this album. This Ensiferum is slower, but still maintains the power and folk spin it had. Kalevala melody is an excelent addition, which goes right into the re-recorded song White storm, which is song quite nicely by the new guy, Petri Lindroos. Dragonheads has to be the best song on the album, and evoks a nice, nordic feel (even though the Finns were never Vikings, but hey) Overall is it a nice and worthy addition to the Ensiferum catalogue, and is enjoyable from the first to last song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album. . .

Not as good as \\"Seven Eyes, Seven Horns\\" but it's certainly worth it for classic tracks like \\"Nightwork\\", \\"So Intelligent\\", \\"Macroscope\\" and \\"Terrorworks\\".The only problem is some of the songs seem to have been transfered from someone's old Tonemaster cassette tapes. Sun Large Records went to enough trouble to offer this long overdue release in a handsome package, they could have given us a decent mix-down as well.

This book definitely has some beautiful pages and ideas, but potential purchasers should be aware that while the book is loosely broken up into chapters based on popular products/ techniques with ideas for beginners, intermediate and advanced crafters it is not an instructional book. This is common with many scrapbooking idea books.

They do not know when they will be available, they do not accept back orders, and the receptionist was very rude. What good is the dart board without darts that fit?

It was the text chosen by my college for a class in Algorithm Development. My excitement quickly turned to disdain after reading a few chapters. Theory and performance data are covered very extensively, and for that, I applaud the writers. But what is missing for me is practical examples of where you would use the algorithms presented! Try as I might, I couldn't find any real-world examples for any of the algorithms. Maybe I learn differently than everybody else, but examples go a LONG way in helping me understand things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Fit","review":"These things are designed specifically for my microphone so I was glad that it fit PERFECTLY! The set screw is a little annoying because you need to have a little screw driver to tighten it. This is important. If you just slip it over the mic and tell everyone you set the screw, you will need to buy a new wind screen because it will fall off as soon as someone brushes up against it and some one (probably the drummer) will step all over it and tear the foam. Also, you can't set the screw with a kitchen knife or a guitar pick so you are really going to have to have a tiny screwdriver handy. My microphone will not fit in its foam travel case with the wind screen on it so I really need to find out a way to have a tiny screw driver within arms reach at all times or else the mic with the wind screen won't travel with the other mics and it will get lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"How-To\\" of graphics texts","review":"When I bought this book on a coworker's reccomendation, I was initially disappointed that it lacked the mathematical sophistication of Foley/Van Dam or of Glassner's books.

If you're looking for deep insight into graphics research problems I'd reccomend one of the two other books mentioned above (\\"Computer Graphics\\" by Foley and Van Dam or \\"Principles of Digital Image Synthesis\\" by Glassner), but if you want a straightforward plain-English explanation of some real-time graphics topic, this book is probably your best bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introductory book!","review":"This is actually a good book, though it does not provide a \\"step by step\\" introduction, but more of a coarse overview of various topics. There's a small revision of mathematical basics, but I recommend you buy a complimentary book like Roger's \\"Mathematical Elements for Computer Graphics\\" to fill the gap if you're not mathematically liberate.Actually one of the key features is the large bibliography with references to tons of books, papers and websites.I recommend this book to everyone new to the topic, as it really helps to get a foot in the door and provides a great overview of various 3D-related topics, plus many links to further resources. Though it lacks the necessary details to directly turn everything into code, it shows you which techniques are available and where to learn about them.Definetely recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"I just purchased this book recently because of all the reviews.

This one left me cold, mostly because neither the hero nor heroine is a particularly likeable character. Nick spends the majority of the book as the lover of another woman, and those scenes are far better written than the one love scene he has with Kay near the very end of the book. That is not my idea of \\"romance\\". Kay is truly a bible-thumping harpy who does nothing to endear herself to the hero until a very rapid fall from grace that makes a mockery of all the religious piety she had been preaching. I just did not care about these two, but it earns an extra star for interesting secondary characters. Please don't read this one as your first by this author, because her others are so much better.

However, I didn't find the reading material any more interesting than what you'd find in a beginning or intermediate Spanish textbook. After spending a little bit of time with this book, I decided that it just wasn't my cup of tea.

I like to test my ability by reading news in Spanish or my personal favorite, People en Espanol!My only complaint would be that this book is someone geared for someone learning Spanish from Spain. Some of the words and the inclusion of the vosotros tense are a bit irrelevant to my needs, but overall this book is amazing.Tip: I find it helpful to read aloud.

The book itself was focused on using the Tarot in relationship issues, in which it certainly excels. However, it can be used for so much more, something this book does not touch upon. The approach to reading the cards seemed somewhat flippant, and more suited for someone with just a passing interest in learning how they work.

Anyway, Arthur Dent, the Everyman, and Ford Perfect, the flaky Alien, are at it again. Not a lot of humour in this one.

Though like the otherfour Hitchhiker's novels it focuses on the amusingly dulllife of Briton-turned-space-traveller Arthur Dent and hisstreetwise friend Ford Prefect, Mostly Harmless alsoincludes Adams' ideas on such subjects as dimentionalmechanics. Also surprising is the fact that, unlike manyof his other books, Mostly Harmless seems to have a trueending, raising questions about future novels in the series.All in all, Mostly Harmless is an excellent showcase of Adams'writing talent.

In that I was successful.It had been a while since reading the other four books, so they were not on my mind and in fact I worried about forgetting minor plot points and whether that would affect my enjoyment.I needn't have worried. There was nothing enjoyable about Mostly Harmless. I was overwhelmed by a sense of bitterness coming from the prose, found myself wondering, \\"Does he even *like* these characters?\\"It struck me as the work of a man who hated what he was doing and wanted to kill it in the most complete and irrevocable way possible.Two stars for occassional flashes of the non-bitter Adams."},{"rating":"2","title":"The end of the series.","review":"This book was written to provoke those who wanted Adams to continue the trilogy but I loved it.

Aurthor fumbles around differant planet earths chasing Random and the threat to the HGTTG with Ford Prefect. It has all the same Adams humor as the rest of the series even though its not as spectacular as the first 3 books there are still some great moments.

What happened to Fenchurch and why didn't Arthur care more about what happened to her? What happened to Zaphod? Colin the robot? What is the question to the answer 42? What was Fenchurch's idea that would solve the world's problems? What was the point to the people on Rupert?

The original Hitchhicker's guide was awesome. My mom hates Sci-Fi and even she picked that one up. \\"Mostly Harmless\\", though, is something entirely different. I guess that Adams should have stopped with the series after \\"So long and thanks for all the fish\\". The first parts with Ford Prefect and his exploits with Collin the security robot were rather good, but after he met up with Arthur Dent again things took a turn for the worst, although things had alread gone bad after Trillian and Arthurs daughter showed up. In the main part of the book the great, typical Adams sense of humor is replaced by a weak attempt to write a semi-serious(family) drama with random outburst of rather corny jokes.In short: this novel is a greater disaster than the final destrucion of planet/supercomputer Earth woul be.

It's as if he (Adams) got upset at himself for having written a book in which Arthur finds love.But then Arthur finds he has a teenage daughter who's feeling lost and unloved, so maybe love has a chance after all? No. [Spoiler alert] The daughter's last action in life is to try to shoot Arthur, and to accidentally kill an innocent bystander, and then, as she realizes she's murdered someone, the world ends -- not just the one, but all possible Earths.

Grade: A"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't forget your towel!","review":"Like its predecessors in the \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" series, \\"Mostly Harmless\\" is a very quick and easy read. Douglas Adams' writing style is light and entertaining, containing just enough words to let you know what's going on, rather than going on and on describing each and every detail. In this way, the story flows along quite nicely. While the beginning of the story did tend to drag on a bit, once it picked up, I found it to be very engaging and amusing. The character development of Arthur and Trillian -- both going a little mad at not being able to return to Earth -- along with their surprise daughter Random, is at once hilarious and heart-warming. The supporting details in this installment meshed flawlessly with those in the previous Hitchhiker books, which in my mind produced a story that was both nonsensical and yet made perfect sense at the same time. Don't forget to bring your towel, and if anyone asks you what the meaning of life is, it's still 42!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Harmless at all - almost retroactively ruins the series!","review":"When I finished this book, my first reaction was that I wish it had never been written. It seemed to me that Adams was simply sick of the characters, and had to real desire to write this book. He took out his frustration on the characters and the readers. What's worse, I don't think I'll ever be able to enjoy the previous 4 books (yes, I very much liked \\"So Long...\\") the same way again, knowing where the series is heading. My advice would be, if you really liked the first 4, don't read this one. I grew up with the Hitchhikers' series, but now when I think about the books, the first thought that comes to mind is how awful \\"Mostly Harmless\\" is. I'm hoping that someday Adams will write a new HH book, one he WANTS to write, and give the series the ending it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book where even the author seems to have lost the plot.","review":"I am a huge fan of the other four Hitch Hiker books and was first in line to buy this book when it first came on sale. However I soon discovered that the origional books were very far removed from Mostly Harmless both by syle and humour. Occasionally during the origional series, most notably in The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, the story would meander from the plot following what appeared to be the whim of the author. In Mostly Harmless the entire plot seems to be an ill thought out whim, a weak idea extended far beyond its humour or its point. It cashes in on the popularity of the series without giving any of its fans credit for being able to spot bad writing when they see it. Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A not-so-fond farewell to a classic series","review":"The Hitchhiker's \\"Trilogy\\" (as Adams wryly likes to put it) comes to an end in this fifth installment in the adventures of earthman Arthur Dent. Although not as thin on laughs as its predecessor, \\"So Long and Thanks for All the Fish,\\" this book doesn't have the nonstop hilarity that made Adams a bestselling author. My favorite gag in the book centered on the Grebulons, a group of aliens that illustrates the evils of excessive television viewing. Still, I felt that the book mostly limped along, finally reaching a dreary end. I would have expected a series that has given readers so many laughs over the years to have either a funny or a poignant conclusion, but this tale has neither. It felt as though Adams was too tired of writing about his band of interstellar hitchhikers to give them the denouement that they deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Liked It Better Than The Last Two","review":"I made the mistake of reading other people's online reviews for this book after I had bought it but before I started reading it. I almost put it aside for fear that it would be as disappointing as so many readers have said it is. However, I have to disagree. This is a pretty darn good book. I LOVED the first two books in the series and really think that Adams should have just stopped there. The third and fourth books were, in my humble opinion, alright but not nearly as good. The whole thing with cricket in the third book just got on my nerves and the fourth book just didn't bring the closure that I craved. I thought that this book came much closer to to the flavor of the first two books and I personally did find the closure to the story in this book that I longed for. Recommended by me....as if you care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entirely Awful","review":"I loved the first four books of the 'trilogy', but was absolutely floored by how awful this book is. I didn't just loathe the unbelievably bleak ending, the entire thing was completely unfunny from start to finish. At the end I had no idea why I had just wasted my time on this pile of excrement laughingly called a '5th book' of one of my favorite series of all time. The book never elicited anything more than a mild chuckle, if that, and hours of frustration at how annoying Random is and watching a funny author waste his talent. This book is a HUGE disappointment and a waste of ink. I wish Adams had never bothered publishing this crap, just scrapped it and started over with something actually funny.I haven't read Book 6, but I'm curious as to whether the new guy can capture the tone of the GOOD Hitchhiker's books and avoid the tone of this one. Avoid this book like it's the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short of Magical","review":"There was a connection that Arthur Dent made with his readers that carried one seamlessly through the first four books. The state of temporary immortality that he reaches in this book simply makes him less interesting.The appeal of the Hitchhiker series was always the conflict of normalcy and the extraordinary (like trying to get a spaceship to synthesize tea). This book just didn't find the right balance and the writing in this book gave off the general feeling that you might get from an unsatisfied sexual partner - that they are simply doing what they can to make the event end without hurting your feelings. This is the feeling I got from Adams' novel and it was all the more terrible because I always loved Adams.This book is not a fit end to the man's career. If you feel as though you have to read this to finish the series then please read the Dirk Gently books afterwards (even if you've already read them)."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are a fan, DON'T read this book","review":"I tore through the first four books, and couldn't wait to read the fith and final book. Afterwords, I kinda with I hadn't. It seems tacked on, almost as if it was written without regard for the story up to that point. It lacks much of the humor and sensitivity of the first four. I'll just say it: I did not like this book one bit.For one thing, it was written in such a manner that it was hard to follow. And yes, I do like happy endings, and this book does not have one. Plus, it doesn't follow with the other books. We all already know that Earthers did not evolve on the planet, and that the Earth was replaced. So why would the HHGTG still say \\"Mostly harmless\\", instead of Ford's long-winded review of the planet? Lots of things in this book might make you think that it was written out of a desperate need for money, or by somebody else.If you love the series as much as I do, just skip this book. It is a disappointing end to a wonderful \\"trilogy.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Please pretend this book was never written.","review":"I have long been a fan of the Hitchhikers series as they are comic genius. The book Mostly Harmless, however, should never have come about. It is frustration at its peak. After reading this book I vowed to never read another Douglas Adams book again (not as though he got around to writing any more). This book contains nothing that resembles a story line and never gets past the character development stage. I happened to go to a talk he gave at the University of Texas a few years ago and he was asked about the ending of the Mostly Harmless and his excuse was that the hardest part of writing a new book is getting everyone back together after you scatter them to the ends of the universe in the previous book so this was his answer. If you ask me he wrote this book to pay off his new Porsche and cheat his fans. Go ahead and read the first 4 as they make up a great story by themselves but don't waste your time reading this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of a conclusion...","review":"I loved the Hitchhiker's Guide--great combination of irreverent sci-fi humor and Monty-Python-esque quirkiness. I found myself laughing aloud as I read. Restaurant was similarly rollicking humor. But as the series progressed (and the books got thinner page-wise), it feels like Mr. Adams ran out of material or energy. \\"Mostly Harmless\\" is amusing at times, and there are flashes of the previous humor, where seeming tangential or trivial events are woven together with great imagination. But overall, this piece is disjointed and meandering. Those \\"laugh out loud\\" moments came less and less often. Even the villains are neither menacing nor silly, and the conclusion is totally unsatisfying. Unless you're someone who has a compelling need need to finish a literary series (see Frank Herbert's Dune series), I would recommend sticking with the first few books. You'll be left with better memories of Mr. Adams's wit and perspicacity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Harmless is mostly pointless.","review":"This is a book only for rabid fans of the Trilogy. Adams was obviously tired of the whole feckless Hitchhiker gang and used this last opus to unceremoniously dispose of them. While flashes of the old wit crop up here and there most of the book makes no sense until the end. And at the end you see the whole purpose of the plot line was contrived to vaporize the protagonists. It can best be compared to the second book, which ended on a dark note also. The second book at least had the saving grace of a lighter sense of humor. The fifth book's end is unremittingly black and will leave most fans enraged."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Hitchhiker\\" fans can't afford to read this book","review":"If you're a fan of the \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" series, this is a book you can't afford to read. It will ruin what would otherwise be fond memories of a wonderful series.\\"Hitchhiker\\" is one of the most tightly-woven stories ever written. Sometimes you'll only get a joke when you read the next book. The thought and love Douglas Adams put into the series are quite evident.With this travesty, however, one gets the feeling that his heart just wasn't in it. Like someone else said, you can almost hear him saying, \\"there, here's your damn book, now leave me alone\\".The whole tone of the series, of British melancholy humour, is simply absent. It's just depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What character development?","review":"It's really quite simple: with \\"Mostly Harmless,\\" Mr. Adams took all the charcater development in the first 4 novels (if you think there wasn't any, read them more carefully) and threw it out the window. This book reads like a tired Hollywood movie sequel (Police Academy XX). Sad, but what can one do? Enjoy all his other books. Avoid this one like 3-day old salmon mousse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely good reading","review":"I haven't specialised to DA in terms of science fiction but rather read everything everytime without any prejudices (atleast in my opinion :) ) and as much as others claim (well, atleast some people do, and they have right for their opinion, as do I) it isn't as good as the others or that it actually is a flop, I must disagree, for if it hadn't been written there would have been lots of information that would have gone without explanation. The books ending seems abrupt but on the other hand, there had been hints towards the ending what it would be like. So this book kind of a fills in some blind spots and sums it all up and therefore I recommend you read it too if you have read the others. All in all once again a great book from DA for readers pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Douglas Adams: \\"He's just this guy, you know?\\"","review":"Sure, _Mostly Harmless_ isn't the same as the original trilogy. And yes it is substancially darker. The ending is abrupt to say the least. But don't take it personally; read it as a conclusion. There are lots of funny bits (like the Elvis sighting: loved it!) to keep things moving along. We asked for another book, we got one. It's not the greatest of Adams' works, but it is an amusing conclusion to a greatly expanded trilogy. I find its darkness and abruptness rather fitting. Certainly worth looking at, for Hitchhiker fans. (How can you NOT read the final installment, no matter how \\"bad\\" people say it is?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Adams, I am disappointed!","review":"What happened? The book was superb all of the way through. I read this book in one day and loved every minute, until the end that is. Everyone dies! What is going on here? All the great characters we have come to know and love are just finished off. It saddens me greatly that Douglas Adams has decided to quit writing Hitchhikers' Guide books. This kind of thing is terrible to do to science fiction fans. Just imagine if Gene Roddenberry had decided to say, \\"Forget it!\\" in the middle of his Star Trek career. Is this any way to treat your fans?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent conclusion to a masterful trilogy","review":"Despite all the people who seem to think this book is awful, I have to say I loved it. I think that the last chapter is a very good conclusion to the trilogy. To those who stupidly wish that the trilogy would go on and on, all I can do is point to SLATFATF, the lowpoint of the trilogy. A series can only go on so long, and then it has to end. If the author is forced to keep producing, either he will produce a load of crap, or he will start repeating things.There was a danger of this happening in the Trilogy, even Douglas Adams can only take a plot so far. This one had been milked for all it was worth and needed to end. Adams found and ending, that fit the nature of the trilogy and so ended the thing perfectly. I for one am glad that Adams to pull out before things got much worse, and frankly I loved the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love humor ,,,,,adams you complete me","review":"this book had me laughing all the way through, being 16 humor is good for the soul you know.for some reason i read htis book before any other of the 5 in the hitchhikers series, but i still understood most of it....and it was funny. the best parts in this book include descriptions of ford perfects adventures to the hitchhiker's guide publishing building, and the introduction of random to her father....trust me when you read it you will understand....so douglas adams i salute you with the greatest respect...because your far better than this one author named joshua harris that writes books about being gay"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slapstick, not wit... blah","review":"I read HHGG many years ago, but never got around to Mostly Harmless when it came out. I saw it at the library the other day, and knew I had a quest to finish. Unfortunate.Instead of the cutting wit of the first stories, we get Jerry Lewis-esque slapstick, and Dr Seuss-like silly word play. The plot rambles and bumbles, but unlike the comedic diversions of its predecessors MH just fades away into more nothingness.MH gives us a smile here and a chuckle there, but after a short period of time I simply won't remember anything in particular about Book 5 - with the possible exception of the ending. That was a surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vastly confusing blank canvase","review":"The ending had my heart racing and mind reeling. But after the initial shock of it. Came a barrage of questions, then a brainstorm(s). Now this may not have been his final book, but a original ending. The Salmon Of Doubt was not continued, and may have lead to a different or continuing conclusion. But over all, this is a great ending, that will have you re-reading almost every third paragraph. A must to complete the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mortly Harmless not so harmless after all.","review":"After reading all the reviews of other people and reading the book I think that some of you might have a little misjudged the book. It does have its' problems such as not as many characters and I also noticed that the book is not as adventurous as some of the others. If you're not a real fan of these boooks you probably will be better off not buying Mortly Harmless but if you're the kind of person that likes The hitchhiker's books then i would strongly recommend to read this one also. It's plot can sometimes be lost but it still is fun to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"I'm amazed my the number of people who either love this book blindly because it's Douglas Adams or hate it because of the downer ending. I have no problem with downer endings. Unfortunately the book was simply not very good. Douglas Adams is past his prime. He should take up painting or golf."},{"rating":"1","title":"really harmless","review":"Even though The Hitchhiker's storylines caracterize themselves for not being too coherent, which is probably one of its strong points, Mostly Harmless fails to achieve a \\"proportionate\\" incoherence with the other Hitchhiker's books. This novel is too far detached from the earlier books. Arthur Dent seems like Charlie Brown in the sense that he always loses on this one, and the one time that he wins (Stavromula Beta) its in the end, and the ending of this book is by far the worst of all of the series' endings."},{"rating":"1","title":"The end is at hand - fortunately!","review":"I recall when this book came out that it was indicated by Mr. Adams that it was written in response to repeated demands for yet another story in the series. The fact that he was of the opinion that no more books should have been written and that this was undeniably the last one is clear through every page of the book. I personally own first editions of every one of his books, and I enjoyed them all. If you are completely insatiable and want to read more of his work, go ahead. If you think that \\"So Long and Thanks For All the Fish\\" was a great ending to the series and leaves all the characters where you want them, don't even look at this one! This is perhaps the most disappointing sequel since \\"Scarlett.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've stopped the trilogy at 4","review":"It's a long fall when something so anticipated turns out to be so disappointing. After a very charming and wonderful ending to the series (So, Long and Thanks ...) Adams seems to just suddenly grab his characters and put them through an adventure that neither he nor they want very much to go through. The whimsy is forced and the humor is tired. Read the 1st four. Then, read Mostly Harmless at your own peril."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly harmless is \\"mostly harmless\\" - don't bother.","review":"I was a fan of the \\"original\\" trilogy, but it appears that Mr. Adams has went to the well once too many times. There's no spark and hardly any new insight in this book. It was almost a chore wading through the book to find out what happened to our heroes (and heroine) that we loved in the first three books. It was a very disappointing way to end the series"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Useless","review":"The series started off so well, it's sad to see it end so badly. This book is just a collection of random events, there really isn't a plot. None of the questions raised throughout the series are answered.The first book was great, I wish I had stopped there."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are only four books in the Hitchiker saga.","review":"Reality, friends, is what you and I make of it. So I'm going to make a solemn declaration: This book does not exist. The Hitchiker series ended with \\"So Long and Thanks for All the Fish,\\" a bright, funny, well-written book.It did not end with \\"Mostly Harmless,\\" which is the literary equivalent of an old man shouting \\"Here! Here's your darn book! Now leave me alone!\\" Adams is obviously tired of the series, and this book amounts to a middle finger to fans who begged for more. It's not funny, it's not smart, it's not that much fun to read. It doesn't take the series in any new directions; it exists only to finally shut up people who want another chapter in a finished series.It's not, all in all, a horrible book, just a monstrously disappointing one. Believe it with me, and we can make it so: SLATFATF was the last. There are only four. There are only four."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Harmless, Mostly Bites","review":"This book is by far the worst of the series. The plot is weak and cobbled together. The characters are out of character. While reading it, one gets the feeling the adams is wringing the last dollar he can get out of his masterpiece series. Buy one the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate that the 'trilogy' I loved so much ended like this.","review":"In many ways this book is just as interesting as previous books in the series. Adams humor is in tact and will have you snickering fairly often.The main problem is that of the overall plot. It is unsatisfying and pessamistic. Not just the ending. Tricia Mcmillian or Trillan turns from being a likable and symathetic character to somone who uses people and makes them clean up her mess. It is a heartbeakingly unfit end to a series I have such fondness for. This is compounded by the fact that the late Douglas Adams wished to write a sixth book after this one but never got around to it.At this point it is better to consider the fourth book the final guide since it has such a satisfyingly beautiful end. For those who love the works of Adams should read it anyway, since it is well... a douglas adams book. Just dont be to dissapointed when you are dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth checking out of the library","review":"The first three Hitchhikers books are probably the most hilarious books I have ever read. The fourth, _So Long and Thanks for all the Fish_ was a great disappointment, and lacked the brilliant spark of the first three. _Mostly Harmless_ is mean spirited and largely devoid of humor. I think Adams not only has lost interest in these books, but has lost his muse. Sad to see him writing such junk as _Mostly_, I would presume just for the money. I felt cheated for buying this book, and I cannot even recommend checking it out of the library, as surely your time must be worth something"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved By A Multitude Of Friends","review":"CHALLENGE TO LASSIE is a fairly entertaining family film about Lassie's loyalty to her master even after the latter's death.

I won't go on and on, since other reviewers have added some helpful comments. However, this is a great collection of some music that one doesn't hear on the typical radio station."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Orange Sky in the Garden State...","review":"I bought this CD before seeing the movie, mainly because of the buzz I was hearing about artists The Shins, Frou Frou, and Zero 7.Gotta say I loved it from the first listen, and the Coldplay gem kicking the whole experience off didn't hurt. This is a great atmospheric soundtrack, maybe one of the best I've ever bought.Then I rented the movie, it made the music even more powerful and inspiring. Replaying the movie scenes in my mind as I listen brings great enjoyment. One disappointment, there's about 5 seconds of Alexi Murdoch's 'Orange Sky' during the movie and it didn't make the soundtrack. I would sacrifice Bonnie Summerville's 'Winding Road' (played over the credits) for Alexi's song in a heartbeat on the soundtrack, but that would be the only thing I would change.This is a great disc and if you get it for the listed $9.99 you've scored a great work of artistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"This soundtrack made the movie! What a collection of songs","review":"This is the best soundtrack CD I have ever heard in my life. The songs on this CD just flow so smoothly together it is amazing. When I watched the movie Garden State I was so impressed by the sounds of the soundtrack I had to rush out and buy it even though I had only previously listened to Simon and Garfunkel, Remy Zero and Coldplay. Zero 7, The Shins and others on the album that I had never heard of are amazing and I will rush out and get the rest of their stuff the first chance I get.I recommend this highly!."},{"rating":"2","title":"As refreshing, relaxing, and moving as the movie","review":"Everything about this soundtrack screams the movie, and in turn, the brilliance of Zach Braff (who knew?).As not only the writer, director, and star of \\"Garden State,\\" he was also the soundtrack executive producer, and he did good for the fourth time.This delightfully moody collection of songs is perfect, and for someone who had heard of very few bands on this soundtrack, it has definitely opened my eyes.Of course, after seeing the movie the soundtrack fits, but this collection of music will appease near anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good complitation.","review":"Over all this sound track is very good. the shins are amazing and everything fit the movie very well. the only thing i had a problem with was that they used a cover of the postal service's \\"such great heights\\". i believe that the original is much better and i really enjoy the postal service. but other than that i think its a great sound track"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pitch-perfect Soundtrack","review":"Zach Braff sets himself up as the next generation's Woody Allen, and it's a testimony to his writing/directing skills that his first film is his \\"Annie Hall\\". \\"Garden State\\" succeeds both as an often very funny look at his generation (and his parents' generation; i.e., mine) as well as a sweet and realistic love story. And he selected the perfect soundtrack for it: a moody, reflective collection of songs from some of the best alternative and \\"chillout\\" artists around today (Coldplay, The Shins, Zero 7, Iron and Wine, et al.), as well as classic artists like Simon and Garfunkel and Nick Drake. (Hmm... were Simon and Drake the original \\"shoegazers\\"?) It's a mellow, coherent collection that works very well outside of the context of the film, which will be remembered not only as a \\"sleeper\\" hit, but also one of the best films of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW - its all I've been able to say","review":"This is a great soundtrack. A great mix of awesome music that makes you smile when you remember what was happening in the movie to that song. And if you haven' seen the movie: GO WATCH IT!

Gave so much strength to the film. Impossible to get tired of listening to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sum is greater then it's parts","review":"This is one of the best CD's I have heard in a while. This CD proves that music is alive and well outside the world of pre-fabbed teeny-bop singers. It's refreshing to hear great musicians making great music and letting the music sell itself instead of a group of record execs telling us what we like and while we like it, drink a Coke, and talk to your friends on your AT&T; cell phone.My particular favorite track is \\"Such Great Heights\\" a moving song that proves a guy, a guitar, and some great lyrics can go a long way!If you love music, this CD must be in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dentist Music","review":"I suppose it's a tribute to Zach Braff's eye for scene and character that this lame music actually seemed pretty cool in Garden State. I remember it being very sweet and elegant and wonderful when I watched the movie.Yet upon buying the CD I'm mortified by the sheer tedium of the songs. It's not even one particular style, but many styles all conspiring to put the listener into a boredom-induced coma. Even \\"Break Down\\" by Frou Frou - which sounded so great in the trailers and the closing montage - sounds tired and worn. There's nothing else to that song and without the images of the movie in place, it falls.The rest of the pieces are odious. Coldplay isn't so bad on this particular CD, but Nick Drake, the Shins and Simon & Grafunkle work overtime to act all sentimental - so sentimental that you want to hit them on the heads with shovels and tell them to stop whining.This music has some good context, but hearing it without the movie just sours me."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite CD","review":"This is most definitely my favorite CD of all time (not to mention one of my favorite movies). This is such a great compilation of songs, and I like every single song on it, which is rare. This is a beautiful album to really listen to, but it's also a great mix to play in the background during a dinner party of other gathering of friends where you want great music but to still be able to talk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie Soundtrack I Own","review":"This is the best movie soundtrack I own that's not from a musical.

She was very interested but said that in school she learned that it was somehow wrong to be interested in her family history. She asked \\"Why don't they tesch this stuff in school?\\"Her comments sent me straight to Amazon to search for books on Irish American history. The Irish American Family Album provided a good introduction for my niece. The book is organized into brief selections highlighting people and events. It is a good introduction to the rich and often tragic history of a creative and determined people. Written in short chapters, with sidebars and first person accounts, the book provides interesting topics for additional exploration.

I had to wait until after the holidays to purchase this for my daughter. The advertisement made it seem so fun and easy to use. But in reality it's boring and a waste of money. I thought the child would be able to draw on the face and create a different look. It is really a tap and paste type deal. If the picture isn't in the correct spot the image will not turn out right.

My daughters set up a lamp which they used for illumination for the pictures, and this improved the image somewhat, but not nearly well enough, considering the price.I can't say I would buy this toy again if I could go back in time.

There were only 3 or 4 reviews, but they were positive. (first mistake) They must've been posted by the company. We went by the directions which were poorly stated, and tried everything to get a decent picture. The picture was so dark and blurry. The make-up part was uncontrollable so the eye-liner covered up the entire eyes. The hair styles were no better. In other words, the makeover never came even close to the photo that is represented on the advertised product. Luckily, I saved my receipt and returned the product to the store for a full refund. My daughter remembered another product by Radica that was a disappointment...funny how an 11 year old can remember a company's bad name, huh? It was the \\"Password Journal\\"...we returned it too a year or two ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"Unless they've updated this product and really overhauled it, don't buy it.

On the box it shows a clear picture of a girl's face. Ha!! My granddaughter and I took picture after picture in different lighting and nothing helped! The pictures were awful - nothing like the picture on the box. Dark, grainy image and when you put the make-up on the picture of your face on the screen it won't set where it should. Lipstick above the lips, etc. I hate for anyone else to waste money on this awful toy. It is not an inexpensive toy and it should work like the package says. False Advertising!

Once we figured it out, we had a blast. It's not meant to be a real makeover, but rather a fun time. We brought the toy to our friends house, where the 7 kids... ages 3 to 8 thought it was hilarious. They \\"made over\\" the dog & turned one of the 6 yr old boys into a \\"rock star\\". I only paid $40 versus the $120 advertised on this site. This is a great toy for a girly sleepover. The picture is grainy unless you get the lighting in the proper position. Electronic board games can cost more & usually need more than 1 person to play. A kid can play this alone. Relax & enjoy your childs creativity. It's better than kids just sitting there \\"zoned out\\" playing a Gameboy or Nintendo DS. This is a much more interactive toy. I would recommend it at the $40 price but not much higher"},{"rating":"1","title":"Digi needs a makeover","review":"I went from store to store to look for this product for a christmas present for my daughter.

The instructions included were a joke & I finally called the 800 number just to figure out how to do the photo part. The picture quality was horrible, but we still plugged on, hoping for it to get better. We did get a good laugh at the hair styles - it looked like a forest animal had taken up residence on the top of my daughter's head. The other options were so difficult to operate and produced results that were a joke. I think it would be better to give your daughter old school photos and a bunch of markers. We boxed this thing back up and took it back to Target for a full refund. This is an expensive toy, but even if the price dropped to $5.00, I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours of fun","review":"I just purchased this for Christmas for my 8 year old daughter. I pulled it out of the box to try it out and had fun playing with it for about an hour. The built in camera worked to take a decent picture - once I turned the light on. I had fun applying the different hair styles jewelry and makeup. I will say the directions were not really all that clear and I kind of had to playwith it to really figure out how to use it. It took 4 AA batteries so make sure you have them on hand at Christmas.I think my girls will really enjoy seeing themselves with all the wild and cute hairdo's and putting the makeup on themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks!","review":"I gave this to my daughter for Xmas and she told me then that she didn't like it, and it wound up in the closet.

I was hoping there would be a way to import our own photos but didn't see a way to do it.

I am trying to think of a worse movie which I have watched, but can't come up with anything.........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect for a Buddhist Temple","review":"Ok the title of my review may seem odd, but if you ever see this movie you will understand. I tried as a test of wills to watch this movie from beginning to end on at least 3 occassions and I found my self at some point or another contemplating the universe and life in general. I would then snap back to the real world and realize i had missed some half hour or so of the film. So if you are in need of sleep or want to contemplate the sound of one hand clapping this movie is for you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Dreck","review":"When this movie came out I was too young to see it, so I rented it last night and let me tell you, this movie is so bad it should be banned. I'm in a state of disbelief that an actor of Julia Roberts' caliber would agree to be a part of such a piece of crap! The only redeeming scene in this movie is when Tim Robbins says \\"Je suis mort. Ou est je suis?\\" in French, which doesn't make any sense so it's hilarious. Other than that, this is 2 hours of some of the biggest stars in the fashion world making fools of themselves, getting naked, and speaking an atrocious script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Altman!","review":"Anymore, when the name Robert Altman is raised, a bored lull enrapts the room--Pret-a-Porter is no exception. This time Altman takes the audience on a two-hour tour of the pretentiousness of the fashion industry. With no apparant plot, the all-star cast is reduced to small talk (a key element in any Altman film). The mediocre and sparsely placed comedic moments are not enough to keep the viewers attention for the duration of the film. The high point of the film came from Bassinger's deliberately bad southern accent as she narrates this tale of sick photographers, perverse fashion, and the effects alcohol has on two complete strangers."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Mess","review":"I saw this movie at the show years ago when it first came out. I wanted to demand my money back. What a rip-off. What Leonard Maltin says in his review is right on the button. This movie has no plot, no momentum, and no point to any of this. Robert Altman is supposed to be this great director. But this movie looks like a college film school student made a very amateurish film and had no idea where to go with it. Its really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ready To Wear","review":"WORST 133 MINUTES I'VE SPENT LATELY. IT HAD SUBTITLES, THAT DIDN'T STAY UP LONG ENOUGH, AND JUST A STUPIT MOVIE OVERALL.

And compared to something truly wonderful like Pans Labrynth it's pedestrian and cliched.I can't actually believe how many good reviews it got, which just goes to show that one mans meet is another mans poison! I found it very sickly and just too cloying for my tastes.The cast were great however (waste of a great cast IMO) - well except for Robin Williams who over acted commendably. Jonathon Rhys Myers was good and the child actor was amazing. Just a pity they had such a weak story to work with.If you fancy checking it out though i would say to do so, it;s not an offensive film and obviously a lot of people really love it.Oh and it has Alex O'Loughlin in it for about all of three minutes but he steals the damn film with those minutes and he's very, very, very pretty here. So yeah two stars for Alex. It would have been one otherwise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You're Kidding, Right?","review":"A preponderance of 5-star reviews for THIS? The state of the Union is worse than I thought.This is one of those movies that are so bad they're embarrassing to watch. At least outrageous clunkers like \\"Tough Guys Don't Dance\\" and \\"Mars Needs Women\\" are good for a laugh. This phony, complacent, overwrought dreck lacks even that redeeming value. If a cloying pastiche of clich��s like \\"August Rush\\" doesn't insult your intelligence, nothing will.Freddie Highmore is a talented child actor. If you're a fan, you'd do better to catch his performance in \\"Finding Neverland,\\" a film worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen","review":"So, so bad. Sort of a \\"Oliver Twist\\" - boy deprived of his rightful destiny, in this case musical genius; and his misadventures while \\"following the music\\". The film had so many plot holes that made it absolutely impossible to buy into the story. I never believed from the get go that the two musicians fell in love, that they could never have found each other earlier, that a baby could be born and given to an orphanage without the mother's consent or even knowing what really happended, etc. etc.The dialouge was insipid and contrived; the dialouge during the scene where the two musicians have their once in life time one night stand;actually made me cringe it was so melodramatic and stupid.This movie is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen because of it's pretentiousness while it actually insults the intelligence of its audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"August Rush","review":"This is one of the best movies I have seen in many years.

It encourages children to perceiver to develop their God-given talent in this case in the field of music. August Rush will inspire children to pursue their musical ability overlooking any kind of diffculties and problems they are faced with. I recommend this to parents with children who are incline in music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful film, great cast and message","review":"I finally had a chance to see this movie on blu-ray. As a music lover and believer in the power of music, for healing, catharsis, unity and many other powerful experiences and situations, I really enjoyed how the child attempted to speak to his \\"lost parents\\" and the parents to each other. The score of the film is itself very powerful and blended seemlessly in the story. The song lyrics sung by Jonathan Rhys Myers fit perfectly into the story, and the mom's face when she saw her son at the concert was priceless. This movie truly warms the heart, and is a great date movie, or an opportunity to remember the things that are important.

Make a list of cliches (make it long!) and see if this movie misses even one of them. It's nothing but cliches with some very good actors that should have protested having this bad a script. Oh, if you are wondering, the worst movie of all time is \\"You light up my Life.\\" If you saw that, this isn't quite that bad. I found myself sitting there saying \\"they're not going to...\\" and they always did. Seriously embarassing with some terrific music and terrific actors. Blame the script and the Director. Oh, and someone explain to me how Loren Mazel taught this kid to direct. The kid did a great job faking the guitar he couldn't play, but the conducting was beyond terrible. Walk outside and stare at a brick wall. It will be more enjoyable than August Rush!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality DVD","review":"I bought a previously viewed August Rush DVD and tried it in two different players.

First of all, I believe the child was insane. It's basically a twisted musical version of Oliver Twist. It's one of the strangest musical movies ever! something I care nothing about. It was infuriating how the boy kept missing his parents by just a little. Also, NOT RECCOMENDED FOR SMALLER CHILDREN, his \\"parents\\" got him doing something well, um,.........sexual. Half the movie was flash-backs and I do think they did them well, It's sooo easy to make flashbacks confusing.

It's about hopes, dreams, courage, and perseverance.I don't like that the premise for the story revolves around a one-night stand, but if you can ignore that and focus on the good- they boy having to live his life trying to believe he wasn't just abandoned (when so many others were and resent his positive attitude)- you'll enjoy it.Also, Robin Williams plays a good bad-guy. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for music lovers","review":"This movie has been clearly depicted on here by quite a few people so I will not take the time to go through every aspect of the plot. In general the movie is creative, the music really adds to the plot line, and the music itself is quite solid. In fact I also went back and purchased the soundtrack, something I do not do often.For music lovers this movie is perfect. It really can touch us on a deeply emotional level and gives us a new aspect at which to look or better yet where to listen for music. Sometimes it can happen in the most unusual circumstances.Overall this movie was fantastic. The acting was great, the plot was fantastic, and the music did not let you down one bit. If you are a bit of a rut this movie can definitely lift your spirits."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Liked It!","review":"I liked it.

A few faux pas on the playing scenes, but if you're not a seasoned musician, you'd never catch them.HOWEVER, the story was nothing more than warm, fuzzy, fluff. There were a lot of 'gaps' in the story and the realism was pretty lacking. I understand this wasn't intended to be a documentary or anything like that, and I wasn't looking for spoon-fed information, I was simply disappointed with the 'movie' as a whole. The acting side of things was pretty tragic. Robin Williams was good, in a disturbing way (due to the character), but the storyline and 'depth' in the other characters was pretty shallow.If you're looking for low-substance, warm, fuzzy, family film ... this one works well.If you are wanting something more 'real' or at least a sense of 'believable', then it's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple-minded story","review":"A friend recommended this movie. Foolishly, I bought it. It is such a simple-minded story. Fake fake fake. The dialog is fake too, and doesn't make sense at times (bad editing?).

It consists of a young boy, wandering around looking for his parents, meeting people who's characters are never developed, staring wide eyed at everything he comes across, then finding his parents.

In his pathological desire to find his biological parents, kid runs away form the orphanage and changes his name from Evan Taylor to August Rush. Before you know it, this kid can play every instrument in the universe, he is accepted at Juliard and composes a symphony for the Cetral Park public performance. And of course, it all ends up happy. There is no focus to this movie since it wants to cover too much. Story may be good for a book but it is too unbelievable for the movie. Acting is forced and feels fake at the time. Body doubles with guitar playing, etc. are too obvious. This movie is not for everyone. Do not expect too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie i've ever seen in my life...","review":"it's just unbearably cheesy. not in the way that disney films are so that adults can enjoy them. this is just awful. filled with cliches and bad 90s style music and horrible acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like an Oliver Twist remake","review":"O.k., here's my review, my short review. I don't recommend that you buy, nor rent this movie. It's too much like Oliver Twist, with a hint of Forest Gump. It's a love story none the less, but in every aspect, your typical Oliver Twist.

I have seen worse films but am struggling to name them !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TAKE IT WITH A TON OF SALT","review":"It's not like movies need to be 100% realistic and the fact is either you dig this type of fantasy or you don't. It's just hard to swallow August's Dad running +/- 23 blocks in half a song and ending up exactly 5 spots from his long lost love in crowd of thousands; August composing a whole concert in about 3 days; both his parents looking more like his older siblings; characters miraculous meeting around NYC as if it consisted of 2 square blocks and the insufferable Robin Williams yet again at his very worst.A must miss !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful movie","review":"August Rush looks like kind of a wacky movie from the jacket description. We were surprised at the refreshing humanity of it. The description talks about magic, but the greatest magic in it is love. It tells the story of a couple who is very talented musically. Their talent comes from a passion they feel toward the music they hear around them, including the music from each other. This passion leads to a pregnancy, wanted by the girl, but unwanted by her father. He's not a terrible villain. He wants the best for her,and leads her to believe that her baby died during birth. The baby is a pleasantly odd little boy who hears the music around him. To the joy of the bullies in the children's home,he believes that some of what he hears is the music of his mother and father calling to him. The story unfolds as he leaves the home to search for the music. What unfolds has an echo of Oliver Twist, but not. A wonderful movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern-day \\"Oliver Twist\\"","review":"Freddie Highmore as a guitar-playing Oliver, Robin Williams as Fagin, and even an Artful Dodger by the name of Arthur.

I had to turn it off at about the hour mark when the kid, upon getting his hands on a guitar for the first time, banged out music worthy of a skilled musician. Even used a piano style technique on the fretboard that would at least have gotten a nod from Eddie Van Halen. Please, give me a break. I get it. It's a fantasy. Maybe science fiction? Of course it takes hours of study and effort to get anything resembling music out of any instrument. Ok, maybe not a kazoo. I guess the sale of musical instruments will skyrocket now. If it left you with a warm and fuzzy feeling, I think that's great. Good luck when your child, expecting similar miraculous results, entertains you with their new electric guitar - or better yet, new violin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"Don't listen to harsh critics - this movie is a welcome reprieve from the violence and vulgarity which has saturated today's movie offerings.

After weeks of \\"No Country for Old Men, Micheal Clayton, Atonement, Into the Wild, and the Kite Runner\\", it was finally nice to come home from a stressful day and watch a movie that left me wiping my red eyes and feeling good inside. Too bad the academy was focused on dark films this year, because this should have gotten a nomination. Though some scenes might be emotionally tough for kids between 5-8, I still feel this is a great family film. By family film I mean kids can watch it and like it, but parents will be the ones who really enjoy it. Like many people have said here, put fairy tale in your head before you watch it, so your not like the few who say, \\"not believable\\". A beautiful, sweet, heartwarming film."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Rush!","review":"Loved every moment of it! Watched it on blu ray with surrond sound blasting!

I loved it, I simply loved it and I can't say it any clearer than that. I wanted to feel good, I wanted to feel joyful, I wanted to feel that magical something that I can't really explain and this movie gave it to me. The plot, the actors, the music, the journey is just right for me.Here it is nearly 1:00 a.m. and I am so alert. Really I feel energized with that kind of \\"you can do it\\" energy. I love when a movie gives me something positive. It's like a sort of nourishment.I've just finished watching this movie and I feel like I can watch it all over again. I am uplifted, energized, hopeful, creative, and just filled with something that is inspiring and encouraging. For some, what I say will sound hokey or whatever, but hokey people like me love this kind of movie. The kind that is alright to share with the entire family. Gosh, did this movie make me feel great. I simply loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all time favorite","review":"Even tho there are reviewers who down the movie, it continues to be one I will watch over and over (and over). A couple parts could be scarey for younger children (treatment by fellow orphans and Robin Willams as Wizard) and I seriously doubt if they would understand the story anyway.I do enjoy Freddy Hightower (Finding Neverland). Found Kerri Russel to be a breath of fresh air. Loved the music!True, the story line is highly improbable, but it will remain a favorite and, once again, I do have to rebuy it since I can't find my copy. Most likely loaned it to someone for their viewing pleasure!Not a chick flick, but a good family film.

For a good night in, grab some popcorn and feel the music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Misunderstood Marvel","review":"So many reviews have focused on the \\"Oliver Twist\\" subplot to this film and failed to see the genius in the true structure. August Rush is a clever inversion of classic Anastasia tales, where it is the parents, not the wayward child, who need to be reminded of whom they were meant to be. On a spiritual level, this film has kinship to the legends of the reincarnation of the Buddha and the Christian emphasis on the importance of children in being able to perceive the heavenly realms. Little Evan-August is music incarnate who seeks not only to restore his wayward parents, but to harmonize a discordant creation. And the film as well as it's protagonist succeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great BLU-RAY","review":"This review is for the blu-ray edition of August Rush. It is a very good feel-good movie with 4.5/5.0 excellent picture and 4.0/5.0 sound quality. I bought it used here for $10.51 and it was well worth it. With Legend of the Waterhorse, Cars, and Ratatolliu this will join our collection of family friendly movies. I must admit though all of the acting was superb except Robin Williams.

The magic qualities it has to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless and Endearing Story to Watch Again","review":"Evan aka August is an orphan boy gifted with musical talents. He hears musical tones in ordinary noises all around him and feels it in his bones. This is a delightful story about how he finds his parents, two musically gifted people, who don't know his existence. Aside from the great soundtrack, the juxtaposing of classical cello and electric guitar, and the riffs Evan/August creates on his guitar, there is also the poignant searching of Evan for his parents, and later his mother for him, and his father for his mother. The three souls are joined and connected through music. This is definitely a movie that you can watch over and over again, because of the freshness of the music, and rooting for the orphan to find his parents despite his circumstances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely!","review":"OK, I fell for it hook, line, and sinker.

He is very, very good. As with most films these days, it could have been edited a little tighter, but otherwise -- let your cynicism go and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"August Rush","review":"This is an amazing movie and a must in every musical family's collection.

The one semi-literate guy in the whole movie (i.e. the whole world) is going to save the human race? Uh-huh. Because even though he's only read the one book \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Fin\\" he is certain that he can tap into his dead father's scientific leanings to create more of the yellow powder that will stop the zombie disease from spreading.

Leslie opens the reader's eyes to the opportunity that exists in all companies, which is their people. The book presents the science of behavior as a key to motivating and enabling people toward the successful execution of the company's goals as well as their own personal success. It became clear that the \\"soft side\\" of business is where much of the opportunity exists for leaders in today's competitive marketplace. The author presents an understanding of behavioral science with real examples which allows the reader to understand how it could positively impact their world.

But, from a few smaller projects I've done and used the Kreg pocket hole jig. It does greatly speed up building things because you don't loose hours clamping and gluing up parts and waiting for the glue to try before starting the next section.With the Kreg jig, you simple drill the pocket holes, add some glue to certain parts and screw it together. The only draw back to this video format is they tell you about the design as they build it.

In high school I dated a girl in Saugus and another in Swampscott and got to know these cities also. At the time I did not know that they were originally part of Lynn. Reading about these early places brought back many memories. At age 79, things have changed a lot since my days in Lynn.

I like the price and the size, but has enough drawbacks that I'm going to return it. First, the FAQ says that it will hold 15 high quality pictures. I couldn't get more than 5 on my camera. No problem, you say, add a CF card. The FAQ states that the camera will take 128mb CF cards, but not in my camera. When I finally got a response from their tech support, they could not provide a solution other than to buy the iClick brand 32mb CF.... I responded asked for more information, like, \\"Which CF 128mb card WILL work in your camera?\\", and haven't received a reply. Photo quality? I liked the outdoor photos and most of the indoor photos looked good. Some looked a little mottled, but I could have lived with that if the camera would hold more than 5 photos! I guess I'll look for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, DO NOT BUY.","review":"I recently bought this item, and, needless to say, I am extremely displeased.1. Bad quality pictures. Pictures come out fuzzy and dark without flash, and with flash, all you see is a giant patch of white as the result.2. Eats power. My batteries died out after a couple shots- totally new batteries, too.3. Size. It's not as easy to carry around as they say. It doesn't really fit into your pocket, and it's pretty thick.4. Memory. For me, it held about 6-10 photos. A disposable digital camera is even less expensive than this, and it probably takes more pictures, and better pictures too.All in all, a bad choice for a camera.

For teenagers in pain everywhere, there's COLLEGE MATCH. This balanced and clear book takes one through a step-by-step process of discovering your interests and what you want in a college, then recommending how to go about finding those colleges and keeping multiple applications straight. (My favorite suggestion: Keep a wall chart with important dates (when to ask for an application, early decision, regular decision, postmark dates) for the colleges you want to apply to. I'm already planning the ritual sacrifice of yet another room in my house to the ubiquitous College Search.)

These are flexible enough that i can install them just by squeezing, which is a major plus in my mind.

I have to agree with some earlier reviews that the author spends too much time telling and not enough showing. I liked the premise of Marian trying to control her own destiny and enlisting Robin Hood's aid in doing so, but somehow their actions fell flat. It seemed like all of the action oriented things happened off camera. Marian spends her time telling us about them, not really involved with them until the end.Overall, I'd give the book 2.5 stars.Anyone interested in an engrossing Maid Marian story might like to try Lady of the Forest by Jennifer Roberson. I read it in one night. The sequel Lady of Sherwood was not quite as involving, but still a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"I loved this book!

Hoy","review":"I really wanted to love this novel - the premise has so much potential. Unfortunately, it was little more than fluff. The story in the hands of Elsa Watson is told rather than shown, giving the reader no opportunity to be immersed in the drama. While Ms. Watson is a capable enough writer, she does not know how to pull a reader in. In the hands of a more experienced novelist, Phillipa Gregory, for example, Maid Marian would have been incredible. I wanted a great summer novel. What I got instead was a ho-hum treatment that missed countless opportunities to be terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maid Marian: A Feminist Heroine","review":"Charming and well written! Be sent back through time to see how Maid Marian and Robin Hood might have found their way to one another. Watson breathes life into a story so old, its source is untraceable. The tone is intimate, and the plot is clever (as is the book's heroine). In contrast to the frustratingly simplistic portrayal of the \\"damsel in distress\\" you find in so many classic love stories, Marian is smart and capable. The nicest part about Watson's take is that for once you can see why Robin and Marian might have fallen for each other. Her characters are not fairy-tale perfect, but their flaws give shape and depth to the story. I read it in a couple of days, I found it so engrossing, and I was sad when the ride ended.

The trivia portrayed in the Roosevelt-Churchill relationship was at times interesting and even amusing but when all is said and done both men made decisions NOT based on their supposed special relationship but on the needs of the day. Roosevelt was at first suspicious of Churchill, then came to be a fan or his, but turned again suspicious of Churchill as he pursued the courting of Stalin. I am not convinced that there really was a meaninful and consequential relationship between Roosevelt and Churchill. Without this relationship much the same would have probably occurred. Meacham does not demonstrate that his thesis is valid.Having recently read Meacham's analysis of the Jesus Question in Newsweek I am not surprised that his work here is superficial and jejune -- the work of a journalist not a scholar.

There's not much new here, but it does put all the pieces together in an interesting way. Sadly the reader here (Len Cariou) is so distracting it makes this audio book almost impossible to get through.

Stay away from this and read the book on your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great piece of work","review":"Many books have been written about Roosevelt and Churchill, but few put them together in a dual biography. Meacham's depiction brings the two of the most important figures of the Second World War to life with humorous anecdotes which make them look more like the odd couple instead of a well oiled machine.

I am not a big person, and this dog can pull and lunge. I have him on a gentle leader head halter. It was not an instant solution - but it was effective and painless.

Pain is not the same thing as training.This will make your dog stop pulling quickly, but it will hurt him and it may make him more reactive in the long term.

When your dog pulls stop walking. Be patient. Your dog will learn that pulling does not pay, with no pain and no fear!

I recommend this movie to everyone young or old!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME MOVIE","review":"This was one of my favorite movies, even though (I did not like) the love story the special effects were awesome.I think anyone who liked Armegedon will love Pearl Harbor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pearl Harbor:TTT on steroids","review":"This movie has superb battle scenes.Hey,it's a Michael Bay movie.The events in this movie move too fast.More explosions than Hamburger Hills and the longest day combined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Titanic Wannabe","review":"Clearly, Michael Bay was reaching for his own Titanic with Pearl Harbor: A tragic romance set against a national tragedy. Well, it didn't work. The romantic story is too soap-opera, the acting a bit over-the-top and the whole movie was just too darn long. The effects are outstanding, the only saving grace, but not enough to justify watching the movie. If you're interested in Pearl Habor, I mean really interested, rent Tora! Tora! Tora! Keep Michael Bay's plastic version at, well, bay."},{"rating":"2","title":"big bass for big guys","review":"This Dean is awesome! Very big - good for tall guys, doesn't look small in your hands. You may want to buy longer strap to keep it lower.The only bag that fits this giant can be found hereDean Large Gig Bag for Metal Man BassI gave it 4 stars because front strap button was missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"never got what i ordered. I am very unhappy","review":"I never received my book from this person. I ordered before Christmas for a gift. I new i wouldn't be getting for Christmas day, but thought i would be getting it shortly after Christmas.I got a notice to watch for my order anywhere between 1-3-11 through 1-19-11.I AM STILL WAITING..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it..","review":"I found this novel quite pointless. It is about a quite ordinary but heartless man named Monsieur Meursault whose mother dies. After the funeral he befriends a gangster named Raymond and as a result of getting mixed up with him, he ends up senselessly, somewhat by accident, and because of the blinding hot sun, killing another man. His trial, his stay in jail and the results of all this are narrated throughout. But I could not feel any sympathy for the man. Find something else to read; this one is pointless."},{"rating":"2","title":"l'existentialisme","review":"J'aime ��tudier Sartre et Camus. J'enseigne l'existentialisme dans ma classe de franais niveaux 3 ou 4. Les ��l��ves trouvent ce livre un peu difficile, mais ils croient tous sont difficiles!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Sacred Cow\\" of Camus and Existentialism","review":"I first read the novel in english, but I read it in french once I became fluent in that language. After the first sentence: \\"Aujourd'hui, Maman est morte,\\" you know that you are in the good hands of Albert Camus. The existential theme is just awsome, and it was all the better en franais! Surtout, je sait que je l'aimais."},{"rating":"2","title":"It has changed my life forever","review":"When I had to study L'Etranger for my school exams, I at first greeted it with mild distaste - that is, until I got to know Mersault. This lead character made you want to strangle him and protect him from society at the same time. He truly illustrated the absurdity of life and the hypocrisy in which we all take part. I LOVE THIS BOOK!! I have read it no less than ten times and as soon as I start University next month guess what's going to be the first book I borrow from the library?!? P.S. If anyone out there wants to send me a free copy of the book (in FRENCH of course) please feel do so!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"meilleur livre de Camus","review":"L'histoire est plutt bien, pas trop ennuyante. Elle est tr��s courte. On d��couvre l'absurdit�� de la vie �� travers le personnage de Meursault. Le livre est beaucoup mieux que la peste.C'est ��crit simplement car Camus fait comme si c'��tait Meursault qui nous racontait l'histoire et celui-ci est plutt simple.Je conseille de le lire en franais c'est mieux."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, false advertising by Amazon","review":"The books is a classic, wonderful read as always. My problem is that the \\"Look Inside\\" on Amazon's page makes it seems as though this edition includes an introduction (in English) as well as a guide to understanding some of the French phrases. The edition I received today had none of this. It is, very simply, the original French text. No additional material. Just a heads up."},{"rating":"2","title":"I made some modifications","review":"I prefer the vanilla over the chocolate. But with both I make some modifications. The directions say to add 12oz. of liquid. I used 24-32oz. This way the shake is not too thick, it controls my hunger/cravings for longer periods of time, and it helps me to meet my daily water needs. It only takes two shakes a day using the 32oz. modification to meet the recommended 8 glasses of water a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy & Satisfies!","review":"This is hands down the best tasting protein shake I have ever had! I do suggest mixing it with icy cold water in a simple blender bottle. You can do skim milk, but there's really no need. It is smooth, rich, thick and keeps me very full. I like that it isn't a high sugar cintent and it provides a great source of low fat energy boosting protein. There is nothing weird in this shake that gives people the jitters. I work in a business where I can't always sit down and eat a big meal, so this shake is quick, nutritious and simple. Best of all it really keeps me satisfied, and keeps me from snacking on crappy foods. By the time I get home I am still energized enough to do my workout. This shake is helping me keep my lean muscle and burn off my excess fat. One of my friends recommended this shake for me and I am so glad she did. I can take the little protein shake packets anywhere and convenience is SO key."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low sugar Lean Body shakes","review":"I like this product because it is low sugar/low carb, is a smaller portion (less calories) than similar products and has good taste & texture. Easily mixes with water or soy milk & is great when mixed in the blender with just ice & a little water. Lots of good fuel without unneccessary sugar & calories. Product was delivered quickly, as promised. I will continue to buy from this merchant."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK if blended with something (i.e., strawberries)","review":"I didn't like the thickness or the flavor, compared to another protein powder that I was used (Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Vanilla). Perhaps this is the nature of all meal replacement shakes--not sure.Easy to use/carry, mixes well (no lumps), and mixes with water (rather than requiring milk)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maggots with powder","review":"I loved the flavor of the vanilla shakes until one of my packages had dry maggots in it, which makes me be seriously concerned about the cleanliness of the facility that packed the protein powder-- or about the origin of the protein in the pack. Would give Labrada negative stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tasting and filling","review":"I love this product.Tastes great.I got the soft ice cream.Definitely cuts down on calories for me since it fills me up.Will definitely reorder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chocolate or Vanilla?","review":"Although this is a good product, I am not a fan of the vanilla flavor at all. I normally order the chocolate flavor and I like that very much. In fact, I ordered chocolate this time too, but received vanilla. I would highly recommend the chocolate flavor... but not vanilla... yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really, really tried","review":"I do not like the flavor. I love vanilla ice cream/ shakes. This shake however, doesn't even compare in a natural goodness. It is chalky and harsh. I even tried blending in strawberries. The flavor of the shake was too powering over the strawberries. I would be open to trying the chocolate...but not at this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lean Body","review":"Lean Body is a wonderful replacement product. We liked the chocolate flavor the best. We would either low fat milk or if we were making a special dinner treat add low fat choc ice cream and peanut butter. Too good!! The product is a little expensive but the convenience is worth it. We have tried Slim Fast and my son and I prefer this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy and filling","review":"I bought this stuff on a whim as I started my diet. I needed ideas for snacks, as I'm supposed to have 3 snacks each day. I think both the chocolate and vanilla are great! The first time I tried it, I simply stirred it with milk. It was pretty good. The next time, I put it in the blender with a couple of ice cubes, and it tasted really good. Now I experiment with various soy and rice milks and usually add 1/4 to 1/2 cup frozen fruit or 1/2 banana. I highly recommend this product as a meal replacement or snack. I haven't tried the strawberry, so I can't speak to that flavor, but I'm sure it's good, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied","review":"I am a regular user of the Lean Body shake and was pleasantly surprised when I ordered the product this time. Amazon had sent the new and improved version I couldn't get at my local vitamin store. It tasted 100% better! I'll order it here from now on - as they have the newest, freshest product available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy!","review":"These shakes are very filling. Just what you need. A real meal replacement that tastes good and is filling. I usually mix with a 1/2 banana, a couple of strawberries, and some ice. Sometimes I mix with a 1/4 tsp cinnamon for a different taste. Love this product and Amazon has the best price anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful!!! Contains plant estrogen!","review":"This product contains soy isoflavins, the plant equivalent of estrogen. This has different effects on different people. For some, it makes them more fertile (see articles on soy and fertility). For those who use oral contraceptives with estrogen, this product can make you physically sick, including migraine-like headaches and diarrhea. If you take oral contraceptives and suffer ANY adverse consequences after using this product, STOP and find a non-soy replacement like Biox Whey Isolate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tasting","review":"This is a great shake. Perfect taste and fills me up when replacing a meal. I am trying to slim down and the weight is coming off. Thanks to these delicious meal replacement shakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilled","review":"I love this product. I use it for meal replacement (breakfast), and I do not get hungry until lunch time. I will continue to order this product as I need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only OK","review":"Lean body is ok. I purchased the chocolate and the consistency kind of makes me sick. The flavor is decent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats wrong with you people?","review":"Oddly there is absolutely no mention in any of these reviews about how much protein there is in this protein based product. Does anyone know? after all its a protein meal replacement shake. I don't care about how pretty the box is or how little the calorie content is or if it tastes great. If a person is not getting the proper amount of proteins to support proper workout then the product is useless. Protein, Thats the whole point. i wouldnt buy this product based on the reviews at all because they miss the effectivness of most crucial ingredient. Sigh, For the record it has 30 grams of protein.
