No pieces have broken and all the moving parts work just fine, after much abuse from an active 3-year-old.He may love the ship, but I LOVED the packaging. What a great idea! Less waste, easier to unpack, ready to play with about 30 seconds after he unwrapped it. Everything arrived just fine with nothing lost or damaged. Thanks for creating this simplified packaging and please offer it on more items!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent choice!","review":"My 3 year old nephew loved this toy right out of the box. He plays with it all the time and takes it with him from room to room. The best thing about it is that it does not make any noise so he can use his own imagination and make his own noises. I would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this ship!","review":"My 4 year old got this for his birthday. He hasn't been one to play with toys much. He prefers video games, so to keep those kind of things to a minimum, I am looking for toys to keep his interest. He has played with this nearly every day for a month, and still seems excited about it. He likes the cannons that really shoot, the sails that open and close and the figures. His older siblings enjoy playing with him too.It encourages open ended play and imagination which is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pirate treasure","review":"I got this for my son's 3rd birthday because he likes pirates. He and his 5 yr old sister have had so much fun playing with it. I love all the neat things that it does: shooting cannons, pirates that sword fight on the back (aft?) of the ship, the sails go up and down, the anchor can be dropped and raised, and the flags, rails, emblems can all be rearranged so it holds their attention for a long time. The only drawback is keeping all the pieces together- my daughter likes to scavange parts to play with her little pet shop pets. It has been very durable and we haven't had any problem with it. Another bonus is that when William usually plays pirates he grabs his sword and starts the attack. When he plays pirate with this ship the attack is kept in his imagination, where it belongs. I would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun that lasts for years","review":"I bought this pirate set, as well as the Imaginext castle set at two years, then three years. The parts are very durable, with the exception of the cannonball extenders. My son is now turning four and STILL plays enthusiastically with both sets. Lots of fun and imaginative play. Worth the money... also, always check Target brick and mortar stores for sales on Imaginext. I haven't paid more than $39 for these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Happy Boys","review":"One son got this last year for Christmas. It was such a popular toy we bought a second one for our other boy. (Ages 3 and 4 now) They play with them endlessly. They have drawn out pirate \\"battles\\", they go on adventures together, they crash... it's endless. I've never had the hull come apart (as one other reviewer mentioned) and these ships take quite a bit of heavy play at my house. Nothing has broken off our ships at all. They get carried around in the oddest manners, they get crashed into each other and they've been dropped on concrete. Nothing. After 9 months, they look as good as they did the day we took them out of the package. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"THANK YOU AMAZON!!!","review":"WOW--i bought this gift for my nephew last minute and i did get it in 2 days--the day of his 4th b-day and he was so excited about his pirate ship he literally dropped his other gifts to start playing with it. he has to carry his pirate everywhere even to play t-ball --him and his older sister played with it for hours--great details and extras--durable--great gift at a great price!!! and thank you fed ex and amazon for fast delivery--i didn't think it would make it to montana in 2 days but it did THANK YOU!!

We love it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shiver Me Timbers!","review":"Purchased as one of many Christmas gifts for our soon-to-be four year old son, this was the gift he kept returning to on Christmas day and often since then! No instructions make the parts and pieces a challenge for feeble-minded parents. The cannon piece that is stored under the deck was easily destroyed by my son, hoping I can get a replacement from Fisher-Price. Like the classic Fisher-Price toys that still continue to engage my son, this is a winner, well worth the price and far superior to the other action figures marketed to kids this age!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy","review":"We received this Pirate Toy Ship last year as a gift for our son's 5th birthday.

Up till now we have been very satisfied and they all have been a lot of fun and function perfectly. Sorry to say but we are not very impressed with the pirate ship. Great idea but it is very limited in what \\"it dose\\" and the few functions that it has do not work very well. I think that they could have done a better job in the design and could have made it so that it would be a lot more fun and functional. We bought the Research Boat at the same time and it is A LOT BETTER. The pirate ship just sits while the other boat gets played with everyday. Would not recomend this as a primary toy and would instead buy the Reasearch Boat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the high price...","review":"The suggested retail price on the Fisher-Price website is $36...it is listed on Amazon for $179.99 (why I rated 1 star overall)!

The authors use abundant census data to depict the contradictory socioeconomic trends induced by the island's industrial development. Analytically, the authors straddle between a view of Puerto Rico as a developing economy and as a regional economy of the United States. This ambiguity leaves the reader wondering whether the paradox is the product of methodological inconsistencies or of the reality of Puerto Rico as an unicorporated territory of the United States."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"Carlos Santiago is magnificent.

Judging from the photos included in the excellent liner notes, Toni did not fit the slender glamour-girl image of the Peggy Lee-Julie London era, and this may have held her back (that, and some sub-standard material written by her hit-or-miss songwriting husband).

Perhaps something happened with that mysetery known as timing. If \\"The Wedding Night\\" is an example of her acting, the mid 1930s American audiences missed something. I think she is superb in this role and has a wonderful doomed chemistry with Gary Cooper. The film itself has a terrific look, as do a number of Goldwyn's films from this period. They appear like handsome leather bound novels in motion. Ralph Bellamy turns in his usual superb performance and captures the essence of these Polish immigrants as a pragmatic people. It's easy to dismiss them as cold and humorless but, to be fair, they most likely, as other immigrants of that time, came from countries where they knew only hardship and had to fight to survive. This clash of cultures leaves the viewer frustrated along with the characters, as the screenplay intends, and \\"The Wedding Night\\" elicits a very rewarding viewing experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"plot holds a mile wide","review":"With plot holes a mile wide it was hard to watch what could have been a good movie. We are lead to believe that Gary Coopers character is enchanted by Anna Stens simplisity and touched by her plight. We kept expecting him to come to his sences. Ralph Bellamy's character is presented as if he is only marrying her for the dowery and we never see a tender momment or else the plot falls apart. The same can't be said of Coopers wife who appears to have a change of heart and attempts to win her husband back. The ending is dreadful as Anna dies and Cooper mopes and his wifes final appeal falls on deaf ears. It seems so contrived with characters that are not real only characters. The only emotion I got in watching this attempt at \\"art\\" was dissatisfaction and a low grade mad.

Although the original b&w 1957 version was a low budget drive-in cheapie, I felt the only way a remake could go is up . Not so , this up-dated version will put you to sleep faster than a handful of Ambiens . A slow moving borefest . Skip it !"},{"rating":"1","title":"When they invent minus 4 stars this film will earn it","review":"Action is always what moves a film forward. Over-dialogue will slow any film down. Our fifty foot woman just needs to expand on the plot from the last film giant. She needs a monument and a tour guide, an unsympathetic father, a female deputy and analyst, a swimming pool to take a spoiled soap suds bath in, persuing helicopters from a different era, and a spaceship to rescue her that will also torture her unfaithful hubby Harry (Daniel Baldwin) Now with all these wonderful extras you would wish she could spare the feminist terminology and just stomp on her jerk of a husband and the scheming floozy he's been fooling around with like she did in the first film! It was planned as a film but went to cable TV instead. Daryl Hannah might have helped write it, but would this material help her graduate from the seventh grade?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a little-wacked Monster movie","review":"Notice to parents, there is some verbal material unsuited for little ones, adult nature.

There are only one or two songs on the CD that are not on \\"Living Under June\\" that I thought were any good, and I have to like a song an awful lot to buy an entire CD for just one or two songs.

Levy is the starting point for debate on what freedom of the press meant to the framers of the first amendment. Levy contends that the framers had a very limited conception of freedom of the press, and presents a wealth of evidence of suppression of press freedoms in colonial America. There is a wealth of interesting information in this book, although it is not casual reading by any stretch of the imagination. Moreover, many scholars have criticized Levy for ignoring both the actual practices of colonial printers--who behaved as if they were quite free despite the law--and for ignoring the philosophical contributions of English Whig thinkers to the American conception of press freedom. In my view, you have to start with Levy if you are interested in this topic, but you shouldn't stop with him."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it much","review":"Ok, I read the book and it was ok. Some banks listed in the bank have gone into receivership (1st Cayman Bank, Eurobank). The book's advice is not for me. Too much was riding on the theory that legislation will not change. Recently (2/00) Clinton was talking about more reporting requirements for those who deal with offshore entities. Best advice is don't ask, don't tell, and make sure there are no traceable transactions from the U.S. to your offshore tax jurisdiction, no mail, no wires, no traceable cheques."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks substance on implementation","review":"The book introduces the concepts associated with off-shore havens, but does little beyond that. Certainly, off-shore havens can be used by individuals and corporations for a variety of benefits, but the author does not adequately discuss implementing those benefits. Also, there's a lot of hype and questionable tax advice for U.S. residents. My advice is to retain an accountant and an attorney with a history of specializing in international taxation and commerce, as opposed to a \\"consultant\\" whose tax and legal credentials are unknown. This book is probably not the one you want to buy, but I would encourage people interested in the subject to not give up hope, tax havens are worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried it, book doesn't work.","review":"I followed the book's instructions to the letter and tried to open a current account at three Singapore banks recommended in the book.

The cat will jump over one gate effortlessly. The two gates are easy to stack and are about 6 ft high when stacked. It is very easy to use once you get the hang of it. The first gate did NOT come with instructions, the second one did.In case yours doesn't, measure the door you want to use, move the measuring bar to the width on the gate, and press down the locking bar.Anywho, I had to make sure there was no space at the top or bottom of the doorway b/c the cat was able to climb over or under the gate if it's too high or too low.

They really worked quite well for pressure gates, and were completely effortless to set up. One of the cats, who weighs about 10 pounds, would climb up the gates (we had them two high). He had to climb up it at least 10 times before the top gate finally slipped out of the door frame under his weight. I would think it would be great for dogs and kids also. It won't require you to mess up your walls with hardware installation and the price is right. I wouldn't use it at the top of the stairs, though, just in case a child was able to push it loose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy access with a secure gate","review":"This gate is wonderful-no more climbing over or removing a gate to get in/out of a room.

I loved this tv until it started to make a grinding noise. It came and went until it became unbearable. Research on the web revealed a common issue: failure of the color wheel. This, an archaic technology going back to the invention of the color tv, is a complete waste. It seems to have a life of 2-3 1/2 years. You need to replace it. It is expense to replace. I did so, but it would not go on. I replaced the lamp as suggested, it would not work. Then it was suggested to change the ballast. This still did not do it.

I gave up after page 30- nothing had happened- lots of dialog from people sitting around- descriptions of food, cigars. No suspense. I guess it was setting background, but a better writer would have done it in 10 pages, a very good writer in 4.I received comments suggesting I should have read of the book more before doing a review. I agree, and yet..... it may help some readers to know going in that at least one impatient reader found it too slow for him. So, unfair review? Yes. But helpful? Your call."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"I am a big fan of Alan Furst and have read every one of his novels. Dark Voyage simply does not measure up, and, in my opinion, is not worth the time. If you want to read Alan Furst, choose one of his older works and give this one a pass. If you choose Dark Voyage as your first novel by Furst, I promise you it will be your last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"One word describes this book- BORING! I know that most of Alan Furst's novels are slow, but at least they have a plot that keeps your interest. Here, you have a merchant captain from Norway, of all places, who is roped into undergoing different missions for the war effort. None of which are very dangerous, nor worthy of the telling. Not only that, the vessel captain is a worn out nobody that doesn't deserve our respect, let alone our interest. I look forward to every new Furst book that comes out, but this one was a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Furst 'at sea' on the water","review":"Alan Furst takes his story away from his usual haunts to the deck of the Dutch tramp steamer the Noordendam and the waters of the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. Captain E.M. DeHaan is the somewhat reluctant hero this time (in the manner of Furst's other lead characters like Jean Casson and Nicholas Morath). DeHaan and his ship are recruited by Dutch Naval intelligence and eventually become tools (not to say pawns) of British espionage on a dangerous mission that takes them from Alexandria to Finland.Another entertaining effort by Furst with fine writing, but not my favorite. Furst is the master at capturing the atmosphere of the early days of WW II (especially Paris and eastern Europe) and he's a bit 'at sea' (pardon the pun) in Dark Voyage. The bits on land in Algiers and Alexandria are first-rate. Highly readable and recommended for fans of espionage thrillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner by Furst","review":"In this book, Alan Furst breaks new ground, escaping the close world of continental espionage to take the reader on a vivid journey into the fringes of military operations: covert ops, evacuations, confrontation on the high seas. In Dark Voyage, Furst is masterful in his recreation of places and events ranging from Africa to the Baltic. Each sequence in the book is a complete, self-contained story that stands on its own. Combined, the sum is greater than the very good parts. I hope that he will continue to develop tales that take the reader outside the confines of Europe into the wider world of the 1930s and 1940s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition: full of transcription errors - is there no quality control?","review":"Every accented character in the book has simply been erased for the Kindle edition. Since there are many such characters, there being many phrases in French and other languages, part of the author's approach for building atmosphere, this indicates a certain carelessness on the part of the editors. In fact a complete lack of quality control.For example, the word \\"francais\\" (with a cedilla under the 'c') becomes, in this edition, \\"franais\\".I have got used to seeing errors in Kindle editions, but this is the worst so far.

Lots of generalities and stereotypes - e.g. taking the subways makes people feel stressed; spiritual feelings in the countryside or in the mountains. Lots of details about life in Alaska.

Personally, I think it's a good rock CD by a good band. My favorite songs here are \\"No Need,\\" \\"Not Like You,\\" and \\"Breathless.\\" \\"No Need\\" and \\"Not Like You\\" especially give me goosebumps; the choruses sound very heavenly, even if the entire CD isn't really very heavenly.

The lead vocalist has as enough fuel in his balls to cover just about anything asked of him. Originals like the ones on Lifer, including the guitar work--done by a guy who also acts as about 18 stellar musicians wrapped into one, make this album a keeper for a long time. Ditto the band. You could say Lifeson has produced a gem, but these guys have obviously made this album all by themselves over quite a bit of time before the studio. The only thing left desired is to see them live and I'm sure the sentiment is pretty Universal."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD....read on!","review":"i cant belive people are out there bitching about good music.

Third wave feminists did not just step out of a cave, the older amongst us (those now in our later 30's to early 40's like myself) saw these events unfold as children and it's throughly seared in our minds. Ms. Chesler ignores the fact that in the 1987 March for Reproductive Rights on Washington DC, in which 500,000 women marched, 2/3 were then under 30 years old (the third wave feminists, this was our first major- in numbers present, activist appearence) This book tempted me to write a letter FROM a young feminist. But I decided not to, because if Ms. Chesler was determined to ignore third wave feminists, despite much activism by us, a letter refuting her claims of our ignorance wasn't going to open her eyes. Readers are better to choose books by second wave feminists that are better written and informed, like Gloria Steinem's. I'd also recommend books by older third wavers like Naomi Wolf and Susan Faludi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful Introduction to Science Fiction","review":"My 8-year-old son loved this book. I read it to him over a few nights and he was enthralled with the story of a boy whose parents work on a space station and the stowaway Rat. The book is fast-paced and exciting. It has turned on my son to the wonders of science fiction. He wants more, more, more books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ideas, but not the best book","review":"THere are some very good ideas in this book, but they are poorly executed. The writing is pedestrian, the characters are two-dimensional, except for Rat, and the action sequences aren't very clear. Jeff is a very, very whiney child who does nothing but complain in front of his stereotypically preoccupied parents. The worst thing about this book is the repetitive references to the Captain being fat. Kids do not need to be encouraged when it comes to fat jokes, and given the high requirements for physical fitness in space, it is highly doubtful that there would be a fat Captain. The \\"jokes\\" add nothing to the plot. There is likely to be a sequel; I am hoping it will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Written, but dated utility.","review":"While the premise of the book and the foundation are good, the utility is lost and revealed as dated with the suggested resources.

Guess I can just use it flipped over, but I did order expecting plain red."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea, good price, bad hardware","review":"Purchased this gate to use to keep my son from climbing steps. It is fairly strong, easily adaptable, but a flawed design. Having to hook 2 latches is difficult, contrary to the pictures on the box. You could never operate the latches with one hand and a baby on your hip. The springs in the stick, sometimes won't latch, sometimes won't let go. Worst of all, my wife cut a large gash in her hand on the \\"safe\\" plastic section. Good idea, POOR hardware. Needs serious work to make this functional. Going to build yet another baby gate myself due to lack of cost effective, SAFE options on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect fit","review":"i have a walkway from the living room to the dining room that most expandable wooden gates wont fit because they arent wide enough. This one expands perfectly to fit! i also wanted something that couldnt just get pushed or tipped over so this being able to ger secured into wall was exactly what i needed. no complaints, easy to set up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I ordered this product hoping it would be the perfect solution to keep my baby boy from going up the stairs. The bottom of my stairs is in a kind of crowded area and I wanted the gate to expand and contract to fit into a small area when not in use. Unfortunately, the gate stays very large and doesn't swing like I thought it would. I returned it before even trying to install. Disappointed this wasn't a good solution. Back to the drawing board."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gate for kids and dogs!","review":"This gate has a really nice feature where you can open it from either side. Also if you purchase extra eye hooks from a hardware store you can easily set it up in multiple parts of your house. It's sturdy too, which is essential in my house. I like that opens and closes easily and it's higher than most gates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for our tall dogs","review":"For well behaved dogs that don't jump on things, this gate is perfect. Not sure it would be sturdy enough for more agressive dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to install","review":"This expandable gate is very easy to install, and securely fits my odd sized doorway (unlike the pressure gate that I had previous tried to use.) It is also surprisingly sturdy for an expandable gate, and has not loosened up when either of my very large dogs has leaned against it. I like the fact that it can be opened from either side. I do not care for the clasps that are used to open and close it, though. It is sometimes difficult to apply the correct amount of pressure to the rather small handle, while you are simultaneously trying to line up the latch on top and the hook on the bottom. Once it is opened or closed, though, it does a wonderful job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swing gate","review":"This is a good gate for large openings. I needed a gate to keep my small dog off the carpet. The big drawback is the screws included to install the gate to the wall. You receive four small eye screws. After numerous holes in the wall trying to keep it in place, I finally gave up and now use it to block a smaller area. The screws stay in place if screwed directly into molding but don't bother connecting directly to sheetrock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great baby gate","review":"This is a great, manuverable, lighweight baby gate.

After just two days of use I found myself wishing we had spent the extra money; the locking mechanism is awkward and time consuming, and the \\"4 point steel mounting hardware\\" (eye hooks that screw into the wall) have already become stressed and faulty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible latch hardware","review":"I've used a lot of these gates for both children and pets. My satisfaction is usually dominated by how easy they are to operate. This is the worst one I've used. I am physically strong but cannot compress the latch spring without using two hands. The latch components are cheap and ill fitting. I doubt many mothers could operate it with a baby in one arm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only buy for smaller openings!!","review":"At first we liked this gate. It was easy to install and did its purpose. We didn't even mind that it was a little tricky to latch at times. We used this to cover a 4 ft opening. It broke after only a few months of use. The bigger the opening, the more flimbsy the gate gets. Good luck if you go with this gate!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"gate","review":"works as advertised, easy to follow directions, larger eye screws might work a little better when singing gate to walk through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality","review":"This is a great quality gate and will with stand a whole lot of abuse.

This album is partly responsible for that, for it is the first recording by Accept I heard. This album is veritable metal classic, replete with screeching, Brian Johnson-esque vocals from the man Udo, and some good old fashioned gutiar mayhem from Wolf Hoffman. I know some Euro-metal, at least to me, seems to have a distinct lack of emotion but that is not the case here.

Otherwise I would give it a ZERO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Sure What These Other People Are talking About...","review":"I've used this compact antenna for years in a small apartment in NYC where signals bounce between the buildings and often cause an echo effect. It has worked very well. I do not use this for AM reception; I unplug it when listening to AM radio and use a passive TERK AM Advantage antenna, which I cannot recommend too strongly. Also, I've never tried to listen to an FM station farther away than Newark, NJ, so I'm not sure whether this antenna is really an improvement over the older TERK model it replaced, but there's no comparison between it and the T-shaped wire that came with the tuner. The sound is clear and static free, even during storms. I will admit that it is a bit of a chore to adjust the pin-dots every time a radio station on a different part of the dial is selected, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't really work","review":"Didn't seem to make the FM reception any better, except for the fact that when I was trying to get the classical station from NYC, to my horror, I got loud and clear, the local Christian station. Not what I wanted. The AM reception was completely gone; I went back to the antenna which came with the Onkyo tuner, which sort of works. I didn't have much luck with the \\"pin the dot\\" tuning system. More gain just made it more static-y (with more pain).Bottom line will be an attempted return to CC; we'll see how that goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"For the price I expected more.

As others have said, there are too many cover songs here, and while Lucy never fails to find the value in any song, she could easily have skipped a couple of these. It's her original songs that make this an album to cherish. In particular, the two songs inspired by her father's death (especially the title track) and The Gift, about how her musical gift runs directly back to her grandfather, are beautifully crafted and overwhelmingly moving.

Of course, they neglect to copy the part of Shaeffer's book that outlines just who is the founder of this way of eating. I wouldn't go so far as to say that no one should buy this book, but I would say that anyone who buys it should also buy Instinctive Nutrition by Severen Shaeffer so that they can get the good info Spors and Devivo chose to leave out and so that they can see just how far their plagiarism goes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deliciously controversial!!!","review":"What a book! I haven't seen anything like it on the diet market in a long time. With all the boring same old, same old out there, it is refreshing to see human nutrition from a totally new perspective. The fundamental concept is in my opinion rock solid. The authors presented their case with elegance and sharpness of mind. In addition, they give many scientific references to back up their claims. Because it defies traditional ways of thinking, this is definitely the kind of book that easily attracts a horde of detractors.

He shows that anger is a natural human emotion and to reject it is as silly and destrutive as rejecting any other basic part of our humanity. He also demonstrates that most problems we connect with anger (violence, hatred and rage) are really the result of trying to deny and repress our anger. Definately one of the best self-help books of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Rubin knows about anger","review":"This book is excellent, but not as good as Rubin's other book, Compassion and Self-Hate. The Self-Hate part of that book is about as good as it gets for insight into how we tend to sabotage ourselves because of anger that we keep to ourselves. However, this book has a lot of good ideas, is easy reading, and Rubin comes up with a few gems that you might not think of. He's very perceptive about how to use anger properly so that it doesn't destroy us or restrict our enjoyment of life. Rubin is a follower of Karen Horney, Freudian, but not extreme, and Horney was a genius when it comes to reading the subconscious. Overall, an excellent book from Dr. Rubin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fundamentally a meaningful book but far too redundant.","review":"Since I tend to be a person one would describe as hot-headed or ill-tempered, I thought this the perfect gift. Honestly, I believe that much of what Dr. Rubin purports to be true: that many psychological problems stem from our inability to connect to our anger.However, I found that the book's main points are made in the first several chapters while the balance is spent reiterating those points continually. In my opinion, Dr. Rubin should've spent more time helping the reader with excercises aimed at connecting WITH the anger rather than understanding its many faces.Maybe he is setting us up for \\"The Angry Book II\\".

Anger is deadly. We must avoid anger at all times. While we may at times find ourselves in moments of anger, we must learn ways to have it immediately removed.\\"If we were to live, we had to be free of anger.

Said it had changed her life and I have seen significant changes in her dealing with anger. However, after reading the book...I don't get it.

Ms. Flinn obviously knows her antiques, more than I can say for some of the other so-called mystery writers using antique dealers as their progagonist. Molly Doyle is refreshing and sassy all at once. A woman of her time, she isn't even intimidated by the former big time cop from L.A. who suspects her of murder. I particularly enjoyed the inside info about artists and how fakes are done. Oh, and what not to do at an auction. Her setting of Carmel, California is great and I can't wait to visit it and look for Tosca's and Daria's restaurant. They probably don't exist, except in the mystery, but I sure wish they did.Do yourself a favor and pick this one up. You won't be sorry. I can't wait for the next one. Hurry up, Ms. Flinn! I'm tired of Antique Roadshow re-runs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"I didn't expect to like this book as much as I did, because I didn't see how the antique business would hold my attention. I was pleasantly surprised.The characters were fairly realistic and likeable and the writing style was good. As a smoker, though, even I was a bit surprised at how much emphasis was put on the characters and their smoking. It was nice for a change not to read the typical anti-smoking BS, but the author should've toned it down a bit because it started to overpower the story.The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars was that I found a lot of errors -- spelling, grammar and consistency (several times, characters were referred to by the wrong name). Otherwise, I look forward to reading the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drawn into the Pages","review":"Dealing in Murder is an excellent debut novel by new author, Elaine Flinn. From the get-go 'the blood-soaked sweatshirt' draws you into the world of Molly Doyle as she tries to scrape a life together in beautiful Carmel, California. For the present, she lives the life of a small antiques dealer while her past shadows a world of grangeur and decandence. The plot keeps the pages turning and your mind races to the end before you have time to stop and realize you've been drawn into a mystery novel. Before you realize that the reality you've plunged yourself into is the workings of another's mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new character","review":"I loved this book. Molly Doyle is a great new character who's a firebrand with a heart, a true eye for antiques, and a tendancy to get herself into trouble.

You'll be glad you read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good scratching...when you can find it","review":"Like the other discs in this series, this one features the best turntablists in the world spinning non-stop beats and scratch theory totally disrupted by WAY too-much non-sensical \\"rapping\\" that doesn't elevate the tracks in ANY way. Maybe they felt that no one would tune in to a radio broadcast of pure turntable action without some kind of grounding vocalisms, but it was just distracting.

The Dr. Marten brand is no longer manufactured in England and it shows. The leather was marred and the fit wasn't nearly as good as my previous pair. To top it off the sole pattern is completely useless. Gone was the hiker boot pattern that would grip into ice and snow, replaced with the 'groove' pattern that does nothing for traction.

As they won't return defective shoes and if the defect isn't convincing enough to prove manufacturer defect-I'll be out the shoes and the money I paid for them. If they do find that the shoe is defective and not by me, they'll gladly replace the shoe with the same shoe or a comparable one. That's crazy-why would I accept a \\"comparable\\" shoe, when I may not like the look and it may not be what I need. This just stinks. I think I'll just scrap the shoes and purchase from another company. Dr. Marten shoes aren't what they use to be. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Prepared for a Length \\"Breaking-In\\" Period","review":"To echo the reviews of others, I have found these Docs to be quite different from others I have owned.

If you are fortunate enough to find a pair that say on the inside heel: made in England, AND on the bottom of the shoe, you see the same phrase, these are the real deal. Otherwise, they are cheap junk. Google about it online. Get the ones made in England and you won't be sorry. Get the ones made elsewhere, and well, you WILL be sorry.How do I know? Well, I am 26 years old and I still wear a pair of DOCS that I wore when I was in 11th grade. The sole is worn down only about 1/3rd of what it was when I first purchased them.

I wanted to strangle the heroine from nearly the first page, and the fact that Alex was even the slightest bit interested in Alix, caused me to decide he had a mental disorder.

Avoid this book like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Katie's best","review":"I'v eread several other Katie MacAlister novels and had high expectations. I was, however, quite disappointed in this book. Where to begin? Perhaps the heroine: annoying, unfocused, frenzied without being funny. The hero: Well, gee, I never really understood him. What motivated him? What possible interest could he have in Alex, as annoying as she was? How in the world did they fall in love? Too fast, too frenzied, not enough of the basics. This book bugged me so much, in fact, that I almost dropped the author from my list of must-buys. I can heartily recommend several other of Katie's books, though: Sex and the Single Vampire, Hard Day's Knight, Noble Intentions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny!!!","review":"This was certainly not your typical contemp. romance!

Alix is not the perfect heroine to admire and wish you were her (except when she's heating up the pages with Alex!) She exhibits the characteristics all of us have - insecurities, desire to protect our hearts, emotional breakdowns! She is quite frankly, immature. But that is what she is supposed to be so that she can come full circle, find her inner self, gain confidence and fly like the phoenix! If you like a funny, sexy romance, you will love this book. Ignore the reviewers who must not see themselves clearly enough to admit their own imperfections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unspeakably bad. SO bad. bad, bad, arrgh","review":"I give this book one star only because zero wouldn't show up. It is probably the most sickening excuse for reading material outside of -- gee, I'm at a loss. Only sheer bloody-minded perseverance let me finish the thing. I even had to turn frequently to the letters of Pliny the Younger to stop my brains dripping out my ears in protest at having to absorb this garbage. While the 'heroine'--a self-centered, whiney and vulgar woman of the emotional age of 13 for whom we are presumably to feel some sort of empathy or sympathy-- writes a trashy novel, so bad as to be an object of derision, so too does this one mimic it. Oh, even the memory of this drivel nauseates me. Such a far cry from the dragon series as to suggest that MacAlister allowed ten chimps access to a typewriter and enough sugar-spiked bananas to make the notion of anyone spending money to buy this thing funnier still than the proverbial banana peel slip. Oh, gods. This was so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Average","review":"I really wanted to like this book - the title is fun, the cover is fun, the premise is fun, and Macalister's most recent book, Men in Kilts, was awesome. But.. this was not a quality book. The main character (Alix) is an annoying female that is just as self-centered and obnoxious as her friends say she is. The lead male (Alex) is just not believable. In fact, the entire romance lacks realism and is hardly more than teen fluff. I felt like this book was very immature and seemed geared to a very low age group - like teens. It just wasn't well written and I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to snuff","review":"I LOVE Katie MacAlister's books, but I have to say I was very disappointed with this one. The heroine was not at all likeable, I'm sorry to say. You never get why the romantic characters (Alex and Alix) like each other, and they don't seem to have anything in common besides sex. I can't see why they would stay together. As I said I really love Katie's books, usually, but this one was not as developed as her other works.

I kept waiting for some revelation that the heroine was just joking and not such a bitch. No such luck. And the thing that pissed me off the most is that the hero is a decent guy for the most part. At least in the Vampire series the guys are just as dim witted and immature as the girl. But to try and justify a decent guy throwing himself away on a heroine that selfish. Geeeeeeeeeeeez! If I wanted to deal with that, I'd go outside my house and watch real life unfold. There are plenty of good people throwing themselves away on horrible relationships (hence the whole reason of reading, to escape reality).No one should buy this book. I was so insulted and angry I had to try and do something relaxing to calm down. Total trash. How could this author waste hours writing about such a horrible woman! Is she that immature?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Improper English","review":"I would have given this book 5 stars based on Alex's character alone. I thought he was wonderful. So wonderful in fact that he put up with the heroine Alix throughout. Can't say I would have done the same.

Actually, the new Robert Charels CD \\"Metropolitan Blue\\" that Robilard produced or the work he did with Herb Ellis is much closer to a classic Duke or Roomful album than this is. I bet Duke bounces back strong though because he truly is one of the greats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great piece of music from the Duke","review":"Being a Duke Robillard fan for the last years it's a pleasure to listen to each new work from the duke. He becomes better and better with each release, if you like jump blues and not the rocking edge of blues. So if you want to have a strong jump blues record with soulful vocals and virtuos guitar playin buy this won and you will have a great time with this record and wont stop listening to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"This is the first Duke album that I have bought that I didnt like, I think it is awful! He is way off the reservation. This is what happens when an artist tries to play too many styles of music and abandon what they do best! He went out in left field on this one!Come back home Duke!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Explorer searches for the roots","review":"Complete with horn section and synthesizer, Duke Robillard's clean single-pickup guitar tone floats through his amp with a subtle touch of beach-reverb. Released June 13, 2000, his sparse electric technique and faux-southpaw notation leave you yearning for his well-placed flares that rely on tone instead of effect. The muted acoustic baritone guitar reminds one of gypsy-jazz, and the vocals on the record give way to a gritty drone that draws on both Big Band and Call-And-Response. While relying on Chicago rhythms and New Orleans Piano, Explorer creates an environment for saxophonists Doug Jams and Warren Beadle to interlude and experiment with less-sobering tonality. It's a playful jaunt to yesteryear that appreciates an amalgamation of uniquely American music while proving the versatility of the Duke's band. Also highly recommend is \\"Duke's Blues\\" and \\"Blue Mood\\". Please check out his website at www.dukerobillard.com.

It is a winner from start to finish! Godzilla looks fantastic and is bigger and more powerful than ever. Maestro Akira Ifukube returns to the G-series with a wonderfully majestic score that is worlds better than the scores for the two previous films. King Ghidorah, one of the Big G's most popular enemies, looks great and is a worthy successor of the classic King Ghidorah. The incredible spfx are once again handled by Koichi Kawakita. My only complaint is that this film has only been released in a pan-and-scan dub that is recorded in the EP mode.

I did not realize the error until I re-read the book just recently. My apologies to Mr. Kalat and to anyone who noticed the error.That said, G vs KG is a fun movie.

Godzilla was a dinosaur back then and moved the dinosaurm into the Bering Sea. Then the put the Dorats out. Then the H-Bomb turns the Dorats into a powerful 3-headed monster called King Ghidorah. Next, King Ghidorah destroys a city. Then a nuclear sub uses radioactive weapons to turn the dinosaur back into Godzilla. Godzilla and King Ghidorah fight. Godzilla blasts King Ghidorah's middle head off, and makes a hole in its wing with Godzilla's raidioactivity. Godzilla attacks another city.

It's smaller and thinner than I'd expected but that's my own fault for not looking up the product dimensions. Facets are slightly more angular than the picture suggests. And the colors don't blend into one another quite as smoothly as the colors in the Amazon picture.The bigger issue: anyone buying this product on the virtue of these reviews should be aware that whenever Gem Avenue receives a positive seller rating, they request that their buyers review the products positively as well.

Although the crystal I am reviewing is beautiful, I have only had it for a few weeks and have noticed that it already has several chips. One side of the crystal actually has a noticeable gouge out of it. I can't explain how this has happened since I have not been scaling walls or rolling in sandpits recently (joke). All I can say is that the other crystal, several years older, that I have been wearing at the same time, is fine. It's not a huge loss, since the crystal was quite cheap.

I was excited to read this book (not because I thought my marriage needed help, but because I thought there's nothing wrong with trying to make it even better!), but got discouraged and was disappointed immediately. By the time I got to the second chapter, I actually had to put it down. I don't think she is very realistic in this book and I don't think there can be cookie-cutter advice for everyone reading. I don't agree with the theory that men can do no wrong, that they are simple creatures, and it is up to the women to make the relationship successful (by having more sex, cooking dinner, whatever).

I have read many of Dr. Laura's books. A letter that I once sent to Dr. Laura even appears in one of her books (page 76, Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands.) So please take this into consideration when I say I was disappointed in this audio book. The first hour was about surveys men and women took, and what was important to each sex. I would sum it up as women talk too much, women are almost always completely responsible for anything that goes wrong in the marriage, and that both men and women both fear rejection. IMO, this was a fast re-hash of the Proper Care and Feeding of Husbands. Save your money. Get your Dr. Laura fix by listening to her radio show---for free.

In other words, she DOES NOT respect a woman'sright to say \\"NO!!!!!!\\" To put it another way, if a womanis thinking she might want to get lusty with a man, andthen starts making out with the man, Laura believes thatthe woman has given-up her right to change her mind andsay NO! NO! NO!

No blame toward patriarchal laws, mysogynistic culture and still rampant sexism. Plus, she gets to have this high-powered career, while she seems to think that every other female should stay home and clean the house all day and fix dinner for her man, he of the fragile ego needing constant bolstering.Wake up, people. this is 2008.

The mornings when they find themselves together in the old kitchen in the house in Scotland, I find I am waiting for my turn to put bread in the toaster and enjoy a sausage and maybe let the dog out for a nice walk down the lane. Ms. Pilcher puts you right inside this beautiful and heartwarming story that's resounding message is that love and family don't always come with blood ties, but with people that truly care about each other because it is the right thing to do.

They aren't always perfect ; Elfrida, the main protagonist of this novel, certainly has her faults, but she is a \\"real\\" person. After reading many books by Rosamunde Pilcher and Maeve Binchy, I've gotten to understand the lingo; \\"grit lorries\\", \\"wheely bins\\", \\"trainers\\", etc. However, I have begun to wonder about the British diet - do all English, Scottish, Irish people eat a diet consisting solely of bacon, sausage and\\"huge macaroni and cheeses\\"? If you can enlighten me on this, please do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"winteer solstice","review":"while i am a huge Rosamunde Pilcher fan and just couldn't wait for this book to finally be released, I felt disappointed in a way. It's is a great book, but just didn't hold my interest like \\"The Shell Seekers\\" which I think is the best book of all time.i will always continue to buy her books though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Version Stinks","review":"The reader of the audio version of this book is awful. Speaking in a stereotypical, high brow British accent, she ruins a sweet and endearing tale. Misread words and poor choices of character accents and inflections abound. Better to read the book on your own in front of a warm fire, in a comfortable chair with a classical CD on rather than listen along to this reader's insufferable mutterings."},{"rating":"2","title":"So comfortable.","review":"Listening to the audiotape of this Rosamunde Pilcher book is like sitting down by the fire for a comforting hot cup of tea. And that's saying a lot because I listened to it over several weeks in my car during my commute. Her descriptions really give you a sense of place, and you really come to know her characters. Her world becomes so familiar, you're happy to be able to visit again and again, even if you're on the freeway in California and she's describing rainy Scotland. The only drawback of this audiotape for me was the narrator. She can have an awfully assertive style sometimes. I really don't think the characters were being as assertive as she was, half the time. But that doesn't take away from the story. Little could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait!","review":"I was so thrilled to find out Rosamunde Pilcher had written another book five years after writing \\"Coming Home.\\" This book was worth the wait. What a beautiful story! The characters were very finely drawn, and the threads of their lives intermingle in a fascinating way. I love Rosamunde Pilcher's minute, detailed description of her character's homes and environment and this book is no exception. She makes every word count. Despite having a bleak midwinter setting in Scotland and one of the characters coming to grips with his beloved daughter's death, this is an uplifting, satisfying book. \\"Coming Home\\" and \\"The Shell Seekers\\" are still my favorites, but I was not disappointed in this one. I hated to turn the last page and finish the story. I just hope we don't have to wait five more years for another book from this great author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we reading the same book??","review":"Having read The Shell Seekers at least half a dozen times, and having enjoyed Pilcher's other books, I was looking forward to this one. What a disappointment! It's been a long time since I read anything so contrived and predictable. The characters were superficial and one-dimensional, and the plot device of devoting each chapter to a different character simply did not work here -- there was too much repetition. It reminded me very much of one of those \\"Lifetime original\\" movies in which one can predict what will happen after half an hour. (Honestly, was anyone surprised to discover where Lucy would be going to school, or where everyone would find Oscar on Christmas Eve?) I was amazed to read so many enthusiastic reviews here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Draw up your cozy chair , fetch a cup of tea...","review":"Winter Soltice is not the type of book I would have thought I would have loved. I assumed that Rosamond Pilcher was like other popular authors: overly sentimental and lacking an ability to make characters truly three dimensional. I assumed WRONG. Her beautiful prose grabs you like a sunset in South Pacific: YOU MUST STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND EXPERIENCE IT. Her characters are so well drawn, that I feel like I have lost good friends after finishing this book. Buy it. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply a masterpiece!","review":"Rosamund Pilcher is one of my very favourite authors and this book is one of her best, or perhaps even her best book!the plot, after all these reviews needs no further description i think. i just wanted to say that this book, except being written in a very satisfactory way, has it all.love, tenderness, romance, coming of age, healing, restored hope and faith. and, on top of it all, Christmas.this book touched me deeply and ever since i read it i carry it with me as a maturing, educating, worthwhile experience.anyone, i think, who reads it will find a great part of himself or herself in it, one way or another.a tender book, full of warmth and heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't like the reader","review":"I am liking this book quite a lot except for the audio book reader.

I am from Liverpool, England but, I'm currently living in Chicago with my husband, so I love to read great descriptive books, as I miss home. This book was great at creating a mental picture of my home country and my favourite place in the world - Scotland! She is amazing at puting you in the picture, her characters in this novel are all very strong and equally interesting. Infact, I found myself wishing for a sequel to find out what happens in everyones lives - she could definately turn this novel into a series. Anyway read, enjoy and get absorbed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit predictable but I love her writing anyway","review":"I've gobbled up all her books. I love her non-judgemental approach to a wide variety of charactures, her sweeping vistas, her tidy comfy homes. Makes me want to go do the dishes. Although this was predictable and I felt like I had already read it, I still loved it. Read it now during the winter especially if you reside in a cold climate. This one would make an excellence Merchant-Ivory film. (Keep James Cameron away) Paul Newman as Oscar, Hugh Grant as Sam... To that end, even if it was a little thin as a novel, it made for a rich story. It did leave you hanging a bit as if a sequel was in the works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Pilcher's standards.","review":"I have read a few other books by this author and and found them to be engrossing reads. I want to say to anyone who is thinking of reading Winter Solstice to instead read her outstanding Coming Home instead. That is one of my aboslute favorites and is vastly superior!I was eager to read this newer novel , but saved it to enjoy around the holidays. I just could not be absorbed by this and found my self not really caring about the outcome. The characters lacked any depth, growth, and development. The story line was terribly slow and meandering. You realize how lacking a novel is when the most intersting character is Horace the Dog! A great disapointment.Pilcher is capable of so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertain Me","review":"I loved Winter Solstice. It was comfortable, like I was one of the family, sitting in front of the fireplace with a glass of wine. I love Scotland and could see these beautiful views so wonderfully described in the Highlands. Great story line that kept me eager to learn what are we doing and where are we going next. I the book made me happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"What a nice book! Nothing earthshaking or experimental, just a story about several people moving through life, making connections with each other, and finding happiness after loss and disappointment.Yes, the characters and plot are at times predictable, and not always entirely sympathetic, but they were basically believable, and certainly held my interest. It struck me as somewhat old-fashioned, but I found it soothing. Not something you'd write a dissertation about, but perfect for a vacation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best read in a long time","review":"It has been quite a while since I've read a book so absorbing as this one. I was hooked on the first page and hated when I had to put the book down, always eager to get back. This story held me under the same spell as Jan Karon's Mitford series. One can only hope that Ms. Pilcher is going to continue on and keep these people with us for at least three more seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Draw up your cozy chair , fetch a cup of tea...","review":"Winter Soltice is not the type of book I would have thought I would have loved.

Pilcher","review":"New fans or old, Winter Solstice is the kind of novel that makes you think of the characters while you are not reading! True to her writing style, Ms. Pilcher builds characters into a slow paced, satisfying story--no car chases or glitzy high powered moguls, but several meaningful love stories. I didn't want the book to end!! I'm hoping for a sequel in the same way she wrote September after the Shellseekers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Heartwarming, lovely book by this author","review":"I just finished this book and I loved it. It (like Snow Falling on Cedars) is one of those books that make you feel as if you are living in its setting. It is early fall here, but, when reading this, I felt the snow around me, the cold air, and the early sunsets! The characters are lovely and, as usual, superbly drawn. My one and only criticism is the ending, which may be just a little too pat! I highly recommend to anyone who wants a warm, relaxing book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A must for insomniacs","review":"I've read other Pilcher books and this was, by far, her worst. The characters were extremely boring and I had no interest in finding out about their lives. If you want a novel that will numb your senses and keep you yawning for hours, then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winter Solstice","review":"I just finished Winter Solstice by Rosemund Pilcher. I have read all of her books and reading this one was like sitting down with an old friend.My only criticism is the lack of closure at the end. We did not get to enjoy Christmas with the characters or read about the construction in the new house or find out if Carrie and Sam actually end up together.I do hope there is a sequel out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, plodding and predictable. . . .","review":"This is the first book of Ms. Pilcher's I have read, and sadly, it will be the last. While the story was initially engaging, it quickly became plodding and dull. Ms. Pilcher shows a tremendous paucity and redundancy of language, and the story was inconsistent in its details. It has the stereotypic and formulaic quality of a paperback romance novel. The effort to paint quirky characters felt flat, especially when compared to a classic such as Shipping News by E. Annie Proulx. Rather than connecting with the characters, I simply became bored and quit with 100 pages to go. A shame; I truly wanted to enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"winter solstice","review":"Other reveiwers have described plot. I want to say that I expected more. The plot was very predictable, simple and contrived. All and all this was a waste of my good reading time. I feel Pilcher has riped us off. It was not \\"Shell Seekers\\"!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Get It","review":"I am amazed at how many people like this book. It was a snooze fest for me. I love Scotland, but I don't need to read about it so much that it is practically a character in the book. I like more interesting characters and plots. To me, it was a boring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Mix","review":"I was just mucking around listening 2 some music when i came across this cd and i decided to give it a listen.

Stewart Brand reveals in the opening essay that he wanted to get hippies out of their heads, when they were busy protesting the war. So he organized a physical game, called Slaughter, where people had to work to pull (not push) each other off a mat. The games outlined in this book include some new, some old (British bull dog), and some that may have been new at the time but now are classics (Frisbee golf). Another aspect of this that seems dated is the attempt to bind in a book a lot of social practices that were evolving; it seems so compelling today to think of how much such a write up would benefit from being a web site rather than a paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hugger Mugger foam roller","review":"Had mine for about a year now.

Also, a wide number of the ideas contained therein were gleaned from '30s notions and various religions without reference, but (and you know it's a classic because) other small groups have since gleaned ideas (such as Thought Adjusters) from this book. So for some obscure reference possibilities, sure, maybe.For a basis of belief, though? If the universe is actually as crammed packed with such a tediously granular and rigid bureaucracy and hierarchy as this book claims, I'll side with the Rebellion. No, wait, the Rebellion Urantia style was too boring (involving comminiques and diplomats and lengthy debates, all of which was somehow cause to disintegrate Lucifer, simply for expressing and discussing his opinion).

Nita has captured the essence of the Cathars mystique with her own time travels of switching from present to past portals of experiences. I am ordering her second book to see if she does indeed walk between the veils of the imaginaire and speak their truth for us all. One would question if there is a global awakening occurring with such fascination in the obscure heretical Gnostics called the Cathars. Why I am saying this is another author, Barbara Burritt wrote her own personal saga of past-life recall from this same chapter of mystical power and agonizing persecution.

In total, a deep and interesting story which not only offers a lot of pleasurable reading but a fascinating look at some real, poignant history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, enchanting, and ultimately enlightening","review":"Past Recall shines a quantum light upon two eras and how they interlace -- which in itself makes for a solid, enjoyable exploration of history; the persecution of this unique sect of Christianity, and the later archaeological intrigue of investigating the lives of those who went through such persecution.The storytelling is, much like the philosophy of the Cathars themselves, dualistic. It shuttles between these timelines with an elegant beauty. Yet in unearthing the legacy of the Cathars, it showcases the horror and hypocrisy of the Church's handling (\\"Thou Shall Not Kill, anyone?\\") of this heretical sect. Author Hughes demonstrates a contagious enthusiasm for the Cathars -- their lives, philosophy, secret meetings in shadow, and the timeless sorrow of a people hunted and destroyed by a tyrannical religious regime. Hughes has done the Cathars justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve McQueen's first Bit Part","review":"This is a great film djrectefd by one of the best director's in film history, Robert Wise.

Both the characters and story are not very well developed in this one. I like my thrillers to be a bit more challenging and provide a little more excitement. I always liked the Will Lee character, so thought I was in for a good read. However, Will's role is on the sidelines and the new character, Kinney, just doesn't have a lot of depth.

The final chapters make sense and are certainly surprising. I enjoyed that book a great deal and was looked forward to reading more of his workI'm sorry to say, however, that while Chiefs seems to be the work of an author with a great deal of literary future, Wood's later books, including this one, show that he has sold his soul to pulp fiction - for the money. I have now read five of his later books, hoping upon hope that one of them would be as good as \\"Chiefs.\\" None are. They are predictable, boring, repetitive, poorly written. In each book many of the events are highly improbable and Woods stretches far, far too much to make the story continue into another smellable volume. Don't be fooled. They all get boring.

This book oozes of polital bias and a lame plot complete with the FBI director actually satisfied, well, let's say not disappointed, with the sniper shooting of one of the victims, a conservative SOB (all conservatives are in this book)who is a senator. As an avid reader, I just get tired of the same predictable stories and villains in current fiction. Do authors honestly think their readers are buying (no pun intended) this fodder? Woods needs to stick with the Barrington line and phase out the Will Lee novels if this is all he can come up with.

No character development; we get no feel for what's going through the characters' minds or why they behave the way they do. The liberals are all wonderful people.

The scourging scene lacked any impact, probably not to horrify the audience. According to evidence from the Holy Shroud of Turin and the witness of several Catholic mystics, His scourging was absolutely heart-rending in its horror. Of course, this being an obvious Protestant production, they gave short shrift to Jesus's mother, Mary! Maybe that is why they chose Luke, instead of using material from Matthew, Mark or John!!!

Also, the original Atalanta never loved any man (much less Jason) until Aphrodite, the goddess of love, tricked her into marrying someone (whom she grew to love). Every time Medea opened her mouth, any time she had a scene, I kept expecting her dark side to reveal itself. Unfortunately, it didn't happen.

While I was glad to see young children enjoying Beatles songs, I was very disturbed by this CD. First of all, why wouldn't the original songs by The Beatles themselves be good enough for kids? Are they inappropriate? Would they scare the children? I am really confused. So instead of introducing a child to amazing music, you give them versions sung by some guy and a bunch of kids? With cheesy background music? What is the point? Why bother with a mess like this? I can't even begin to comprehend the logic..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heinous","review":"Now I can understand why someone would allow Britney Spears and 'N Sync music to be sung by a chorus of annoying kids and a creepy older guy, but this is infringing on sacred ground.

What did these songs ever do to deserve such a horrible fate?Parents : News flash! There is nothing wrong with having your children listen to Beatles.

This is the second album I bought with Woody Shaw on it (the other being UNITY with Larry YOUNG 5 stars...). It makes you realize what a great trumpeter / composer Shaw was and what a shame was his early demise... This is the foremost trumpeter of the seventies, and his music is the perfect (missing) link between late 60\`s Miles and Trane and today\`s jazz scene, which still hasn\`t caught up yet IMO...

Its descriptions of procedures and the accompanying illustrations are a model of clarity. Its practical advice is cast iron.

He is a mainstay in my African music collection, which is sort of large.

The use of listing by genus and species definitely marks it as an educational book not a book for use by the general public. The lack of colored pictures of the plants is also unfortunate.

After washing my shorts and the bag, the shorts were fine but the bag had basically run and the dye had come out of the bag in streaks.

However, one of my magazines had a sample strip of this and I adored it. Since I wasn't able to find it close to home, I took the plunge and ordered from Amazon. When in doubt, check out Amazon appears to be my mantra. This fragrance isn't heavy or overwhelming or too sugary sweet. It's soft, feminine, and you have to be relatively close for it to be noticed. It has become my go-to and I'll definitely be reordering.

I thought listing the perfumes I wear all the time might help someone else make a decision. I am going to order the shower gel and possibly the lotion. I typically don't have everything from a perfume line, but, this one is an exception. The scent is light, and smells good on everyone as one of my friends has this.

I'm so sorry to have to say that this perfume completely disappears from my skin in 10 minutes. I mean, there's not a trace of the scent! I'm quite confounded actually. I can't believe that I spent $80 for a bottle of perfume that I literally have to carry around with me and spray it every 1/2 hour or so. :(I'm so sad...

If Hollywood made a lesbian film, then it would come out as crass and explicit porn junk, Hey folks I hate Hollywood And I hate America too. But putting my issues aside I love this film, and I might buy it. The actresses are beautiful and the story is sweet! I definately recommend this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"show me love","review":"Set in a small town is Sweden,a girls coming of age, and the realization of having no friends in a new town.

Finally she confesses her love to a drunken Elin at Angie's birthday party. After much sole searching, Elin realizes she to is in love with Angie. As the story goes, they lived happily ever after."},{"rating":"1","title":"Show Too Slow","review":"I don't mind subtitles. I don't mind coming of age movies. I don't mind movies about the misfit and the popular who get together. This movie is about all the above, and for me it was too slow. The story line has been seen over and over again. I had a hard time not wanting to kick the young girl underdog. Hey, get your head out of your ass. Her style grated. There's a scene where she disses a disabled girl. I don't see how that moved the story along. Basically, the movie irritated me. But there are a lot of reviews that say how great the movie is, just not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story About Finding Acceptance","review":"\\"Show Me Love\\" is the story of two teenage girls. Agnes just turned 16 and is alone at her school. She's also a lesbian and has a crush on Elin. Elin is 14, beautiful, and popular. The movie takes us through Elin's choice between Agnes and a boy and Agnes' dealings with her loneliness and depression as her sexual orientation becomes known to her classmates.An amazing story that could easily take place anywhere in the world, \\"Show Me Love\\" is not just a movie for those interested in gay and lesbian dramas. It is primarily a story about teens trying to find their way and find acceptance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This film is so touching. You don't need words, all you need is emotions for this one-of-a-kind foriegn film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is my favorite foreign film. It's a simple Swedish love story. The simplicity is the best part and it captures the liveds of teenagers well. The ending was a little weak, but the film as a whole was great. I could watch it over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow pace and unsympathetic leads doom this teasing film","review":"Neither of the teen-aged heroines has a spark of humanity. They are robotic avatars of stereotyped lesbian teens, and are manipulated by the writer and director into a totally unbelievable coming out moment that makes them feel triumphant--an absurd and silly attempt at resolution of serious problems. Before that the film drags as the two girls try and fail to make satisfying relationships with their peers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great film about life.","review":"This is a brilliant movie about the life of some people in a boring small town in Sweden. It's about being an outsider, like Agnes (Rebecca Liljeberg) and the difficulties about being popular, like Elin (Alexandra Dahlström), who discovers a new side of herself. This is not only a film about lesbians and a problematic love story. It's also a movie about life, love and about prejudice. Agnes mother says she has nothing against lesbians, but it's really hard for her to accept that her daughter is. All the charachters in this movie are very good, the lead characters are, and also the smaller ones, especially Jessica, Elin's sister, Agnes's parents and Johan and Marcus. And the actors are great in their roles.This is a fantastic movie about being young and all the problems that might be involved. And also about how difficult it can be to be a parent. It is full of great scenes, like the car scene and the toilet scene. And Elin's and Jessica's arguments."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:A wonderfully true movie about adolescence without a single false note, Show Me Love is unfairly pigeonholed as a gay/lesbian interest movie when in fact it's a sweet, heartbreakingly accurate movie about young love that develops likable, realistic characters and stays entirely clear of audience manipulation; it's a gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"a touching gem","review":"this movie is wonderful and heartfelt. Not only are the characters truly believable, the dialogue is very true to life. This film has become one of my favorites because of it's originality. Not many films can touch on the subject of homosexuality and adolescence without seeming too dramatic or over the top and unreal. While the scenario is common in certain adolescent movies, the entire film has a truly unique feel to it. From the type of camera used, to the situations present throughout, this movie is honestly a remarkable work of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"trash","review":"terrible artifical movie, disgusting. poor acting, too long , too boring, blonde bimbo was drunk did a dare and kissed and instantly in love with the deppressed girl, yeah ok! worst movie i ever seen"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't watch","review":"This was a really stupid movie. I am shocked that so many people liked it...the plot was soooo predictable and the acting sucked! Not worth my time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"I think I'm quite possibly the only person who truly dislikes this film. Both main characters annoy me. I really don't like either of them, and I don't see anything \\"real\\" about their relationship. Maybe I'm overly cynical, but I saw it as two girls with a shallow relationship which wouldn't last two weeks. I should probably watch it again, since everyone likes it so much, and see if I missed something, but honestly, I wouldn't recommend anyone watching it the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Class Act","review":"Many films pick you up and take you flying..however at the end you're looking for your ticket. The end of a film is the true test of whether or not the director knew where he was going from the start.\\"Show Me Love,\\"a fairly serious story about two girls in love with each other, ends on a light note with a girl on her bed talking about about drinking milk. This scene captures a transformation from the world of a child to an honest sexual relationship. Most films of this type wind up with a distorted ending(a disaster or a blaring proclamation)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"This was a good movie. I didn't like the subtitles, but they were really easy to follow.The acting was great and the storyline was good (the only thing I didn't enjoy was Elin whining through the entire movie).Fourteen-year-old Elin is popular at her school, where Agnes is very unpopular. Agnes has only lived in Amol for a year and a half.Agnes is in love with Elin. Elin starts to fall for her, but she is afraid of what her friends will think. Elin starts to 'date' a 17 year old guy who likes her (and whom she loses her virginity to; there aren't any sex scenes in this movie though, only kissing).Eventually Elin tells Agnes her true feelings, and the movie ends with everyone knowing they are a couple."},{"rating":"2","title":"FIVE","review":"this film totally woke up my belief for movies and their power when they're well done. every each detail in this movie 100% real. no half-stepping. i watched it yesterday and i'm still stoked..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving, funny and real","review":"This film is one of the best films I have seen for a long time. It depicts being a teenager in its true colour and steers clear of cliches we would normally find in a Hollywood teen movie. This is a very moving and emotional film and funny in places. I don't think I want to watch another American teen movie again as I would only compare it to the brilliamce of this one and it would not compare in the slightest. American teen movies are unrealistic, Show Me Love is a real and truly fnatastic film. 5 stars all the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"grizzled old fart","review":"my son from sweden came over, and what to do but to see the Van's Warped Tour?

This was a refreshing find, as many other bands could not crawl out of lower registers, so murky and bottom heavy as to be indistinct and growly, with pseudo angry exhortations ringing false.

I thought I'd try the memorex because they are inexpensive and what a mistake. I have had a 30% failure rate. I thought it was my burner so I bought a new Sony and the results are the same. The disks seem to work fine as long as the finished DVD is under 3.8 Gb. I can record a movie and it will play fine until the last few minutes of the movie, then it locks up the player. I definately won't use these for any important data as they are hit or miss. I'll spend a few cents more next time and get a DVD+r that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or money","review":"Like a previous reviewer, these disks are garbage. Here I sit with these worthless disks. Unfortunately I did not see his review until after I had ordered the disks. They will not burn video without error. The only thing good about the disks are that they have a superior printing surface, but without a superior burning surface they are worthless. I will go back to Verbatim in which 100% burned properly. I do NOT recommend the Mrmorex disks at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be wary of these discs","review":"While I'll admit that the price is right: $100 for 100 discs and that the printable surface is superb using an Epson R300 direct to cd/dvd printer... I've had many failures burning a full DVD with this particular brand. My other burns that only make use of 25 to 50% of the disc were great, no problems. It's just when I burn a DVD that has about 4.36 gigs on it that problems arise, with skipping, stuttering and sometimes complete failure to recognize the dvd from both my computer dvd drive and my set-top dvd player. In short, I can only recommend this brand if you plan on not using the outer tracks of the disc because I surmise the dye on the outer portions of the disc media is not consistent and will lead to burn and/or read failures.I recommend TDK brands at this time over Memorex brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP CRAP CRAP DVD'S","review":"THESE ARE THE MOST CRAPPIEST DVD'S EVER....THE PRINTABLE MEMOREX DVD'S ARE THE WORST....I JUST TOSSED 80 OUT OF 100 OF MY 100 PACK....THE BACKUPS OF MY MOVIES THAT I'VE USED WITH THESE DVD'S SKIP....I WILL STICK TO THE 8X SPEED DVD'S CRAP CRAP CRAP IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY BOUT THESE DONT BUY THESE...BUY THE 50 PACK MEMOREX AH THANK YOU"},{"rating":"1","title":"TRASH","review":"I have used Memorex without trouble until these printable to the hub ones.

The author's editors really let her down by letting this be published as is--there are lots of mistakes that simple editing would have corrected. Beyond that, the plot limps along offering no surprises, and the romance is not convincing. I will not be buying another by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor craftmanship, laughable lines, unbelievable denouement.","review":"Bad Moon starts off okay but rapidly tries to accomplish too much with too little attention to any kind of psychological reality.

I was looking forward to a good romantic suspense and instead got a mediocre murder plot and a less than satisfactory romance. The epilogue of this book tells the entire story in 4 pages while the previous 340 pages is fill. The characters of Eric and Christi are poorly developed. I couldn't feel for them. The romance between them is completely unfullfilling. In the course of about two days they fall madly in love and into bed. The author never developes a chemistry between them except for lust. The murder plot is as equally unfullfilling and less than suspensful.The killer, while not specifically indentified throughout until the end is an easy guess. Not a great reccomend for fans of suspensful romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Shiela at her best","review":"Ms. Jordan is capable of making some really wonderful music. This is not evident in this album, unfortunatly. She constantly pushes to be \\"cute\\" or \\"hip\\" instead of singing this material in a straight ahead serious manner. This is too bad. The bass playing is wonderful, but the vocals are self-indulgent and inane. When one measures this against some of her earlier albums, the result is not good. When measured against some of the other minamalist outings out there (like Michael Moores duets) it suffers even more. I am selling my copy to the local used CD store and rethinking whether I wish to buy any more of her more current material."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great help!","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It had a lot of helpful and realistic tips for brides on a budget. The author even made me smile a few times with her humor.

There aren't a whole lot of specifics, so if you are looking for great detail this book is not recommended.

I also likesd in the other books how Garion grew up etcetc. !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting points cannot save this book","review":"David Eddings' continues this horrible series with the same style as before. They ride, the reader gets a boring description, the characters make bad, stale wisecracks, they learn some small bit of information, and continue on. All to fulfill a prophecy that is pretty much just like the one in the Belgarion. Every reader knows the outcome and the characters. Eddings just decides to painfully fill in the small, boring details.This time, the get kidnapped by the Mallorean Emporer, and learn about the raising of demons from one of the many random evil sorcerers placed throughout the series. Same old stuff really.There was one point of the story where Eddings' seemed to have started something interesting. He describes a plague outbreak and it's effect on a city. For twenty pages, the reader is glued to the book. But, unfortunately, the interesting sub-plot ends and the monotony continued.This book was about 400 pages, but only 10 pages mattered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor!!","review":"Garion's son has been captured and our heroes wander slowly across the countryside to find him. Of course they could all turn into eagles or dragons and catch up but they are too busy being stopped by people that have no power to hold them. They are all basically omnipotent so can snuff out anybody that they don't like. If anybody slightly tough comes along a deity or something will pop up and handle it for them. They all like to make jokes while they slaughter people. In the previous series they went so far as to start a world-wide war just to create a diversion. Avoid this author!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Books Ever","review":"David Eddings, along with J.K. Rowling, is the best author i have ever read. His characters are funny and realistic, but not inhuman and stupid. The third book of the Mallorean Demon Lord of Karanda once again demonstrates his skill.Garion and company are captured by an emperor. when a plague breaks out in the city they are being held in, they must escape.They are pursuing Zandramas, a sorceress who has captured Garion's son.Vivid details add to this story as they journey after Zandramas in this exciting and suspensful book. Everyone should read the Belgariad and the Mallorean because they are so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eddings surpasses expectations","review":"David Edding is a wonderful fantasy/advnture writer. The depth of his characters and his intertwined plots makes all of his books hard to put down. This series of books was one of the best yet from David Eddings. I am looking forward to see where he can lead us to next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty much what you'd expect","review":"Okay, to be honest, the film's a bit of a snoozer. The acting is pretty much on par for these type of films, with the Russian taxi driver's accent particularly amusing. The special effects are mediocre and mostly limited to the first half. The second half is devoted to various uninteresting characters getting rescued or in the process of dying. Again, boring and nothing you haven't seen before or better, although the ridiculousness of Sharon Lawrence's character pseudo-rock climbing her way up a ruined school building to retrieve her son was unintentionally hilarious. This did not need to be a three-hour event, and when it's over your only emotion is relief that it wasn't any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The aged cheese of all time","review":"One of the craaappiest movies I have ever seen if not the craaappiest. Thats all that needs to be said here. If it were not so bad, I would actually take the time to name what makes it so bad. I would have to write a book about this one though.The only reason it has one star is because zero stars was not an option.Its beyond my understanding how anyone can give this a 5 star rating. This is the kind of stuff you see on tv and cant flip the channel fast enough away from. Rates just below the home shopping network.This is my first review of a movie after purchasing dozens of movies for years from Amazon. This movie motivated me enough to take the time out and warn people. It was that bad.The aged cheese of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friends close, Enemies closer","review":"This IS a book about writing incredibly formulaic screenplays period. For my likes and dislikes, I would refer to Blake's movie ideas as groaners. That said, I find this book to be INCREDIBLY HELPFUL, amazing, on laying out that Hollywood 'movie' formula. It's great for creating structure. I'm not expecting this book to make me a more intersting storyteller. But I've worked with a number of hugely successful film producers / directors, and for the most part, they comletely rely on formula. Now, it's YOUR job to make that intersting. It's your job to know HOW breaking that formula makes your idea work better. It's all really valuable information. Do other books cover this same subject? Probably. But since I don't want to waste too much of my time reading screenplay books, I found this one to give me exactly what I needed. And I'll make it interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"The book offers a few good suggestions, however it's mostly formula. Not for the Independant film writer. The book is a good shoehorn for writers hoping to write Hollywood Summer Tentpole films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brillant","review":"Blake did a great job of boiling down the whole process and made it extremely easy to understand.Not multi-layered like many other books.

I think Blake Snyder must be, personally, writing all of the reviews. Save The Cat! was just too paint-by-the-numbers to be helpful. If you need more proof of how bad the book is just look at Snyder's produced writing credits: Blank Check and Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot. It would be hard to come up with a worse pair of movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"I'm venturing down the path of novel writing, but bought Save The Cat! on the high recommendation of a friend who is writing screenplays. He was right! It's a fabulous book that I'll read many times. I found the Beat Sheet tremendously helpful in wrapping my mind around what elements constitute a great story. After reading STC! I feel I'm much better armed to create stories that people will want to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"For beginners only, then discard","review":"This is the cheesiest screenwriting cookbook out there, filled with \\"rules\\" that are nowhere to be found in countless great films but you can spot them very clearly in Hollywood's February releases. It offers a very shallow understanding of how dramatic stories work. For example, the opening image is apparently something REALLY IMPORTANT. What was the opening image in The Godfather? I forget. Who cares? What was important was the characters. Then pages 30-55 are \\"Fun and Games\\". Yeah, okay. Then there's the \\"bad guys close in\\" section - I suppose you can rent The Graduate and find this section followed to a T.FACE FACTS: The top screenwriters in Hollywood don't follow this formula any more than an NBA player practices his jump shot on one of those little baskets you hang over the door in your bedroom.If you want to write a first script, try his method. If nothing else, it's one way to try and write. But as you get better, you will realize this is grade school stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear and To the Point","review":"The book is clear and to the point dealing with screenwriting. The only problem I have, as someone completely new to the subject, is that I don't know the format for actually writing a screenplay.

This was an extremely fast read, and very entertaining and honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blake Snyder's Save The Cat! is brilliant, illuminating, AND FUNNY!","review":"As a young college student with a passion for film I have thought many times, \\"Hey! I can write one of those things!\\" Well, Blake Snyder is here to help! From Fade-In to Fade-Out, Save The Cat! is engaging, insightful, and impossible to put down. Furthermore it's EASY TO UNDERSTAND! Having no previous knowledge about screenwriting I was able to pick up STC! and, by the book's end, feel empowered and capable of writing a fantastic AND sellable script! Snyder's book demystifies the craft of screenwriting for us newcomers. How did they come up with that idea? How can I make my hero likeable even if he's a \\"bad guy?\\" What is a logline and why is it so important? From its 15 point Beat Sheet to the 7 Immutable Laws of Screenplay Physics, Save The Cat! explains all this and tons more in a way that's fresh and brilliant from beginning to end. Blake Snyder's Save The Cat! may very well be the last book on screenwriting you'll ever need!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for anyone interested in the industry.","review":"This book was recommended to me by a pro-screen writer who has several significant screen credits to his name. From the first chapter I was hooked. It completely makes sense. I am a believer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every writer should get it","review":"Helps you plot out your pacing so that your book never drags! Provides a template telling you exactly what needs to be happening at what point in your book by what page. (Obviously YOU created the outline for the action.)

Highly recommend to any author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly Insightful","review":"I was completely blown away by how insightful \\"Save the Cat\\" was. Snyder's overall theory of screenwriting is founding completely in logic but no one has ever articulated it so clearly. The book is filled with moments where I was slapping my own forehead saying \\"of course, why didn't I think of that.\\" He doesn't dance around the fact that he is a spec script writer and that his main goal is to write scripts that get purchased and appeal to large demographics and in his honesty about that he doesn't dance around telling you what you need to do to write a successful screenplay.If you are open to it, he'll force you to sit down with your original screenplay idea and rewrite the entire thing and it'll be better because of it. A must have for any director, producer and writer that hopes to work in the industry and understand storytelling better."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY HELPFUL BOOK FOR ASPIRING SCREENWRITERS","review":"I bought this book recently and enjoyed it a lot. It made a good companion to a few other screenwriting books I have. I am an aspiring screenwriter working on my first script.

Blake Snyder's style is casual and to the point. The book is filled with incredibly useful chapters thankfully devoid of fluff or or excessive wordiness.One thing to study is the \\"Blake Snyder Beat Sheet\\". It takes all the basics of structure and gives you a solid framework to start with, while at the same time being intuitive. Apply it to the next movie you watch and it'll make perfect sense.I recently earned a certificate in screenwriting from UCLA, and I recommend this book for writers of all experience levels, either as a refresher, crash course, or or supplement to what you already know.Mike Hultquist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy, shallow and uncool","review":"I read all the reviews and still thought with so many good ones the book should have something good. But no.He goes on and on about a lot of things that he thinks are right, without giving any explanation, expecting the reader to believe on it for the sake of it or because he tries using a lot of cool (or retarded in my opinion) terms for script genres / problems / tricks.Really amateur, not a deep insight into anything. u can sit down and read it at a library in 2 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just for Screen Writers!","review":"The loss of Blake Snyder was a huge loss to the screenwriting and novel writing world! Easy to read and entertaining, Save The Cat! is definitely the way to go for beginning screenwriters and those who wish to learn to analyze novels and movies for their structure. Each \\"beat\\" of the storyline is explained in detail with a multitude of examples from popular movies. A great tool for screenwriters and for novelists who want to take their plotting to the next level and ensure they have all the points before they get down to writing. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the perfect guide","review":"Here's a method that works from an author who's been in the trenches and is more than willing to share everything he knows.

I also flicked through the book at a bookstore. Let me say the title is very misleading. Aside from tips about how to sum up a film in a sentence (the log-line), the book didn't offer much. I also thought Snyder stuck the boot into the film Memento unfairly. Momento is mentioned in various film study books due to its creative editing and manipulation of narrative structure. Snyder's barbs just sounded bitter. Really, Snyder wrote (and freely admits to writing) \\"Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot\\". Is that the voice of wisdom? Log-line for this book: Old hack writer name drops incessantly and attacks independent films whilst offering little to no original information himself. Do yourself a favour and go and purchase a better book on this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired of the same old B-S","review":"Sitting across a Hollywood executive who holds this book as \\"THE BIBLE\\", I finally understood why movies fail at the box office. By using the same old formula, like the one Snyder suggests in his book, we are subject to the same old thing over and over again. Screenwriters are well aware of the likeable factor their characters have to have, but Save the Cat, does not reveal anything new we haven't seen from writers a lot more accomplished than Snyder. This book is overrated and is one more way of encapsulating writer's creativity into a magic formula."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusingly Enough...","review":"If one takes the time to IMDB the authors name, one will find two movies listed - Blank Check and Stop!

When I was 24 I decided I wanted to write a screenplay. I talked about it for a couple years, but could never really get started. Then a friend recommended Blake's book to me. I bought it and two months later my first screenplay was finished. I'm not saying that you buy this book, read it, and 60 some odd days later you have a movie. See, I had pretty much all the ideas for scenes either in my head or in my journal. Kind of like hundreds of tiny puzzle pieces scattered about. Blake's book helped me lay out the structure of my story before I started typing. Once I had that down, all the pieces just seemed to fall into place when I finally did start typing."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply put: a MUST READ","review":"I have read a vast number of screenwriting tutorials, STC! is far and away the best.

I'm extremely anxious to see how this script will be perceived in the marketplace. I always send my scripts in for coverage service, and this will be an interesting test. Will the editor/reader applaud my structure? I have a feeling he/she will.Blake is entirely genuine and entertaining.

Everything is useful.If you want to write screenplays for indie films, for purely artistic value then I do not recommend this book. It is for those who wish to screenwrite for the big screens. But even if you do write for artistic value, I still think you might get something out of it.Remember, this book is for those who wish to write and SELL a screenplay; so it's not just about how to write a good story.

They have become my Holy Grail of writing books for the way he helps you construct a story and I refer to them over and over again.I used to think I was strictly a panster (write by the seat of your pants) when it came to writing, but now I know that a good story needs that structure to take it to the next level.I don't think I could ever write another story now without checking my beats to make sure it flows well.Thank you Blake Snyder (and God Bless)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Heads up: suspicious 5-star reviews, glowing with cliched hyberbole.

It is geared to those who want to SELL their screenplay. That's what a spec script is. It's not pointed to those who want to make art or shoot their own script. People who want to be Chris Nolan or MNS or the Coens will need a production book.

I bought in on the referral of a novelist friend, and I've found it really useful for creating a strong plot backbone in a novel. I don't outline before writing, but I do in revision, and I find it very helpful at that stage, as well as for writing query hooks. There are a few differences between novels and movies--the text part of movies is much more simplified than books, and if you wrote your novel characters the way this book suggests, they would come off somewhat less than three dimensional. But books and movies are just different, and you have to pick out the bits they have in common when reading screenwriting books, and not worry about the rest.

Excellent resource for understanding the how and why of what makes a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Structure Rules!","review":"Blake Snyder has written a book that is literally \\"hands on\\" for screenwriters. With detail, humor and wise counsel Save The Cat instructs you on the creation of an effective logline, dynamic beat sheet - and, to my utter amazement, a board containing 40 3X5 scene cards. This combination of structural elements leads to an easy transition at the keyboard and a well conceived script.Snyder's approach is tried and true, based on his over twenty years of writing and SELLING his owns spec scripts. I have read many screenwriting books over the years - Save The Cat \\"is\\" The Last Screenwriting Book You'll Ever need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I thought that I had all the books on filmmaking I need to have. But I was wrong. I was still hinged to traditional way of screenwriting until I came across this book. The biggest trouble with screenwriting is to write second act (off course you need an idea too!!). This book addresses some of the inherent problems in traditional way of screenwriting. Although writer also admits that most of his beats are based on the existing framework but nevertheless thanks to Blake Snyder in identifying and demystifying the pattern. I also got his second book which is also amazing in its own self. Both of them recommended and considering the price it is sin for a film student not to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is no curtain!","review":"On the one hand, I thought this was one of the most brilliant books I've read for writers of all types. It explained exactly what I've been struggling to achieve in some of my manuscripts. On the other--I feel like not only have I now seen the man behind the curtain but the curtain no longer exists. It's hard to watch a film without analyzing since I read this book. I can't just enjoy it for entertainment's sake. No! While watching a movie, I actually said in my mind, \\"Oh, we've reached the fun and games part! Hijinks ensue!\\" DOH! This is the answer key--to everything--to every good story ever told.It'll make you a better writer for certain, but it very well ruin watching movies--especially those with poorly done scripts. Consider yourself warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purple Prose","review":"I almost never write a review, but this book is so poor that I felt the need to warn you.

No can't-keep-'em-straight-without-a-program Campbellian archetypes, none of the \\"script-Nazi\\" McKee Commandments.

The advice really isn't very good. When the guy's only two credits are \\"stop! or my mom will shoot\\" and \\"Blank Check\\", enough said! Don't emulate him. Try 'Story' by Robert Mckee or 'The Devil's guide to Hollywood' by Joe Eszterhas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hack Manual","review":"The dichotomy of Art and Commerce is especially stark in Hollywood. I guess there are people who say \\"I want to be rich, so I'm going to write a screenplay and sell it for millions of dollars instead of, you know, work or learn a trade.\\" If you are one of them, this is your book. But I think most people who actually take the time to write a full screenplay are doing it because they have a story they really want to tell. And this book will make those people want to tear their hair out.My friend, noted TV writer Eddie Gorodetsky says \\"Hollywood is the place where people run to where lightning just struck.\\" That's the operating principle in Save the Cat. And it's not completely stupid. People who buy movies want to buy what made a huge amount of money last. But if you have an idea for a movie that you want to make, or even want to see, this will not tell you anything about how to write it. It's all about sales and it made me want to puke."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad stuff","review":"This type of books is Hollywood's main enemy.

The read is relatively short and to the point, entertaining, concrete and if there were only three things I have learned from this book - that is the Logline, The Board and The Beat sheet - the book has enriched my filmmaking abilities. The only small downside I found was that Mr. Snyder seems a bit arrogant for my taste, but that's just a small speck on an otherwise great book. It is not the only read, of course, and I am currently reading Syd Field's Screenplay, plan a reread of McKee's story and have the Seger book on shelf - Save the Cat is definitely one of the very important books to read on the art of screenwriting.Kamil BeerDirector/Writer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Save the Cat is an excellent read!","review":"Wonderful book!

I think it's very helpful and a lot of the information is to the point. I've read and/or looked at other screen writing books and a lot of them are just so.... well... \\"wordy\\". I enjoy reading words (!!) but if I want to reference anything later, I want it to be quick. This book does just that, and I've found it really useful in writing my own screenplay.Sure, Mr. Snyder seems a bit arrogant about his big sell, \\"Blank Check\\", and some might think he is under-qualified but he has to be making some money or else he couldn't be writing this book.I've read some reviews that state he is only interested in films that made money and not about the arthouse films... Well.. I don't think he states that Arthouse films don't have artistic merit - but they don't make as much money. I think he's pretty clear that he's teaching the format for selling a screenplay, not art.If that's what you're interested in, or curious about, this is a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's love got to do with it?","review":"My book club selected this novel, and I was very glad to see it end! The title refers to the theme of the book--as one character says, \\"the mathematics of love defy arithmetic\\" (216). In other words, if a person feels physically attracted to another person, age, gender, and marital status shouldn't stand in the way. People who think otherwise are called \\"old-fashioned\\" 3 times in just 10 pages (311, 314, and 320). So although I found some of the information about photographic processes and the author's use of language in certain passages interesting, the disdain for and name-calling of those of us who are \\"old-fashioned\\" turned me off from this story very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best!","review":"I own this product and I think it's simply the best.

It costs as much to get a new pesticide on the market and takes at least as long as it does to get a new medicine on the market. Therefore any agriculturalists who are still in business use pesticides as little as possible because every time they use one it subtracts from their bottom line.I also think he has a very valid point about diets causing obesity.

Even though this movie is set before The Beatles were famous, it holds a distinction not far from the grunge holes and influences modern day rockers get their starts. If you're tired of hearing the numerous \\"Fab Saints\\" portrayal of the group, this is for you. It is hardcore, authentic, engaging, and retrospective look that passes as if it happened today. You'll miss Ringo, but a look at Stu Sutcliffe's relationship with Lennon, his death, and the former Pete Best on drums bring the story before Ringo to life. Astrid Kirchherr and Klaus Voorman are vividly portrayed in this wild ride of the early years. The Beatles...bad as they wanna be..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie that shows a different side of the Beatles.","review":"This movie shows us how the Beatles rose to fame in Europe. Between their high energy rock, and their black leather outfits, they could have just as easily fit in during the punk movement of the 1980's. A great treat for the eyes and the ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glimpse of the largely unknown proto-Beatles","review":"\\"Backbeat\\" provides a fascinating and alternative viewpoint of the pre-stardom Beatles. Ian Hart's jealous, sarcastic, and insecure Lennon is both fresh yet seemingly correct. Liverpool and Hamburg lay at either ends of the bridge between the sappy 50's and avant-garde 60s, and the film moves us across that bridge at the frenetic and raucous pace of the cover tunes of the then-Beatles' playlist. Hart and the actors playing McCartney and Harrison bear a less superficial and more unnerving resemblance to the young Beatles, certainly not in the way of a Vegas revue, and all the better for it. It's probably a good thing though that Stu Sutcliffe quit the band, if quite a sad thing he died so young. His continuance with the Beatles is one counterfactualist scenario I'm glad not to imagine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving story of obsession & passion","review":"Came on this movie accidently - Stephen Dorff is incredible as Stuart Sutcliffe (the 5th Beatle). Sheryl Lee transforms from a cold German beatnik into a passionate introspective woman. Backbeat delves into the strong, if unusual, relationship between Sutcliffe and John Lennon. I'm not even a big Beatles fan, but I really enjoyed this movie. I've done some research and it appears that the movie is historically accurate as well. The rest of the cast is convincing as the rest of the band (Especially John Lennon)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backbeat DVD is done right!","review":"I'm posting this review to let Backbeat fans know how great the extras are on the disc. The DVD is anamorphic widescreen. The features include the following: feature commentary with director Iain Softley, deleted scenes, interview with director Iain Softley, stills gallery, interview with actor Ian Hart, director's essay, casting sessions, and TV featurette.Ian Hart is my favorite actor and this is the role that introduced me to him. Backbeat is my favorite film and I am thrilled with finally having it on DVD. This is a film that you will never forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"First of all I am a huge Beatles nut so any movie made by them or about them i love. With that out of the way I can say that this was a very good movie.For those expecting a movie like A Hard Days Night, it is nothing like that. This movie is about John Lennon's friend who was the bass player for the Beatles at the begginging of their carrear. it shows how he lost his interst for music and fell in love wiht a German lady.

How did all that music start? Who got what idea first? Where was the genius in all of this? In this film Paul comes off like a choir boy younger brother to the controlling Lennon. And where the heck is Ringo in all of this? A mere mention of him! This is supposed to be a film about the greatest rock band of the 20th century and we're wasting film on a guy who never even did anything of any value with the group!

But, there is report of a company realeasing a new adapter to convert GBA games to a TV. So people who want to tranfer data, get it!

For Hot Wheels Velocity X, you get more cars, for NASCAR Thunder 2003, you can use your GBA to manage the data of your car, and you can go to Animal Island when you hook up the GBA to Animal Crossing!

Comedy that is completely over the top and unbelievable.Finding Phil & Ape in Paris? Finding Random Hero and Don Vito in Times Sqaure?

Maybe I'm too old for these toys.Definitely don't wear a dark color when playing with the panda: it shreds continually!My panda never held the bottle when drinking either. . . and hugging you. . . we'll see this afternoon at the party!

She loves Pandas and baby dolls - so has asked for this toy. Does anyone know if this bear can be dressed up and what size?

Sadly, this novel is an embarassment to both. While the culinary aspects of the novel do seem realistic, I had no empathy for Layla. As the main character, I found her utterly unlikeable and the plot to be completely unrealistic (especially the ending). I was not rooting for her... she was whiney, bitchy and a bit emotionally disturbed. The supporting characters were one-dimensional stereotypes at best.Even though it's a quick read, don't waste even a few hours on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Layla Mitchner is a wimp.","review":"As a cook in a three star restaurant, I consider Layla Mitchner an afront to women cooks everywhere. Any woman entering the culinary field knows that it has been dominated by men since Escoffier.

McCouch's Layla is the kind of character that sticks with you after you put the book down. The author has a deft hand with characterization and, with a few adroit phrases, brings even her supporting players to vivid life. I didn't want the book to end and was only consoled by the preview of McCouch's next book (Mountain Betty) that is included in the paperback edition.

Therefore it is hard to identify with Brady's professed disappointment with this trip.

Perhaps he is too young. But the video is rated for 4 months to 24 months.

It may, however, be possible too adapt some of the poses for a standing position and yet gravity affects the body completely differently when it is horizontal instead of vertical. The photographs themselves are very poor in terms of quality in that they are: muddy, bad resolution, slighty out of focus, badly lit etc. etc. etc. Basically this was a very disappointing purchase.

Read \\"The Egg and I\\" to find out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A breath of fresh air.","review":"One of the things I enjoyed about this book was the way the author was free in the 1940's to express her reactions to the cultural differences of her neighbors. No political correctness here. It may well be the fault of the anglo that the Native American (Indians, as Betty calls them) of the area live the way they do, but Betty doesn't waste time analyzing their plight. She calls it as she sees it. A drunk is a drunk is a drunk. I particularly loved the passage where she described the reason her husband can befriend men with deplorable behavior. She is a very astute observer of the difference between the sexes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BOOK OF WONDERS AND TRUTH","review":"This book is a great one for anyone who recognizes truth when they read it.

I agree with reviewer from The Netherlands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for children!","review":"I had read and loved all of Betty MacDonald's other novels before I picked THE EGG AND I up to read. While it is written well, it is not her best work and should not be pushed on children. The history of the Native Americans in the Pacific Northwest has been brutal enough without an ignorant white woman's veiws being passed down to further generations. There are so many wonderful books out there, especially for kids, this book is detrimental to the development of positive outcome in the Native American experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Was Shocked!","review":"I was so disappointed after reading the first page of this book onthe amazon website.

I don't think I could have then and I don't think I could now. MacDonald's bigotry toward Native Americans right from page one made me catch my breath! I stopped reading immediately. What an unpleasant jolt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"It doesn't get any better than this if you want to enjoy a move to the country story.

OK, so her veiws of Native Americans were really dated, but I don't think that ruins the book for all time! I'm sorry for those of you who miss out on it, it's not as well known as it should be.

VERY UNCOOL! and I'm very disatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ant Farm - worth the money!","review":"The Ant Farm was much smaller than we expected, but the blue lights make it interesting. The ants were very active the first couple days, building 2 different tunnels, but are now not so active. They are still fun to watch since some of them crawl through the tunnels, but most of them huddle at the bottom of the farm. Follow the directions and order Harvester Ants from any link off where you purchase the farm. They are big ants and are neat to watch. The best part - no feeding or clean-up! Overall, well worth the money, especially when you see people's reactions to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The base light does not work.","review":"I received my AntWorks ant-farm as a gift for someone else. It is very difficult to get ants in or dead ones out without a mass escape. There should be a better setup for opening the farm up. Once we finally got ants in it and got everything together, we discovered that the base LED lights only work when you push up on the plug area while it's plugged in. However, after quickly contacting Amazon they sent out a replacement with one day shipping. I LOVE Amazon...I've had such great service with them! Other than that, the gel is cool and the ants are already tunneling down the side and very interesting to watch. The gift went over quite well and with the lights replaced and the ants all finally in place I expect this to be a great little ant farm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ant farm on the market","review":"This is my first ant farm (over 30 yo) and it's great. I brought it to work and it's a good conversation piece. Another person has the Uncle Milton one and so far, they are working in this one MUCH faster (I have more tunnels in 2 days than she has in 2+ weeks). I assume the gel is softer and not sure how it will hold up, but so far, so good. I got the ants in about 4-5 days which was good and only about 8-10 dead ones out of 30.The light also works great and really shows the tunnels nicely.I am now looking at getting one for my niece who I think would really enjoy it and learn how ants behave."},{"rating":"1","title":"should come with label \\"lesson in misery\\"","review":"This was a sad experience for my 11 year old.

But then you have to pay for them (and shipping too) When you buy the ants you even have to tell them, after you get the receipt email, when you want them to ship the ants. All in all, not the best system for getting you a complete product. Almost designed so you won't order the ants.Oh and half of them were DOA. Not the funniest moment of a 4 year's birthday gift set up."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"This was well worth the money!

No need to add food or water - very simple. Cool tank design! Recommend sending away for the ants using the form in the packaging. Collecting your own can be a pain and risky in the south - fire ants! Also - if you mix ant types by mistake (they look alike sometimes) - you may have an ant war on your hands. Get the Ant Illuminator night light (sold Sep) if you can. Makes it even cooler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours Of Entertainment!","review":"Turn of the TV, and don't answer the door because this is one seriously addicting ant habitat! It took awhile for the ants to arrive (about 2 weeks) but just as soon as they came in the mail (via plastic vile) they were popped in their new home, and within hours they were beginning to dig a new tunnel! Apparently I have become super nerd because I love just sitting there watching all 20 of them move about, in army style! Definitely worth the money. A cheap thrill!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"We tried several times to get this product to work. We followed all the directions but the ants would only dig a little bit.

So happens that both of my children are studying insects in their seperate schools so the kids are taking turns taking the habitat, but today is my day to have it at work.Anyone that thinks ants come with ant farms is ubsurd and impatient. They would have all the tunnels started and you would miss the first stage of the experience. We woke some harvesters out of hibernation in our yard, and as they die, plan to add to our collection from the same anthill. What a pleasant study in nature to gather them ourselves!The lid on this model fits TIGHT! I broke 2 nails and ended up having to pry the top off with a stick. That was my biggest concern.

There is about an inch anda halfspace over the gel in the container so lookingat the product you may think the ants are far enough away from opening of the container and will stay contained. The ants however when they dig carry someof the gel and build it up on the top area. In the instructions you are given it states that the ants need air to live and to openthe container to give them air. however when you do this you are giving them an escape. My son was terrified when some of the stinging ants got out of the container and into his room. I think they need a better design or more space in the top of the unit. Also I know they do not send a queen ant but who's to say whenthey get out they cannot mate with ants in your home. Doyou want stinging ants all over your home? I'm guessing not"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time!","review":"This product is not what it seems.

We got about 15 ants in there and most died after a bit...we've got to replenish. Problem is... the ants found a gap between the gel and the side and worked their way down there, tunneling only along the side to the bottom and then a bit along the bottom, rather than tunneling through the center of the medium. I would recommend boring a couple more significant starter holes than the instructions suggest and make sure all the ants you collect are of the same type or it is more like gladiatorial combat than ant farming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"My kids and I have been totally fascinated by the ANTW2 Antworks Illuminated.

The ants arrived in great condition (only 2 dead). We dumped the ants in and waited about 1 day for the tunnels to start. Our family enjoyed watching the ants for about the first month. The ants would make tunnel after tunnel for days, we loved it. But.... After about the first month all the ants (who my son named Judy because you couldn't tell them about, you had to name them the same name) seemed to be on the top with all the little balls they had collected from the tunnel digging.. They we noticed the little buggers all around the top of the habitat eating the rubber seal. I could NOT tape the top of the habitat fast enough!! I don't know what would of happened if we never noticed them eating the rubber seal.. I think this is an awesome thing for learning about ants behaviors and watching them up close. However...

If you're new to Toot's music, this CD is a good place to begin. It has most of the essential Toot's songs (greatest hits). If you are a hardcore fan like me, it leaves you wanting a little more. I feel this disc would be nearly perfect if \\"Dreams To Remember\\" was left off and \\"Never You Change\\" and \\"True Love Is Hard To Find\\" were included. Aside from the early classics, the producers of this disc had the good taste to include \\"Freedom Train\\" from the \\"Toots In Memphis\\" album.

Mr. Koenig played a very important (and largely unappreciated) role in recording and thus preserving the best of \\"The West Coast\\" jazz of the 1950's. He not only supported Hampton Hawes through many difficult periods in his creative career, but also did the same for Art Pepper and who knows how many others.

The visual clarity is variable, but worst of all the speech is not in sync with the picture. This seriously detracts from the enjoyment of the film.

They take a single quote from a single one of Lewis' many books and keep repeating it over and over again as if that were all there was of his thought, philosophy, theology, or faith. The BBC production starring Joss Ackland and Claire Bloom does a much better job at presenting CS Lewis the man as we meet him through his writings."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing piece of propaganda","review":"C. S. Lewis, a tremendous and tremendously significant apologist for and teacher of Christianity, is here attacked using the medium of the motion picture - a powerful propaganda tool, because it bypasses the intellect, speaking immediately to the emotions and carrying with it the impression of personally having witnessed the events portrayed.Here Lewis' extreme pain and grief at the loss of his wife is used to undermine all his other work by the not so subtle insinuation that he cannot be taken seriously, having himself lapsed into doubt and criticism of God. That he recovered from his period of extreme pain and continued in his work is only very slightly hinted at.That he has now passed through the shadow lands and is now in the glorious reality of the presence of Christ is a cause of rejoicing for this faithful servent of Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woefully inadequate remake. Poor acting, poor directing.","review":"The BBC Original drama Shadowlands could not be outdone. I don't blame the 'starring' actors for wanting to attach themselves to the drama but they fell way short. Once the 1990's version was made, it should not have been released. The original drama is moving, the remake is laborious to watch. The attempt to attach the Narnia concept to a green valley, robs the viewer of their own imagination and again falls short of the writer's and original versions' directors' intent. I have studied the original from many different perspectives and find that the remake is lacking in the depth and multi-faceted perspectives. Was it dumbed down for us in the USA market?

I was so irritated by Winger's very very long drawn out death that I was overjoyed that she finally went.Don't be mistaken that I'm a cynic.

The movie is beautifully shot, faithful to the period in which it's set, and portrays an emotionally complex man who was perhaps unaware of his own emotional complexity. Marvellous, heartbreaking, and not \\"just a chick flick\\".

Unfortunately, my desk is not near a window and I cannot pick up a single channel.Overall, the device is OK for the money. It was relatively inexpensive.

These gates function perfectly for our purpose. They provide a visual and light structural barrier between our dog's area of the home and us and the baby. That said, our dog is respectful of the barrier and only needed a structural reinfocement for our own peace of mind. These gates would absolutely NOT withstand a toddler or a dog bumping up against them, pushing or jumping of any kind. In fact, even with very light use, I am skeptical if these gates will last more than a year or so, but that is probably why these gates are in the $40 range verses the $200- $400 range that would get you something very strong and immobile to cover such a large area."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of crap!","review":"It came broken, and I could tell by how flimsy it was that I didn't even want to exchange it!Returned it and bought something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Product Description Carefully","review":"Just received this but found out that the Manufacturer description above is incorrect (lists 28in - 103in).

Within 24 hours the hardware on the bottom was bent so badly it did not function, from my dogs merely putting their paws on the top of the gate and pushing on it with their noses to try to move it. We straightened it back out so we could use it again. We didn't use it for almost a month, then put it back up. My SIL's 35 lb collie mix managed to snap one of the upright dowels in half with his teeth and pulled it out of the gate.

I was finally able to use the thing only after I bought four #8-32 x 1 3/4\\" long screws with matching washers and nuts and bolted the middle of the gate together. I did this by unscrewing the original connection at the middle of the gate and overlapped the pieces together about 6\\" then drilling two holes about 4\\" apart on the top and bottom rails and bolting together.

The only issue that I have with it is that it is a little difficult to open and close and it doesn't retract very far, so there is constantly about 5 feet of gate extending into the room when it is open, but we usually just leave it closed and step over it.

Based on a true case in 1930s France, Richardson stars as Christine,the controlling older sister of the shy, humble Lea (Jodhi May) They go into the employ of a widow, Madame Danzin (Julie Walters) and her daughter. Walters is the kooky,tyrannical matriarch. While the Papin case was seen by many French intellectuals as an example of class struggle, neither side is particularly angelic.\\"Sister My Sister\\" is emotional and sensual-for a British film--compared to the cerebral French version \\"La Ceremonie.\\" Lea and Christine feel drawn to each other. In their isolation, they turn to each other. In some ways, the movie glamorizes their incest,but at the same time shows it as the result of their employer's controlling nature and Christine's mental illness.\\"Sister My Sister\\" is a finely done period drama. Based on the Papin case, it is a powerful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A startling drama/tragedy that tells a tale to alarm you.","review":"Sister My Sister catapults a shocking true tale of sisterly love that goes too far.

Has to be a film that will gain a following in the years to come. I myself thought it was disgusting. I was left agape and shocked. The story follows two sisters who grow into an obession with eachother that leads to horrifying conclusions. This film tells the truth in what love between siblings should be put a stop to when it started. In what I cosider...I have no words. The ending which is shocking, but I must admit had to be left to show was a, well satisfactory climax. But still shocking. I would recommend it only to the strong of heart and shock. This film as I said will be a cult favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfied","review":"I'm sorry to put this review up, but my DVD was contain a documentary or some sort, so, I was wondering, it is normal or I'm being unlucky and got the one that is being mixed upThank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable.","review":"If you enjoy solving a mystery and learning a bit about cultural differences along the way, give this book a try.

The exciting mystery features Christina Garcia y Grant, who, like the author is a burned out attorney, running a B&B to support her writing. She and a tough elderly mentor, a young attorney and a retired doctor try to free a Hermano charged with a murder that may have been committed by Satanists or Los Alamos scientists. Great reviews in Publisher's Weekly, Harriet Klausner, Today's Librarian, The Snooper, About.com < mysterybooks.about.com > Boston Globe and every other reviewer who's read it. About.com said that \\"The rest of this tale unfolds not only in the beautifully depicted local of Taos, but during the rich celebrations of ancient Spanish culture....\\" Klausner ended with, \\"...if the subsequent tales are half as colorful, mystical and alive as this debut is, fans will have a treat for years to come.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BOTHER...BUY ANOTHER BOOK!!","review":"I should have read the reviews BEFORE I ordered the book. First of all, the type is so small that I'm having trouble reading it, even with glasses. I agree with another person who reviewed this book, it IS bizarre. I'm trying to decide whether to get my money back and return it, or put it in the trash. Way too awful to donate to a library. My money back just might, in some way, punish the Authors.

Not as expensive as the Jeep Hurricane, however serves it purpose. Goes 2.5 and 5 mph with lock out for beginners. opening door and a working radio. It also has velcro seatbelts. Very pleased. Purchased for my two children ages 2 and 4. They both enjoy driving, and being passangers. Charge initially for at least 18 hrs and never over charger for more than 30 hrs. Mine came with the battery and charger. Look before purchasing a play vehicle for your kids if the charger and battery come or are purcahsed seperately batteries are around 55.00, and chargers are about 25. This definetly increases the initial purchase price. Shipping was on time and assembly was not to difficult. Be sure to charge vehicle before showing the kids though.... C batteries for the radio must also be purchased seperately.Very Pleased. This vehicle also does well on grass."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Parker Palmer","review":"This book tackles a process in very much the way reader's of Parker Palmer will expect. His approach to understanding ourselves and others, being supportive of others, and dealing with personal conflicts or dilemmas is consistent from book to book. His books and techniques may not be for the impatient, but that impatience may be part of the problem he addresses. I only gave this book a ranking of four stars instead of five stars because it does not go significantly beyond his other material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I have read the Courage to Teach and loved that book. A bit dry and sometimes, pedantic, it was still a solid book and I was excited to be listening to this series. Until I began.It is in an interview style with someone from Soundstrue. I struggled to listen to the entire thing. His work is lovely but his speaking style is not quite what I expected.I can't honestly recommend this CD set. I would encourage readers to check out his books. His discussion about how to find that place of balance is reflected in his writing and is valuable. It is simply hard to continue to listen to both the interview style of this set and the speaking style of Parker Palmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abstract","review":"I normally love books like this, and this one came recommended by a friend, but I personally was disappointed by it. It just isn't written that clearly, and starts to sound like \\"spiritual gobbledygook\\" after a while.

I guess I was hoping for some helpful techniques that would give me a little insight into myself and others, but all I came away with was a negative feeling for Mr. Palmer!At first, I thought that Mr. Palmer was advising you to follow your true self in your work and in your life! He has a rich and deep speaking voice that draws your attention; however, the more he spoke, the more condescending his words sounded to me! The packaging on the 5 CD's present him as an educator. I felt that his attitude is that of superiority and that he thinks that those people who don't agree with his philosophy have to be kindly shown the errors in the way that they think.When Parker Palmer condoned the bombing of the Twin Towers, by saying that the United States had treated others the same way, that was it for me! I wouldn't have decided to listen to these CD's had I known that Mr. Palmer also had a political agenda!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Living fully","review":"Parker Palmer describes a way of going more deeply into knowing who you are and who you can become by listening deeply to your soul/your deepest self as a guide within a respectful gathering of companions on that way. The title and subtitles tell the essence of that journey. I recommend this book without reservation and have created a Circle of Trust with people I know. Everyone rejoices in the format Parker offers, having glimpsed the possibility of finding the way to deep peace and authentic action in their lives within a supportive gathering of companions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo at the missing disc","review":"I got the package sooner than I thought I would which was very nice and there was no damage or anything of the sort. I open up the case and one of the discs was falling out. I open it further and disc 11 was missing, which has the same episodes as volume 11. After doing research I see Eureka Seven Vol. 11 selling for $40+. I don't know what to think of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing experience","review":"This is an unique movie.

I also think that this game seems to be a lot better than the fist version as far as features and graphics. This game, however, will not work if you own a new, redesigned Playstation2. If your console is a 75001, one of the new slimline consoles, this as well as 44 other games will not work properly. This particular disk freezes while loading new screens, as well as in the middle of driving/playing either locking up the screen or turning it black.

But it does get a bit old after awhile, not one that you can play over and over. On another note, this game has made several of my friends lose their lunches which is always fun at parties!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, spacey game!","review":"This game is great! It is a crazy romp through Japan-culture with an outstanding Jap-pop soundtrack. The music is so good you find yourself humming it days later. The plot: The King of the Cosmos has just recovered from a wild bender on undisclosed substances. In his altered state he managed to stumble around greatly and as a result knocked all of the stars from the Cosmos. Now the player, his Prince son, is assigned the task to roll up all sorts of earthly things and beings in attempt to make a ball (Katamari) big enough worthy to send back into the heavens to replace the stars.This game is addicting and is even better in a slightly \\"elevated\\" mind-set. I \\"highly\\" recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great game","review":"Great game to buy. found it here at the best price after hunting on some other websites. was worth the buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weirdest game ever?","review":"Okay, so the Japanese have given us some weird games in the past, and perhaps this isn't the weirdest, but it's definitely a shining star in the field.It's also incredibly simple: roll a ball around, things stick to it, ball gets bigger, bigger things stick to it.Music - great great great soundtrack. The songs will be stuck in your head, possibly at awkward times (at work, during the throes of passion, at a sibling's wedding, funerals, etc...).Game play - a few people say it's redundant, and it is, but for some reason most people never tire of it. The challenge varies by level, and is never ridiculously hard, but allows you to challenge yourself if the level isn't enough.Graphics - colorful and playful - this game was meant for children and probably for pot-heads, not for \\"realism in graphics\\" snobs.Final words: Play it. It WILL make you happy.Funnies for existing Katamari fans:http://xkcd.com/83/http://xkcd.com/161/"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tetris 2004?","review":"Addictive, deceptively simple, very well executed... Very basically put, you collect stuff by rolling over it with a sticky ball, but its amazing how gracefully perspective shifts as your katamari goes from 1 inch in size to 1 mile and from collecting shirt buttons to skyscrapers and bridges.And if you thought \\"All Your Base Belongs To Us\\" was funny in any way, you'll really enjoy all the story interludes.Be warned, the graphic approach is very very basic and will remind you of pixel art or C64 games at times -- this is no doubt completely intentional. But if you are looking for super-realistic graphics, don't come here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This is an incredibly addictive, fun game. Yeah, it is short, but for 20 bucks, quite worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"katamari damacy =)","review":"Fun game. Only problem is that until you get used to the controls it is easy to get a little turned around.

Did that monster truck cut you off in traffic? Roll him up. Did your little sister annoy you? Roll her up too! Anything and everything is yours for the rolling. Roll plugs off of walls and people off of the streets. Roll until your hearts content! You can even roll up the clouds. I'll be buying the sequel... once I'm done rolling up the world in this one!P.S. Don't forget the mini-game while the credits roll. Can you roll up all 195 countries?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only the Japanese...","review":"Only the Japanese could invent a game as strange as this. The intro is almost the best part of the game and should not be missed. It has dancing Panda Bears and rainbows, along with cows and other creatures. The game is deceptively simple. All you do is roll a sticky ball around and collect objects that are smaller than your ball. Eventually, you are able to pick up people, cars and skyscrapers. It doesn't sound like much, but once you start playing, it's hard to stop. I would definately recommend this game for people of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky Goodness","review":"This is a rare gem. When this game was released a while ago in Japan, hardly anyone thought that this quirky game would ever make it over here.This game is about rolling a katamari -- a ball -- over objects. Like a snowball, the katamari will grow with each object added and depending on the stage, will start out as a few cm high and eventually be able to roll over cities themselves.The premise is simple, and the graphics aren't mindblowing but it's genuinely fun, new and interesting. Most of the cookie cutter games dare not venture out of traditional mold, but this game begs to differ.In addition, it's $26.99 CAD! Show your support for one of the most original titles to be released this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORTH LOOKING FOR","review":"Easy, fun, and addictive.And the soundtrack is like nothing you've heard before.The most entertainment you'll ever get for under $20. Go out and find this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as weird as a Japanese Vending Machine","review":"Specifically recommended by X-Play on TV. ABSOLUTELY agree that the recommendation was good. I rolled my eyes at my wife when she wanted to spend 19 bucks on this game and I think I actually called it \\"totally retarded\\". She let me play it first and within 3 minutes I was hooked. She's not allowed to play it because it's MINE. ALL MINE... (Yes, I'm 29 years old and she STILL can't have it!). I'd recommend this game to anyone NOT looking for an advanced game requiring weeks of play and advanced storyline. If you like Tetris but want a little more variety and just a little more skill requirement (and a good laugh), this game is for you. There's something oddly satisfying by rolling over the dog and seeing his legs twitter in the air when 5 minutes earlier he was pushing you around... WEIRD? Yes. FUN? Yes. I'd say good for 12+ years because young kids may find this too boring because they won't appreciate how strange and cool this game really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"You've never lived life until ...","review":"... you've rolled up everything and everyone in your neighborhood, and eventually rolled up your whole neighborhood, into a ball. Believe me, you have never played a game like this. You will complete the game in 3-15 hours, but this is a game that could entertain for months -- you will probably find yourself coming back for much, much more.The only 'enemy' in this game is the clock - you are almost always playing with a time limit. Other things will bang into you and make you drop stuff off your ball, but nothing, not even the cops shooting at you, will ever hurt you. Your goal is usually to make the ball a certain size or larger, but the other, quirkier goals of other stages are one of the best parts of the game.The graphics, and the length of the game, are about what you would expect from a $20 bargain-bin game. But the good stuff - the depth of the item collection, the music, and the really good feeling of it all - are worth so much more than twenty bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift Idea","review":"I gave this product as a gift for one of my friends with a PS2.

And you can't stop yourself from going back and doing it more. The moment you realize you're addicted, and the sheer simplicity of the gameplay comes into full view, you realize the genius of this game. There's not another game like it around. It's more like a toy. Sure, there are goals to reach, and you'll reach them easily. But after that, you still won't be able to stop yourself from playing it. It's a relaxing pasttime.

I have also purchased the \\"We Love Katamari\\" game to add to her collection. It, too, is totally cool! Go for it! It's enjoyable once you get the hang of it. It's addictive.

I recommend to anyone, even if you're not terribly video game savy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for kids and grownups!","review":"I am not much of video games fan, but I like this game. I can see how it can get addictive, as you just want to play one more round to see if you can build a bigger katamari or another katamari. Our son loves the game.All the talking from the \\"King\\" between games, if you will, gets a bit tiring, but you can skip most of the talk (press X). One part of the game seems complicated (where you view your playing history among other things), yet our 6-yr-old doesn't seemed bothered by it and navigates the game much faster than Mom and Dad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stoners Game","review":"I got stoned one day in the park, we drove back to my friend's house, played Soul Calibur 2, then this game.

You learn about cultures, you can mash up a lot of things together, Godzilla, Ultraman, Dong, etc. Amazing fun, I hope a longer sequel comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gettin the Ball Rollin","review":"This is a great game. The concept is that you are a little prince with a sticky ball that can pick up anything. Literally anything. There are many hilarious items that you can pick up, ranging from small to huge. The learning curve is a bit steep, but once you get it, the game gets really fun. My only problem is that the game is rather short. I beat it in about 3 hours. I definitely recommend it, definitely worth a play-through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe the best game ever","review":"If you don't like this game, there is something wrong with you.

I bought it because I normally like quirky and off-the-wall, cute games and this looked certainly like a match.Wrong. Very. It is painfully, mind-numbingly boring. As repetitious as Tetris and with script as poorly written and frustrating to get through as, well, something like Zero Wing comes to mind, you'll wish it ended as soon as it begun. I'm not sure how long they really thought rolling around a ball would be entertaining, but it lasted about 20 minutes before I found myself wondering, \\"Is this all it has to offer?\\". Giving it a good while longer I found, yes, yes it was. Luckily I was within my 7 day return period and got a small fraction of my time, in the form of cash, back. \\"They\\" say in the description the cutoff age range of 20.

There is a reason it is selling for only 19 bucks, it is short, it looks bad and is not very much fun to play. You basically are introduced by some lame story where you have collect trash and build stars. The characters who do this look terrible, and you are expected to basically read about 10 minutes of dialogue before you start to do anything remotely interesting. For a lack of better description it is too Japanese and too weird for most people. I know people have enjoyed the game for the creative use of controls and simplicity of the game but what about every other component of this game, the camera - terrible, the story - aweful, game length - short, fun - for about 5 minutes.

We saw her sing live at Legoland in California last summer, and she has an AMAZING voice. What a talented young lady--the Lord has surely gifted her, and she uses it to His glory. O Holy Night is one of my favorite Christmas songs of all time..the lyrics really bring out the true reason the Son of God came...\\"long lay the world in sin and error pining...'til He appeared and the soul felt it's worth\\"...Her heavy R&B version--honestly--took a little time to grow on me--and I grew up on R&B--Qunicy Jones, Stevie Wonder, Prince kind of stuff-- but I love how she thinks and does her music \\"outside the box\\"--very fresh and different...something Christmas songs need!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very modern, very good","review":"This CD really shows what a talented singer Stacie is.

It's as if, every early on, Ray has decided never to take himself too seriously - and as you listen, you always have the sense that he would be just as happy in front of a slightly out-of-tune upright.This is a great disc, and serves the Bryant collector well as a great benchmark of his early work.If you are new to Ray Bryant, this disc. will have you asking, \\"How much better can he get?\\" Pick up \\"Somewhere in France,\\" for the answer to that question.As always, Ray plays without pretense or distraction. Music seems to flow effortlessly from him, as if he is thinking it, rather than playing.Big Ray is very cool indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"new mommy","review":"The mobile is adorable and it matches the bedding set well.

It is an incredibly difficult language, the main problem being the verb, which frequently must agree with the subject, the direct object and the indirect object. Not only that, but verbs can take different cases depending on what tense they are in.But if you still want to learn Georgian after all that, this is a good book to use. The dialogues are interesting, the vocabulary rich and varied, and the exercises are quite funny.Learning Georgian is no lark, but this is a well designed book that can help the persistent learner on his way. I'm on chapter seven, but I still have a lot to learn.jalian kargi cignia (It's a very good book)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really all that suitable for learners","review":"Georgian is unquestionably a difficult language for a lot of reasons. It would be good to have a book that teaches, say, the 1000 most important words, introduces verb conjugations gradually and simplifies a very complicated subject. Although the book does cover a lot of information, it isn't really all that suitable for learners. Perhaps in the next edition it could be revised to simplify the presentation of difficult grammar, to include more repetition of the vocabulary. It could be accompanied by a cassette of the vocabulary and the dialogues. That would make it much more valuable. However, Georgian is not an easy subject to teach and the author deserves commendation for at least making a brave effort. As to the comments of the other reviewers, perhaps they should be less sensitive to perceived slights. Why don't they write a book on Georgian language? Mr Hillary has made it possible for willing students to get a grasp of this fascinating language."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to make the Georgian language even more difficult to learn","review":"I agree with many, at least, of the criticisms already voiced of this book. The presentation is too often indigestible and confusing (for one thing, Hewitt apparently expects the student to learn whole lists of verbs or verbal phrases, including \\"you scratch your head\\", \\"you clean your ear\\", \\"you dye your hair\\" and \\"you wipe your nose\\", as examples of particular verb forms), and the dialogues generally seem more Martian than Georgian (\\"How green the grass is!\\", etc.). Could the author have been laughing up his sleeve?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Manages to completely waste a very good cast...","review":"In my book, the very worst films are the ones that take a lot of talented people, all of whom have done great work elsewhere, and deliver them into a cinematic meatgrinder. \\"Battlefield Earth\\" is one such film, and \\"Striking Distance\\" is another.This film manages to completely waste Bruce Willis, Sarah Jessica Parker, Dennis Farina, Tom Sizemore, Robert Pastorelli, Brion James, and Andre Braugher, all of whom are tremendous actors who've done fine work elsewhere. But in \\"Striking Distance,\\" it seems that they were all in it for a paycheck, and little else.When bad movies are filled with hack actors, and were obviously done on a nonexistent budget, at least you know the movie couldn't have been better.But when you have a bomb like this populated with this kind of talent, and obviously the product of a serious budget, the problem is that the people making it just didn't give a darn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Bruce","review":"This is a classic Bruce film where he is only slightly smirky, and very down to earth.

Sure, it's not Die Hard... However I don't think it's fair to compare every Bruce Willis movie to one of the greatest action movies ever made. It has more than it's fair share of excitement and the plot has enough twists and turns to keep me occupied. The opening car chase is top notch. There are quite a few excellent character actors who turn in great performances here... Look for Tom Sizemore, Robert Pastorelli, Andre Braugher, and Timothy Busfield (as well as his spindly little girl legs). It's not going to change the world. It's not going to make you forget Die Hard. It's a fun thriller... especially with a couple friends, some popcorn, and a few beers. Worth a rental!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it's almost a parody of thriller cliches","review":"The Bottom Line:A movie that Bruce Willis (who has been involved in more than his share of terrible films) has publicly apologized for, Striking Distance seemingly leaves no stone unturned in its quest to include every conceivable cliche of the genre, from its generic thriller title to its obvious red herring character to its one-note depiction of every character; completely unredeemable, this film should not be watched by anyone.1.5/4"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's the best cop? Not this movie.","review":"\\"Striking Distance\\" was one of the weirdest movies I've seen, because by the time the movie's over, you don't see a point to it. I'm not saying you shouldn't see it, but the fact is the plot is predictable and pointless. The killer is no big suprise, and the characters are just not as intriguing as John McClane or Martin Riggs. Playing Sarah Jessica Parker as a cop was somewhat confusing, and pairing off with Bruce Willis did not work; they're just too different. Although the setting was terrific and the cast allstarred, the movie is over-the-top and as unconvincing as they come. The scene where Tom and the killer are going head-to-head is actually laughable: the guy just doesn't know when to quit, and neither does the screen play.

From acting to script, it was absolutely horrendous. I could go to any video rental club, walk directly to the ACTION or SUSPENSE section, close my eyes, and pull out a random thriller identical to it!

I actually find him much closer to John Hiatt (post Bring the Family) in style. Excellent songwriter who I think is an album (uhh, CD) away from knocking us out with a classic. The first cut, \\"Down to the Well\\" with Lucinda Williams is amazing as is the last 30 seconds of \\"Burning the Church House Down.\\" I'd like to see a bit less of the rockabilly that shows up on a few cuts and more focus on his own sound which comes through loud and clear on \\"Marina Takes Her Aim\\" and \\"Down to the Well.\\" Overall, a solid effort by an emerging star."},{"rating":"2","title":"a searching heart","review":"you keep on walkin' up the \\"Promise Road\\"...you can't read the signs, there's no destinations, no arrival times, you can do what you want, you can do what you're told...\\" this body of work is truly a soul-seaching gem of a record.

The acting is heartwrenching and the music takes on a life of its own. I deducted a star basically because the garbled accents made it so hard to understand, I missed some of the dialoge. Watching this film requires patience and a love of youthful dreams and screaming guitars. I highly recommend it to anyone who savors rock n' roll movies and teenage violence.

I'm U.S. Navy (Retired). And I have never, ever, heard such needless foul language even from drunken sailors, as is in this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"OVERLOOKED COMING OF AGE MOVIE","review":"Quadrophenia is an overlooked coming of age movie. It is the type of movie that is usually always available at you local video store, because most people don't know about it. This film was made by the Rock Group THE WHO!! Completely different format than THE WHO's Tommy. Quadrophenia is also historically acurate, in that it takes place in Great Britian during the Mod and Rocker gang riots. Quadrophenia is about a mod teenager named Jimmy who is questioning authority and life in general. He is taking drugs, kicked out of his house by his parents and is contimplating sucide. This film is very relivent even today to most teenagers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost flawless","review":"I only have two technical qualms with \\"Quadrophenia.\\"1-The mix of the movie is awfully, awfully muddy. I've seen it both in the theatre (albeit several years after the release in a university theatre) and on video. I hope they've gone back and worked on it, with the Dolby and all.2-Like most English movies from the 70's, the transfer of the film, that is, the way that it is colored just before the film is released, could've been pushed a lot harder. Makes it look dated, which I guess is sort of good, as it is a snapshot of an era.One of the many good points about the film is that you only physically see The Who twice-once in poster form and once on the telly. I applaud the self-restraint.Otherwise, I gotta chime in with the fact that the film-perhaps more than any other film-really influenced my life. It did for me what \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" did for a lot of other people. I own very few films, maybe five or six.

Ich bedauerte damals, zuspät geboren worden zu sein, zumal diese Jugendkultur bei uns in Österreich lediglich eine Minorität darstellte.

Quadrophenia is one of my favorite 'albums' (that should be a hint as to how old I am). Having said that, I must say that I was vastly disappointed with the movie. I found the main character to be a whiney little turd who I was relieved to see drive himself over the cliff at the end of this abysmally boring 'movie'. I got my own Quadrophenia straight from Pete and the boys. It's much better in my head than on the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget the Movie, Listen to the Album","review":"As musicians, The Who were geniuses but as film makers, they were failures--and this movie proves it! Quadrophenia's plot is weak the acting, writing, and directing are equally abysmal.Although the album \\"Quadrophenia\\" tends to be complex and over-produced, it still has a lot to recommend it. \\"Quadrophenia\\" was also one of Pete Townshend's most ambitious and grandiose projects. Unfortunately, this grandiosity does not translate well onto cinema.\\"Quadrophenia\\" the movie is, at best, flat and banal. At worst, it's an extravagant ego trip on the part of Messrs. Townshend, Daltrey and Entwistle. Fortunately, after this fiasco, the surviving members of The Who decided it was time to give up on making films and go back to making music. Unfortunately, in the ensuing years, they didn't do much better in that area either.If I could, I'd give \\"Quadrophenia\\" a zero. Bottom line: Don't waste your money on this movie.

Sting prances about as the Mod leader (yeah, right) and once poor Jimmy loses everything from his dim girlfriend to his home and his belief in the Mod ideal, he tries to commit suicide, but stops at the last minute because he is too scared, like any sad white boy. The soundtrack from the Who is equally awful, since the Who were one of the WORST bands ever.In short, this grimy, cheap Brit movie tries to explain to day to day suffering of the poor white boy, and succeeds as an exercise in in self indulgence and pretentiousness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, useless product","review":"This item was initially sold under the Sonoma Reserve label.

They are under the control of the evil Grimes family, and the physical and emotional abuse they suffer is pitiful. The children are helpless with no one capable of liberating them except Mollie the oldest. When the abuse leads to the death of the youngest child, Mollie is moved to an act of courage and manly heroism that any generation can learn from. Excellent movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pickford's Best","review":"Any doubts that may be held about Mary Picford's skill as an actress and the validity of her screen persona can be put to rest after watching \\"Sparrows\\". This is an absolutely beautiful film, and if they were handing out Oscars in 1926 Pickford would surely have been a contender.The plot is faux-Dickens and it would be easy to sneer at the film's overt optimism and dated sentiment. But its a lovely film all around, with just the right blend of comedy, corn and thrills.A special nod to some of the most beautiful camerawork I have had the pleasure of witnessing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary, Mary, your movie's quite scary","review":"Listen, contrary to the above, them ain't real alligators in the swamp chase; I saw it on a theatre screen, and I'm pretty sure I glimpsed their strings.That said, this movie is scrumdiddlyumptious. It might be sentimental, but it's also macabre and intense enough that I've occasionally seen it referred to as a horror film. The atmosphere is so thick you can almost smell the swamp. I fell for it completely and was gasping through it along with the rest of the audience.Pickford wasn't the shrinking violet her current image might suggest; as here, she played strongwilled girls who held up under awful conditions, and in real life she was one of the most powerful women in Hollywood's history.

I have always been interested in her because she is, after all, the most memorialized female in American history. My renewed focus on her, of course, relates to her newest and greatest memorial -- the Year 2000 Golden Dollar Coin. In the back of my mind, I have wondered why half the historians say Sacajawea died in 1812 and the other half claim she died in 1884, and there is also no firm affirmation regarding her gravesite. Well, at last I accept the conclusions registered and documented in SACAJAWEA: Her True Story. The one and only Sacajawea grave is on the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming. I believe, at long last, that is a vital revelation concerning the most memorialized female in American history. Now I wonder if the anti-Wyoming historians, such as Steven Ambrose, can sufficiently challenge Mr. Haney's biography of Sacajawea.

I previously bought cheaper brands , dynamic health and smart basics because of lower price. I have to say this one from genesis today is way better. Doesn't taste bitter and is not diluted with so much water than others. It is expensive , but I will buy another bottle if I have to. This time from vitacost. I think is worth buying.

Following 1998's 'The Best Of' and the UK only 'The Collection' (released early 2001), this is already the third 'greatest hits' set of this dance performer. Unfortunately it's also the worst collection. Just like the 1998 official collection it focuses on album cuts rather than single remixes, which is always a mistake as her remixes are often much better. 'Gypsy Woman' is featured in an awful version and 'Say... If You Feel Alright' is missing. The only interesting thing is that it includes her rendition of 'You Turn Me On', which was previously only available on a film soundtrack. Other than that, it's more of the same and only interesting for fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid dance collection","review":"I know the 20th Century Masters collections get a bad rap but I rather like them.

Once I replaced the cable, I was still very disappointed. I was able to get 4 channels pretty well. I am about 15 miles from Baltimore and 25 miles from Washington, DC. In the analog days, I could get about 10 channels from Washington and Baltimore. I even put the antenna outside the window facing Baltimore and although it was better, It was still unsatisfactory. This antenna seemed to work much better on UHF than VHF. I never could get our big networks here(NBC, CBS, and ABC). I only got 45-1, 45-2 and 56-1 and 56-2.Finally, I returned it to Amazon.

The only problem is when she dose she finds herself drawn into a world of vampires, both good and evil. And if she dosen't look out Lily will get caught in the crossfire. Sound good? Well it is. Usually I can't stand comic books or graphic novels but this one took me by surprise. It was a great fast paced read with an interesting story.

I was pleased with that. Everyone talked about how much nicer the quality is of these sets. I do agree that the quilt is really nice, and I like that everything is in the set together.

The crib sheet is very difficult to put on the mattress, and after a few washings it tore in two places!. The bumper pads do not fit snuggly on the crib, and only have ties at the top. I thought this was how all sets were made. I am pregnant again. Another beddingset was purchased for the new crib, and the sheet fits great, the bumper pads have ties on top and bottom, and the set washes better...and it cost less.

Then, one of the ties just fell off while my husband was tying it on. The bumper also didn't fit correctly on the crib--that could be because the crib is made a little differently than most, but even still, it just seemed very generic to me.

This is a cute show with silly chipmunk antics. Kids will get a kick out of watching recognizable snacks pour out of cupboards as Dave tries to catch them in his kitchen, which ends up in a big mess. Who would have thought it, but Dave's surprise house guests turn out to be the perfect accompaniment to his music writing, which has been pathetic and going nowhere. Life gets a little crazy when the singing trio achieve star status and face some of the challenges that go with it. Dave and the chipmunks bond and have ups and downs like a real family.

David Cross (the voice of Remi in Ratatouille) is perfect as the jerk you love to despise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taylorr's Review","review":"Why this is a good movie!I personally like the Alvin and the chipmunk movie because of its sarcastic humor and its characters. Alvin is the hard headed leader of the group & can't really say anything without being a jerk about it. Theodore is the cute but stupid one and is the one who eats the most so he is a little clubbier than the two. Simon is the smarter of the two siblings and is the backup singer for the band. In the movie the chipmunks are tired of the forest life and end up in a Christmas tree till they meet Dave the song writer for a big record company that just fired him for a stupid song about death. The boss of the record company is Ian who thinks that he found the chipmunks and wants to take them on a world tour but takes it a little too far but you have to figure that out when you see the movie.

It was much better than I expected. From the trailers on TV, I worried that there might be too much crude humor, but it was very minimal.

Fun for a family movie night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love those little chipmunks!","review":"The movie was funnier than I thought it would be. I loved hearing those little chipmunks sing and they looked so real that I began to think I could go out and get our own chipmunk that hangs out at front door to come in and sing too. It was hilarious watching Jason Lee make their little costumes for them and try to teach them right from wrong. The tree the chipmunks lived in was cut down and hauled into a big city and the little guys had to hid out in Jason's basket to get out of building. When they saw how he was struggling to produce something new in the song industry, they had to help out. He had to teach them about keeping the home clean. The messy little things wrecked his home in no time and he told them they would get, uh...rodents if they didn't keep it cleaner. Hey, they turned out to be great housekeepers!

The only part of it that did make sense was they were actually chipmunk size. While in the cartoon they're about the size of 7-8 year old kids. Still modernizing the costumes I can see plausable but removing the aspect of Alvins signiture red ball cap? All 3 have Sassy additudes, Don't seem to mind giving Dave grief and trouble, are self centered and don't have that looking out for each other bond that made them endearing on TV.

Maybe it's not for a 4 year old (or younger) but honestly, I won't be letting them watch it when they are 5 or 6 even. They have a lifetime to learn those words so I don't want them to learn them from Alvin and his brothers now.

Calderon has written a classic comedy that follows the formula but ventures into classic philosophy as well: what is our life? Is it real? Is it a dream?

Her children are grown and her husband is locked in his own demanding way. Shirley has nothing to lose in this journey that might change her ordinary life.Pauline Collins' \\"Shirley Valentine\\" won Broadway's Tony Award before winning an Academy Award for her leading role in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shirley Vallentine","review":"Shirley Valentine has enjoyed screen and stage success as the story of the ignored and unappreciated British housewife who finally has it up to here with her demanding husband and clueless daughter, secretly running off to Mykonos, one of the Greek Isles, for a change of emotional and attitudinal landscape. Once she ditches her self-absorbed female companion on the trip, Shirley settles into an unexpected romance with a cafe owner (Tom Conti) who reminds her just how lonely she's been. Her decision not to return to the U.K. and stay at the hotel cafe to serve guests puts her husband in crisis and a little self-examination of his own as he packs his bags and heads for the Greek Isles to fetch her. Pauline Collins is witty and charming and very funny as Shirley Valentine, especially as she succumbs to the affections and flattery of her younger pursuer."},{"rating":"2","title":"YEAH SHIRLEY!","review":"This is a great flick when you just are down on the world or are feeling used by that certain someone or that certain no one. Earlier reviewers have given you the plot line, so I will not add to it. What I will say is that you definately come away from this film wondering if you can afford a plane ticket to Greece. Pauline really is Shirley Valentine and we are all lucky because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It just doesn't get old","review":"I have lost count of the many times I have watched this film - can quote it almost verbatim. I finally had to buy it and, after all these years, Shirley has lost none of her charm. The quotable lines are as quotable as ever (\\"A microwave, Wall, what is the world coming to?\\"), but what really makes this a classic is that the human condition will never change. Generation after generation will be able to identify with this wonderful character. Over the years the minor characters have also become more well-known, and the comic turns of Julia McKenzie (\\"Brussels - bloody Brussels\\" and who can forget Claymore the vegeterian bloodhound) and Alison Steadman now evoke a special smile. Not, of course, to forget the Fabulous Joanna Lumley. But it is Pauline Collins's film and her many hilarious glances into the camera is what makes this film a collectable. There really is only one word for it: great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still have not received","review":"I still have not received this item.

You know when you're reading a good book or talking to a good friend and they just \\"get\\" everything you're feeling? There's hardly a better moment than that.

Please, powers-that-be, bring out a region 1 version for us Yanks who also love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Trust The Viewer","review":"This could have been a very good movie; the under-appreciated housewife daring to go off to Greece without her husband, having a brief and refreshing fling with a sexy Greek man, and an ultimate reconciliation with her husband. The problem with the wife character is that she tells the viewer everything, every single thing that she is feeling, how she is reacting, posing questions to the audience, etc. So much of what she told the audience could have been brought out with non-verbal gestures, facial expressions, and good acting. The viewer is not trusted to be able to tell what is going on with the main character; the viewer is told how to feel, with whom to sympathize, and is actually lectured on middle age angst; really, we are smarter and more perceptive than that. It's like putting a sign on a tree that says \\"This is a tree.\\" This story's approach might work on stage, but, on the screen, it is annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freedom from the daily grind","review":"It was fun to enjoy Shirley's escape from her daily grind and the boredom of her daily unappreciated life, plus enjoy the romance of breathtaking Greece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This movie is as hilarious as it is sad.

So when i got my new M515, i bought these screen proctectors. They are not smooth, but rather a textured surface that on the color screen creates diagonal lines similar to a color Tv with bad reception. The look of the screen is opaque. Also, i find the the grafiti recognition was greatly REDUCED when I applied these protectors. Bottom line. Not worth the [money]. Try the clear ones made by NuShiled and CompanionLink. But do get a screen protector. It will scratch eventually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beats NuShield","review":"I saw the rave reviews for NuShield and ordered them instead. Frankly, I'm disappointed. The NuShields arrived quickly, but were heavily spotted and very cloudy. The first one I installed was scratched too much to be useable within an hour. Considering the NuShields are five bucks per sheet, I was severely disappointed. I've used Fellowes sheets on two different types of Palms (Vx and Tungsten T) and although they're not crystal clear, they hold up and do what they say they will do -- protect the screen and remain read-through-able. Also, they don't glare in high light (NuShields do this even in minimal light) and the Fellowes don't reduce the apparant light from the handheld itself (the NuShields cut the apparent light by a good 50%). I'll be sticking with the Fellowes in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money.","review":"These are a joke.

Like pattern theory, how things were roughed out before a finished product, fitting, style adaptations, how and by whom garments were fur lined. This is a very historically helpful book that provides too much information to possibly cover in review. It also includes pictures of period garments inside and out. And has pattern layouts.

Layout is a MESS!","review":"This book seems to be a very nice and informative book, but the Kindle version renders the text incorrectly. No matter if you read on the Kindle, with Kindle PC or the Cloud Reader, the margins, the centering, the page layout is broken. So if you follow the Kindle edition, you are wrecking your script, and learning from the wrong examples.E.g. \\"Dialog\\" is too widely formatted, and it seems as if it was directly aligned next to the left margin (erroneously). Also, Courier/Courier New is not used consistently.This book should be especially very carefully rendered for Kindle, or better, distributed as Kindle Print Replica, so that the original layout is kept intact.I returned my electronic copy, but will probably get a real book though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy the Kindle Version","review":"This review is for the Kindle version only!!!

If you're writing a script and need to know how to express the idea you've just come up, this is an excellent reference book. I use Final Draft, which formats everything correctly, but it can't tell me if the point I want to make is written in the right way. As you work, keep Riley's book close by to refer to. It's a good idea to go through the entire book first to know what's there, then to begin writing. Use it to look up how to say something correctly.

It has a little side spin to the right but otherwise it is very accurate. This gun is actualy only fully automatic, the only reason it says it's semi-automatic is if you pull the trigger back a certian distance is shoots out one at a time but any furthur and it is full-auto. The force grip is kind of wobbly and I can't get it to fold up. Also the safety goes further than ON/OFF, if you push it far enough it would fall out. The speed loader that it comes with is very handy without it it would take a very long time to load. It says it comes with 5000 free BBs but i never got them. So far i have found a few pointless things on the gun. There is a slide on one side of the gun and a cocking mechanism which do absolutly nothing, but with all that said it is a very good gun.

I was not impressed with this quality, but was not given many options on the return.

First of all, it is not 300 FPS, more like 80-100 FPS. After charging it overnight, I took it outside and began to shoot it. The first few shots sort of rolled out of the barrel slowly and then the rest of the 25 shot clip sprayed randomly at a rate that wouldn't hurt at a point blank range. The accuracy is garbage, the clip capacity is garbage, and the gun quality is garbage. The scope is nothing more than a couple pieces of plastic and a clear piece of glass.If you are into airsoft wars, do not even consider this gun as a sidearm, let alone your only gun. people would run right through your shots,and wreck you. Honestly, you would be better off throwing BBs at your opponent, this gun does no hurt. This gun takes about 5 shots oozing out of the barrel, and then it only shoots 20-30 feet before hitting the ground. It is consisted of cheap plastic, and it actually smells bad when you shoot it.

While the border is cute, and is a WONDERFUL addition to our nursery, it was very difficult to put up. We followed the directions to a \\"t\\", but for some reason, the top edge was not sticking. It looked like there was no glue on this part of the border. So, we figured out a trick...wet the border, and put on the wall where you want it. Wait for about 10 minutes and start pushing the glue FROM THE BOTTOM. With glue at the top (glopping out of the top), wait for another 10 minutes or so. THEN push out the rest of the glue. We still needed to work the top edge with a damp cloth for a good while, but it did eventually stick.So, while the border is cute, be ready to spend an entire afternoon putting it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess!!!!","review":"I love this set -- I've invested in almost all of the cute little accents that are offered. However, my experience with this border was horrific. First of all, I was assuming that the border was a self-adhesive (easy on, easy off) material. Every single other child's room border I've ever bought has been. There was nothing on the wrapping for this product that said differently. That being said, it was a total mess to try to get this up on the walls. We soaked it for 10 seconds, as recommended, and ended up with dripping streaks of gray glue down our walls as we scrambled to get the soggy mess adhered (straight and without bubbles) to our walls. We finally gave up and pulled the whole thing down before it could dry completely and ruin our paint.They should offer this product in a non-permanant version.

When I was smoothing it onto the wall, the portion without glue, of course, wasn't sticking. So I tried getting some glue from the middle by moving a damp rag along it. I was able to do this, but the edges still stuck up. Now that it's dry those edges have rolled up slightly. I just hope over time it wont become worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Border Instructions","review":"I love the design on the border, it's going to go really well in our nursery.

She hits the ball out of the park! Mariza loves poetry and she loves sharing it with others in a most powerful way. Her performance leaves my bones vibrating like the strings of a cello. Be sure to read the lyrics in English and Portuguese at Mariza's Official Website. Click on \\"english\\", then on \\"lyrics\\". It helps also to learn a few Portuguese words so you don't lose your place while listening to the song.Do not confuse this DVD with the one that comes with her CD of the same concert. That disc, also very worthwhile, is a documentary about Fado music.The last two lines of \\"Recusa\\" read,\\"Entao eu nao sou fadista / Eu sou mesmo o proprio fado\\" (!) When you translate that while listening to her sing it, you will know something profound about Mariza."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariza carries the freight","review":"Like Andrea Bocelli, when in need of soulful transport through solitude, I turn to Mariza's fado concert in Lisbon for surcease. She always delivers.Their capacity to contain, form and express intense emotion is an extraordinary gift from the Gods to all who can receive.Viewing the concert's DVD is an additional treat, but of a different order.I recommend both -- for different moods --in your home discography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fabulous music, live recording sucks","review":"Mariza has a great voice and her music is just fabulous. This recording is mediocre at best with people shouting from the audience and clapping with the music. It feels as if you are in some yankee-doodle get together. In some instances, they have dancers on stage and you can hear their feet and people cheering for them. It feels as if you are listening to the Nashville Grand Ole Opry Dancers on Radio. Pretty awful. I guess you'd have to be at the concert in order to enjoy this CD. Otherwise skip it. To have audience participation rob you of the purity of Fado is something that I don't appreciate.I bought this CD after I saw Mariza on David Letterman and she was simply fabulous. Fado is to be enjoyed for its purity of sound, beauty and sadness. Also shame on Mariza's publicists for promoting this CD on Letterman when they should be promoting a non-live (and non-hick) version."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've read over 60 of Grey's books and this is rates high.","review":"As a lover of the American West, I have read all of Zane Grey's western novels.

The innocence of the relationships during this time period is just as exciting as a modern novel. I highly recommend this book as reading for all sexes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this an unauthorized printing?","review":"I absolutely loved this book when I read it at 12 years old, at 21 years old and I wanted to read it again and have my own copy.

The setting is early for him, taking place toward the end of the 1700's. The story was reminiscent of James Fenimore Cooper with the earliest settling of an area east of the Mississippi, as well as dealing with the native American tribes of the era.Pros: an easy read. Based on historical facts. Interesting details about the native American tribes.Cons: plot is predictable. Contains some violent, graphic fighting, mostly against the native Americans. And as this work is somewhat genealogically biographical for the author, I found the author's descriptions of his forbears to be a bit over-the-top perfect.Add one star if you are related to Zane Grey or other early settlers of Wheeling, WV. All in all, another great free Kindle read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Historically fascinating!","review":"No one can write a story like Zane Grey. He may be a bit hard to follow but you have to remember that he wrote these books prior to the 1920's. Everyone should read at least one of his books and take a good, honest look at the world he describes. Hardships were on EVERYBODY but the dedicated made it and established our nation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad It's Funny","review":"This novel is interesting only if you want to get a close-up look at the value system of the late 19th/early 20th century. The language is repetitive, the characterization one silly cliche after another. Grey is terribly earnest about saving pure and silly maidens from savage redskins. One of his \\"stalwart\\" protagonists is a serial killer. Really. Save us from the good ol' days!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as predictable as other Zane Grey novels. I've read maybe 20 or so of Zane's books and have always enjoyed them.

This book was written from a different perspective and I found it just wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time ever reading a Zane novel...","review":"...and I really enjoyed it. The chapters were all very long but it was nicely done in the way where he gives us a change of scenery and place where we can take a break if we wanted to.

Emma Bovary, tired of her never-home husband, goes out of her way to get caught in strings of contraversial situations in those days, meaning: Making out w/a man who's not her husband. A vivid psychological novel about the corruption of a woman, who is comparable to Edna Pontellier of THE AWAKENING. Highly refreshing, easy read, and definately worth reading more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Depressing","review":"Self destruction is a terrible thing to witness, but Flaubert's style is unreal. Must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"utterly boring and bland","review":"When I started reading this book for school, I thought I had already read some really banal books, but this has to top them all. It is so eeriely similar to the Awakening that I found myself subconciously comparing them at every possible chance. Emma's actions are so close to Edna's that the two women seem like they should have been born sisters. The way that they treat their husbands and the responses they receive are almost indentical. What I find so irksome is the way that Emma refuses to see through her thick mind the consequences of her actions. Unlike Edna, Emma completely ruins her child's life along with her husband's. This tale seemed like the exemplary tale of a woman's scandelous attempts to find love from page 100 and Flaubert manages to drag the story on for 300 more pages. There should be no pity for the \\"heroine\\" Emma, only a wish that she should have received her true comeuppance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Vapid& Hysterical Woman Throws Herself Away For Love","review":"This book was so lame, it took me many years of putting it down and picking it up again to get through it. Why did I waste my time? Because all my cool literary friends just love it and find it sooo very deep. This story is just tired, sexist and overdone. Something about the French writer (of the 18th & 19th centuries) compels him to draw tawdry sexploitative portraits of wealthy women who throw their entire lives away for some hot action. Even Kate Chopin, who is only Cajun, felt the stirring in her blood to write the same idiotic tale in her novel \\"The Awakening\\" (another book to be avoided like the plague). Most mystifying of all is that many people, even intelligent friends of mine, consider this whiny breach of taste a passionately real and pro-woman statement!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would anyone read this thing voluntarily?","review":"Every time I have to help a high-school student or college freshman slog through Madame Bovary, I find myself wondering why the assignment isn't a violation of the Geneva Convention. I'm as dedicated a soldier as any in the war against illiteracy, but there is such a thing as an inappropriate and inhumane weapon.Bovary is boring, melodramatic, and as likely to break people of the habit of reading literature as to improve their ability in it. (It is, however, and interesting test of whether a person has more honesty, or more pretension. If you pretend to like this thing, you may be a pompous egghead.)If you have a choice at all, please, save yourself: back away from this title and none of your innocent brain cells will be needlessly killed.

I'm sure when it was written it showed a scandalous look into the life of a French house wife, but it has no relevance to modern life. Not only was the main character bitter, depressing and loathsome, but the drab and dull look into the French country side was almost enough to put me to sleep. I only trudged through the book in hopes that there would be a spectacular ending to make up for the slow pace and repetitive nature of the book, but alas, I was wrong. For I was greeted with a heinous ending that was not only unremarkable, but even more disappointing as the book itself. There was no obvious point to the book, although a deeper look did show the moral. Unless you have nothing better to do with you life, I recommend that you skip this so-called \\"classic.\\" For no matter what language you read it in, Madame Bovary is tres horrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Overrated Classic Ever (including \\"Vanity Fair\\")","review":"I am not writing this for those who, by their nature, love everything classic. If you start reading \\"Madame Bovary\\" and, for whatever reason, like it after one hundred pages, then great. I am writing this for all those who get one hundred pages into it and wonder what the big deal is. There is no big deal, and you should quit at this point and not waste any more of your time. The entire book is just as boring as the first one hundred pages. There is nothing-- NOTHING-- worth continuing for: flat stiff characters, no real plot, and stuffy stupid language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consider when this was written","review":"I just want to remind everyone that this was written in a time when the definition of womanhood was how well you married. Of course Emma was undeveloped, when did she have a chance to be? Women were encouraged to define themselves inside a marriage or a family if at all. The novel is more Emma's quest to find herself, and much like Kate Chopin's The Awakening, it only ends in tragedy. Think, people, think!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Original Desperate Housewife","review":"This book will never make it on the Oprah Classics Booklist...too dark--which is shame. It is an amazing story of a woman, and more amazing--it was written by a man. Where did he get this knowledge? How did he understand Emma? This was in the days before therapy groups and tell-alls. It is also a masterful book about lust and the cult of idols. Since I first read this book I remember what Flaubert warned us of...do not touch the gilt (the gold leaf) on our idols, it comes off on our hands. A warning as we worship at the altar of celebrity. This is a book for today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"A beautiful, brilliant book with one large flaw: it was too easy for Emma to cheat on Charles. Charles is a good-hearted, well-meaning but stupifyingly boring person. The book would have been better (and more believable) if the choice to cheat on him would have been more difficult. I love Flaubert, but Charles Bovary is possibly the most uninteresting person in all of literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK it's a classic, but it bored me to tears","review":"This is one of those books where I can see why people consider it a classic, at the same time that I wish I'd never been forced to read the silly thing. Some classic books are hold your breath reading. This is smother your yawns reading. The grammar and prose are not enough reason to read the tale of a silly woman and her boring husband. Though if Emma were real she'd be a hot candidate for the Darwin award. If Flaubert was so bored by his story and subject, why should I be interested in them?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Queer Story","review":"I was surprised to find so much drama in this book, for a turn of a century book, you'd think it'd be about tea and horses, NO!It's about adultry, suicide, depression, all the \\"hot\\" late 20th century topics. It's well worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modest doctor marries a naive women.","review":"I think it one of the most interesting books of French literature. The style is very good, espescially if one knows that Flaubert used to shout all his sentences to find out whether they sounded pleasant or not. The details about Emma's life and thoughts are so full of sorrow...The end is rather hard to believe, and that is why the book is for me the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wOw!","review":"I would have hated being the husband of this woman. She was a total ditz and had no brain at all...oh wait, she's only a fictional character from a genius of pessimistic works: Gustave. Wow, what was that? Deja Vu or something?

There are some classics that can be hard to read with the old language the writers used even with some modern translations. \\"Madame Bovary\\" was easy enough to read and I enjoyed it very much so, despite the story not being a happy one.Of course I don't want to give anything away but even though Madame Bovary can be a selfish, twit but in the end you do want her to find happiness. I will soon read a recent author's continuation of the story of Madame Bovary's daughter Berthe in \\"Madame Bovary's Daughter\\" by Linda Urbach. That seems to be the hot thing for the last five years, that of authors continue the story of classic stories. Jane Austin's is the most popular of course, so I hope a more obscure classic and continuation is just as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"hot garbage!","review":"I had to read this wack siht for class and I must say, overrated garbage! why does everyone think that just cause a novel is pre-1900s its such a CLASSIC. smh. madame bovary lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very descriptive book","review":"The author of this work of literary merit uses vivid description and imagery in his novel.

Then, he sees the woman's hand and thinks it looks like an almond and is impressed with it because she is ugly and her nutty hand is beautiful and he falls in love with her.

And, if there were any doubts, he knows very well how to use words. This work is a perfect union of his poetry with captivating music. His famously rough political assaults are not missing here (\\"Canzone per Silvia\\" dedicated to Silvia Baraldini), but overall nostalgia and the wise observations of an experienced literature teacher predominate. Above all, besides \\"Parole\\", there are the beautiful \\"Samantha\\", a sad ballad of suburban life and love in Milan, and the very ironical \\"Dovevo fare del cinema\\" (\\"I should have been in the movie biz\\"), an entertaining description of how image is running our life.

As they get involed with each other again, we learn about their relationship and why Bruce Wayne became Batman through an effective series of flashbacks.

Burton's Batman is good, but as I've becoming a bigger Batman fan, I've realized just how wrong it is. The Batman isn't quite tortured enough, and there's just too much camp and not enough grittiness (and this is Burton we're talking about, not even Schumacher). Batman and Batman Forever aren't bad, but Phantasm is just infinitely superior. Keaton was a good Batman (by far the besty, but Kevin Conroy absolutely owns him. And if you'd ever told me that Mark Hamill could out-act Jack Nicholson, I'd have told you you're crazy, but Hamill's Joker is simply hands-down the best incarnation I've seen outside of Alan Moore's classic \\"The Killing Joke.\\"I first saw this about two years ago, when I was 15, and even then I was surprised at how dark it was, given that Batman: TAS had always been relatively tame in terms of death and whatnot.

Sorry, though only one pops into my mind, THE TRANSFORMERS: THE MOVIE (though only one video release has kept its theatrical rating of PG) was rated PG. I do not know if it was the first or not, but that is what it was rated.

Whatever you'd want in a movie (action, tension, romance...), you'll find it in spades here.Please do yourself a favor (especially if you've had to suffer through the live action movies) and PURCHASE this video.

There was a period of about ten years in which I didn't watch it and stumbled across it about this time last year. Remembering how much I enjoyed it, I popped it into the VCR (yes I still have one of those) expecting my memories of it being seen through the nostalgia filter. I was wrong.

I thought the animation was great, sometimes cartoons distort the characters too much, either by having too sharp of features or doing freaky things with their eyes (like The Spectacular Spiderman) but this animation was perfect. The story was good, I even enjoyed sitting down and watching this with my kids. My kids usually watch this on the Kindle and the quality is fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best Batman film before Batman Begins.","review":"As I said in the title, this movie is probably the best Batman film before Christopher Nolan's reboot of the films, Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. This movie has everything there is to be loved about the old TV cartoons from the 1990's, Batman: The Animated Series. It's just all around a good movie. Adults will enjoy this movie just as much as the kids will."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of these...Please!","review":"WB should produce more DVDs of this kind...great animation, full length, fantastic musical score, and simply different from what is available. Obviously, this is a well-thought film. Too bad we have to wait for features to be released in theater before we can see something like this on DVD.I hope the guys in WB will do more of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Batman movie, ever.","review":"Better characterization, better story, better action than any of the live-action movies, including the first one. Compelling, thrilling, and just flat out fun, the way a superhero cartoon is meant to be. It's not deep but it sure doesn't insult your intelligence, either. Easily one of the best retellings of the origin of Batman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Batman: MOTP is a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone who likes anything Batman! I must say, that when Joel Schumoucer (or however you spell it!) took over the Batman movies, it was a disaster!!! However, this made a great alternative to stupid (and I put an emphasis on stupid!) Batman and Robin! I mean come on! Tim, why couldn't you have directed the others too? I give this movie 5 stars for great action and a great storyline! I only wish it would come out as a live-action feature!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars for the movie, but...","review":"I really hope WB goes back and makes a 'special edition' of this movie someday. The movie is great, but the picture quality on the DVD leaves something to be desired, as does the so-called \\"widescreen\\" version, where they basically just put black bars on the top and bottom of the screen (not kidding - compare both versions and you'll see what I mean; same goes for the uncut version of Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker, which unfortunately was only available in widescreen). But all quibbles aside, this is a great movie, though I really wish WB would quit with the \\"matted widescreen\\" crap and do a better job on the picture quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it , Love it","review":"This soundtrack is the best Batman soundtrack I have ever heard!It includes every moods you can think of; excitement, mystic, romance... just like the animated movie itself. If you have seen this movie, you will love the last song 'I Never Even Told You'. It revealed the feeling of Andrea Beaumont (Bruce's old lover), touching and moving.This is the only Batman soundtrack that I don't have to skip any song out! Every songs in this soundtrack really have the power of bringing your mind back into Gotham!Buy it! You will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Few cartoons stand out like this one","review":"Even if you aren't a Batman fan I recomend this. I do like Batman myself and am a fan but not a hardcore one. The animation is terrific the voice talents in this movie are perfect. Mark Hamill of all people doing a terrific voice-over for the Joker, who would have thought? That right there is enough to see this movie and it's not just for kids either, most of the content is adult oriented and geared towards how Batman really is. Few of the Batman live action movies were this good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Batman.","review":"I'll keep this review short. This movie is arguably the best Batman movie ever, it has a great story, a nice little twist, and it captures the character of Batman/Bruce Wayne.This is not just a \\"cartoon\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Batman Score (unfortunately edited)","review":"Great Batman score (as good as Eflman's two), but unfortunately, the score has been edited to 34:47 min (actuall length, 55:45 min), is no longer in print/for sale (I got mine from eBay), and some classic music is not included.Still, the music rocks (w/ the fantastic Batman T.A.S. theme by Shirley Walker) and can probably be found on eBay or at Flea Markets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman Mask of the Phantasm","review":"This movie is really good.

This movie is based about an old girlfriend of Bruce Wayne's who returns to Gotham,and at the same time a series of murders are being committed by a mysterious figure called the Phantasm. The story also includes numerous flashbacks to the creation of Batman. The film has many twists and turns and deserves to be seen by all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman at his best, but a mediocre DVD","review":"This is one of the greatest films of all time. It has an intense, suspensefull, interesting plot, wonderfull voice tallent, a great musical score, and a very stylish, magical look to it. And when I love a film this much, I'll buy it on DVD, even if I have it on VHS. Unfortunately, I must say, buying this DVD was a waste because it had next to no special features. The only two were the theatrical trailer and the abilty to switch from standard format to widescreen (the widescreen was a real treat, though).My message is, if you don't allready own it, buy it on DVD. If you got it on VHS, don't bother"},{"rating":"2","title":"Animated Batman is the way to go","review":"The animated Batman film -- Phantasm -- and the Animated Series are definitely the way to go for the Batman fan who also happens to be a comic book fan too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe this is the Best Batman Movie Ever.","review":"Batman (Voiced by Kevin Conroy) has to face a new Anti-Villian named the Phantom, who has been Killing Dangerous Gangster for Revenge.

Extremely Well Made. Grade:A-."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Bat Man Movie","review":"This, in my opinion, is the best Bat Man movie ever. It's got everything: great plot, great villians, great music. Here's the basics plot...Someone's been going around killing well known criminals, witnesses see a dark shap in a cape and assume it's Bat Man. The cops go on a man hunt for him. Meanwhile Bruce's old flame shows up and complicates matters. Bruce has a lot of flashbacks about how he first met Andrea and how he became Bat Man (lots and lots of flashback) Meanwhile Sal the Weezer figures he's next on \\"Bat Man\\" kill list so goes to an old partner to seek his help, the Joker. Well Joker figures out that it's not Bat Man doing the killings (it's funny, i won't ruin it for you) and they all (Bat Man, Phantasm, and Joker) show up at an old World Fair thing and duke it out. The ending is a bit of suprise (at least it was for me) Like I said, this is a great film, so watch it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but not at the same level as Batman or Batman Returns","review":"Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm is the first movie of the animated series. (Contrary to what most people believe, the animated series' batman theme was composed by Danny Elfman). Shirley Walker's use of the choir for the Main Title and Batman's theme was suprisinly good, a new element for the Batman Theme. The music for phantasm, unfortunately, sounds like a cliche from old horror films. Shirley Walker's composing style is dark and Elfman like, but it doesn't match at all Elfman's gothic style. Unlike the movie, Batman, batman's theme doesn't show up much. If you are a TRUE Batman fan, I suggest that you get this soundtrack. If you don't, you probably won't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tony Lang has kicked it up more and more!","review":"I have been an advid fan of the band for over 4 yrs now, watching them grow and produce some of the best sounds out there, \\"as we move on\\" and ' falling for nothing' kicks some serious you know what, they have almost perfected thier stage presance and have been expanding thier sound to a Matchbox20 meets Third Eye Blind kinda. watch for a new album to come out soon, and dont forget to call the radio stations to help this great band out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as mike farley","review":"I've seen this guy play twice now at the Odeon, while I was at a couple Mike Farley concerts. I had high hopes for this band, as they are good friends of Farley and work together often (he produced Mike's new CD). Unfortunately, I was slightly let down. Many of thier songs are just watered down rock and roll. They are entertaining, but not very strong. One song did stand out however, and it was unique and surprisingy good. Unfortunately I do not know the name of it, but it was heavy on the harmonica, so listen for it. Tony Lang is worth paying to see if he is opening for Farley, but otherwise, I just can't recommend it that strongly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smaller and nearly just as powerful as it's big brother, 7736...","review":"This little beauty is the perfect carry/auto light for ladies, youth and people on the go.The only downside is its use of AAAA batteries. Not, AAA. Many people will find them difficult to come by. Even on Amazon they run around $3-$5 for a single pair. Just remember, this light uses three (3) AAAA batteries. Things can get costly if you intend to use the light regularly.All that aside, the 7739 is well constructed and weather resistant with its sealed aluminum housing for use when quality really matters. And at just about an inch in diameter and four inches in length, this compact light is well suited for smaller hands and easy portability. Belt case and lanyard strap are included.Having owned both the 7739, and it's big brother, the 7736, which uses standard AAA batteries and has a slightly more powerful (and more tightly focused) light beam... I would go for the 7736, despite the added cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best ever!","review":"this is the brightest, toughest led light you could ever want and i collect flashlights! it is much brighter than normal leds. you better get one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"laughably horrible","review":"One of the wirst movies ever made.

This is in a genre all by itself because of the fact he takes literally not a single hit from a bad guy in any of the action sequences. I actually memorized the speech about Seagal from Stone and I recite it for my friends. THIS IS A MUST WATCH MOVIE!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"much violence","review":"The only good thing about this movie is the aikido moves performed by Steven. Otherwise the movie is kinda uninteresting.

Here he plays a Macho sercurity man for an Oil Company whose substanderd oil drilling is causing trouble for the enviroment and it's inhabitants. The action scenes in this film are awful they all follow the same trend since Seagal's debut in \\"Above The Law\\" Seagal never gets touched and he can break as many bones as he wants. And with Seagal at the head of the director's duites he has more leway to do whatever he wants. This is a slow dumb uninspied action film with no redemming qualites. Not worth the rental charge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seagal's directing's on deadly ground","review":"Seagal put together this laughable, nearly comedic hero-action flick to satisfy his ego and preach environmentalism with a ten minute lecture-film at the end. Joan Chen's and Michael Caine's talents are wasted, and the intelligence of Alaskan Native Americans is insulted. Cinematography of beautiful Alaska must be applauded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help.","review":"Laughably awful environmental action directorial debut by the terrible Steven Seagal,in which he's an oil rig worker racing against time to stop a truly embaressed looking Michael Caine from destroying the environment of the local inuit people.Were Caine,or Joan Chen (Oliver Stone's Heaven And Earth)really thinking with their heads screwed firmly on when they agreed to appear in this unspeakable trollop?"},{"rating":"1","title":"this had to done as a tax rightoff","review":"not even michael caine could save this BLEEDING HEART(in more ways than one) about the raping of the alaskaen interior by an oil company is just so bad that you wonder how it ever got made. steven seagal walks through it in a half daze(he also directed)and kills more pepple than any accident by an oil company! the final \\"speach\\" is the only part of the movie that works(but only because it's so funny,not because it's good)! movies like this are what killed mr. seagals movie chances!!REALLY,REALLY BAD!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite, boring action movie","review":"Save yourself a rental fee and pass up this movie. The martial arts are poor to non-existent, and the required bar fight scene is truly hilarious, especially when an overweight and out-of-shape Seagal leaps onto a table to fight one of the bad guys. It is a true miracle of modern carpentry that the small table doesn't collapse from Mr. Seagal's ponderous bodyweight. The \\"politics\\" behind this movie are simplistic, and hopelessly outdated, with oil company tycoons as the villains and the barely literate Seagal delivering a speech at the end of the movie that, once again, is unintentionally hilarious in its absurdity."},{"rating":"1","title":"The producers should have just burned their money","review":"Not even multi-academy award winner Michael Caine could save this movie from Steven Seagals acting deficiencies. Who ever heard of the last name Seagal, in reality it was little Stevie Segal getting kicked around everyday on the playground. You can look at him in this movie and tell that he knows the real meaning of a swirlie. The plot, there wasn't one. The action was formulaic. Seagals acting, well it could have been worse, it could have been Van Damme. The movie does, however, answers one question. If you've ever wondered if akido was good exercise, just check out the gut on Seagal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"I normally do enjoy many of Steven Seagal's films and this film is a pretty decent one. Some of his earlier films are far better, but this one had some decent fight scenes and good dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst action movie ever","review":"This is one of the worst action movies ever.

Ha! Not worth one star.","review":"Academy Award winner Michael Caine must have really needed a paycheck when he signed on to this rubbish. Steven Seagal (did anyone see his True Hollywood Story...Ha!) stars as an ex-government agent (of course he does) who now works as a firefighter for the world's largest oil rig (I mean toy model/painting). Eventually Seagal's conscience gets to him and he turns on the company and begins to help the Eskimos (ha). \\"What is the essence of a man?\\" Seagal actually says this in the film right before taking on a factory worker. It's okay to put messages into films and the message this film tries to put out there is a worthy one. However, the message becomes stupid in the context of this ridiculous film. Next to TICKER and THE PATRIOT, this is by far Seagal's worst film and he directed this one and I can't believe I saw this at the theatre because this movie doesn't look like it should have ever made it to the theatres."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied Customer","review":"The DVD was shipped and received ahead of schedule.

He worked for an oil company which was willing to kill off people for profits. Seagal goes into the snow and fends himself from a pack of wolves that bite his genitals. \\"Stinkin' dogs, get offa me!\\" The spirit of a bear enters his soul as he dreams of hunting the bear. But, the bear threw him down a waterfall and he woke up as a lord. Seagal wants to save his people, but he kills many other in the process. What a genius! He changes the essence of a fat man at a bar, blows up an oil refinery and rides horses for the first time! Poor horse. Steven Seagal is wickedly clever by ambushing his enemies with bombs and defends himself in a grotesque manner. At the end, Seagal delivered a long speech concerning today's society and the waste we spill around our environment. How thoughtful of Seagal after he demolished the most important oil drill in Alaska."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Seagal flick","review":"I like this movie I own two copies of it.

You would look utterly ridiculous giving someone a pen.

While the first couple of chapters almost put me off the book, with their discussion of the nature of biography, I'm glad I stuck with it to the second half of the book. Zinsser does a great job of explaining the difficulties in tracing the history of any infectious disease, and manages to make what could have been a highly technical discussion both readable and entertaining. Written in the 1930's, some of the information in this book is definitely dated. Specifically, modern antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals have radically changed the role of infectious diseases in our society. In addition, our understanding of viruses, genetics (including the discovery of DNA), and evolution have all advanced dramatically since the book was written. Even so, the historical analysis in this book is still enlightening and serves to highlight the often overlooked role of epidemics in history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, Out of Date and Amateurish","review":"This discursive, rambling instance of poor scholarship is a blight. Little justifies this book's continued presence in print. It is anti-semitic, racist, bigoted and, in many respects, anti-intellectual. The science is out of date, and was conservative in some respects even at the time. His expeditions into other arenas display his amateur status and naivete, which masquerades as snobbishness and is, at the end of the day, merely stupid. I'm sure, for those who cannot be troubled to read better books on the many topics it covers, it serves some enlightening purpose. I'd rather it didn't.

Through the process, the reservoir of their vocabularies is expanding and these memorable lessons imprint in their minds. The Frog and the Ox. The Wind and the Sun. The Fox and the Grapes. 53 Aesop's best fables were accompanied with magnificently artworks done by distinguished illustrators such as Charles Bennett, Milo Winter and Percy Billinghurst.

My only complaint is that the individual stories listed in the contents are not click-able and you do have to navigate page by page to get where you need to go.

Approximately 90 stories are featured. Some, but not all, of the stories are illustrated with engravings.The pages of this book measure 23 cm X 13 cm, and many stories cover less than half a page. Few stories cover more than one page. This tersely-written style is ideal for the storyteller who wants a concise plot of each story.

The aphorism then says, \\"Might makes right.\\" Might can be misused for greed and disreputable contract but not to make it right! Additionally there are no pictures with Kindle versions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too boring","review":"I wish I had taken time to read the reviews in detail, rather than going by the total number of stars. I bought the paper back edition (not sure if other editions are different). It differed from the look inside view, very few illustrations and small print, not something a 5 year old would enjoy. The language used is also a little difficult for a child to comprehend. I also found the narration to be rather abrupt. It seems more suited as a quick reference for a story teller who needs to quickly pick a story and then elaborate it in his/her style."},{"rating":"2","title":"For The Grandkids","review":"The grandkids are at the age where they like \\"Pappa John\\" to read stories to them. My special technique? I substitute the name of the characters with the names they recognize like their Mom and Dad, their pets names, friends names etc. So they think I am reading a story written just for them.The downfall? When they get old enough to realize that Pappa John was fabricating these stories all along. So this book allowed me to read their stories with all the names replaced. I hope Aesop forgives me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrible Harry and the Dragon War","review":"Great book and series of books for the younger reader in the family.

For most Americans the region of the world that is the source of the poet's inspiration is remote and strange.In reading these poems the reader is drawn in, introduced to both the darkness and the light. I found the book moving in ways having to do with the soul more than the intellect. At the same time, the language is sophisticated, serene. This reader will return, many times to these pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"It will take a while to get by your side.","review":"I ordered this on Jan. 14, it is April now and I still don't have it.

The rhyming pattern used throughout the story is very smooth and makes for an easy read. The author has done an excellent job re-telling the original Goldilocks and the Three Bears but has spiced it up with a little more of a twist!

The Romans practiced a rudimentary form of surgery in Pompeii in the 1st century AD.Lanfranc of Milan popularized lithotomy and cataract surgery.His school believed that wounds in vital organs tended to befatal. Later, Wiseman dealt with amputation and anaesthesiawas popularized. This book would be excellent for any studentof science or medicine.

I put my satellite dish on a tripod, turned it to the general position horizontal and vertical, attached the finder to it, adjusted it a little until the beep was the loudest, went inside my house to test the signal strength, and presto 98 percent signal. I have my dish attached to a motor so now I can receive all of the FTA channels available to me. Guess what? The storm moved my DirecTV dish out of alignment. I just saved myself a $75 service charge by realigning my DirecTV dish myself and it only took 30 seconds. I recommend this item to anyone just starting out or who installs dish for a living."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magnetic Poetry Kit","review":"I purchased this product for my elementary-age granddaughter and was disappointed that the product does not reflect the age level of the recipient. Some words were too adult, and I removed them. (\\"Sex,\\" for example; \\"Gender\\" I would have kept, but \\"gender\\" didn't appear).

I would not buy this as a gift again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Remakes of Original Percy Faith Arrangements","review":"This CD is a great compilation of some of Percy Faith's most popular arrangements. The sound quality is excellent, as is the track selection. It includes versions of most of his charted songs, most notably, \\"Theme from a 'Summer Place'\\" and \\"Moulin Rouge.\\" Purists should note that this CD was recorded in 1994, almost twenty years after Faith's death. In my opinion, such re-recordings rarely compare to the originals and generally have little value, except to the record company. However, since Faith was primarily an arranger, this CD works remarkably well and serves as an excellent representation of what he was about. Don't be surprised if you find yourself seeking out original Faith performances (of which there are many available on CD) after listening. All in all, a worthwhile purchase for anyone interested in the easy listening format or in quality instrumental music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance and Peace","review":"I bought this C.D. to listen to the theme from a Summer Place and found to my surprise that all of the selections were wonderful. There is a fine art to arranging music and Faith is certainly distinctive in his very romantic and peaceful style. Faith, himself is not actually conducting these selections but the arrangements are true.

Yes, it was decades ago and I don't care if it dates me. I loved that movie, but even more... the theme song. It was hauntingly unforgettable and tragically romantic. I rushed to purchase this CD when I discovered that not only was one of my favorite themes featured, also included were Tara's Theme from \\"Gone With The Wind\\", Autumn Leaves and Some Enchanted Evening from \\"South Pacific\\". The arrangements are exquisite, Percy Faith's orchestra \\"noteworthy\\" and well worth a listen, with or without your romantic partner.Pie DumasAuthor & Life Coach"},{"rating":"2","title":"Theme from a Summer Place","review":"Another great listening album with words.

I just bought 12 batteries for 3 units and wasn't about to buy an AC adapter to see IF that fixed it. It cut off my mom's voice and I rarely heard her message. The units also have annoying beeps that can't be turned off. No real volume control either. A very overpriced and poorly designed unit.

The units ate batteries like a rabbit eats grass. The units went dead without any use in a matter of a month or two. The effective range of the product was much less than advertised -- probably 50-100 feet. Beyond that, the extensive delay between transmission and receipt of a message made the product unusable.

Her house is no more than 75 feet from our back window, so I figured there would be no problem. WRONG. Only by standing at our back window and placing her unit in her front room could we even remotely begin to communicate -- and this was spotty at best. Forget using it through walls and other barriers! I had to set it to all 4 channels scanning in order to pick up a clear signal, the rest of it cuts in and out.I then moved it to my garage, much closer to the rest of the house. Even now it's iffy at best. If I still had the packaging I'd return it -- now I can only warn others not to purchase this.

Very little actual volume control--it's loud, louder and loudest and not very easy to figure out how to set.

To watch the process of his re-emergence of his soul from such a psychological detour was to learn about the reciprocity of fate and free-will. I highly recommend this movie for introspective people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, stupid DVD full screen format","review":"I loved Fearless the 1st time I saw it.

Jeff Bridges, who can be great, was the worst I've ever seen him. Even the cinematography was poor. The script was psychologized in a dour, trite & phony way. I didn't buy anything about it. The closest thing to being good was Rosie Perez's acting, which was good considering the script. I thought it could have been a truly uplifting movie about someone surviving a crash who realizes the beauty of being alive. Instead it was a big heap of muck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe","review":"As a lover of movies, it pains me to say this about one, but I hated it. I felt like I was being made to feel that I wasn't living life to the fullest because I didn't thoroughly enjoy my last strawberry. The last thing I want is to be made to feel less than someone without being inspired to reach their heights. I thought Jeff Bridges' character was a jerk and Rosie Perez's was an annoyance.There were also many irrelevant subplots: that of the woman he visits after the crash, the role of the psychiatrist and the scheming lawyer and the clingy kid. All detours that could have been productive had the film ever led up to anything with the main story, let alone the sidetrips. Great crash scene, however, very well done to beautiful music and in wonderful luminescence. But the rest, like a strawberry, is hard to swallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close to the worst movie I've seen in a long time","review":"Sorry to disagree with everyone else, I thought though the premise was good, the execution was pretty bad.

But I am a light sleeper and these things kept me up all night. For one thing you can't roll around in them without getting tangled up. They have enough friction that they stick to your clothes when ever you shift positions. This drove me to distraction.Additionally, while I was awake trying to get myself untangled, I was constantly getting shocked. I can just imagine what my daughter, with her long blonde hair, would look like in the morning after sleeping in these.The material is thin and looks like it will wear out quickly, but I'm not really giving them the chance.

I thought it would be a synthetic fleece similar to that found in inexpensive fleece throws or light sports jackets. This is more akin to the fleece lining inside a conventional sweatshirt. While it was quite soft when new, three weeks later it's pilling up quite a bit and has actually become rough and scratchy where our feet are.Bottom line, these sheets are alright for 20 bucks, but don't wear socks or PJ's when using them as they can't take rubbing up against other fabric."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Quality","review":"These sheets were to be a replacement set for my son who all ready had a set of fleece sheets.

After about a week of sleeping on it, however, the areas where your body rests, especially feet and legs, started nubbing until it is now uncomfortable to sleep on.

The lyrics are superb. They are full of excellent imagery and devoid of cliche. They were written by someone with depth of experience and maturity. Her songs are personal, but not self-absorbed.Ms. Scialfa's vocal style reminds me a bit of Ronnie Spector. While her range has limitations, her use of background singers and superb musical arrangements keeps the music at a high level of quality and interest throughout. There are talented musicians and singers working together without multi-layered production gimmicks. This CD is a treat from start to finish. \\"Stumbling to Bethlehem\\" is my personal favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reflection","review":"I'm a die hard Springsteen fan, and I've watched Patti Scialfa perform many times with Bruce and E-Street. Watching all of her performances on tv the week her CD came out, I found her to be self assured, well spoken, and a very talented musician. She is very much her own person. Her CD has me reflecting on my youth and how my past relates to my present. The CD is calming, bluesy with catchy lyrics... Another poet as her husband. By the second song I found myself dwelling into cleaning the refrigerator, and my three terrifing terriers calmly resting beside me. After listening to the entire CD, I started humming along. I had my husband listen, and he was impressed. If you want one person who has a little Bonnie Riatt, Joni Mitchell, and Dusty Springfield, Patti Scialfa may be for you. She is more talented as a musician than I had ever thought. I think this CD may give her the recognition she deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"23rd Street Lullaby","review":"This is the best music I've listened to in a long time.

The songs are very good, consistent but with enough variation in styles to keep it interesting. The production -- by Steve Jordan (original Letterman drummer who has played with Neil Young and Keith Richards among others -- is top-notch. Her voice reminds me most often of Rickie Lee Jones, but she's got more range and less idiosyncrasy. Bruce and Nils play on it, but it's not real E-sreetish. Marc Ribot is on it too.I know it's hard to approach this without preconceptions, but trust me this is a quality piece of work, not at all a vanity project. It's stupid that I feel like I have to defend this record. I'm really glad she doesn't let the naysayers bother her. She went all out on this one, and it shows. Give it a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"DREAAAADFUL! JUST DREADFUL!!!","review":"I wonder if the people who rated this cd so high actually meant to rate another artist instead. I cannot for the life of me figure out how this woman got a solo recording contract (did someone say Bruce?)

PLEASE, please please sample this cd before you buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen before you buy","review":"I love Bruce and most of what he does. But his wife can NOT sing or carry a single note and sings through her nose. This a CD that will not stay in my music library.

A barn is considered an outbuilding, and local electrical codes may be different for residences and outbuildings. Barns are often used to house livestock or poultry, but the book does not address the different requirements for farm wiring.Residential wiring usually requires NM (non-metallic) cable, but in a building may be subjected to high moisture like that in a livestock barn, NMC or UF (Underground Feed) wiring is required.

However, the tone is rather dry and condensed, so don't expect those 157 pages to be a light read."},{"rating":"1","title":".NET from 50,000 feet","review":"This 156 page book, is an ultra condensed book on the Microsoft preferred design for .NET applications.

This book is credited not to individuals but to Microsoft itself, and such books tend to be more marketing-oriented pitches about how cool Microsoft's software is than serious documents containing deatiled technical information. It has all the right buzzwords like \\"patterns\\" and \\"distributed solutions,\\" but there's little of substance here that couldn't be gleaned elsewhere in a less pedantic package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent addition to Asian cinema!!!","review":"Personally, I think Japanese horror is the greatest thing going right now. It's intelligent, devoid of all Hollywood flare, requires the viewer's imagination and has a creepy style unequaled by any other country.'Another Heaven' succeeds in balancing scares, pitch-black humor, philosophy, action and drama all in a single incredible hybrid film. It's very well paced, with slick direction, quirky characters and some truly unsettling sequences.Although not quite as accomplished as some of Japan's other genre offerings (The 'Ring' Trilogy, 'Pulse,' and 'Dark Water' among others), 'Another Heaven' is more than a worthy addition to the genre. I wish more distributors would pick up these films and give them the treatment they deserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect!","review":"I was drawn into the story from the opening scene--one of the greatest, sickest openings in film history! The storyline is highly dirivitive (think The Hidden, Jason Goes to Hell, Shocker, and on and on), but the acting and direction are so good, you are willing to go along for the ride. One of the best thrillers (Asian or otherwise) I have seen in some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dull movie","review":"I bought this movie on ebay; watched it; found it very boring, and it's in the trash--literally. I thought Fangoria lowered their standards not a little, but a great deal. There was very little gore in it, in fact. Not much of a plot, either. A few times I was nodding off and had to struggle to stay awake. In fact, I found the movie so boring I had to turn it off a few times and resume it later. It was simply impossible--due to how boring it was--to watch all at once.I honestly believe high school students can make a movie better than this.Some Japanese horror was very good, but lately there is a horrific stream of extremely boring ones. This is another one of them.It's good to watch if you can't fall asleep at night. It will bore you to sleep in no time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plowing through the mud of the Middle Earth","review":"I am absolutely certain that this is the greatest fantasy epic poem ever written in the English language. I have enjoyed Tolkien books for years. I have attempted to finish this one for years. I cannot get through it. It is an epic poem, and like most straight men, I simply cannot get excited about the epic poetry literary form. There are great stories of the Middle Earth embedded in this thing, probably as good as if not better than \\"Lord of the Rings\\", but it's like a gold coin in the middle of a snake infested swamp - highly valuable, but not worth the effort to recover.

J. Garcia has a great flair for making the reader share his discomfort and loss after his aircraft crashed on a training mission and how he coped with the loss and uses those emotions only a few months later to lead troops in to combat during Desert Storm.The beginning of the book has him being a little to \\"gung-ho\\" for my taste, but later he shares how that mellows and begins to accept that serving your country in the profession of arms is not all glory but lots of hard work and dedication.I highly recommend this book to company grade officers serving in our armed forces."},{"rating":"1","title":"for wives who have lost a husband.","review":"i bought this for my dad after my mom died.i was dissapointed. it should be titled 'when a man dies' with advice like 'wake up each morning and put on some lipstick' it is clearly written with a woman reader in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grief Expressed When A Mate Dies.","review":"I was a funeral director for over 34 years before retiring.

Notable for its trashy blend of noir fatalism, stereotypical American settings and characters, and subversive anti establishment amoralism.However, save yourself $30.00 and buy a used VHS copy of the film, this Criterion edition is an absolutely AWFUL print, and looks to be no better than the cheapest VHS tape in quality.Criterion continues to push the envelope -- the limit of how much people are willing to pay for what are frequently sub standard prints and transfers of classic films. They have had some wonderful remasters and reissues, and deserve credit for those. But they also won't hesitate to use their name and reputation to hustle poor quality copies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upscaled old transfer to be anamorphic!","review":"This new VCI anamorphic edition of THE NAKED KISS does feature some new to DVD bonus interviews, BUT the transfer is not good at all! It looks to have been unscaled from a flat widescreen master, and there is major ringing and compression artifacting around words anytime they are on the screen. This transfer is worse than Criterion's, which also needs to be redone. So far the best I've seen this film look is on the UK R2 PAL DVD release, which is unmatted but is properly cropped on a widescreen TV once the full/fill mode is used. It is sharper, brighter and smoother than any US release I've seen.DON'T BUY THIS DVD IF YOU ARE WANTING A HIGH QUALITY NEW ANAMORPHIC TRANSFER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"one of the best movies I have ever watched.

Looks like a copy of a very fuzzy, washed-out VHS or Beta tape.

Amazon should not be offering this on either DVD or video-on-demand streaming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap format","review":"What they don't tell you in the description is that this is NOT pressed like all standard DVDs are. It's burned on a DVD-R format recordable DVD. Which means it will not play in all DVD Players (only those designed to read DVD-R format). It does not play in my DVD player. These types of DVDs are what you'd see in a bootleg. I'm very suspecious of the company that created this DVD; reelclassicfilms - the website printed on the box doesn't even work.After playing this in a friends DVD Player that can play DVD-R discs, I noticed that the picture quality is horrible. This DVD is bogus and should be avoided.

To make it fit the now ever popular wide screen TVs, Criterion has cut off part of the top and bottom to make it 1.75:1. With parts of the top and bottom missing, the very carefully planned and executed composition is now destroyed.I'm extremely upset with Criterion. I'm a film purest - preferring to always view a film as it was originally designed and intended - not butchered just to make it fit my widescreen TV.However, the transfer is really cleaned up as you have come to expect from Criterion."},{"rating":"1","title":"IS THIS SOMETHING, OR WHAT?","review":"I mean, you've got to like a movie that begins with bald hooker beating her pimp senseless with her shoe, don't you? And it just gets jucier, as, hair restored, she moves to a small town full of crippled kids, crooked cops, and child molesters. All this, and some color footage from director Sam Fuller's home movies and snippets of poetry and Beethoven, too. The acting is fairly wretched (any movie where the best performance is given by Anthony Eisley is dire indeed), the sets are cheap, and the music is pretty bad, but it was nicely photographed by Stanley Cortez, who must have been wondering as he worked on this masterpiece if this was the same career that began by shooting Welles' THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS. This film has a big reputation in Europe, but as film critic Andrew Sarris once noted, Europeans experience orgasms at the thought of Americans committing suicide en masse--like lemmings . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad its...bad.","review":"Don't get me wrong; I like trash. But this manages to be both very dull and very over the top at the same time. Constance Towers is ok (its no wonder she ended up doing soaps; she has that \\"almost convincing\\" way of acting). Anthony Eisley is fair. The movie has some of the absolute worst, terrible, shockingly bad child actors imaginable.The bad acting, fake streets and sets, stereotypical characters and sheer length make this painful. Nothing rings true enough to take it seriously--but how can you laugh at crippled children and child molesters? Its like Roger Corman without the fun.Worth seeing--maybe--but how people can attach such importance to imcompetant schlock....."},{"rating":"1","title":"The buck, the bed, and the bottle","review":"Two-thirds of the way through THE NAKED KISS a wardful of pediatric orthopedic patients, wearing pirate hats and leaning on crutches, perform a musical number with the formerly bald ex-prostitute who's now engaged to the richest man in Grantville, after telling him that upon her arrival in town she shared her favors and a bottle of Angel Foam with the town's un-uniformed cop, Griff, who'd she met immediately upon debussing....Sorry.

Her book is a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Softer Approach to Dietary Transition","review":"By no means a guide for the raw food purist or vegan, Rose's \\"Raw Food Life Force Energy\\" is a softer approach to dietary transition. She is very helpful in guiding the novice away from the foods that simply do not support health, stamina and nutrition.This is a book that will gently encourage the reader to eat more raw, diminish flesh foods and increase juice intake.The book is simplified into 3 sections of Basic Principles,a suggested 21 day regimen and a basic collection of healthier and more raw meal suggestions.Her delivery is direct, the dialogue is everyday language and she is quick to suggest other authors and resources to explore her premise in more depth.This book is a first dive into dietary change that should prove a beneficial read to those undecided in how to approach a healthier diet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy, Tasty","review":"Just try it! I was not a big fan of Rose's previous book, but this one worked for me. I gamely decided to just try her 21 day plan and see what happened.

I passed on the dry brushing and colon cleansing, but the diet alone made a big difference.Be sure to get yourself a good juicer before starting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative for first time \\"Raw-foodists\\"","review":"My own health and growing health concerns starting me reasearching into the \\"Raw food diet\\". This was the first book I read and though it came across as a bit of an information overload, it was still very helpful in explaining the extensive overall health benefits. I was a little dissapointed there weren't more recipes in this book but I suppose that means my next book should be strictly a raw food recipe book. I think this a great book for someone just starting out as it explains how you can gradually shift to raw food without having to give up cooked food completely. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in learning about the raw food diet and lifestyle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Les Parents Terribles","review":"This book is simply brilliant.Jones has a strong, clear style and is in complete control of his subject matter. He has thought through what so many others have only hinted at. He is a Catholic Nietzsche - he philosophizes with a hammer; and how much more sane and deliberate than Nietzsche himself.This is a revolutionary book. It exposes the horror lurking beneath the make-up caked suface of the modern world. It deserves as wide a reading as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"While I find the premise of this book very interesting, I found Jones' writing to be repetitive and at points excessively paranoid. When I started to detect undercurrents of anti-semitism, I stopped reading, and did a little checking into this author. I found that some of his other writings contain more than undercurrents of anti-semitism. I became very uncomfortable with the idea of having any of his work in my personal library, and I returned the book without finishing it. While I'm sure he presents some very interesting information about the history and consequences of the sexual revolution, I'd like to find a book that does so in a more level-headed (and better edited) manner.For those interested in this subject, a better alternative would be Wiker and DeMarco'sArchitects Of The Culture Of Death."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book on Group Therapy","review":"This book has it all. Being both a psychiatrist and a psychoanalyst, I have read many books on group therapy, but SR Slavson is the only person who indicates 1) what are the indications for group therapy as opposed to individual therapy, 2) what types of group therapy can be done, 3) how to select group members, 4) what are the unusual mechanisms seen in group members, 5) how can these mechanisms be clarified by the group therapist to help group members learn about themselves and others, and much much more.There is plenty of \\"fringey\\" literature on group therapy. This book is the opposite: solid theory, plenty of clear writing, and nothing ethereal or abstruse. Clear descriptions and reasonable suggestions for constructing different types of therapy groups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, don't buy it.....","review":"Okay, so I may be one of the few that enjoyed this movie. I did not have high expectations and knew it would be silly. It did make me laugh. So, I was so happy when Isaw that this was available on DVD. In this day and age of technology, it is completely unacceptable to produce a DVD with such poor sound quality. I don't know why it is, but I constantly had to raise and lower the volume. I have not had this problem with any other DVD, so this was a real disappointment for me. I bought this DVD for under $10 and I still say it isn't worth $5! The sound is horrible. If you have not seen this film and you are a fan of the actor or the series, then rent it, and you won't feel like a sucker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgust from a Benigni lover","review":"I am a great fan of Roberto Benigni, and own most of his films, including, unfortunately, this one. The plot could only be described as ponderous at best, the sight gags were mediocre, and the actors, who were obviously trying hard to bring this out of the muck, could not do the impossible. Benigni is only at his best when he writes and directs and when he can perform in his native Italian."},{"rating":"1","title":"The End Of The Line For Blake Edwards","review":"This is the movie that proves the genius behind the Pink Panther movies wasn't Blake Edwards, but Peter Sellers who unfortunately, is long gone when this one is made. In my fifty years of enjoying movies, I've only actually walked out of the theater before the end three times. This is one of the movies. Roberto Benigni is horrible. Admittedly, I don't find him funny at all. I have seen about six of his films and each time I fail to find anything funny about this guy. This movie will test even the true Benigni fan, however. I can't remember one funny moment (in the hour I stayed). I was so disappointed being such a fan of Peter Sellers and hoping that Edwards hadn't totally forgotten how to be funny. If I could have given this zero stars, I would have. This is one of the few things I will change if I ever get a time machine.

Apart from his comic scenes, the movie lacks continuity of action and even misses to end some minor plots, making you wonder if it will ever have a sequel, or if the director himself pitifully stopped the movie, just to avoid more boredom to the audience.

Even though the great Peter Sellers is not in this one, Blake Edwards transfers his slap stick style over to the Son Of The Pink Panther. The movie starts out just like the other movies do and suddenly goes into the misadventures of the new Clouseau. Roberto Benigni does a fine job as the Klutzy policeman and still gets the mystery solved."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst performance of everyone involved.","review":"Do you want to watch a bad movie?

There is not one song passed that I have not enjoyed. This is a great album which I have added to my collection. If you love the old hymns that are slowly being forgotten to the more contemporary! This is a classic for your collection as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor rendition of loved hymns","review":"I was extremely disappointed in a lot of these hymns. The instrumental arrangements drowned out the vocal arrangements several times. A lot of the hymns were instrumental only and the arrangements were very loose interpretations to say the least. There are better arrangements out there - search further if you want to hear beautiful hymns!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I saw this on TV, and I thought it would be good from the sound of things. When I received this from Amazon, I tried it and was disappointed. I just think it's way too operatic. I had a really hard time hearing the words which I think is really important for hymns. The tunes were unrecognizable with over powering music and done it a way that was just not appealing. It's just something I wasn't used to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had Potential","review":"The music on this CD sounds fantastic, but BE AWARE that they are only short segments of the hymns. For example, I specifically bought the CD for \\"Be Thou My Vision\\", which is actually only a short instrumental, and \\"Crown Him With Many Crowns\\", which only had one verse. Not good for a rousing sing-along while you do the dishes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what we expected","review":"To us this CD was not worth the cost.

We purchased two albums and both had the varing sound level."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice collection of old hymns","review":"While I admit some of the songs are a bit obscure today, overall, it is a very nice collection of old hymns. I do enjoy many of today's young artists and the heartfelt music they put out. But sometimes, in an effort to seem more musically current and to appeal and draw people to church, I find the \\"rock\\" approach is more focused on the music and it loses something valuable and important in regards to worship. That is what makes the old hymns timeless and still touches the listeners heart for God. Many of the old hymns still seem anointed by the Holy Spirit-- and sadly, not always, but too often I find that lacking in much of today's Christian music. It is usually too loud and too repetitive, relying on one or two phrases or verses, repeated over and over and over and over as if that somehow indicates worship. As I said, this is just one man's opinion. But if you like the old hymns and times of quiet, reflective meditation you might enjoy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 50 Most Loved Hymns","review":"They are the songs we grew up with and they just bring back such pleasure to your ears.

However, the CD's are poorly mastered with volume all over the place and some chopped beginnings and endings. Unfortunately, at least two (2) of these wonderful hymns are chopped long before the ending(s).

However, still a beautiful selection of hymns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Concept, Disappointing Execution","review":"I was sold on the concept, a recording of classic hymns. Unfortunately, the actual product disappointed. I had hoped for simple, heartfelt, preferably skilled, renditions by people of faith, something reminiscent of the best of traditional worship. Instead, I found a commercial product, full of orchestral flash and perfunctory choral performance, devoid of discernible inspiration and, for that matter, taste. I doubt I will give it a second hearing. But it has set me on a quest to find what the marketing promised; I will seek recordings that fulfill that promise.

There is, for the most part, ONE die-rolling mechanic for everything. You don't need to look at charts and figure numbers, you just need to throw some dice and keep going. You get bonuses for describing your actions as vividly as possible, and making them entertaining. (What we call the \\"Looks Cool!\\" bonus.)

About 200 songs fit on this 2GB memory card, and while bigger cards are available, my car apparently does not recognize HDSC memory. I have used this card along side SanDisc, PNY, and Transcend memory cards, both in my car and to store other data without being able to notice any difference in performance, ease of use, or durability. One cheap-o SC card from ebay even preformed admirably.Since there is no room to write much detail about content on each card, I find it a little helpful to buy cards from different manufacturers (hence, with different labels) to quickly identify which card I'm selecting.

Scoring their 3rd US #1 hit (2nd this year) with this tribute to the new Charlie's Angels 2000 film, Independent Women Part 1 does not deal with any new issues that they haven't covered, but it contains a groove and chrous so infectious that it'll get u on the dancefloor within minutes. This much-delayed CD release contains the album version, 2 Victor Calderone mixes and the Maurice Independent Man Mix plus a X'mas song in time for the season's greetings. The Calderone mixes sound pretty good this time round, considering how boring his mixes are usually. What's missing here still is the Joe Proof 2-Step Mix available on the Europe single which is a rather good mix. But grab this if you dun 1 the soundtrack or u've been hearing it on the radio but not having it in the CD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"How desperate are you?","review":"Let me start off by saying that the song \\"Independent Women\\" is a 5 star song. Buy this maxi single ONLY if you don't want to buy the \\"Charlie's Angels\\" soundtrack. That's what I did. I knew that I loved this song that much. Generally I don't like maxi-singles because if you have heard one dance mix, you've heard them all. This isn't an exception. But, I figured buying this over the soundtrack was the lesser of two evils. Unfortunately my CD is in my car, but I can tell you that track 4, which is one of the dance mixes is a great mix. It contains a little Santana-like guitar in the background, and is faster paced. In fact the vocals were redone for this version. Track 5 is a new Christmas song from them called \\"8 Days of Christmas.\\" It's pretty good. I think these girls can pretty much release a song with them snoring and it would go number one. I am concerned, though. How much longer can they have success talking about no good men and being able to buy what they want?"},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR QUALITY","review":"The mixes left SO much to be desired.

All of the paint was crackling loudly and spewing particles all over LOUDLY and this went on for over an hour!! Even when I put it in the sink and doused water on it. It was the strangest thing I ever saw. It made me wonder what the heck it's made out of it. I've had lots of tea kettles in my day and I've never seen a pot react like that before.

This is a great series, especially if you're into military history. Afterall how many films can you name that are based on the Napoleonic Wars? Me neither.This is my favorite episode which is probably due to the fact that this particular installment features the very lovely Elizabeth Hurley as Lady Farthingdale, one of two women who have been kidnapped and held for ransom by a group of British deserters.

Perhaps she understands all too well, and therefore this cynical book, and obvious attempt to make money by imitating and slandering a true American, is really an effort to quash the truth. The Bible says it well: In the end times, men will call good evil, and evil good. Susan is the queen of twisting good to cal it evil, and making evil sound like the norm and that which is good.

Right-Wing and Left-Wing pundits are too focused on annihilating each other.

Until then, this CD will do just fine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mix of musical styles","review":"If you are like me and love many different styles of music this cd is for you.\\"The Flavour\\" has a cool spanish guitar vibe to it.\\"Breezin\\" is a great cover of the George Benson classic.\\"97th & Columbus\\" is a sunny day at the beach song while \\"Two Hearts\\" has that late night jazz club sound.\\"Sun Goddess\\" is a smooth but funky version of the Ramsey Lewis funk jazz classic.\\"Thank You\\" and \\"Ode to Chet\\" i believe are tributes to legendary guitar player Chet Atkins who also mixed pop,country and jazz on his albums.Check out the albums \\"Sails\\" and \\"Stay Tuned\\" By Chet.Doc closes the cd with an incredible cover of the Marvin Gaye monster hit 'What's going on'.Highly recomended cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish you could give a minus star - Very disappointed","review":"My uncle bought one for me at the PX as a present, and I felt terrible that it didn't even work 1 month. It barely stayed on long enough to warm up rice let alone cook rice, when it did work. It quickly stopped working, altogether. The cord can be used to work with the new rice cooker that you purchase from some other brand. I cook lots of brown rice and needed a dependable appliance that my kid could easily turn on and have rice with a crock pot meal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use for Irish oatmeal","review":"I have several other Breville products and think they are all high quality. For the clearance price, I don't see given the features and additional parts, how anyone could complain. I tried going by their suggested directions and now go by the rice or oatmeal brand's directions. I do rinse the rice and after the small boil over of McCann's oatmeal, I will rinse it once too. It is wonderful to not have to stay at the stove for those two food items since they are time consuming. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Atlas, as usual","review":"I have been a loyal user of Rand-McNally Road Atlases for more than 20 years. They are light-weight, sturdy, well designed, comprehensive, (and most importantly),they have great maps that are ACCURATE and UP TO DATE!The 2006 edition is no different, except that it comes with a strong vinyl cover (which also doubles as a handy file pouch for brochures, receipts, tickets,etc.) and a newly formatted index of cities, counties and states, with up-to-date population estimates, and easily understood indices.The choice of lavender and purple highlights and overtones for the index can make reading the small font sizes a little tricky (especially if you suffer from \\"old eyes\\", as I do). But this is a trivial complaint; by and large, the 2006 Rand-McNally Road Atlas is the best deal you will find. If you buy it, you won't be sorry.Roger Surbaugh"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice atlas","review":"great for the price and wow very fast shipping very easy to use. If you travel alot get this atlas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful film","review":"In the tradition of Terrence Malick's films this is a beautifully photographed and conceived film.Considering that actors are non-professional, their performances are wonderful.Despite the characters of this film are mostly poor, there is no sense of anger in this film, just a passing glimpse of a few people's lives.This film has more feeling and dept than 90% of the over-produced garbage that comes out of Hollywood."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American masterpiece","review":"Hmmm, maybe some people just don't get this masterpiece. That's fine. To each his own. It must be said, though, that its impressive for a debut film to be released on Criterion Collection. Even more impressive is the fact that Terrence Malick himself hired this young filmmaker to direct a script that Malick originated. But this is all the hype stuff that creates the kind of backlash I'm reading on these reviews. If we just discuss the film, I would have to say that it is slow, it is deeply moving, and it is as powerful as it is long. An incredibly polished, mature and confident work of art. Green is an auteur and has already established himself, at the age of 28, and after only two films, as one of the most important filmmakers today. He will be in the ranks of Malick, Scorcese, Kubrick, and the like, by the time that he is 40."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rough edges but very compelling","review":"This movie is definitely more about character development than advancing the plot at any cost, and it pays off.

Some parts, however, are extremely violent in a quiet kind of way and were hard to watch. Definitely worth watching, but I also had to take a little break from it at one point.

I would agree this movie is not for everyone.George Washington takes awhile to get into. The plot is dragged out but this film is worth the time to sit through and do more then just sit watching it as another film. There are many little pieces to this one, some not as forth right as the others but it offers great viewing and craftmanship which has become some of the most prominent forces i nthe film industry.Do not expect anything glamorous or Hollywoodish frim this film.

Its not working.In \\"George Washington,\\" David Gordon Green tries to extract the natural beauty and poetic simplicity of Terrence Malick's films to the point of absurdity. The quick cuts to nature shots, the pseudo-casual speaking tone of children who stutter and say \\"oh-so profound\\" things...This dvd contains his student films, which speak for themselves to show you what a talentless filmmaker this guy is. His Charlie Rose interview is nauseating. He lets Charlie stroke his ego about what an interesting new visionary he is....Sickening and insulting.Go buy Badlands and humble David Gordon Green before the master...TERRENCE MALICK"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Difficult To Explain Just How Bad This Is","review":"The most striking thing about George Washington is the incredibly unrealistic dialogue of the children. The funniest thing is that I later read the director say he was seeking realism. I would strongly warn against anyone considering buying this without having seen it first. I was also thinking of this after reading a review that favorably compared the film's narrative to that of Harmony Korine's Gummo, which I like very much. That's all I really wanted to point out. As well, I'll just say that the reviewer who posted the 'myths debunked' review is, if not involved in the production of the film, in some way profiting from the sales of it. All the others who have posted five-star reviews can just be put down to poor taste (click more about each one and see five stars given to a 98 Degrees album and similar products)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A poignant landscape of a dusty, delapidated South","review":"I saw this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival in 2000, and thought it one of the most original and haunting films I have seen in years. It is a very subjective, impressionistic and almost transcendental movie about a group of kids, and how they follow their own particular code of honour in the face of misfortune. Kind of like Harmony Korine but at an easier pace, and with more unity of vision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"If I could give it \\"0\\" stars I would.Had I seen this in the theatre I would have walked out. It was THAT BAD. The dialogue of the children is pompous, self-important, self-conscious and worst of all wanting us, the audience, to actually believe that the characters would be spouting this mess! The blond little girl was at least interesting until she opened her mouth and tried to wax philosophica. Pitiful and unbelievable!Do not waste your money, time or energy on this movie.

Bob Hite, Henry Vestine, Alan Wilson, de la Parra and Taylor, were/are talents that have received very little rcognition. All were.are great in what they do/did. Hite was realy a joy to listen to.

This one fit like a charm.This appeared to be a well manufactured gasket and arrived quickly and was undamaged. That it arrived quickly and in good shape is just as important as it being well made to start with. Replacing it is a stinky job that you do not want to have to redo. So get it done right the first time with a good quality gasket.Update: I reduced this rating from 4 to 2 stars as I just had to do this repair again because a leak developed. This is not the type of repair you want to do over.It turns out wax rings are not a good idea for wall-mounted toilets. After consulting a professional, I can only recommend using foam gaskets for wall mounted units. Wax is fine for floor mounts where gravity works to help the seal. On a wall mounted unit, not so much. The flexibility and bounce back of a foam gasket creates a much better seal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bob's electronics -worst service I ever experienced.","review":"Customer service does not exist at Bob's Electronics.

I assumed this was a self-help book. The author is a pastor's wife in a Christian community that understands feminism as aggressive and castrating! The book is geared towards helping women be good wives and mothers, including weight loss. The implicit values make it a narrow resource for me. I found it to be very supportive of roles rather than people.I had hoped to learn more about being driven or controlled by anxiety, etc. as I live with perrenial stressors, such as the murder of a grown daughter.

Her debut single, Come Back To me, which samples the classic 70's song Baby Come Back, doesn't have a distinction of really standing out as a good song.

However, I just bought a Kindle Fire and realized how useful these headphones can be because you can control the volume on the headphones themselves. No need to go into your Kindle's settings to change the volume when you are in the middle of watching a video or listening to music. I highly recommend them for use with your Kindle Fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second pair","review":"I have a bad habit of constantly breaking my headphones and earphones.

He likes it for all the reasons noted. After he has used them a while, I can speak more about longevity and durability. For the first few weeks. They are a GO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent ear-buds, especially for it's price range","review":"These have decent sound quality - while it doesn't sound like a 200$ or even a 50$ earbud; it's still a significant improvement over stock earbuds.Especially with bass - I didn't expect bass like this from a 20$ earbud, let alone a 10$ earbud.The design is simple and rugged: the case even resisted my purposeful attempts to crack it.Now as for the downsides: The case's cover pops off easily after a while, and the cord is really, really short - I sometimes have to tilt my head when it's plugged into my computer.Secondly, the sound is very sensitive to positioning if you don't have the cover - it gets muted if I tilt my head in the wrong direction, and it feels awkward. And it's still an open-ear earbud, so don't count on this when you're mowing the lawn or something else noisy.Still a good choice if you aren't willing to pony up an additional 10$ for better earbuds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great earbuds... but short cord","review":"I had high hopes for these after reading some of the reviews... and for the most part, they've matched expectations. They do have great sound for cheap earbuds, they are comfortable, and the quality feels pretty good...My only complaint... the cord is SHORT. When I work, I have my phone sitting on my desk and plug the headphones into it... the cord is so short I have to keep the phone either on my person, or on the very edge of the desk, where it gets pulled off a lot as I move. It is literally 18\\" shorter than the cord on my old headphonesIf the cord was longer, would have given 5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"I am so pleased I found these headphones! These are the ones I used back in the day and I can never find them in stores. Great sound and the bass is incredible. Buying another pair before they disappear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Earbuds","review":"These earbuds provide pretty good sound quality. You can also listen to them fairly loudly and someone right next to you wouldn't even know they were on. The winding storage case works well but i never use it. The cord for these buds is a little bit short, could use another 6-8 inches. The volume control can only raise and lower the volume by a very limited amount, which was disappointing. Don't expect to be able to mute your device or crank it up loud using only the headphone control. Otherwise, these headphones have held up well over 5 months of moderate daily use and i would consider them a decent pair for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Ear Buds","review":"I saw the other reivews about the buds being big and I did not believe them.

They also fit in ear very nicely and stay put."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk... only one earphone works after 3 months","review":"Sony has phoned this one in... This is the second pair I have owned. I am an adult male that does not abuse the head phones so I am very disappointed that both pairs went bad in less than 6 months. Wiring is miserable and breaks somewhere inside. It is not repairable.I bought them because of the volume control and travel case. They are garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too fragile....","review":"These are great headphones. I've owned at least five sets. All of them comfortable, all of them sounded great. And the inline volume control is incredibly convenient. Unfortunately, I need to advise you NOT TO BUY THESE HEADPHONES.Why? Well, there's a problem with the construction that whenever the cord snags on something, more often than not the left headphone stops working, never to live again. The first few times, I just thought I was a klutz, so the third time it happened, I ordered two sets to replace it. Well, it just snagged again after a month's use, and again, the left headphone died.It's finally occurred to me (slow learner, here) that MOST people will probably snag their headphones at least as often as I do, so most people will not get more than a few months use out of these. So I regretfully have to advise you to avoid these otherwise wonderful earphones. And I'm looking for something comparably cheap and good with an in-line volume control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very short shelf life","review":"I bought these less than two weeks ago, and they've already crapped out on the right headphone. This is the third time I've bought this brand of headphone, and the third time the right earbud has crapped out after only a short amount of moderate use.If you want headphones that last, don't buy these. It's just frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"I was looking for comfy earphones to replace my Phillips one I got awhile back cos the rubber coating had fallen off and I stumbled on this one. I was a bit skeptical about the volume control thinking it would give out after a few times of sliding up and down but it works wonderfully and is so light and responsive to touch as well as being sturdy.I started out using the foam that came with it but that proved to be a bother and pretty much useless as the plastic earbuds are comfy enough. And they stay in your ears like glue. No more readjusting and I loved that.For the price, this SO worth it.EDIT [12/6/2006]: Right! So I bought this in April but somehow one ear's volume got lower than the other at the end of August so I gave it to my brother cos he didn't mind. I searched for other earplugs in the meantime (tried about 4 in fact) but none compared with the comfyness of this so I'm back again and giving it a 2nd chance. Hope it doesn't bail out on me again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If only they didn't die so quickly...","review":"I've been using this model for years, but recently it seems like the build quality has gone way down. 4 pairs have died on me in the last two years. The most recent one died after less than 2 months of use. In all cases, one of the ears stops producing sound. Too bad because otherwise I really liked these earphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"CORD TOO SHORT AND STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED CREDIT FOR RETURNING IT!","review":"I, IMMEDIATELY, REALIZED THE CORD ON THIS UNIT WAS WAY TOO SHORT TO BE USEFUL AND REQUESTED IT BE RETURNED, PRINTED THE LABEL, SENT IT OFF, AND STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED CREDIT."},{"rating":"1","title":"retractable ear phones","review":"They were bulky, didn't seem to work smoothly.

I have to jam them/screw them in at an angle to make them stay. Still they try to fall out and are very uncomfortable if they do stay in. The sound is OK, but they're so irritating that I can't even enjoy the sound. Also, I got them to listen to lectures, etc. online and the cord is so short that I have to sit uncomfortably close to the monitor. This was not a good purchase for me. I'm going to have to start over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headphones","review":"Did not like this product. ear buds are big, no cushions and hard to keep in your ears. Would not buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"clang","review":"hmmm, where to begin...I purchased an Mpio mp3 player (Mpio fl100 - a cracker), Amazon reviews advised the dumping of the factory ear buds for this model Sony, hear more bass, improved range, natter natter...Made the purchase and shot home for the comparison...drum roll please...Aero smiths \\"I don't want to miss a thing - Armageddon theme\\", was sampled with both. The sonys failed to adequately pick up the three settle tin drum beats through the intro, nor the strumming of the Spanish guitar as the tune picks up. I only realized they were there when I plugged the mpio's back in. Again the suttle strings that complete the song are incredibly out of these buds range.There is more bass, but muffled, it sounds like a canvass veil had been pulled over the whole music spectrum - if you want to hear the entire engineering that has been mixed into a song, you will not get it with these dud buds.They promised so much, but could not better a factory set from an MP3 manufacturer?Try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy!","review":"Just got them today and I'm very impressed. I love the design in comparison to the other headphones I've used. The design actually reduces outside noise for high-intensity listening and helps generate a powerful, resonant bass response. Based on the reviews, I believe this is money worth spent. Also, the carry on case that the ear buds come with is very convenient. Having to constantly detangle the cord in my handbag is bothersome. This case practically saves me the time and energy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"I needed replacement earbuds for my iPod touch but didn't want to spend a lot.

His plan, thanks to the help of a succubus named Samira, seems to go well. He destroys an arranged marriage and delivers a 'pure bride' to Vlad. Yet the man refuses to let Theron have his body for the agreed upon three days, no doubt sensing that Theron has no intention of returning the body once he claims it. When the Queen of the Night invites Theron to join her harem, the incubus panics. He needs to do something and fast. He sets his sights on Vlad's lovely virgin bride, Lucia (whose marriage to Nicolae it was that Theron and Samira destroyed). Theron plans to deflower the innocent and spoil Vlad's pleasure. But there is more to Lucia than Theron thinks, she is the first human woman that can see and communicate with him. A splendidly dark paranormal romance.

You can be eating one of the first four waffles you have made, and then you hear the ding bell that tells you your next set of waffles are ready. I have not come accross another waffle maker that has the bell feature. The krubs waffler looks just like this one, but it lacks the notification bell. That bell is essential to me, since I want to sit down in my dining room and eat, rather than having to stand and babysit the waffle maker. Great machine.

I especially liked the shirtless guy singing alone in the desert, the prison chorus, the gay and lesbian interracial choir and the chorus of Dallas cops."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"I *want* to like this album, I really do.

I wish that someone would come up with more substantial type connections of that auto manufacturers would provide a means of connecting accessories that has better connections and capable of higher amperage.

The K-Rains work great to get additional throw, while still putting down water close to the head. In the past I've bought one at a time as needed.

Simply amazing. Digvweed's Bedrock was mesmerizing. Sasha's underground series was totally brilliant. But when you put these guys together, something magical happens. As much as i liked Bedrock, I like this one better. For some reason, you hear the purer sound of Digweed and Sasha even though they're working with eachother.

But anyone who has listened to anything from them before knows that it surpasses 90% of the choices out there.

If you've enjoyed their previous works you'll definitely enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilo in London","review":"They've done it again. Sasha and Digweed break out with a slightly calmer first disc, but bring everything down on the second disc. You can easily see Digweed's chiller influence on the first CD, but Sasha's need to get the crowd going on the second disc. The Jimmy Van M track is excellent. Having recently seen both (although seperately) DJs in London, I recognized some of the tracks from their sets there. I'g glad to see their London sets making it to this side of the Atlantic finally. Excellent CDs, I highly recommend. Track Selections: Disc1: 2, 9, 10; Disc 2: 1, 5, 10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sasha & Digweed dig deep","review":"This album grows on you. It's deeper and darker trance than I am used to listening to, so it took a couple of listens to warm up to. It is definitely the deepest trance from S&D yet and is indicative of their current live shows. I personally think it sounds better off the disc than live, since some of the nuances of this music get lost in a big room...maybe it was just the venue I was at. I would give side two a 5 rating, all the tracks are excellent and the music is interesting and grooves throughout. Side 1 starts good, building through Clapton's \\"Get Lost\\" (doesn't sound anything like Clapton, but who cares) but then it starts stagnating on tracks 3-5. It's not until Slackers \\"Fusion\\" does it pick back up, but from then on it's great, so I give side one a 4. All in all a great effort from Sasha and Diggers, it's good to see them taking their mixing in a new direction.

There's nothing exceptional about this outing that allows it to stand out from the already overcrowded \\"electronic\\" market. If not for their relentless reputations this album would have been completely ignored -- which is exactly what I did after giving it one listen.Don't be fooled by the pervasive Sasha and Digweed myth.

With communicate they have created another double disc set that takes you through many different levels of techno.

The mixes are somewhat gradual, but be patient and you will find them to come through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from Sasha and Digweed.","review":"Sasha and Digweed have done it again. They have combined the thrill of a live show with the technical brillance of a studio mix and put it together on a nicely priced double disk CD. Over the past couple of years their following has grown dramatically, which only led to them putting out as much material as they could in a short time. But do not be worried, I have yet to find a subpar CD in the series and this one is along the lines of greatness. From brand new songs that even the most savvy DJ will not recognize put together with some older stuff, and some of thier own work, I am very pleased with the music, mixing, and overall feel of the album. If you have not put your order in yet, do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blinding","review":"Out of all the sasha/digweed releases over the past 5 years this mix is the one that truely reflects the current style that they are playing. It is basically banging. Its hard, melodic, twisted and will leave you feeling like your stuck on the dancefloor of a dark sweaty nightclub at 3am. This is pure dancefloor fodder. Mix one seems like it reflects sashas style with a large emphasis on the slacker sound. The winners here are, Sven Vath and Trisco-Musak which brings a funky element to the mix. Disk two carries the momentum with some dark twisted floor destroyers. The orb's once more and jimmy van M rock this disk. Be aware that track number 8 is actually track number 9. This sleeve mess up is mearly a blip on an otherwise amazing mix which is the best I've heard in a long time. Buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"another essential mix from the masters - Sasha & Digger","review":"If you're a fan of their work then definitely go out and buy this double cd.

I don't have kids to read it to any more. But I bet that if they shared my love of New York they would have been amused by this peek into how it looked and felt in the 70's.

Any Human Heart, however, puts Boyd in a whole new league. The technique of creating a fictional, but realistically flawed diary for the mail character is unusually well done. I read this in two long days of travel, but reread many paragraphs to admire the technical skill of the writing. Not only is the diary realistic, the life portrayed is both fascinating and surprisingly normal.

Any Human Heart is also an excellent book. What will stay with me for a long time is the upbeat ending. It didn't have to be this way, given Logan's ups and downs and seemingly modest achievements. But the fact that it is gives us a happy-ending type feeling which I think is a real treat from Boyd and a real show of appreciation for life.What dissapoints a bit is how similir the book is to New Confessions. That book has similar \\"ups and downs and modest achievements\\" over a similar scan of 20th century events and locations told by a similar main character. Having read New Confessions (though quite some time ago) made Any Human Heart feel predictable.

That is what this novel, written in the form of an \\"intimate journal,\\" does and it includes most of the major events of the 20th century. It is fiction skillfully interwoven with history.Any Human Heart tells the story of Logan Mountstuart through his diaries, and his experiences. Born male, rich, good looking and arrogant at the beginning of the century, he dies a modest, kinder and wiser man. Logan's life might seem preposterous but it is certainly engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific","review":"In Any Human Heart, William Boyd manages to create a not entirely likeable character, Logan Mountstuart, who nonetheless is an entirely sympathetic protagonist. Logan is not the nicest person in the world. He manipulates friends for his own amusement, sleeps with one of his closests friend's fiance, and commits a number of other, minor atrocities. Yet for all Logan's badness, I missed him when I finished the novel and throughout, I found myself rooting for his finding some semblance of happiness. Logan is entirely human in the sense that his story indeed could be the story of any human heart--any British heart is probably more like it. He manages to come in contact with quite a few notables from the twentieth century and reinvents himself and his career many times over. Perhaps no one lives a life as rich as Logan, maybe so. But that still does not take away from the fact that Any Human Heart is a terrific novel, excellent storytelling. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me \\"restless\\"","review":"I suspect my expectations are the problem here... because so many others seem to like this novel. But having read, and thoroughly enjoyed Boyd's \\"Restless,\\" and reading the good reviews on \\"Any Human Heart,\\" I purchased the psuedo- autobiography hoping to be equally enthralled. I found the format too choppy, and the more I learned about the main character, the less I cared about him and his future entries. So many historic names are dropped, and then the story lines involving them are also dropped, leaving the reader in limbo. Finally, about three-quarters of the way through this novel I started skimming ahead, learned how he died and finally, laid this novel to rest. I plan to try one of Boyd's other novels in hopes of finding another read as compelling as \\"Restless.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun break from the norm","review":"I found this book both fascinating and frustrating. Fascinating, as the life Mountstuart leads is exciting and unpredictable, yet frustrating as one cannot understand the motivation that lies behind the seemingly random events of the protagonist's life. This was an enjoyable read, though for completely different reasons than usual. Typically, I love to read about the inner workings and motivations that lie behind the actions of the main character, yet here the reader is left somewhat bereft.I loved the simplicity with which Mountstuart views life, as a series of events that happen to him out of chance; yet at times I wanted to strangle him for lacking the ability to learn from past mistakes and never having the foresight to plot any sort of future for himself.This was a fun break from the norm.

How can Time magazine call it the best of the year?

Logan Gonzago Mountstuart was a (fictional) writer, spy, art dealer and all around rennaissance man who lived through the great events of the 20th century. This book is written as a diary, and, at first, one can find it a bit tedious, as the your Mountstuart writes clumsily about his experiences.But quickly, this book becomes almost obsessive, as Boyd draws his character with subtle strokes. I was so drawn into this book that I found it hard to put down. Being the first Boyd novel I read, I didn't know what to expect, but I'm certainly going to read others. This character's life is interesting and inspiring, and watching him rise, fall, and finally die is deeply moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO Much better than the film series","review":"If you enjoyed this story on Masterpiece Theatre, you'll love the book so much better.For one it starts in his childhod.... and there are a lot of good scenes not in the film.Does the illustrious Logan redeem himself in the end?

It rings true -- based on my travel experiences and lives of friends.If you liked this (or are interested in Middle Eastern women's issues) you'll probably like Nine Parts of Desire, The Price of Honor, and Memoirs from the Women's Prison (Saadawi).

If the author had lived in Damascus for few years and if one of the reviewers had lived there for 3, I am a person who lived there for 22 years. I do not think that life there is full of threats and betrayal. I am a christian and I never encountered a problem there.

The story had potential and some fun ideas, but never quite fleshed them out completely or lived up to the expectation. First of all, the book is printed in extremely large type, which was very jarring...but it seems it was like writing a college paper - make the font bigger to make up for the lack of substance. Harriet and Martin are somewhat entertaining, but Martin especially becomes very unsympathetic and his actions through most of the book aren't consistent with the picture presented of him in flashbacks. The side characters pop in and out with very little development. It just isn't up to par with writers like Amanda Quick, Elizabeth Dodd, Julie Garwood and others. I'd love to see one of them take this idea and run with it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Couldn't Have Been More Disappointed. Save Your Money.","review":"I bought this book on the strength of customer reviews and I really wanted to like it. What a disappointment. If we're meant to believe that Abigail/Harriet is a spy, then she is the dittsiest one I've ever heard of. She and her \\"family of spies\\" are ludicrously written. They talk about being spies like that...\\"oh yes...we're spies...\\" Ick. There is very little plot here, even less character development, and neither the hero or the heroine are sketched out beyond the barest frames. Also, as far as romance/eroticism goes, there is no there, there. If you don't care about the main characters, then you don't really care about their lovemaking either. I think the author needs a better editor...one who can remind her over and over that the reader wants to be SHOWN, not told. This went into the trashcan, and I do hate having my money wasted. Also, beware of the back cover art. Very trashy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for boys who like knights!","review":"Hat's off to these two authors for creating a book about this subject that is intriguing to boys yet non-violent.

Then the connection to the car became flakey and you had to get it positioned just right. Finally, less than a year later and after only moderate use, the power plug has failed completely. Worse, the fit is so tight you have to hold the dash trim on the car when you try to pull the plug out for fear of ripping the dash right out of the car.Design seems so bad that we just junked the device and have now purchased a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never worked from the start","review":"Installed the product, plugged it into the cigarette lighter socket and nothing: No light on the unit, no power to any devices plugged into it.

I carefully inspected the wire to see if I accidentally crashed it with something - no sign of breakage.I probably should have contacted Amazon or manufacturer at that time, but had other things to worry about and just put it away.

When compared to my Garmin GPS plug, the Garmin plug is smaller and was easy to plug in or remove.You would probability have the same problem in all Honda models. The Wagan 4-Way 12V Automotive Socket Extender that I purchased as a replacement was perfect. The male plug is smaller and thus easy to plug in or remove.

The few problems I had with it I'm not sure are its fault so I'm not taking off any points for that. I wanted to run my laptop through an inverter as well as a radio transmitter for music, but it appears that if I have the inverter plugged in as well as the transmitter the transmitter will turn off. I'm not sure if this because the transmitter sucks, or the inverter is taking a lot of juice (i think it's a 140W inverter) or because the Lenmar is unable to accommodate that high of a load, but I couldn't get them to work together. I was able to run the inverter by itself, as well as the transmitter and a USB charger together."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"the male part works, but the female sockets failed.

As far as him showing art, he did show art, he also showed you by trying many things how these people survived, what they ate, how they cooked, how they made plows, how the Aztecs made weapons that were inferior to the steel ones the Spaniards came equipped with.

I bought it as a birthday gift for a friend who is a Julie Andrews fan, as I am myself, so I did watch it before I gave it away. I do like Blake Edwards as a director, and I liked the cast, but the film itself did not do too much for me. But that's just my opinion. I don't consider the film to be really a comedy, if that is what it is supposed to be. I guess it was just too het for my tastes.

Also, the actors must say interesting things and keep the thing moving along. Burt and Julie in her office, not saying much, is not good film making. But, the part with the dog stuck to Burt's hand is very funny (although not as good as the sex outfit in NEVER AGAIN). There are far better comedies out there: Jack Lemon's stuff for instance(UNDER THE YUM YUM TREE, GOOD NEIGHBOR SAM, THE OUT OF TOWNERS)."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the French Version","review":"Too slick, hip and cool for my britches. An Americanization of a European classic that doesn't work.

The phone is cute but should be more for decoration that actual use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable!","review":"I bought this phone for myself because I love Hello Kitty.

Getting in the right mood, however, will require at least half a bottle of scotch, or something stronger. I always excuse the actors in a movie like this because I know enough actors to know that they're working people just trying to make a living and doing the best they can with the material they've been given. It's the material, the writing, that I have no sympathy for in a movie like this. The script here is so poorly written it makes \\"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\\" look and sound like high concept cinematic art. Watch at your own risk. I'm giving it two stars because I did have some scotch on hand and it - the movie not the scotch - did, unintentionally I'm sure, make me laugh.

The direction is not great (sloppy and uneven) but is saved by a very well written script (by unknown Eric Barker). Violent--yes, but then again the movie is called Hitman's Run and the box has a very large gun pointing at you. If you want family friendly entertainment go rent a Disney cartoon.

This is a fully functional telephone, modeled after the field telephone carried by Lindbergh on his famous solo Atlanic flight. The top case has a working compass, and a series of lights which flash in sequence to display the route of Lindbergh's flight when the phone rings.The receiver isn't a plastic toy-it has a satisfying heft; the cord retracts into the base; the buttons for redial and speed dial are big chunky push buttons. This is a \\"retro\\" phone in the best sense-smoothly functional and up-to-date technology without the feel of being a plastic knock-off.If you're looking for a telephone to compliment a den, library, etc. this is a handsomely crafted & interesting item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks cool, works bad","review":"I had the previous model of the st louis phone and it lasted awhile and was great, but it quit working and I got this model. Its absolutely worthless! I can hardly hear when im on the phone with someone. And, the retractable cord would be a great idea if it actually retracted properly and had enough cord to actually retract. There are also little lights in the top, I think they are supposed to work.. they don't. and they clock seems to work randomly. This is the most unreliable and useless phone I have ever owned. It looks really cool though. They should have spent more time on its funcionality instead of packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slice of Life","review":"I like movies that have a bunch of different story lines that run concurrently or even overlap, and this is one of those. These stories are realistic tales of humans lying in the beds they have made and struggling to get up and move again. The soundtrack, a playlist of torchsongs in a dingy club, becomes a character in the movie.This edition comes with the book of short stories that inspired the screenplay. Not all of the stories are included in the movie, and I enjoyed reading the book and seeing the inspiration behind the characters.Great writing, acting, and directing make watching this movie feel like being a fly on the wall, secretly witnessing the characters at their very best and worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Altman at his complex best","review":"Altman weaves together the disparate, but achingly similar, lives of disfunctional couples in today's Los Angeles.

The film is an Altman masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"bleak, sometimes funny, tragic and a pinch of weird","review":"If you've seen \\"Magnolia\\" and crave more of that genre, this is a good next step... although I would rate \\"Magnolia\\" as being a better product in the end. Different collections of stories with many inter-connected plots... more of a \\"Magnolia\\" meets \\"Pulp Fiction\\" in some ways. Nudity, dead bodies, and breaking hearts. A bleak portrait of our self-centered culture and how we seek to fulfill our own desires over those of of others at any expense. Some scenes were so hilarious that you can almost have heart failure from laughing so hard, but they are mixed in with some of the most uncomfortable scenes you've ever seen... the type that make you want to cover your eyes, yet not blink at the same time.

I don't say this to insult him in any way, but I agree with most but not all of what he says. It could have treated Carver better and he's right about \\"So Much Water So Close to Home\\" and \\"They're Not Your Husband.\\" But \\"A Small, Good Thing?!\\" It's not even faithful in letter, as the treatment of \\"So Much Water So Close to Home\\" basically is! I found it to be another story completely. If you haven't, read the book! The movie is not bad, but it's so totally different that you don't have a clue of Carver's plots or characters or maybe even general sensibility without the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misanthropy on Display","review":"If you read the short stories by Raymond Carver that this movie is based on, you will see how much he loved humankind despite its flaws; this disgusting film displays how much Altman detests people. Carver is spinning in his grave."},{"rating":"2","title":"stealthy greatness!","review":"Like a few others in Altman's career, a truly great film operating on a stealth level. A Southern California Theater of the Absurd all moving toward the sacrifice. That image of Matthew Modine holding that balloon and making that sound will stay in my memory the rest of my life. Not a movie for the impatient. Altman adept and even and driving it home--a director who's mastered his craft and can, every once in a while, create a true gem. There's a reason why everyone in Hollywood wants to be in one of his films when it looks like he's latched onto something good. They know they'll have a place in the film-greats history books. This may be his best. I watched it in three installments, so the length wasn't exhausting. Maybe that helps with the digestion too. Wonderfully absurd in a low key. Highly recommended for the discriminating viewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short Cuts DVD","review":"Quirky film. Strange and amusing. Some disturbing scenes. Film follows several dysfunctional families and chance meetings tie them together. Takes place in California, but any location would play well. R rated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, if not quite great Altman","review":"I certainly liked this film, especially after a 2nd viewing. But it's weak spots kept me from feeling it's one of Altman's very best. There are some less than great performances in key roles -- some actors are miscast, or playing caricatures, or are just not that brilliant. Some story lines seem facile, and the ending feels unsatisfyingly convenient and cute. Still, there's a lot that's funny, and a lot that's moving. It just never quite has the depth, or power or overall vision of it's earlier multi-character epic cousin, 'Nashville'. That said, most critics and people seemed to like it even more than me, and it's well worth seeing and deciding for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Altman at his best","review":"Some reviewers despise this movie because of the humor, some because to them it doesn't represent Carver's work properly. Well, taste differs, so that's for them to decide.To me the film's humor is terrific. I get the feeling Altman got to do what he wanted without too many studio people telling him what to leave out. Sure, some characters are despicable, others are nervous wrecks. But some of them are nice and friendly - though often with a few hilarious ticks.It's as if you are peeking in on parts of these people's lives - watching the mess through pink and orange sunglasses. You're involved from the first scene on, you judge and despise and you laugh until you can't no more.And if at first you disagree with Altman's view of Carver, read the book - it comes along with the set.Truely magnificent!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"This movie receive two stars because there is a scene of Tom Waits dancing around with a leis on; otherwise, I would have given the film only one star.

I lived in Blue Ridge, GA on the Tocca River and had Sourwood trees on my property. The sourwood honey I received from Savannah Bee Company was like no other sourwood honey I have ever tasted. It was actually sour on the initial taste, then bitter on the after taste. It was thick and a rather dark amber color. Anyone that knows sourwood honey knows it is not supposed to be sour. I have never experienced bitter honey before in my life. A small amount of the honey had leaked in the packaging during shipment making unpacking a messy affair. I give this honey 1 star only because there is no lower ranking.

(2) They are small (3) If they haven't fallen apart by the time you open the can, they will by the time you get them to your mouth. Probably more wrong too but I'm trying to stomach my way through them by making stew. I have to put them in a strainer first to rinse off whatever crap that is on them, cook them in butter and lot's of salt & pepper before I put in milk. Then close my eyes & try to palate them.

There's a bit of social commentary about Japan's rapidly aging society in the premise; however, a character's comment that it's not right to put the aged in mechanical beds because that just hides the problem neatly sums up everything \\"Roujin Z\\" has to say on the subject. The rest of the film is rampaging robots, lowbrow comedy, and widespread destruction, none of it very interesting either visually or dramatically.Despite the undeniable talent and experience of Japan's animation industry, I continue to be surprised and annoyed that the same big-eyed, narrow-jawed character design is so prevalent. It seems to be a convention of the genre that fans just accept, but it made me feel that I had already seen \\"Roujin Z\\" as soon as it began."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, classic","review":"This is a wonderfully funny movie about health care.

This is probably one of the least memorable animes ever. The only thing that seperates this from one star, is the fact that I don't think anything-exept that movie which I choose not to name-can hit rock bottom.

But the acting and writing didn't match the power of the images for me, at least on first viewing.Monica Vitti is a housewife losing her mind, who quickly (and without clear reason) obsesses a badly dubbed Richard Harris, who is visiting Vitti's husband on business. What makes this less powerful for me than L'Venturra and L'Ecisse is here the characters talk a lot more, and a lot of the dialogue is stilted and false sounding; way too full of \`meaning' when the images are already so symbolic. And while Vitti is a good actress, she's not Liv Ulmann or Meryl Streep. But where it fails as drama, it's amazing as storytelling through images. Every time everyone shut up, I was immediately drawn back in."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOVIES DON'T HAVE TO BE ENTERTAINING","review":"the director of this movie actually said that, at some point: movies don't have to be entertaining.lots of pretentious european directors actually felt that way, even into the 1970s---which is why movie goers went nuts over entertaining movies like JAWS and STAR WARS.a lot of the images in the movie have the look of a painting---and are as exciting as watching paint dry.a young richard harris is in this movie----with a dubbed into italian voice!the non-plot has to do with alienation and pollution, all done in a sloooow, and quiet, european, fashion; i.e., boring and pretentious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharper Image SI719 Tabletop Silent Air Purifier with Ionic Breeze","review":"I purchased this item to replace one that I had - loved my first ionizer. this ionizer is not working.

The LCD also has the option to turn off, saving battery life. Which brings up another thing. This camera can use 2 AA's. Although they only last 15-20 minutes it is a great life-saver if the big battery dies and you have some AAs. I recommend buying the Info lithium battery.

The reason is that first of all, all of the above problems are found in one way or anoher in all digital cameras (something like a dc trademark) and with the accessories I bought, the camera has transformed into a very powerful device.

Evocative re-enactments and a remarkable exposition of Islamic art, artifacts, and architecture are combined with interviews with scholars from around the world to recount the rise and glory of early Islamic civilization.

It is not, however, unlike some people claim, without its biases: While it spends time detailing how awful the Crusaders of the 11th-12th centuries were, it makes no mention, when talking about the conquest of Constantinople (now Istanbul) by Mehmed II in 1453, of the countless Christians (men, women, & children) slaughtered by his armies, even though it mentions the conquest of the great church in which they were slaughtered: the Haggia Sophia.

Non-muslims who are trying to learn about Islam are missing out on gaining a true understanding of this faith because PBS uses western universities as its source for scholars instead of going to the masjids where you will find the real scholars.

And why nay-say something you haven't even investigated yourself? That's the disgusting thing, not this video.

There is no mention of the centuries of aggressive warfare, oppression, and enslavement that Islam brought to Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. One of the most appalling sequences involves a dramatization of the life of Christian boys stolen from their homes under the devshirme system. These boys were forcibly converted to Islam and then turned into oppressors of their own people suffering under Islamic rule, particularly in the Balkans.

That said, it features some of the best rock and roll criticism (and writing) anywhere. It purports to cover so-called \\"alternative rock,\\" which even editor and major contributor Ira Robbins freely admits is a fuzzy definition at best. The artists included range from rap to heavy metal to college rock to punk to \\"alternative\\" country and everything in between. The main requirement is that they have to have released albums in the 1990s. Hence many rock icons of the new wave 1980s are missing from this latest volume. The artists also range from the megastar level (R.E.M., U2, Metallica) to the truly obscure (Uncle Joe's Big Ol' Driver?). The one constant is the writing, which is uniformly excellent.

While previsou editions had a tendency to verlap since there were mainly simply additions to the previouy one, this edition has chosen to start completely over where the previous editions left off. This means that while the book treats excellently with 90's rock it does lose the sense of historical continuum that you actually have musically when considering all post-punk music (ie.e post about 1976). I know that for those who have the previous editions this is not important but it does in this sense not function as well as a stand-alone work as its predecessors did. Indeed a lot of the music happening in the 90's started in the 80's actually.

The author goes further by providing accounts of some of the more interesting food producers (e.g. Fiorre's the mozzarella maker in Hoboken).Farmers markets, cheese and butcher shops are all covered. The author throws in some good recipes.Contrasting to Zagat's (practical but predictable) this is a fun, lucid and well written food book. It has a wide ranging scope with great coverage of numerous topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello Kitty","review":"Nice calculator. It has the date and time and an alarm built it. Quit sturdy for a kids calculator. The only downfall is that it beeps each time you press a button. This can get a bit annoying if your six-year-old is in love with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it a practical guide?","review":"If you assume that a use case scenario should contain a detailed written description of a user behavior then, perhaps, the book is for you. In my mind it is impractical and most of the time impossible. I disagree with an idea that primary scenario of an event should contain such a detailed description: \\"1. The use case starts when the customer selects Place Order. 2. The customer enters his or her name and address..... 7. Customer will select Submit... 9. When payment is confirmed, the order is marked as confirmed. an order Id is returned to the customer. and the use case ends.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable guide to understanding use cases","review":"I was very, very happy I'd read this book. It describes a simple and intuitive process for analyzing requirements with use cases, and where to go with use cases - to activities, sequences, and packages. I actually enjoyed the fictional dialog; I think it helped me mentally prepare for similar things my users may say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great place to start with Use Cases, but you'll want more","review":"As another reviewer pointed out, the campy dialog that this book relies on to help guide you through the process of developing use cases sometimes hinders the cause more than it helps. Luckily, you can either skim or ignore it altogether and still garner valuable insight into the process of using use cases. This book has served as my read-along guide for a current project and I have found the chapter outlining the final use case documentation for the books' fictional project to be a great aid. I wish there were more books on this topic, especially some with 'real-life' use cases that led to successful projects, but this book is a very good place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quick Read For Those Interested In Use Case Development","review":"This book provides an easy-to-digest introduction to use case development. I wish it had been available when I first began employing use cases. The consistent example of the order entry system -- neither too complex nor too simple -- was helpful in understanding and applying new concepts. However, the fictional example of a team of people meeting periodically to go through the use case exercises was amateurish at its best and painful at its worst. The editors could have cut it entirely, with no loss in readability or understanding. Good dialog is very difficult for even skilled novelists. In my humble opinion, it would have been far more effective had the author pushed the unintentially comical dialog into a full, campy diversion from the topic at hand. Despite this literary faux paxs (presumably provided by the second-billed Jason Winters), Geri Schneider writes with clarity and anticipates questions well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice for the 30 days it worked","review":"This microwave is big and the Inverter technology is nice but it only worked for 30 days and now it buzzes and doesn't cook.I had read other reviews that said it's quality was lacking and just thought they had got one built on a Monday (hangover day) but it appears Panasonics quality is sadly lacking. I am sending mine back, don't know what I am going to get now. My last microwave worked fine for over 6 years until the turntable stopped working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but did not work out of the box","review":"I bought this microwave 2/21/10, it is beautiful and has a lot of features. But the turntable did not work the day I got it. I returned it, no problems, and got a different brand.

Tuuli is awsome... check out the donnas, bratmobile, mary prankster or sleater-kinney if you like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important read for any interested in American Politics","review":"This was written in the late 90s with a print date of 2000. I give it -1 star for the large amount of bias the author starts the book with. However, in light of the contents that bias does serve the memory of the President well.Even more awakening, this book covers Cleveland's time in office which happens to coincide with a great many issues that are EXACTLY or SOMEWHAT exactly affecting us today.He was dealing with the illegal possession by the US of Hawaii, the monroe doctrine in south america, the panic of 1893, and so much more.There is forever a bias in writing and this book is no different. But the bias does not lie on attacks of current events or people (save the first chapter). The bias lies in the reverence the author has for the man and what he did.I think after reading it, you will wish Grover Cleveland was at the helm in 2008 when are economy collapsed. It is praise and bias well earned.Bravo Mr. Cleveland, Bravo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Read for Gilded Age Historians","review":"There are few people who would find the Gilded Age a fascinating time to read about but if you are one of them this biography is perfect. If you are curious about the only honest politician during that era then this is the book for you. Although elected to two terms (non consecutively) see how this democrat filled in the shoes of a largely republican era. This is by far the best biography of Cleveland in print and while some may be turned off by his politicking at the time they fail to realize it was simply the way of things. Cleveland played the political game as honestly as he could and did an excellent job in doing so. Fascinating story about an interesting time in our political history."},{"rating":"1","title":"an example of how NOT to write a biography","review":"Cleveland's story itself is very interesting, but unfortunately this author butchers the concept of biography so badly that it interferes with the story. This is an excellent example of several things to not do when writing a biography, and serves as a great reminder for why we should appreciate the great ones when they come along. The author excessively editorializes (and very simplistically so at that), inserts his own self into the book too frequently (why at all, I ask?), and often contradicts his own interjected opinions with evidence that a few pages later proves the exact opposite. It gets so muddled on occasion that it is hard to understand how the author came to hold such strong opinions (that for some reason he felt were necessary to include) in the first place. My advice: look elsewhere...I do NOT recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Biographer with an Agenda which Does Not Include Objectivity","review":"The author seems to have two primary purposes for the book: 1. To justify everything that Cleveland did throughout his political career (Cleveland could do no wrong); and 2. To use Cleveland as a vehicle to editoralize on how bad of persons and presidents that Nixon, Reagan, and Bush (first) were.It is a work that will prove to be disappointing to anyone seeking an objective account of an important president who had strengths and weaknesses as expected for any true leader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"Wanted to add some sprouts to our nightly salad routine and after finding out how much sprouts cost in the stores and how much we mow through, I figured that I could do this much cheaper at home.This is a great product, adds a different twist to the normally boring alfalfa sprouts.

Kerry King looks like an idiot sporting his new Anton LaVey 'do, and a lot of the aggression that Slayer was so famed for is gone. A disappointment for hardcore metal-heads will be the appearance of ex-Skid Row frontman Sebastian Bach hanging with the bad boys and the one Venom cover (\\"Witching Hour\\") was utterly butchered. Slayer was once a great band, but they just haven't held up the way Motorhead or the Ramones have. A little goofing off is shown behind the scenes, but most of it is low-energy concert footage. I tghink it's time they gave it up before they have no fans left."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this product until you read this","review":"This product is advertised as as a 1500 mAh battery. It is not. The ad copy is wrong. It is in fact a 1050 mAh battery. I don't know why they still haven't corrected this.

I dissolved it in vodka per the recommendations and watched at least three instructional videos on YouTube before I did it. I used the gold on cookies decorated with Royal icing. I started with yellow/gold icing and brushed the dissolved powder over my Superbowl helmet cookies. I made San Francisco Giants helmets and was trying to achieve that metallic gold color.

It sounded like something I would like, and luckily I was right. The movie is a bit long (about 2 hours) but there aren't too many lulls in the action. I laughed throughout the whole thing, but there were also some more serious scenes that tugged at my heart. Paco the shoe salesman and Nino the drifter are an unlikely pair, but their interaction together and with other people is funny, sometimes hysterical, heartwarming and inspirational. I think everyone can enjoy Paco and Nino's road trip through a small part of southwest France. If you've been to France it will make you want to return, and if you've never been this is a nice and honest introduction to the culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casio 670 is fantastic","review":"Had a few days now and have to say that this is a great little TV.

Not being a camera guy this was my first camera I ever bought. I wasn't too excited about it but my girlfriend was. Turned out the camera was fun and really useful.We bought the Sony rechargable batteries after realizing the regular ones last about 10 minutes. The new batteries last about an hour and a half, which makes them a good bargain. The memory card it comes with is not very useful, but I reccommend atleast 32MB.The digital camera is fun, especially for an electronics junky like me. I recommend this camera highly. The picture quality is outstanding in my opinion, being a novice the pictures are clear and that is good enough for me. We have a portable sony printer and the images we have printed are amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tons of functionnality, short battery life","review":"It's my first digital camera, and I don't know if this battery issue is shared by other brands and models. However, the fact that an AC adapter and a rechargable battery are expensive options certainly doesn't help to forgive this camera's battery life. Apart from that, it's quality is very good, and it has a lot of functionnalities. It is everything I expected from a digital camera when I decided to buy one, and more. UPDATE: I have seriously demoted this camera rating from 4 to two stars after mine just broke a few months after the warranty expired."},{"rating":"2","title":"E-mail feature","review":"The e-mail feature is great (even though at first glance, it looks like a waste of marketing). When then camera is in email mode, it will save the high-quality picture, AND it will save a 15k copy of the picture. This \\"thumbnail version\\" is a very handy size to post to a personal website.The high-quality setting will take 550k/picture so the included 4mb card will hold 7 pictures. If you don't use the extra digital zoom, you will get 4x6 prints that are worthy of framing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great product from Sony!","review":"I did plenty of research before purchasing this camera and I can proudly say that it was a very good decision. The picture quality is great, and the camera is very easy to use. Included software is great and it is easy to upload pictures from the camera to your desktop. Mpeg movie option is great also. The only complaint I have is that it does not include any rechargable batteries / charger, the included AA alkaline batteries don't last more than few hours. I am very impressed with this camera and would highly recommend it to anyone who is considering a low priced high quality digital camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from Sony","review":"If you want a camera for sending pictures over the Internet or for small photos, then the Sony DSC-P30 camera is a great entry level camera. Even though it's 1.3 megapixels, this camera has a lot features not available on other 1.3 megapixels such as 6X zoom and mpeg movie (no audio). The best feature I like is the macro setting as it lets you take pictures up close of very small objects. Since, I publish trout flies over the internet, I have got comments about the great picture quality.The only downside to the camera is battery comsumption. I would recommend buying batteries specially designed for digital cameras. When I go fishing I often bring a spare pair of batteries and over a day I can run out of power. The best way to solve that problem is turn off the viewfinder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera","review":"Awesome!! Its price and features are hardly to find in such a sleek camera. The quality of the pictures is good enough in almost every situation, so if you are not a professional you'll be amazed of what can be done with 1.3 Megapixels. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is beacuse of his \\"STAMINA\\" power supply, they are not included!!, and if you buy it (almos a MUST HAVE!) you have to buy the charger too. But still it is a great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice camera - the battery issue is terrible, however","review":"We bought this for my sister for her birthday. It is a great camera, but the rate that it goes through AA batteries is inexcusable. My sister has had it for 2 days and has gone through 4 sets of AA batteries.

Amazon may only be the middle man getting buyers and sellers together; but they should try to filter out sub par companies.

After playing around with the makisu for several minutes, I noticed that the product was very light and flimsy. Very much like a sheet of paper.

Well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I read through the first 2/3 of the book and decided that was enough for me. I've read some powerful self-help material but this is not it. The author really lost me when he said, \\"make every choice for me and me only.\\" In other words, he was discussing how being true to yourself is the absolute end-all-be-all. He gave an example of his friend really needing to talk when she was upset but he was wanting to sit down and do some writing. So his advice and solution is to totally reject his friend and take care of his own needs. Then later he goes to her and is \\"fully engaged\\" to listen to her and take care of her needs.There are some nuggets of truth and some profound ideas in this book. But it has such a selfish premise under it all that I just couldn't swallow it.I want to learn how to be nice WHILE I'm being real.Since I spent good money on this I couldn't bear to throw it away so I gave it to my therapist.

This was a non-negotiable demand, because just like Mr. Bryson said in his book, people should always insist on their needs, never compromise, and be selfish 100% of the time. My ex also said his women should move into our house and live with us, and I should accept that, because to do otherwise would be to not love my husband enough to allow him his freedom, and would be trying to limit our relationship.Guess he's right: I didn't love him that much.

I kept a copy of this movie through the years and watched it probably 50 or 60 times. It's an excellent - though low budget, sometimes campy and sometimes boring - yarn about a search for the elusive Bigfoot. The comedy comes from the acting, which leaves a lot to be desired. But overall, this is an excellent \\"good time\\" campy B-rated movie that has brought me much joy throughout the years, and will likely continue to do so long into the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good b-movie","review":"The first time I watched this film was at night, in the dark with everybody else in the house asleep. Thats how I would recommend watching this film. I have heard some bad reviews about this film but you have to remember this film was done in the 70's during the whole bigfoot rage. Most people know what they're in for when they get this film. A great popcorn movie that will scare the bejeezus out of you under the right conditions...lights off, quiet, and alone in the room. I highly recommend this film for a good fright. Just remember the film makers had a very small budget, but they pulled off a very convincing scary little flick. I would rate this film one star above boggy creek."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buried Treasure","review":"This is a fun little movie that entertains.It is a fast paced and actually quite humorous in some parts.The two main characters have a really good chemistry and work well together. The final scene surprisingly gets pretty creepy and has a great atmosphere to it.I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the Bigfoot genre, independent horror or 1970's cheese.This is probably the best Bigfoot movie ever made and it is suitable for all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Cheesy Bigfoot B-Movie.","review":"Fans of Bigfoot movies will probably like this one, but it is not in the least bit scary and yes the bigfoot creature does look just like a man in a suite.Essentially \\"Creature From Black Lake\\" is about two young anthropologists who are given a grant to go look for a bigfoot type creature in Louisiana. Along the way there is lots of corny segments involving girls and a run-in with the law. In the end they manage to track down bigfoot and end up in a bid for survival.There is really only one good thing about this movie - Dean Cundy does a great job of the cinematography. Apart from that it is extremely cheesy and is only for bigfoot completists that must have everything. If you want to see a good cheesy Bigfoot movie then see \\"Legend of Boggy Creek\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I have my money back please?","review":"I am a huge fan of \\"The Legend Of Boggy Creek\\". Everytime I read about \\"Boggy Creek\\" , this film \\"Creature From Black Lake\\" seems to come up as well. It is recommended by many fans of Boggy Creek. SO I end up paying more than I should to have \\"Creature\\" in my DVD collection. I had never seen the film before it arrived in the mail. It was just terrible, not even good on a campy level. Frankly, I feel it was a waste of money, there were so many other movies I had been wanting yet instead bought this BOMB. Don't let the reviews foil you. It is awful. It is unintentionally funny (the acting). And frankly, if I could, I would get my money back from Amazon and send this DVD back.

We bought it because we have a 14 mo son that likes to play with the trash can and we thought this one would be more toddler friendly (Ie: he wouldn't be able to open). But alas, he figured figured it out pretty quickly.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything we thought it would be!","review":"When our former kitchen trashcan broke, we decided to splurge and get a nicer can, especially one that would match our new refrigerator. This one seemed to fit the bill. The fingerprint proof finish is as they say, and the action on the lid is quiet and smooth. The only less than positive thing to say about it is that if you have an overhang on your countertop, and most people do, the lid will smack the overhang if you are a little overzealous with the footpedal. We have addressed that issue twofold: both stepping on the footpedal more gently, and putting a couple of felt color-matched sticky pads to lessen the \\"bang\\" that inevitably happened. Otherwise, the can is great, and while the bags (three) that they supply with the can are wonderful, our normal 13-gallon, white kitchen trash bags work just fine. We recommend wholeheartedly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent combination of form and function!","review":"The brushed stainless steel looks sleek and modern and this particular shape can utilize regular bags (I use a generic 13 gallon drawstring bag) as well as the expensive liners put out by the brand. The lid is easily activated by a step and locks in the open position (a light push downward releases it). Unlike some other step trash cans, this one is completely noiseless. The liner is also an added bonus.

I had other Simplehuman trash cans (kitchen & home office) and have always been pleased with the quality. They work great and the brushed stainless steel is easy to wipe off and keep clean. The co. guarantees these for 10 years and I believe they will work just fine for at least that length of time.

No one called in advance to say what they were shipping. I called their contact number and was told that they do not sell the 13 gallon can even though it was advertised on Amazon. At that point, I was offered a rebate which would have had the can still cost more than if I had ordered a 10 gallon can. When I pointed out that fact, they offered the larger rebate. Then it became a take the rebate or send the can back. If I sent it back, they said they would reimburse me for the cost I initially paid for the can but never discussed paying for my initial shipping costs or to have it shipped back. In the end, I kept the can as the less expensive of the two options as I would have to buy a can from another vendor. But I am not sure if this was a bait and switch or an honest mistake.

A young boy tries to drive off all babysitters so his parents will spend more time at home. This movie plays more like a tv show. Some tired jokes played by a very weak cast with no direction.

Idiotic parents work so hard every night entertaining clients, that they are ready to leave their kid with anybody. He is supposed to be a good puppy and stay put, while mom and dad make money to pay for lexus and a big house. That is exactly what is wrong with the modern world. The kid learns a lesson that being bad or being good does not matter, because his parents are going to do what they want anyway. As a mother I felt frustrated, and they call this movie comedy.

When compared with a brilliant album like Electro - Shock blues this is like a cheap, boring imitation.Electro Shock made me cry, this just makes me bored.His obsession with the musical \\"square\\" of melody... it's 4 chords 1,2,3,4 you listen and you can hear it in almost every song he writes. It's most obviously shown on the single \\"Mr. E's beautiful blues\\". It's like a loop and for some reason he uses it all the time.ANYWAY. I must say... even though this is certainly not a 4 or 5 star album, it is a hell of a lot better than \\"SHOOTENANNY\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Amazing Album!","review":"Blinking lights is a great eels album. Contrary to what I was told, there are several songs on this CD that have a high replay value (Railroad man and ugly love to name a couple), and every song is enjoyable and easy to listen to. I put this album in the same league as Electro shock blues and Daisies of the Galaxy. I'm really glad I purchased this CD and I recommend anyone who has ever heard and enjoyed an Eels song to take the plunge, and shell out the fifteen bucks for this CD. It's well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Promise fulfilled","review":"It's taken E several years and albums to fulfill the promise of the great Electro-Shock Blues.

Luckily I found it on sale for $10 and I can see why. You see, when I first purchase a new album I always try to listen to it all the way through, but this was kind of painful. I kept impatiently waiting to hear one good rock song out of the 35 or whatever slow and boring tracks that all sound the same. I heard somebody refer to it as E's \\"musical square of melody\\"...but I just call it repetitive failure. That was kind of harsh. I understand that it deals with life and death- particularly those in his family, but, in my opinion, it just didn't seem to measure up to E's previous work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Double-Album is Big Disappointment","review":"After being blown away by \\"Shootenanny!\\" and \\"Souljacker\\", I was let down to hear what an underachievement \\"Blinking Lights\\" is. Though its size and scope weigh it down, the quality of the songs is ultimately what makes it a bad record.I would probably have been excited to hear these songs if this album came after \\"Beautiful Freak\\". At that point this record would have been growth, but after we've all see the progress made on the last two albums, \\"Blinking Lights\\" seems painfully elementary.The sparseness of the record hurts it as well, as the entire product is an exercise in the miserable self-pity E is famous for; the problem is that the music and writing isn't enough to carry the same old ideas E has been singing about since the band began.The standout on this record is, \\"If You See Natalie\\", and sadly, you could count its peers on one hand. I'm a huge Eels fan, but this record is a letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"These Songs Aren't Very Good (and other observations)","review":"Most double albums, of course, would benefit from some pruning and be far more successful as single albums. And then there are some double albums that are so lousy with bad songwriting, noodling instrumentals, and bland filler that they would have to be edited down to, say, EP size before the good would effectively outweigh the bad.

Well he hasn't really invented the perpetual motion machine. He's just made sure that his poorly crafted wagon is on an endless downward slope. And it's gaining reckless speed. In perpetuity.Eels peaked at Daisies of the Galaxy, started to junk out on Souljacker--which at least had a few great songs. Then Shootenanny? Are you kidding me? (Okay, Fashion Awards was funny.) And now Blinking Lights...?Bland, forgettable songs. Tired, entirely guessable rhyming couplets and the same old four riffs he's been dry humping since Electro-Shock Blues--which, incidently, was a great album. Buy it. But don't buy Blinking Lights.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unispiring","review":"I am the biggest Eels fan but this album is just not any good.There is certainly not a lot of creativity in this record. I get a feeling E fired Butch and put out this double album to be able to increase his own dollar earning.There are not many inspiring songs. Lots of slow stuff that you've heard before, boring drum machines and lyrics that borders on the point of ridicule (listening to 'Son of a Bitch' makes me itch all over for the skip button).Come on E - you can be brilliant. Make an effort and keep us fans happy.This album is NOT worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"I don't know what some of you people are listening to, but this was awful. There are about 4 songs that I could actually listen to. Let's face facts, Souljacker is FAR and AWAY the best EEL'S album.

I HIGHLY recommend against it unless you like to torture yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I bought the album out of pressure from friends.

I didn't realize it was a two disc set, so I was pleased when I saw 33 tracks queue up for my hard drive. Overall it's solid but somber Eels fare. Definitely a good one for rainy day reading. There are a few really stellar tracks on here. \\"Railroad Man\\" is beautiful and emotional. It's my favorite of the album. The emotional symmetry of the songs is interesting, but it can make it difficult to listen to the album straight through as you start to crave a little diversity. Overall though the lyrics are some of their best and it's certainly worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blinking Lights And Other Revelations","review":"Blinking Lights And Other Revelations is a very strange and wonderful concept album. Is it a pop album, instrumental or just experimental? For me it is an album that is hard to define as we get so many different genres on it. I must say that even though the book-let is very strange it is also very nice with personal photos taken from family photos. The lyrics are intensly personal and heavy with emotions. Hey Man is a really good track. The lyrics are so right on how you feel after having been depressed. It is like coming out of darkness and starting to live again. It is something that has to be experienced to completely understand the feeling. Dust of ages is also a track that I like alot. This record was a very nice surprise indeed and I will listen to more of Eels. 4/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another step up by Everett.","review":"I've been listening to the Eels ever since Beautiful Freak was released, and it's a little nerve wracking to hear each new album for the first time. I'm always hopeful Everett will provide new musical insights and lyrics.I especially love the flashbacks to the 90's in the album (\\"Whatever Happened to Soy Bomb\\") and many of the beautiful break-up and love songs (\\"Ugly Love\\", etc.) If you've liked any of the past Eels albums, I guarantee you will find songs you absolutely LOVE on this album. There are SO many tracks to choose from, and you're sure to find your own jewel. It's been great working and driving to this spectacular double album."},{"rating":"2","title":"agreed","review":"in total agreement that \\"blinkling lights and other revelations\\" brings the eels back to the electro-shock blues/daisies of the galaxy days. daisy's has long been my favorite album, but this one, after only one listen, takes the top prize. outstanding and worth every penny. i've been waiting for so long now and this album does not dissapoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just right","review":"Perfect for the newbie who has no probgramming experience but an understanding of the concept of programming and also of the structure of SQL databases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of mySQL for Dummies","review":"This very readable text does what it sets out to do - gives the reader a full appreciation of the power and initial usage of mySQL and PHP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dummies books not for Kindle...","review":"With most types of \\"for Dummies\\" books, you will be going back and forth throughout the book for recalling things that were discussed.

Have managed to do 12 of them so far. As someone without any technical mountaineering skills, I found the book to be great. The descriptions of the difficulties of the climbs were excellent as were the route descriptions. The only thing that was a little poor were the directions to the actual trailheads. Roads milage was often wrong, which made finding turns on dirt roads difficult. If you're looking to begin climbing in CO, this book is an excellent source of information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for reaching your 14er goals","review":"I've lived in Colorado all my life and two years ago, I started my experience with Colorado 14ers. I may not be the most avid climber, but I do plan on climbing these amazing mountains for many years to come. After my second mountain, I realized that I was going to need a way to keep track and better plan my future climbs and, being that I worked at a bookstore, I had a pretty good opportunity to look through many books on the subject. I found this book to be by far the best guide of its type. It gives all the information that a climber will need to climb every last fourteener and does so in a way that is enjoyable and easy to understand without giving away any of the thrills and experiences of the climb itself. I highly recommend this book to anybody who wants to climb even just one of these amazing mountains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, very easy to follow","review":"and accurate in my experience.

Massive trailhead look to be wrong as well. Most, if not all, of the route descriptions have coordinates. After noticing this mistake, I can't trust them. The book is still useful, but I have to give it 1 star because it claims to be \\"known for accuracy\\" and has GPS coordinates as a selling point."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best for the dry season","review":"In addition to an array of routes to chose from, Roach's guide also has the best descriptions on route and potential hazards on routes.Roach's guide is stellar for those interested in climbing in the summer and early fall seasons, when snow isn't an issue.Unlike Dawson there are few (if any) references to ski-mountaineering, and a limited number of snow routes. For this reason, Roach's guide isn't the greatest for those interested in snow-climbing and ski descents.

That said, I found the route descriptions a little difficult to follow (maybe I was hoping for more top maps.)I don't know about you, but for me the hardset part of doing a fourteener is parking my car.

The menu is easy to use (my 77 year-old grandmother used it). If you are looking for a camera that saves pictures on floppy and memory stick, this is the camera for you.

Sony claimed that the rebate information I sent was never received and they were not helpful in assisting me with my battery issue.

I can cry just thinking of certain scenes and I am sorry I was too young to see the Broadway version but having the movie is the next best thing. The Academy did something right for a change by honoring both actresses and that particular year the competition was fierce - Bancroft beat Bette Davis (\\"Baby Jane\\"), Katherine Hepburn (\\"Long Days Journey into Night), among others.

It's inspirational for teachers, students, people with obvious infirmities and those with less than obvious infirmities. Because of the talented portrayals of the characters in this real-life drama, people are able to witness that with the help of a fine teacher infirmities can be miracles in of themselves.I gave this movie as a gift to my niece, who is an avid Helen Keller fan and, at the age of 9, had no idea that there was a movie about her.

Sean Bean (Silent Hill, Lord Of The Rings) is his familiar, consternated self as the husband / father, James.

This was put out by Sony Pictures- who brought us the new version of the Amityville Horror (which should have been rushed to the dumpster)- I'm not quite sure why they would have released that and not given this film to theatres. This is a scary-child-ghost movie that is actually a little different from the recent crop [...] of scary kid movies that have come out in the last few years.

Mario Bello stars as a grieving Mother who meets a young girl who startlingly resembles her late daughter, Sarah. Bello chews the scenery every moment she is on screen and Sean Bean - who plays her equally depressed husband - simply looks uncomfortable in a phoned-in performance at best. The film tries very hard to be intriguing and original, but ends up wrapped in its own tangled web.

If you are fans of these movies then this one will make you very happy. It's thought provoking and has a good story, but I'm just tired of movies like this. There are a couple parts in the movie that make you think something else is going on but then it never goes back to those scences or never expound on them making you wonder why they are there in the first place as they end up having nothing to do with the \\"horror\\" if you couuld call it that."},{"rating":"1","title":"This could have been great.","review":"With Sean Bean and Mario Bella in it, I was expecting a far better film. They are both excellent actors and I they were both brilliant in it but the script was all over the place and quite bland.Obvious J-horror influnces but this just didn't come together for me and left me bored and un-moved.Wish it was better."},{"rating":"2","title":"What 'Ring 2' Should Have Been....","review":"Fans of the Ring and the Grudge will find plenty to like here.

A true Horror film in every way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good buy for lover's of 80's music!","review":"I purchased this cd for the song, \\"Goin' Down\\". It was a favorite of mine that I heard on the radio, and I had to buy the 45, during the time when 45's were really cool. Just that song itself is enough to buy the cd for, but after listening to it, I can tell you that the whole vibe of the cd is the same as that song. Without going into each track, each song fits in with the mood of the cd. It is not one of those cd's where you find a one hit wonder and that's it. I'm surprised that more released singles did not come from, \\"Over The Line\\", because all of the songs are good. You will want to listen to it more than just one time. For any collector of music, this is a rare find in the archives of 80's music. Greg Guidry has a great voice and it complements the quality and style of the song selections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Forster best efforts","review":"I had read that the Taken series as not very good and had hope they were wrong, but the Taken series is boring, poorly written, and completely predictable.

If you must read this series check it out from the library and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Child's Christmas in Wales","review":"The printing is nice, of course, but the low rating is because the illustrations were very disappointing. We were replacing a printed version maybe 10 years old, which we misplaced before Christmas Eve when we always read the poem, and hoped this edition would have appealing illustrations, as the prior one did. And the New York Times imprimatur gave me hope for good illustrations in particular. There were no children with us, but we three adults thought the illustrations were dark, almost scary for children -- not joyful remembrances of good times in days gone by (at least not joyful to us). This is a disadvantage to ordering sight-unseen rather than actually looking at a book at a bookstore before purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"Loved this book as a child.

Being a big fan of Science fiction and special effect movies as well as good hindi cinema, I watched this movie first day first show with family. I invited all the kids from family and friend as this movie was suppose to be a kid or family friendly. It was utterly disgusting. I simply cannot believe that a superstar and good actor like SRK made such a horrible movie. Its a random mixture of scenes stolen from known Hollywood movies with Bollywood song & dance and poor language stereo type jokes. I guess they forgot the fact that even SRK movie needs a story, a plot and a screen play. Please save your money and wait for another SRK movie. This is complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time and money!","review":"The movie clearly lacks substance and entertainment, lets accept it SRK can't act except under some very good director and he looks artificial and melodramatic in most scenes.

It is a good looking trash can and is sized just right for me. However, the pedal mechanism is broken, like several other reviewers have noted. For what this trash can costs, it is ridiculous that it has such a short life span. The pedal mechanism has several high stress areas and the plastic used by Simplehuman just doesn't cut it.

I'm returning mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST GARBAGE CAN EVER!!","review":"Do not under any situation buy this can, way too many problems with something that should be simple to use. One of the main problems is that for what genius reason there are sharp metal edges inside the can so every time you take out your bag of garbage-that's right the bag rips (EVERY TIME!!!) Another reason is a sanitary one before you remove each full garbage bag full of garbage you are forced to stick your hand in the garbage to remove the binding ring that holds the bag in place..disgusting!

This is the world of the drow, one of the most evil and malicious races to taint the Material Plane; the svirfneblin, little deep gnomes who avoid the drow at all costs; and other denizens, most too unspeakably vile to name. But all these creatures are but pawns in the hands of greater powers: authors. Authors like Ed Greenwood, Elaine Cunningham, and Mark Anthony, among others. This book gives you a sample of what the Underdark has to offer and also whets your appetite for longer works the authors have written. Its only drawbacks are that the plots get kind of oppressive after awhile (the Underdark'll do that to you) and the fact that Mark Anthony didn't do justice to RA Salvatore's characters. Other than that, the book is definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, but CHEAP plastic!!","review":"Mine broke within two weeks, the right headphone started to rotate a full 360 degrees when it should have been only 45 degrees.

Tried using crazy glue again for nothing, three weeks later the right headphone broke completely (a thin piece of plastic that holds it to the metal rotating piece just broke). Needless to say these were trash, and perhaps too big for the design. Had they been smaller they would have survived. I yet have to send them to see if KOSS would honor their lifetime warranty.

I found the work quite inadequate in its representation of an objective analysis of the Biblical analogies of the Bahai Faith. Not only was this an apologetic piece of polemic work, but the author's prejudices were so stunningly apparent, that it is truly hard to accept any of it as being objective.

Well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Wonder Years is as Tasteless as Wonder Bread","review":"Fortunately, I did not waste my money on this book. As someone intimately familiar with the subject matter, I found it to be filled with sweeping generalities, hackneyed cliches and gross inaccuracies. It was a bombastic exercise in egotism at best. There did not seem to be any footnotes, giving credit to the quotes and references he included; I smell a libel lawsuit here. As a grammarian, I was astounded and dismayed at the syntactical and grammatical errors; somehow the editor dropped the ball!!!His original poetry addressing his personal problems with cystic acne was a travesty and is better placed in a dermotologist's office.All told, I can't imagine any high school or college student finding any useful information in this book, except if they needed a good laugh. As for the photo and bio on the cover....Hearing this author speak would only motivate me to run away screaming. He was sold a bill of goods when someone told this guy he could write."},{"rating":"1","title":"BACK WAS BROKEN","review":"the back would not shut making it utterly useless for my class though the bag, lens and other items were in great condition"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pertronix Ignitor","review":"I have a boat with 1960 motors in it and I was tired of changing and cleaning the points continually.

I recommend purchasing a new distributer cap as well.Service and price thru Amazon was excellent as always."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow is this bad","review":"I love how this book references its source material and then goes right against it. A truly bad read and I will never reread it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another average album","review":"I'm always amazed when I see people who talk about being die-hard train fans or that train is one of their top 5 favorite artists. Their music, by and large is just garbage. Both of their previous albums had exactly one song worth listening to (Meet Virginia, Drops of Jupiter) and this album is little different. The popular radio hooks are Calling All Angels and When I Look to the Sky, both of which have similarities to their past radio singles in the somewhat catchy beat with lyrics that rhyme but have little meaning. Train is definitely a product of radio airtime, with very little redeeming value musically. And the overproduction on this latest album is more than I can stand.If you have to buy the album, Lincoln Avenue and Following Rita are two of the more listenable songs along with the other two I mentioned. Not worth buying and album just for these songs though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, this dog's got fleas.....","review":"This CD stinks, it's hard to distinguish one song from the next. Extremely sophmorish (even though it is their third offering. The first single \\"Calling all Angels\\" has the best hook on the CD, and thats not saying much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome!!!!","review":"This album rox my sox! It is SO(...) cool!! Train is AWESOME!!!! THIS CD WAS WELL WORTH THE [amount paid]!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A flat album","review":"First of I like Train alot, but I think this record is a little boring. The songs all sound the same. It seems like they just did \\"Calling all Angels\\" and the rest is filler. Train's first album is great and each song is different.It seems like they where like hey, \\"Drops of Jupiter (2nd record) got us on the map, so let's make this album sound like that one.\\" I will admit there are a couple of good songs but I would just get the single if u haven't bought this disc yet. If you haven't gotten any Train disc yet I would def. get ther 1st disc"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite album ever!","review":"My favorite album ever! All could listen to when I first bought it when it first came out. This was my second copy to use for an autograph. These guys just keep getting better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"another good one from Train","review":"Train seem to have made a place for themselves in light rock. They have their own signature sound that makes them easily identifiable: light, twinkly guitars, a bouncy bass line, and fun, quirky lyrics. Those qualities make this CD very listenable. Sure, some of their songs sound very similar, but they are enjoyable all the same.The singles off this disc are Calling All Angels, When I Look To The Sky, and Get To Me. They are really catchy, great sing along songs. But, the hits don't stop there. All American Girl, My Private Nation, and I'm About To Come Alive are other highlights.Check this out if you are a fan of Train. I doubt it will disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointed at first, but definately grows on you","review":"I have been a HUGE fan of Train since 1997. I was disapointed at first with this CD. I gave it a few listens and I have grown to love it. No, it is not the Train that I first fell in love with, but don't dismiss it right away - the songs on this album (especially the 2nd half) grow on you.And if you love the old sound of Train, I recommend getting the CAA import from Australia. The B-sides on that CD should have been on MPN."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY good CD!","review":"I would've given this CD 5 stars except for 2 minor things.1. I don't hear that one huge hit ala \\"Drops of Jupiter\\".2. The album is just slightly over-producedHaving said that, this is a WONDERFUL CD. The first time I listened to it, I was a little disappointed (see above) while waiting for that one big song to just floor me.As I listened to it more though, I realized that's there's not a single \\"fast forward to the next track\\" song on the ENTIRE spin. Do you realize how rare that is these days? Every one of these songs is good and some are just plain excellent. I can't help but sway during \\"Get to Me\\" and \\"I'm About to Come Alive\\" is a hauntingly touching song. Both songs are already some of my favorites of all time. I definitely hear some Beatles influence along with some catchy beats.Bottom line: listen to it at least 4 times before you judge. I think you'll find exactly what I found; this is a GREAT CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking this Train over and over","review":"You can't compare any of the Train CD's to one another because they all have different styles, but yet all are quality music. Calling All Angels, Get To Me, Counting Airplanes are the three best tracks. This is a fun CD that has some catchy lyrics that will stick in your head well after you turn the music off. That makes me know that the time I spent listening to the CD was well worth the time and will be for many years."},{"rating":"1","title":"One great song, followed by nothing but filler.","review":"The first song on the SACD is \\"Calling All Angels\\" which is wonderful, and then it's downhill from there. If that isn't bad enough, the production is this incredible technique of \\"in your face, all of the time\\"! The recording engineer must have been way too wired during mix-down. At times, almost unlistenable."},{"rating":"2","title":"easily the best cd by train","review":"This CD is most definately the best CD that I own, or have ever heard in my life. Calling All Angels is the worst track by far, far too techno and not enough guitar and the elements that make Train great. All-American Girl and When I Look to the Sky are, in my opinion, the best songs on the CD. I recommend this CD to anyone that likes Maroon5, Gavin Degraw, or Dave Matthews, or if you just want to hear something new. A great CD for anyone that loves good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album I have heard in a while","review":"What Beth Massa says is NOT TRUE!!! This CD is not flat and I am richly rewarded by this new album. This album will grow on you. The first time I heard it I wasnt impressed, then I suddenly felt like listening to it again the whole thing through and the lyrics proved to be INCREDIBLE. Listen to \\"I'm about to Come Alive\\" and \\"When I look to the Sky\\". I like them EVEN BETTER than \\"Calling All Angels.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album","review":"I didn't like Train's first album much, but My Private Nation is an excellent album. \\"Calling All Angels\\" is a great song and my Favorite is \\"When I Look to the Sky\\". This Album reminds me of Def Leppard in the fact their isn't a bad song on the album. Train has just gained a new fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little disappointing...but still very good","review":"while there is not a single great song such as drops of jupiter or meet virgina, there are 11 very good ones here. to be honest, id hoped for more but its a very good album, just not great."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad!","review":"This CD is terrible. I have seen Train live and own their other albums and was anticipating the release of this album. I was very let down, however. The lyrics are so very weak and the songs sound like they are produced just for the radio. The whole CD is bla, there isn't any orginality to it. Please don't buy unless you are family member of the band or are a die-hard train fan. Since I am neither, I sold my copy on eBay!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SO disappointed! What happened to my TRAIN?","review":"I saw what was happening with the 2nd cd (Drops)....and this one proves it. The first album was just amazing....one of the top 30 or so albums I own, that's saying a lot. But sure enough...corporate rock fingers gripped the band....gone are the great bluesy licks evident on cd#1, gone is the edgy rock that makes you want to step a little harder on the gas pedal.In are soaring vocals and sweeping synths that leave me cold. Train now sounds as over produced as Britney Spears.I wish the guys well, but I'm looking forward to the day their radio-friendly welcome will wear out (it will--sooner than expected). Maybe then the band will get signed to a smaller label and will start putting out music that rocks again -- when they wrote for themselves and not the bottom line."},{"rating":"1","title":"no soul or substance","review":"...the songs aren't up to par and the fancy studio trickery makes it even worse...the band doesn't come through and it sounds like they fired the drummer for a beat machine. Only the vocals shine on this record which is nothing to brag about. If it wasn't for \\"I'm About to Come Alive\\" I would have traded My Private Nation cd for an american idol cd. I guess you guys didn't hear The Rising before you hired Brendan O'Brien."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordinary, ordinary, ordinary...","review":"I'm a bit disappointed with this latest recording by Train. The main things missing are: the use of string instruments we grew to love in \\"Drops of Jupiter\\", strong musical material and aggressive vocals by Pat Monahan. From the beginning to the end of the disc, it nearly sounds like one song. Now the \\"one\\" song you hear isn't bad, but it lacks excitement. There are, however, enough key changes and chord progressions to keep your interest...barely.Sad to say, this recording should have been called \\"My Private B-sides Nation\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE Fan - But Not of This Album","review":"I've known and loved Train since long before they were known by most. I even sat and had wings and beer with the guys in a bar where only 50 or so people came to hear them, so I've been a pretty die-hard fan. So, I hate to say this, but I'm not a real fan of this album. Something is definitely missing! Perhaps its the absence of Rob Hotchkiss, but the album seems very bland and middle-of-the road to me. This album sounds less like a \\"band\\" and more of a Pat Monahan album with some occasional backup. As much as I love Train, I think this album is not very challenging musically and its a real disappointment to someone who has the first two albums as a regular \\"staple\\" in my CD player!Sorry, guys....its just not good enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than there last","review":"I am a huge Train fan, and I didn't think they could come up with a CD that was better, but I was wrong. This CD is the greatest CD I have. I find that they do have a little bit of Beattles in them, and also a bit of Steve Miller Band, in this CD. I can't believe that the song Counting Airplanes hasn't got talked about very much, that has to be on of there best. A few of my other favorites are Save the Day, Lincoln Avenue and the title track My Private Nation, also of course Calling all Angels. Train is one of the best bands in the history of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trains Best Album","review":"I was the first person in my town to become a Train fan way back when with Meet Virginia. Their debut album is still one of my favorites, however My Private Nation is definatley their best album to date.I was rather aprehensive when I bought this cd because reviews had shot it down saying that it was lacking and was \\"too happy\\" (seriously, i am not kidding)but i was very pleased that they were wrong.The lyrics and beats are catchy, and train really shines. My personal favorites are All American Girl and Save the Day. I plan on playing When I Look to the Sky when i get married, because it is a very sweet, romantic song.This album is a must have for any Train fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"First Train CD","review":"I bought this CD for \\"Angels\\" but it has so much more to offer. This is my first Train CD and I haven't stopped playing it since I bought it two weeks ago. I think my dog is getting sick of it, from riding with me, but I'm not! I have to agree with another reviewer, \\"I'm about to come alive\\" is a very powerful song. I think lyrically, Train is creative and fun. Each song is a little bit different. Do not hesitate to buy this - I've been extremely happy with my impulse purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"My twins love this video from 10 months","review":"It took Mommy awhile to get used to the 'Country' flavor of the songs - which are fun, with a bit of a twang.

Your kids will love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Are the pictures clear??","review":"When asked to take pictures at work, my wife requested the use of my FD97. Not going into a lot of detail, the first comment out of a supervisor's mouth was \\"look at the blood glistening on the barb wire.\\" That says it all in picture quality.I will agree with one other person here who mentions the slowness in recording, especially with the memory stick. There is a problem taking pictures of active targets. And the picture you get may actually be a millisecond later than you pressed the button - a lot of time for those kids to move around.Vacation shots are a dream come true. And the zoom telephoto let's you crop your pictures before taking them.I get about 140 pictures using 1600 pix on the 128 memory stick. I recommend it five stars, my wife and I each own one now."},{"rating":"1","title":"FINE FOR THE MONEY","review":"Maybe my ear-holes are too small or something, but these headphones kept falling out and were uncomfortable when they were in. The sound was fine, nothing stellar, but I had no trouble hearing the music. On a good note, they are compact and great to carry in a purse or pocket.

Unfortunately I bought them at a store where I could read the reviews. I'd return them but I bought them while on vacation. These things are totally [junk]. They're not shaped to fit the ears at all, and they fall out of mine within 30 seconds. They're totally unusable. My Sony's on the other hand (the cheapest, most basic) stay in even when I do sports. I learned my lesson trying to save a few bucks, and I'll never buy another Koss product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Junk","review":"Just like everyone else, they did not fit well in my ears and continually fell out.

These had come with the studio headphones she purchased, so she offered these to me instead rather than wasting my trip into the city. I paid the same $7 for them, and they are awful. The four-foot cord is a perfect length; it's too short to reach from my jeans, and too long that it gets hung up on everything. By the second day I had lost one of the protectors on the earbuds, the day after that I'd lost the other one. They don't fit in my ear anymore, and I spend most of my day grabbing them and sticking them back in. The day after that, one of the channels got a short and I cannot hear anymore. I don't know if it's the left ear or the right because the ears aren't marked- they only have them color coded with red and blue."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are REALLY bad earphones","review":"I bought a pair of these and will never buy them again. The covers came off the earpieces and would NEVER GO BACK ON!!!! The sound quality was also very poor.

Great for families who want cool characters, good animation, challenges that are overcome with perserverance and humor and love -- just all around great. Great mother character in Kirikou, too. Adults can watch many times and get so much out of it each time. Perfect for 3 years and up. Both are so rich. Princes and Princesses are fables with morals and neat to talk with kids about when they are done. Although only in french with english subtitles, adults can read the story once and then the kids can watch after that and know all that is going on. Great to talk with kids about later, too, especially ones who ask \\"Why\\" a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie!","review":"I saw this first in the theatre at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

We immediately set out to buy it. Kids will love the action adventure of this little boy who can do anything he puts his mind to. Parents will love the messages it presents of resilience, patience, and love. It's got great music, and is wonderfully animated. The story is taken from an actual African tale. There is nudity for those with puritanical values to be aware of, however it is not provocative. I would encourage everyone to at least watch this movie once. If you do, the majority will want to own it forever. My son (age 3), his cousins (ages 1-12), and all of his friends (ages 2-6), absolutely love this movie.

I haven't had the audio issues that others have brought up with the 4000, and I own a Dolby Digital receiver from forever and a day ago. The DVD player works fine, as a DVD, CD, and MP3 player. Haven't had any quams.Just thought that might help...I'd say don't bother with the 4000...waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVR4000 - Not the most reliable DVD for the money","review":"I have owned my DVR4000 for about 8 months now. Over that time period, the DVD has continued to degrade. It began by not playing CDs after about a month. DVDs would then occasionally skip - a problem that became worse as time went on. Now, you can't get through a DVD without skipping/freezing numerous times.I am an electronic technician, so I opened it up to have a look. The DVD has only one laser. Most quality decks have two, one for CDs and one for DVDs. The main DVD control PCB runs excessively hot! That could explain the problem.I decided to call GoVideo/sonicBlue to see if I could get them to cover the problems under warranty. Parts are 1 year, labor is only 90 days. Funny thing, they have a separate 800 number for this model...sound like they have had a lot of problems?My advice - avoid the DVR4000. The DVR4500 or 4300 seem to be better models and are less expensive at current prices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked it at first, bought 2nd one...... now both are dead!","review":"I am really disappointed in this product. As the title says, I bought one and loved it. Bought a second one for living room and was happy. After about 6 mos, (of course post warranty) mine started showing all DVDs very dark and then light. You couldn't watch a DVD. VCR worked ok. Then the second one started with the same problem. I was VERY upset about this and had no recourse. So I am writing this note hoping it will stop someone else from buying one and experiencing the same problems. As I said, at the get-go the unit was terrific. I expect a DVD to last longer than these did. They were both used by adults and probably used for a max of 2-3 DVDs a week.Did I replace mine? You bet. I bought a JVC and am happy with it. Just have to keep reading the manual to see how it all works.Skip Go Video..... save yourself a headache in the long run!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"I had no complaints about this combo, until the DVD feature stopped working this past weekend.

Since it's under the guarantee, I took it to have it serviced, but the guarantee only covers the parts, not the labor! Much to my surprise when I found out that the labor was going to cost me [money and I'll still have to look through my old receipts in order to get my guarantee for the parts, otherwise I'll have to give another[amount]for the part! Needless to say, I went out and bought myself a new DVD combo (from a different brand) because the money was just not worth it!

Even though I am a huge silverchair fan I will not buy it and I am totally against it, and I\`d like to inform everyone that so is the band. They left Sony (they are now with eleven...), and then the company released it sort of as a revange, according to the band. Daniel Johns said they even thought about trying to make an anti-best of campaign, but they thought that would probably make people even more curious about it and it would end up divulging it even more, so they thought it was better to just leave it alone and just let people know they\`re against it.

The only cd you need by Silverchair is Frogstomp. Freak Show was alright but after hearing Frogstomp you expected something much better than Freak Show. Finally Neon Ballroom... a prefect example of a band that has no idea whatsoever of what to write about. You think to yourself :\\"This can't be the band that blew me away with Frogstomp\\".

There are all sorts of subplots, but I can't muster the enthusiasm to write a synopsis. I've enjoyed Crusie's work in the past, but this particular story started out dumb, moved on to contrived, and traveled downhill from there. The plot got more and more silly--not funny, silly--and the behavior of the characters was simply unbelievable. Oh, I finished the book, but not even the ending was all that satisfying.

Mano Negra were a great, interesting, rocking band that were entertaining as well as thought-provoking. Some people have called them 'the latin Clash' and there are definitely similarities although the Mano Negra were obviously on the scene a little later.

The numbers and colors do appear on the screen, sometimes erratically, while songs are being sung, but the connections do not seem explicit enough to me. This video is good if you want something simple and non-commercial, but I do not think it is all that educational. She has only seen it once, but wasn't that captivated by it anyway.

The fact that this was a Parent's Choice led me to believe that it would be the perfect educational video. Was I wrong! The 2 songs that deal with the ABC's go by so fast that my daughter couldn't keep up. Don't even expect that this video will help you child learn numbers. The first counting song only repeated \\"1-2-3\\" over and over and the second just showed a little girl randomly counting to 5, 6, 7, and 8. The songs didn't even keep my daughters interest.

Beanbag Alphabet Rag had my daughter up and mimicing the kids pointing out body parts.

Roma musicians have always tended to take on some aspects of local music, and it's possible that's the case here (a couple of the cuts have some distant - very distant - similarity to klezmer music). Yet what the whole CD lacks is the vibrant energy and drive that characterizes all the Roma music I've heard before this limp, disorganized attempt. I suppose this CD can claim to be less \\"commercial\\" than some. It's probably representative of some regional Roma music, and there's some virtue to be found in that.

It was very interesting and well done - but a pretty dated. Since current racers have in-car cameras, and the cars are dated in the film versus today, it lost much of the impact. But the Mario scenes were very good, and I thought the restoration of the old car was the best. Especially its running in the end.

Sergi Lopez is a spaniard living in Paris and pretending to behave as french, mainly being unattached. Nathalie Bayle is the quitaessential french, liberated enough to publish an ad to get a lover, in tight control of her emotions and sophisticated, but when Sergi starts behaving as the spaniard he really is and having real feelings about her, she has to make a choice, and so she goes to the wrong direction: she reacts according to her emergency plan and gets out of the relationship instead to adventuring into unchartered waters.

From their first cafe meeting, there is a spark between the two, a connection that they both felt but were equally adept at concealing until it was too late.Without disclosing too much of the plot, suffice to say that true love wins and loses at the end. Yes, they indulge their mutual fantasy and even foray into the world of one-on-one fantasy-esque sex, but is this enough for a relationship to be formed?

Sony/BMG has a long line of hundreds of budget priced CD's that are basically a sampler of an artists hits and album cuts. In this case, the record company did not include LOVE OR LET ME BE LONELY, which is one of their 2 biggest hits. Unfortunately, it's a tactic that the record label uses so you have to buy the slightly more pricier BEST OF FRIENDS OF DISTINCTION , which is the better buy, as it has all their charted singles , plus liner notes. It's a real shame that Sony/BMG purposely left off this most essential song that should most definitely been included. As such, if you want a CD of this group's most essential songs, this one is missing one very big hit.

I was dissapointed in the way the book was written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diverse motivations for joining a Crusade","review":"Maddens view of what is a diverse and complicated period of history outlines in simple terms the different motivations of a diverse collection of religous and political pilgrims who ventured to the Holy Land.The conclusions he draws,particularly with reference to the current difficulties in the Middle East are well drawn, and should be read by anyone with an interest in the present growing division between the Muslim World and the West ( America and Europe)Gerald O'Mahony"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Superior Introduction to a Fascinating Topic","review":"The author of this book is the most distinguished historian of the crusades in the U.S. I worried, though, that his erudition would make the book overly complex and unreadable. I shouldn't have worried! This book is a joy to read. Madden brings out the tension, excitement, and human drama of the crusades. Best of all, it is not the usual rehash of tired cliches, but instead the story is based on the best and most recent research. This is that rare book that appeals not only to professional historians, but also to interested general readers as well. If you want to know the truth about the crusades, grab this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic for any student!","review":"This interesting compilation of the events that compose the Crusades is fascinating and informative, plus easy to read. I recommend this book for any high school or college student, or for anyone interested in the history and reason behind the Christian Crusades. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very delightful.","review":"This book held my attention from the first page until the end. There were plenty of twists and turns and even some family lessons to be learned. I loved it because the focus was not only in one department but balanced to keep the spark alive. I am definitely looking forward to reading more from Ms Ford.Pick up the book, you won't be disappointed. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying My Best To Forget This Book","review":"Bette Ford, please do us serious and in-depth readers a huge favor...STOP WRITING BOOKS, until you have learned and perfected your craft.To say this book was \\"stupid\\" is an understatement.Characters underdeveloped, corny and dry dialogue, not enough imagery...I could go on for hours, but I'M not into boring people like the author did when she wrote this dumb story."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely a well-written 5 star read!!!!","review":"I can't understand the reviewer who gave this book a low rating. Not only was the book well-written with lots of plot and character development, but there's so much description and imagery, that the scenes just come alive. Nothing seems rushed or irrelevantly included in this book. This book was the epitome of a romance novel...a touching love story that has to overcome problems; in the end, love conquers all. I hated that the book had to end; I wanted to see the future of the characters. This book is definitely one of my favorites, and Ms. Ford has become one of my favorite romance writers, along with Brenda Jackson, Gwyneth Bolton, Maureen Smith, Rochelle Alers and Adrianne Byrd."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I didn't expect a lot from this cd and I must admit my expectations were more than met. I ordered mostly for historical reasons, to sample one of the earliest popularlizers of salsa in the United States. The price was a warning, and I knew it and accepted it. I don't feel cheated, but I'm reviewing it just to inform potential buyers. The sound quality is like one of those historical folk recordings some anthropologist made using equipment in the trunk of his car. I think it's actually monaural. I shouldn't carp about the music itself, because it is what it is. But it is not authentic early Cuban salsa: it's been made cute for a (possibly resistant?) American audience and market. The music historian might not mind this, but as a salsa fan I found it way too saccharine. Also there are no liner notes. The cheesy, PhotoShopped cover picture sets the tone. Let the buyer be informed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello Kitty TV Review","review":"My daughter absolutely loves her new Hello Kitty tv - I purchased it to match a pink and green decor in her room. As an added note, this model is new this year - the picture on line is last year's model made by Emerson not Spectra. The Spectra model is a prettier shade of pink with a carry handle."},{"rating":"2","title":"alyias kitty","review":"i give this tv a 4 .the price is really high for a 13inch but over all the picture is nice and clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Men's Capris??","review":"These are great if you don't care that you look like an idiot. My husband bought these and expected them to zip off to shorts. Instead they become Man-Capris!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Crafted","review":"I received this product in a timely manner and was pleasantly surprised by the fine quality and craftsman ship. I highly recommend this product.
