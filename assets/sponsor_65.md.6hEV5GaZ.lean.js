If the authors had read their own book and applied their principles to its pages, reading it would have been as much of a pleasure as using software that follows their advice.Why do I give it 5 stars?Because beneath the diatribes and soapbox oration there is a depth of experience and of thought I have not found elsewhere.The authors have considered the issue of what makes using software a pleasurable experience for the user in a depth and with a degree of insight that opened my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money","review":"Usability Engineering (UE) is my profession, therefore I was interested in this book. After reading about half of it, I can only say it is a waste of time and money. The author just seems to be in love with his own ideas (which are by no means new- most of his stuff is old wine in a new barrel) but doesn't realy touch the essentials of UE. It is too simple to blame everything on the developpers.For those really interested in UE stay away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst than a waste of time","review":"The tone of the book is very negative, I was often distracted by the authors' strange wording choices, confused by the way their \\"rules\\" would flip flop, and insulted by their insinuations that *I* am the problem. This book took a tremendous amount of effort to read and definitely was not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this book.","review":"This book is a waste of money and should be avoided. The authors fail to give example solutions or suggestions for many of the problems they fault with today's software. Not only that, they continually slam developers for what they consider to be poorly designed software when its obvious they give little consideration to the real world constraints that exist when developing software. Save your money and try another book, I got very little out of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Book","review":"It seems that most reviews on this book are from software developers, which is why they are so negative. I manage a web development company that concentrates on easy to use websites. From my perspective the ideas and methods are by far the best out there.His main point is that software developers should not create the interfaces we use. This is an important statement that many people need to understand. The software engineer can't design an interface when he/she has no interaction with the users. Even further, it takes a different mindset to create an interface than it does to code.You can't blame the author for setting things straight. What you can do is maybe blame the books stores for putting it in the wrong section. It looks as though too many developers are reading this book for insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more examples!","review":"I think this guy has a book about how the inmates are running the asylum...well this book suffers from what happens when the subject matter experts (SME) are allowed to write books. BORING!!! SME's always seem to forget to include compelling examples. Yes there are little screen shots, but IMO in order for a book to be compelling that has to do with design...it needs to show LOTS of examples of good design. The bulk of the book should be about breaking down those designs. I need to hear why a specific design is effective. Take a hint from Steve Krugs book \\"Don't Make me Think\\". That book is extremely effective without inundating the reader with jargon. Lots of examples with meaningful visual breakdowns. Afterall...isnt UI design a VISUAL communication form?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough fluff for a king size pillow...","review":"Some people have given this book a high rating and bashed others who are just stating their own opinion. ( I'm not that petty or immature )The authors make some decent points, but their ideas are not original and their writing style is that of someone trying to impress rather than convey information.This book appears to be more of a platform for developer and software bashing rather than the helpful user interface design text that I had envisioned. After chapters of repetitive whines about software developers, I was becoming irritated. That's not what I got the book for.Usability folks will no doubt love this book because it will confirm to them that everything is the developer's fault. Developers will no doubt hate the book because it states that everything is the developer's fault. I don't like the book because it doesn't give me any good information on UI design, which is what I wanted it for."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of paper!","review":"This book has a very small content to filling ratio. Reading it like pulling teeth. It doesn't give you much guidance on how to better design user interface while mostly is just reviewing what user intefaces are out there and trashing 3/4 of them. For example, in one chapter authors say that creating cascading menus is really bad and whoever does it deserves to be called \\"Philistines, reprobate and a weaker soul\\". In the following chapter they say that sometimes it's Ok to have cascading menus. They make a statement and they overturn it later on. Our R&D team had to read this book and they have even stronger words for it.Do yourself a favor and buy another book unless you want to spend long hours re<Cooper>ating after reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healing book with interesting factual episodes","review":"I met Polly and had a reading with her. She turned out to be a very effective medium. This got me interested to read her book, which gives the reader a lot of factual episodes in her life that confirm our connections not only with our past lives but our after-lives. The book comes straight from her heart and endears the reader to what she has to say and her advice. I think this book joins the genre of books written by other psychics that give plenty of healing and evidence that we are not alone and we are being helped. Very nice read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for what it is!!","review":"Well what can one say but classic Sabbath is just that, Classic. It sounds classic in more ways than one. The quality is poor, but remember when this was recorded people. Let's say it's like designing a sports car and then putting the smallest engine you can find into it. You can only remaster something so much and hope it comes out better.The songs themselves are excellent and the packaging is a nice touch as well. Another thing I found rather funny was you can actually make out what Ozzy's saying. I guess he was still coherent back then... It's Sabbath live and because of that you get some add libing here and their. Ozzy's Ozzy, so the \\"We love you all\\", \\"get up\\" and a few other Ozzy gems are there. Overall it's a very good cd, not great but good. It you expect classic Sabbath sounds, feel, and vibe, this is it. If you expect clean, digital, sterile sound, this isn't your cd.If you love Sabbath BUY IT!!, if you don't DON'T!!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"What in the world does anyone need with this? One disc is the same old horrible LIVE AT LAST thing, while disc 2 is only a little bit better. A cynical cash-in on the talentless Ozzy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Surprised to see such positive reviews so far, I'm very disappointed in this set. It's basically just a glorified bootleg, most of the material being recycled from what even the \\"casual fanatic\\" would already have. Disc 2 comes from only 2 different sources, the 3 Sabotage tracks are from an Aug '75 concert in Asbury Park, NJ and they are the only good thing about this whole set. The rest of disc 2 comes from the heavily-booted (probably a dozen times) Paris 12/20/70 TV broadcast, and clearly not even from a master source. What was the purpose of this set and why the lack of documentation for the material on disc 2? Were they afraid no one would buy it if they knew? If it is supposed to counteract bootlegs it does a poor job since it only provides 3 rare tracks (the full Asbury Park show has apparently started circulating recently) or fails to offer much of a sonic improvment for the other material. Is this really the best they could come up with?"},{"rating":"2","title":"WELL , AT LEAST WE HAVE THIS ONE!!!","review":"Well ive just listened to this and for me it doesnt sound as awful as many fans say; the sound quality is not the best but its an interesting thing to listen to sabbaths songs recorded live at the time that sabbath was THE SABBATH. For the real fans it would be more of a document than a live recording, for those fans of paranoid or war pigs, its better to focus on a good compilation record, anyway the price of the record is worth the value, it entertains with the music as it does with the pictures and notes as well. For the real fans, i really recomend it!!!."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will not spent my money on it","review":"Alright, I've got all Sabbath record up until 1981's MOB RULES, more 1987's THE ETERNAL IDOL and 1985's SEVENTH STAR, which I consider Tony Iommi albums, not Sabbath albums.So, I'll ask you: whast's the point of buying LIVE AT LAST again, more a few more live songs in Disc II? Of course disc II sounds fantastic, it has better production. But I already know all the songs by memory, hearing them live will not make my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"This is tantalisingly complex, but highly satisfying music BECAUSE it is emotionally intriguing, unlike Guillermo E. Brown's 'Soul At The Hands Of The Machine', which one of the reviewers refers to. By comparison the latter is repetitive techno-babble. Junk Magic, like David Torn's Prezens, on which Craig Taborn also plays, is way ahead of lots of music that purports to be contemporary, even avant-garde, because the players really know their music - they're not just making sounds and hoping for a mood or an effect. Don't be put off. Check it out. It will open your ears wide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Runts","review":"The picture displayed is not what was sent. The picture shows the old formula runts, what was shipped is the new formula runts.

Am very pleased with both purchases. There was small pieces missing that I easily replaced. I was given a discount for my inconvenience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hangs crookedly, poor quality.","review":"I am not pleased with my purchase. It arrived in a dented box that was packed inside another larger shipping box which was also dented and had holes in it. Given the poor packing job, I was surprised that the individual pieces weren't broken once I unpacked it. That said, one of the orbs had chalky white markings on it, which I had to remove with goo gone. I hired a certified electrician to hang this piece in my dining room, and was very disappointed to see, upon his completion, that the fixture hangs cockeyed! Both my electrician and I realize that this is due to a manufacturing error, not because of his work hanging it. Also, one of the places where a bulb screws in is poorly made; I'm unable to remove the bulb because the entire piece turns along with the bulb as I try to replace it. I'm going to have to replace this piece altogether. Lesson learned: never shop for lighting online - go to a store instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely","review":"Very pretty movie. Loved all the neat antiques in the film. the visuals in this film are really great too. The story was also very nice. Another great film from ghibli."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming film that you'll watch again and again","review":"I saw this film some years ago for the first time, and remember that I really loved the adorableness of it, the music, the motifs, the morals.Now finally employed, I couldn't resist the temptation to buy it - and it turned out an excellent investment!I still love the film, even more so as I'm older and manage to catch on to far more interesting aspects of it. The quality is grand, and I really enjoyed the special features.(It also just dropped over 10$ in price, so I suggest you go for it :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful coming of age story.","review":"This is my personal favorite film from Studio GHIBLI to date. And the best coming of age story I've seen (animated or not). Miyazaki is great and all, but I tend to prefer Yoshifumi Kondo's films whenever he worked on a Ghibli film. It seems a bit more down to earth and something most people can relate to. And in the end, you're left with a warm and fuzzy feeling. Definately a date movie, so I'd recommend watching this with someone special."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie for young people","review":"This movie is one of my new favorites. It was quite accurate in portraying the behaviors of teens/preteens. It is one of the more quiet Studio Ghibli films, but I think that is part of its charm. The animation is beautiful, of course. I just love it because it reminds me of my youth and of culture in Asia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whisper of the heart","review":"I wonderful magical tale for the entire family. The first story is this one and then \\"The Cat Returns is the conclusion of this one.I love all Studio Ghibli films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"As this movie has the Baron in it, I expected a child-friendly adventure. This is more of a romance/soap-opera sort of movie. We watched it once and will probably never do so again. The Cat Returns we watch fairly frequently. I am pretty disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for the background animation.","review":"If you are a young girl, you might like this. To most mature-minded young people and adults this is going to seem simplistic, shrill, and pretty boring. I'm not sure which was more annoying, the stilted dialog or the incessant background score. This is a far far cry from \\"Spirited Away\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Increased to $30!?","review":"Give me break. DEFINITELY not worth $30, even $20 was too high. Everyone should wait until the price drops to $15 at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Extraordinary Surprise","review":"Having purchased this film knowing nothing of it but its pedigree (the wonderful Ghibli Studio whose other terrific films I was familiar with), I couldn't believe in retrospect how fortunate I was that I took such a chance. The last time I felt this enchanted with an animated film was the first time I saw \\"Spirited Away\\" in the theater (although \\"Wallace and Gromit\\" runs a close second). The film moves from strength to strength, filled with naturalistic dialogue, convincing voices and stunning animation. But what makes it extraordinary is the charming, emotionally resonant story. The filmmakers have captured the moments in every child's life when they first feel the inklings of adult love. That they do so in such a sensitive manner with three dimensional characters portrayed visually in two dimensions only makes the accomplishment that much greater. No matter your own age, this film will be a revelation to you, as it was to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!! ^_^","review":"I love this movie! It is about love, but also adventure. Hayao Miyazaki captures the true story! It is a great family movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whisper of the Heart","review":"I have been Anime fan since Totoro and I would rate Whisper of the Heart as one of the best. It, as with some Anime for children, portrays an intelligent, viable approach on life as a teenager or making that difficult transition from adolescent into adulthood, unlike most of the youth culture movies/tv in America today. It not only is entertaining but retains it's youthful essence throughout with a magical flair. At times, it can be corny, but not over-the-top. All in all, I would recommend this as a great family film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow moving but sweet","review":"When I first saw Whisper of the Heart, it seemed to go on forever. This was because I had seen its sequel, the aptly titled The Cat Returns, first. If you haven't seen either yet, I recommend seeing Whisper of the Heart first. It's slightly slow, and focuses on the nuances of everyday life more than adventure. The main character, a girl named Shizuku, wants to be a writer and finds inspiration in The Baron, a beautiful statue of a nattily dressed cat. However, the story takes its time in transcribing Shizuku's life and thus might be boring to some who like adventure. I recommend Castle in the Sky or Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind if this movie sounds too boring for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Everything I expected. Really enjoyed it. Would recommend it. to any one who likes good anime. Worth the money spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Wonderful","review":"I'm a big fan of Studio Ghibli movies, and this is my current favorite. The visuals are wonderful. Yes, they can seem to move slowly, as another reviewer pointed out. That suited me just fine - more time to indulge in the mood they so beautifully create. The story, too, is delightful and pure.As for the \\"girl movie\\" accusation, well, I'm a 47 year old guy and I definitely \\"get\\" this movie.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Young naive love","review":"The stage of this animated cartoon is said to be the Seiseki-Sakuragaoka Station outskirts in Tama-City of Tokyo.I lived once around the Seiseki-Sakuragaoka Station.It may be one of the reasons, this is one of the most splendid anime among Studio GHIBLI.The process when light love feeling of a Japanese serious young student changes is drawn.There is not the intense scene.Young naive two people do that they can do it as much as possible awkwardly, and it becomes the last scene to be impressed by.There may be a person to feel to be boring but, their pure thought reminds you that oneself of the youth was so.Shizuku and Seiji talk in English not Japanese, but there is not the sense of incongruity at all.All the voice actors of the English version are splendid too.Thank you for reading till the last what I felt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow, but moving","review":"With the exception of \\"Sunday in the Park with George\\" by Stephen Sondheim, this animated movie is one of the most moving dialogues I have seen about the insecurities, difficulties, and eventual joys of the artistic process.As an extra bonus, the second DVD of this movie has the original storyboard (or at least a large portion of it) shown in sync with the audio of the movie playing in the background. This shows very clearly the artistic genius of Hayao Miyazaki, and just how much of his creative vision is infused into this movie.As with other Studio Ghibli films, I felt that it moved rather slow, but nowhere near as slow as Castle in the Clouds.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"an anime for all ages","review":"Whisper of the heart is a wonderful, gentle movie in which Miyazaki's love for children will warm the hearts of old and young alike.The main character of the story is Shizuku, a girl at the threshold of her teenage years. In the movie she discover her strengths and weaknesses with the help of the Baron,(a statue of a cat), an old man who runs an curiosity store, (when he feels like it) and Seiji, a boy who has been in love with her for a long time and finally succeeds to make her notice him.Seiji had dreams of becoming a violin maker and Shizuku wants to be a writer. Both of them find out that it takes schooling and hard work to reach their dreams.Miyazaki has a wonderful way of portraying children, gentle and still very natural and realistic. When watching this movie I felt I got a glimps of life in Japan and wonder if this is a life of the past or if one still lives that way.This movie will be enjoyed by kids of any school age and by anyone who loves children."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Science of Dynamic Psychotherapy","review":"I found this book to be a remarkable and consise description of a complicated topic. The authors summarized the state of the field of short term dynamic therapy. They held no information back and identified the areas of controversy, particularly conflicting opinions and data on the use of confrontation in the Davanloo approach versus the approach preferred by McCullough and Alpert. Furthermore, the inclusion of EMDR as a dynamic treatment was inovative and exciting. Neborsky and Solomon's chapter on \\"Changing the Love Imprint\\" explained how EMDR and the STDP's may have a common therapeutic action, which was helpful to me as was their integration of attachment theory. Finally, David Malan's chapter on the science of outcome evaluation and what we might learn from his career was an inspiration to read. I hope this group continues to write and create more material for clinicians like this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The problem with only using advocates is you get one side of","review":"The problem with using advoates as authors is that you only get one side of the story. In the case of EMDR, for instance, there is research that says a) the eye movements are unnecessary and b) its effects do not last as long as Cognitive-Behavior Therapy based exposure procedures. This really undercuts the second part of the title of this book \\"for Long-Term Change\\". Stories and anecdotes are often entertaining but for true treatment help see a professional who reads the scientific research and is not a cheerleader for every fad that comes along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Produced and directed by Jean Jaques Rousseau and Karl Marx","review":"The problem with the script is that it could have been written by Rousseau or Karl Marx. The producers seem to believe that human beings were peaceful hunter gatherers who shared all their food until someone set aside land for agriculture and claimed the land as their own property. So, the wandering people had no choice but to kill the farmers and steal their food. The pruducers do admit that settled people could use their spare time to make things out of clay, stone, and metal but that only led to the creation of a class system. As for cities - they are only breeding ground for diseases.There you have it - private property is the origin of war and inequality. Don't waste your money on this Marxist claptrap."},{"rating":"2","title":"this was great","review":"I think this is a great teaching tool. I teach World History in Florida and my students really loved this DVD I highly reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the Special Features Program.","review":"The \\"Quest for Fire\\" redux of the main documentary wasn't that appealing to me. However, in the special features section, they include a 50-minute work on skeletons that they refer to as \\"hobbits.\\" They peel the onion showing that these skeletons were not humans facing dwarfism or pygmies. There was a relative of humans that lived for at least 80,000 years, but then disappeared approximately 18,000 years ago. They include silly footage of modern people saying the hobbits still live in a nearby mountain. Also, the skeleton looks like it's mouth was punched in, but the narrator later says, \\"We have no evidence of trauma to the skeleton.\\" Still, I enjoyed it more than the main work, so I encourage others not to overlook it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oversimplistic and naive","review":"This so-called documentary presents an overly speculative view that shows humans progressing toward civilization, starting with an absurd scenario of a peaceful nomadic group encountering a selfish group of settled hunter-gatherers. This show belongs more to the category of pseudo-docu-drama than it does to anything educational. I do not recommend that anyone waste their money buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"You may be sorely disappointed!","review":"If you are expected a sequel to Repo Man you will be sorely disappointed.This move is an odd work of art and I don't mean that in a good way.It was mostly shot in front of green screens with the backgrounds added after. The characters are weird and almost cartoonish and nothing is taken very seriously in this art movie, quiet the opposite of Repo Man. After you watch the movie you may grasp some concept of what the background setting is, as a character did at the end, but you are really only left confused and wondering why.A few of the actors in Repo Man appear in the movie, but all that does is give it something in common with Plan 9 From Outer Space. Although it was comforting to hear Olivia Barash's (Leila) raspy voice in a cameo towards the end.So unless your are some weird fan of Alex Cox creations, I would not buy this thing. There's a reason it never made it into the theaters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic work of typology","review":"M.R. DeHaan wrote some outstanding books. His book on the Tabernacle is one of his best. The author is a good communicator and his book is written with clarity. I have always enjoyed the study of Old Testament typology. This is the art of discovering parallels and allusions to the life of Christ in the Old Testament. I read several books on the topic. There are outstanding books written by Ada Habershon, Andrew Jukes, Henry Solteau, and C.W. Slemming. DeHaan's work was the one I enjoyed the most.He is measured with his analysis and does not jump to fanciful speculations. His assertions are backed up elsewhere in the Bible. He points out that every detail of the tabernacle has symbolic significance and teaches an important message about the nature and work of God. This is an excellent book and a true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource","review":"I am new to reloading, and bought precision reloading guide to help with my processes for reloading.

Not one disappoint here."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Horror Movie","review":"I'm an avid movie buff; but somehow never saw \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" until I was in my 30's. I was immediately \\"sucked in\\" to the whole weirdness of the film. Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer's strange, if not bizarre attraction to Mia Farrow's Rosemary and John Cassevetes' Guy. Then Guy's sudden interest in the spooky Castavets. The horror is not the bloody kind; but the visceral kind - how you keep learning more and more about what is going on. When Rosemary finally gets out the Scrabble tiles and plays anagrams is when I think I went over the edge. It's amazing the number of people who have never seen this remarkable film. Mia Farrow is perfect as Rosemary, and Cassavetes' performance has just the right amount of subtle betrayal. And who can beat Ruth Gordon for the wacky diminutive Minnie Castavet! A must see film for anyone over 12. So glad to see it on Criterion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Re-release in Regular DVD Format!","review":"Did I miss something here? Criterion, why not release a anniversary edition and include both DVD formats? I am disappointed, which is why I gave this 3 stars, originally. UPDATE: Criterion offers the re-release in both formats.As for the movie, it it one of the very best horror movies made during that era. The acting is superb and the drama and suspense, utterly gripping!*****************************So, I've edited my rating because the movie does indeed deserve 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's so great about this movie?","review":"I was excited when I sat down to watch this, it sounded just like my sort of movie.

Does anyone remember that he drugged a teenager and raped her many years ago and then fled the country like the coward he is. If you have any children you should feel the same. These monsters masquerading as \\"artists\\" should never be forgiven. Of course he roams around freely in Europe with the other trash in the film industry. Strangely enough the victim has forgiven him but a message must be sent that hideous acts like the one Polanski bestowed upon his victim must never be forgiven. He is scum of the lowest nature, a devil in an intellectual abyss of misguided power that believes he is better than any woman could ever be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Techno Edge and Politically Incorrect","review":"Armand has put out another genre defining/defying set of cuts which are all real tasty. \\"Why Don't You Free Some Time for Me\\" is the most commercially accessible with its Daft Punkish techno vocals and anthemic redundancies. Armand's renditon of \\"Girl You Got Me\\" also rocks, it is a disturbing blend of house hooks and assaultive vocals.Armand's albums always have a cutting-edge theme not necessarily in synch with the music. Armand's latest manifestation, \\"Gandhi Khan, the disco Don from Pakistan\\" was released on October 2 and contains many Middle Eastern music samples and spoofs about the Pakistani rapper. Forget about \\"Benny and the Jets\\" or \\"Bridge over Trouble Waters\\", this CD gets 6 stars for political untimeliness. I am sure that Armand likes it that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Future 4 You was a FLUKE.","review":"I've purchased both of Van Helden's realeases since 2 Future and they were cut from different cloth (really [bad] cloth at that!). This album has tons of tracks, most of which are stupid \\"interludes\\" of Armand joking with his buddies. The joke was on me apparantly - for purchasing this aweful record. The 4-5 actual songs are filled with him rapping, which CLEARLY demonstrates he should stick to spinning the tunes ONLY. I hated \\"Killing Puritans\\" but thought Armand deserved a second chance with this album. Guess he's got 2 strikes now."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could this be made?","review":"Ok, the only thing good about this cd is the \\"Why can't you free some time for me\\" song. All the others were basically Armand being self-indulgent and making tracks for his friends and him to laugh at rather than for us to enjoy. LEts not even touch on how bad armand is at raping. Please Armand, lets just stick with what you do best, making house tunes. More \\"You dont know me\\" and Flowerz\\" and Less \\"Kentucky Fried Flow\\". Please Spare us all.

The melodies are uninspired. The writers obviously could not come up with one single catchy tune. When I listened to this, I was brisk walking in our neighborhood using a portable cd player. I couldn't finish my walk as the music was simply unbearable. Do they really think the melodies warrant a second spin for the listeners' ears? Give me Lilac Time any time.

The only worthwhile tracks on here is Tray Deee's solo joint Izuwitit, Snoops solo Fine and Bad Azz's Hard Times On Planet Earth. The rest of this comp stinks to high heaven. Thugzzz PrayII is awful lyrically and beatwise and is precisely the reason why people sleep on The Outlawz. I Can Make You Dance is rubbish just like the rest of this album. Bottom Line: Big Tray Deee's General's List is the worst compilation next to Thugs R Us, Violator and Ruff Ryders. The no namesters were at their worst, the beats are horrific and basement sounding and three good songs are a good reason to skip this one. If you want Tray Deee at his best, pick up both of Tha Eastsidaz albums and stay away from this tragedy of a compilation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Tray Deee - Not Even His album...","review":"Tray Deee is a really great rapper but this album was purely trash. I, like many, anticipated a solo release from this West Coast gangsta but was sorely disappointed. The beats were wack...the guests were no name chumps he gave a chance...and they failed him horribly. Tray Dee only has like 1 or 2 solo songs and some songs he is not even on ( Fine is just Snoop by himself)...I guess this was more of a compilation than a true album.

I find that I have to tie the shoelaces though to keep the heel back and the toes from hitting the front, so these are not the shoes I grab to go get the mail or take the garbage out, I prefer my Keen boat shoes for that.

Unlike Blueprints, or Lange Neurology that most students recommend, this book lays out the foundations of Neurology in a manner that's so easy to learn.

There was not much glory to be found in this movie until the events following the defeat of the defenders of THE ALAMO. As film goers we finaly get to see what happened after.

What a total disaster and waste of effort.When Director John Hancock, had Sam Houston (Denis Quaid) on a solid white horse for the Battle of San Jacinto scene I about threw up. The idiot made Houston look like The Lone Ranger, ugg. Also very obvious the screenwriter and director didn't spend any time at the San Jacinto Museum of History, getting there facts straight for this movie.The Alamo was a hard movie to make even with a great director, much less with an obvious amateur.

The war was fought between thousands of Mexicans and a few hundred Texans for the ownership of Texas. The Texas army was lead by three historical commanders William Travis, James Bowie and David Crockett. At the end of the movie, the Texans won the battle, even though they were highly out numbered.Overall I enjoyed the movie because the acting and the scenery was amazing. Billy Bob Thornton truly understood his role as David Crockett and personalized it by adding his own southern accent and heartfelt emotion. While Jason Patric played the role of James Bowie, a commander of the Texan army who bravely fought in the war. The scenery was breathe taking because it felt like you were actually in Texas during the war.Overall I rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars.

In many cases, it is likely \\"right on\\", but the glaring error described above ruined it for me. That error casts doubt on all other historically debatable topics presented in the film.Another part that bothers me has to do with the time of the final battle. Although the battle likely started at dawn, I do not feel the entire battle would have been conducted in the dark. Why?

The reviewer who states that the set designer of this film \\"failed to locate the Alamo chapel the proper position to the Convent/Long Barracks building\\" and claims that this \\"ruined\\" the movie really takes the cake. It's a MOVIE! The same critic then asks \\"What if John Wayne would have had the special effects capabilities this director had?\\" when it's obvious Wayne's version isn't completely correct either so even with modern special effects the critic would have complained about that version too! I love the Wayne version and it has flaws but does that get in the way of me enjoying it? Hell No! Why be a Scrooge? These are good MOVIES! I enjoyed both versions. Billy Bob and the Duke both deliver and I found both versions to be compelling. Others can nit-pick and complain but I'm looking forward to getting both versions of the Alamo for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular","review":"\\"The Alamo\\", I found, was a wonderful movie, even though it did have some historical errors.

Great movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Uninspiring Garbage Of A Movie","review":"I was watching this in high hopes of watching a truly inspiring movie based on a truly inspiring event and this movie just sucked. The script was plain boring and the battles were dry and without soul.I'm glad some of you loved the movie so much, whatever you were taking at the time should be prescribed along with the movie. I just found this movie extremely weak. The Alamo was great, this movie is not.Would not watch this version again. Sorry if I can't further describe why this movie is so lame because I might just tell you the whole plot of the movie while I'm at it. Since there's so many people that like this movie, I guess most likely you'll like it too. I am truly disappointed because I waited so long and expected so much from this. Screw the movie, I'm going back to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"returning to \\"the alamo\\"","review":"this isn't a remake of john wayne's alamo as much as it is a more history leason as this is more the truth of the battle.the real star here is thorton as david \\"davy\\" crockett. his crockett is a man who wants to live down his famous alterego and become a man of wealth. his problem is that his legend is far to big for him to outrun, and he finds himself in the middle of this fight because of it. the final battle is at night like it was really fought, but it is very dark and hard to see, my only falt with the film. this is a fine film though about what makes a hero and about doing what's right even if it cost you your life. enjoy this great war film and \\"remember the alamo\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow,dull&very,very borring","review":"A good western is hard to come by,and not many do.Unless you are an unwaivering,fanatical,die hard, history buff,this version of The Alamo plods along so slowly its aggrivating.I like a good western now and then,and I think instead of trying to make an epic out of this movie,it could have been tightened up a bit&picked up the pace.It is probably more historically acurate than other versions made,but at a price of puting you into a deep coma.There were small bursts of action,but not much more than that.This is'nt a western for everyone,and only the folks who really want the low,down on the Alamo will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misses just a bit","review":"I think that this movie is perhaps the best attempt to show what happened at the Alamo yet produced. It shows most of the people involved in the battle as real people and not just cartoon images.I have one problem- the casting of Sam Houston. Dennis Quaid is totally wrong, and makes Houston look like some kind of brooding idiot."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Alamo","review":"From the studio that brought you Pearl Harbor. Academy Award winner Billy Bob Thornton,Dennis Quaid,and Jason Patric team up for the acclaimed action epic about one of the most important events in American history! It's the heroic tale of the 200 brave men who made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of freedom defending a small Texas fort for 13 days against an entire army! Commanded by three men-Lt. Col.William Travis,James Bowie, and David Crockett their against-all-odds courage at the Alamo would forever live on as a rallying cry for liberty and independence!THE SPECIAL FEATURES ON THIS DVD ARE:.Walking in the footsteps of heroes..Deleted Scenes..Return of the Legend:The making of the Alamo..Deep in the Heart of Texans..Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound..French Language Track..French and Spanish Subtitles..THX-Certified-includes THX Optimizer."},{"rating":"1","title":"trash","review":"there is a reason ronny howard backed out of this film, how can u make a movie like this with a pg rating, incredible"},{"rating":"1","title":"not","review":"Not recommended. 10 minutes was more than enought for this movie.

We aren't history buffs but it had Billy Bob Thorton so we figured it had to be at least worth a look and pleasantly we discovered that John Lee Hancock's The Alamo is a GREAT film that entertained us all. 8 thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good.","review":"The alamo is a very good film. I loved it. It follows Davy Crokkett and his men trying to defend the Alamo from the thousands of Spanish knocking on the door. The acting in this film is spectacular. It is ver similar to The Patriot, exept different time period, different War, and different actors. But the Genra is the same. I think if you liked the Patriot you will love this.THank you for reading my review, I hope it was helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep in the heart of Texas","review":"Superb cinematography, set design and costumes. (I really didn't care much for the weepy Titanic-esque soundtrack score, however.) And while all of the actors aquitted themselves nicely, I think Billy Bob Thornton's take on Davy Crockett - the reality versus the legend - was a real standout. Historians may quibble about certain details here and there (as they should - it's healthy), but this production of The Alamo exposes John Wayne's vastly overrated 1960 version for the simplistic flag-waving cartoon that it always was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie with nice DVD extras","review":"I anticipated a OK movie, and was pleasantly surprised on how entertaining the movie was to watch. From set and costumes to the actually characters, you get a very fine feeling of people from that time period. Although there is obviously some guess as to the activities of the main characters, I do believe they are well drawn. Quaid's Houston seemed a bit inconsistent, and would be the weakest character of the movie. Undoubtedly, Thornton's acting and the script highlight Crockett as the main gem in this movie.The action was top rate, with the special effects shots adding to the movie, not dominating.The DVD bonus info is nice, with a bit of history, and a bit more about making the movie.This is a well executed telling of the Alamo's history that I'm sure you'll remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to remeber...","review":"Because its lammer then all the other movies about the alamo. The battles suck, theyre all 30 secs long and boring. The cinematogrpahy is wasted on this terrible movie and is the only good thing about it. There is no drama, no real action, the performances are average at best, the score is to dramtic for this unemotional waste of film, and i wish i could kill the guy who played santa ana. A story so sad should make you weep like a baby, but every time one of the characters dies that we are suppose to care for i find myself saying yeah so, i know this get over it. The only sad part is that they made so many movies about this and there is not one half decent one. 1 out of a 10 for the cinematography. Forget the alamo, wait i didnt remeber it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thr Alamo Has Got To GO","review":"ok, so first i'd like to say that I entered the theaters excited and very much looking forward to a great film. I'm sorry to say that I was very disappointed. Apart from the terrible acting, the whole film was just like an ongoing conversation, without anything interesting happening. Now I've been a Davy Crockett hater all my life, but this film only deepend that hate. Billy Bob Thorton really does need to go die somewhere. He was probably the main reason the movie was such a disappointment. If you are looking for a movie worth paying for, you should really try something like \\"The Punisher,\\" don't waste time on this load of ****."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie for real Texans","review":"What a wonderful movie!A movie made by Texans for Texans.A movie about the real humans in the Alamo, not the super humans, legions and fairy tales of the story but real people with real stories.I left this movie with new pride for my state. The only state that is allowed to fly their flag at the same height as the American flag. Everyone else must be flown below. Anyone who didn't like this movie are just jealous of everything Texan.This is so much more than a movie about the Alamo, it is a testament of just how strong Texas and Texans are.We have a saying here. \\"If you don't like Texas, MOVE!\\" Yet yankees flock here daily to live in this great state with a great history. This movie should be required in all Texas History class rooms.

In the first Sunrunner novels, Rawn shows one of the early sunrunner rings deals with winds and has a gripping scene with a sunrunner creating a tornado. It was such a good scene, I never forgot it.Invading fleet would not have survived tornadoes and winds, but if that happened, no more big battles. Invasion issue solved.

This CD takes the listener through a great variety of genres, and Ms Candy handles them all amazingly well. There is not one weak track on the album. All the songs are worthy of airtime. Her voice ranges from the soft and sweet on songs like \\"60 years\\" to the more up-beat and funky on songs like \\"Sucker Punched\\". The songs are easily accessible but remain interesting.

But I'm writing today to warn you to skip this one; I don't know what it is, but Ben and Jack combo didn't workout.IF YOU WANT TO SPEND YOUR MONEY TO FRUSTRATE YOURSELF, THEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. OTHER THAN THAT...SKIP IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"This movie was such a let down. Ben Stiller and Jack Black usually make me laugh. Not the case with this movie. At least not often. I wanted to like it, I really did.The problems? A weak script, hardly any really funny scenes, and two actors who are used to working with much better material.I'm not going to go into the plot, but I will say that the movie had potential and that movies like this inspire the average man to try his hand at screenwriting.See ya next review."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Ennui Than Envy","review":"Despite a promising premise this flick just doesn't work. Either it's in the script or in Barry Levinson's lackluster direction, regardless, \\"Envy\\" just lays there. Ben Stiller is too much of a wimp to be capable of anything diabolical. Jack Black's character is too nice to be truly interesting. The movie is saved somewhat by Christopher Walken as a scheming transient type. Time and again Walken has appeared in a film of dubious quality and turned a sow's ear into a silk purse. As far as his efforts here he shouldn't have bothered. I hope he was well compensated."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 And A Half","review":"Although some people say this movie is horrible, it actually isn't. It's no Hollywood gem, but it's not a Haunted Mansion or The Order. Sure, A genious pairing like Black and Stiller was used horribly, but if you think of this movie as a drama, and not a comedy, it's not too bad. Plus, Christopher Walken nails the role which enables him to make this movie a little bit comical. Stiller plays the same neurotic, worrying loser, like always, and Black plays his same old spunky, upbeat, likable character which we loved in the underrated Saving Silverman and the amazing School Of Rock. If you give this movie a chance, and don't sit down expecting anything funny, then this movie won't be a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok, but nothing special","review":"Another one of the million films Ben Stiller puts out every year this time is about a man whose best friend invents a spray that vaporises dog poop, and the man becomes jelous when he could have had the rich life to if he only invested in the idea his friend had. Then his best friend is stinking rich and he's poor and it gets to him over the months, he gets drunk and his rage he kills the rich guys horse and meets a bum in a bar whose gonnah help him hide the horse and then he becomes rich himself *yawn* and blah blah blah.....The movie has a few laughs, but nothing memorable. You'd think Jack Black, Christopher Walken & Ben Stiller might make a terrific cast, but the script just isnt all that funny.The movies all right, but nothing speical. just rent it"},{"rating":"1","title":"way too boring...ZZZZZZZZZ","review":"i rented this film from blockbuster, really wanting a good laugh. i wanted to like this movie, i really did. as a native of Baltimore and a huge fan of both Jack Black and Ben Stiller, i wanted to love this movie, and i really expected to, because i dont know of a bad movie with jack black or ben stiller. until now. the film starts out well, looks like it could be entertaining but about a half hour into it i was forcing myself not to fall asleep. it was so boring, i laughed maybe once, and that was a little chuckle. the movie is watchable before Black becomes rich, it provokes a giggle or two, but his invention takes off about 20 minutes into it and the film goes downhill fast. You would think Stiller could make a funny or two at this point, but, sadly, no. i turned it off a half hour into it and watched Collateral. dont waste your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody stop Ben Stiller!!","review":"Somebody should forbi Ben Stiller of starring in new productions, in order for him to pause for a moment and reflect what he's been doing recently (other than make money, I mean...). He suddenly is no longer a comedian and talented actor on the rise: he's becoming just annoying, making new movies by the dozen each year, echa one worst than the other. He thinks (and the producers also, because they keep hiring him) that he found a formula of proleonged success, but you're wrong, pal..JAck Black is miles ahead of Stiller as a pleasant lead, and he does not drop the ball in this senseless and misleading comedy. By the title, you would guess that the so called \\"envy\\" would lead to a lot of geneuinely comic gags. NO such luck.

I was ready to leave the theater about a quarter of the way through, but I kept on telling myself that it might get better. Once again, I was wrong. Jack Black and Ben Stiller have really screwed up. If you are planning to see this piece of crap, please save yourself a lot of torture and stupidity and don't. If you do decide to see it, please make sure that you have seen School of Rock of Shallow Hal first because if you haven't, Envy will make it look like Jack Black sucks. My best advice: don't watch this stupid excuse for a film. (Oh, yeah! I gave this movie one star only because I can't give it what it truly deserves.

I stopped the movie of the way in and did not care how it ended. If you must watch these 2 actors, stick with movies like dodge ball, school of rock, or meet the fockers. This movies stinks.

It sucks fun out of the air. It has an intersting premise, a cast with incredible potential, but seems like a morality play rather than an all out comedy. I kept waiting for J Black to cut loose and for B Stiller to wallow in a funny overdone pool of self pity. Don't happen. The film also also seems to have a cheapness about it that doesn't help sell it either. This film is a misfire wandering down a strange path."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid!

Yet nothing else sounded remotely original. If you are already familiar with the likes of The Go Gos, or The Runaways, or heck, even the Bangles, you won't be able to think of anything else when listening to Tegan and Sara.

At first I was disappointed that this album was so much shorter than \\"So Jealous\\", but after digesting the lyrics with several listens, I understand that this album is like well crafted poetry that needs to be explicated, as opposed to a cheap dime store novel that relies on exposition. The sound on this album is much more polished and less raw, which may detract a bit from their earlier work, but I think I like the direction T&S are heading in with their music, since it reflects their maturation as both songwriters and performers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing LP","review":"I saw them live when they opened for the Killers in April and was very impressed.

And recently two of their songs have been featured on the tv show Grey's Anatomy- Downtown and Fix You Up. All songs mentioned are favorites along with I Bet it Stung.Bottom line, their fresh talent and sound (both women have very unique and distinctive voices- think Nelly Furtado fused with Ashlee Simpson, in a good way) is a much needed change in the music world today and I hope they stick around for a very long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"black/brown belt","review":"The article came damaged and later than expected.

It is the saga of a fabulously wealthy Mexican crime family presiding over a global drug cartel, and the 6 episodes define how the power of that family was violently consolidated under the quiet and cunning leadership of Miguel Cadena,(Yancey Arias). Much of what was done has been done before and inevitable comparisons to \\"The Godfather\\" are sure to be raised. But with a mostly Hispanic cast, cultural values usually associated as south of the border, and highly imaginative plot twists, this work is sometimes brilliant. The production values of this series more closely resemble that of film rather than episodic weekly television. With just 6 episodes in the can, I think the series ended a bit too soon, and this viewer was left wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous television!","review":"One of the best shows to come along in a very long time, Kingpin redefines primetime television. Despite the confines of being on a network, and not cable, this show proved you don't have to have a mouth like a trucker to get your point across. Pay careful attention to Yancy Arias, because as Miguel Cardena, he's AMAZING! A lot happens very quickly, but it was well executed and doesn't feel rushed. A definate must see, particularly if it gets picked up for the fall season!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kingpin","review":"This was one of the greatest crime series/mafia productions I have ever seen. It was captivating throughout much like the sopranos except dealing with the mexican cartel. How NBC could cancel this series is beyond me. I bought the dvd after viewing the recommendations and was blown away. If it were to land again on NBC I would be a faithful watcher of the show. How can we petition NBC to give it another try? It is injust how such low quality shows remain on the air and a show of this magnitude (which was far too short - only 6 episides) could be canceled. I highly recommend buying the dvd if you are a fan of the sopranos, scarface, godfather, casino etc... Please NBC bring back Kingpin - this is an outrage to many of its legions of fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank goodness this is off the air","review":"The entire concept of the show is a very bad Sporanos rip off on either a much lower budget or just sheer production incompetence. The dialogue is atrocious and the characters predictable and flat. What the actors do to compensate for the poor script is to overact turning every episode into a very painful ordeal.Thank goodness this is off the air."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Series ever on NBC!!!","review":"Kingpin was one of thee best shows ever produced on NBC!

I didn't really expect much from the movie but it was worse than I thought. The singing was fabulous though.

Over all it was a terrible movie but if you are a Kelly or a Justin fan it can't hurt to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't waste the cost of a ticket for this Hype","review":"This movie shows people get dumber and dumber for entertainment.Fame has real talent and is handled professionally..but I hope they do not go this 'fleece the public' mechandising route and secure real jobs and credible agents from their diversified talents.

Previous reviews commented on the fact that it's painful to watch. I thoroughly agree. Yes, Justin and Kelly, it's great that you guys are \\"American Idols\\", but please, don't ever grace us with your presence on the big screen again.Ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"RANKS AMONG THE WORST EVER","review":"This was a terrible film. Justin and Kelly both proved to the entire world that they can't act and of the two of them, only Kelly has even decent vocal abilities.Each musical number is slopped between over-acting and horribly written dialogue that fails miserably and meeting its obvious pop-culture savvy intentions.I've never seen such a poorly pieced together film, and I did - in fact - happen to catch a little film called Spice World. None of the scenes seem to have anything to do anything else and half of the music is irrelevent to the situation.And I won't even get in to the choreography, so let's just leave it at the fact that this ranks along the likes of Envy, Starsky & Hutch, Spice World, and Gigli with the worst films ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever!","review":"What can I say? This wasted precious time of my life. Good thing I saw it for free, but that's not saying much. Those idols should be proud of their fellow peers for making the worst movie ever made. Yes, Simon Calwell knows what he's talking about when he sees talent. There was so much singing in \\"From Justin to Kelly,\\" I wanted to get up and start break-dancing and kick the tv screen in. The acting was grotesquely ugly and it would've made Medusa go back in the darkness where she came from. I don't think I can ever step foot on a beach again after watching this horrible misery.

Maybe they are not \\"classically\\" trained actors, but they are funny, great singers, and Justin is a real hunk.

The sad thing about this movie is that the music is really great, but there isn't a soundtrack. I think had there been one, it would have done better than the movie. The singing performances by Justin and Kelly really shows off their vocal abilities and their acting isn't bad for a first time gig. The movie is a love story and the challenges they endure in trying to get together after meeting up during a Summer break in Miami. Although the movie focuses on Justin and Kelly, it also includes other Summer hookups. Although the other actors/actresses in the movie are mostly unknown, all in all, they did a good job. They also sing and their performances are as good as Justin and Kelly's. If you enjoy good music and like Justin and/or Kelly, I recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry but this movie is HORRIBLE.","review":"I'm sorry I don't know what is up with everyone else thinking this movie is great, fantastic, enjoyable. It wasn't to me. It was cheesy. Every scene I knew what was going to happen next. Evan and Roeper [however you spell those critics names] they even thought this was movie was bad! It was absolutely horrible!!!!!! The dialogue was cheesy, the story in itself was cheesy. Whoever thought of to film this movie. They seriously need to be told \\"really?\\"THIS MOVIE IS ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS, AND A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME. This movie is for people who think life is perfect. As soon as you start watching it, your going to know what is going to happen, its not that hard to predict. Kudos though Justin [whatever his last name is] and Kelly Clarkson, because they do have amazing voices. But they should stay at voices and leave the acting to professionals."},{"rating":"2","title":"CUTE CUTE CUTE!","review":"Okay... so it's not Grease, however, this movie is really not as bad as everyone seems to think it is. I enjoyed it so much I watched it twice right off the bat and I never do that! It is VERY cute, and you can't help but like the characters. Sure, it's goofy at times, and it resembles more of a cutsey \\"musical\\" version of 'Where the boys are '84' than a true musical, but I enjoyed the musical numbers and Kelly and Justin are just charmin'! The DVD has a lot of extra features that make it totally worth the $10! I would have paid more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone who doesn't like this movie...","review":"... is a bloody hater. And that's a fact, Jack!This movie was killed at the box office by bad \\"buzz\\" and terrible marketing... neither of which has anything to do with the quality of the movie itself.The story keeps you interested. The music and singing is awesome. The dance numbers are amazing. I love it.The extras on the DVD are very funny and interesting as well. Rent it first if you must, but you'll just wind up buying it anyhow, so what's the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOO Disappointing","review":"I so wanted this movie to be a success, but unless you're looking for a comedy, it's terrible. We went to see the movie and it was painful to watch. All we could do is laugh. You actually feel embarrased for Kelly. She is so talented that you wonder how they could miss on this movie...but they did BIG TIME! The only saving grace was Kelly's amazing voice. I don't even think it's worth waiting for the video. Wait for the soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disaster.","review":"From Justin to Kelly is so deliciously awful. I am a big Kelly Clarkson fan but what was she thinking? The only thing great about this turkey is Kelly's beautiful and powerful voice but she is no actress or dancer. Justin Guarini is even worse, they have no chemistry whatsoever, not sure why everyone thought these two songbirds had a relationship in real-life? I can't even say this film is a guilty pleasure because it's not worth seeing more than once. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Charming, Fun Movie","review":"I was very surprised how good this movie was. I wasn't expecting too much, I thought it would be a marketing hype with everyone making more money off of Justin and Kelly. Which it is... and yet, I was very entertained. I loved the music and the dancing. It was all very light hearted and very fun. It reminded me of the old Annette Funicello - Frankie Avalon movies. I thought Justin and Kelly did an excellent job. Amazing, a year ago, these kids were just ordinary kids. Today, movie stars. This was a very charming movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Flop","review":"It is just so surprising to know that some movies instead of being good with their acting, they are just terrible with the feel of the movie. Based on the success of American Idol on television is one thing, but doing a movie that was similar to the idol feel was just really bad. That does go in that case with Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini. The movie from Justin To Kelly was really the worst teen style film that has ever been my displeasure of seeing on television. It was just awful. I really don't ever suggest this movie with bad acting ever. If this is bad, there are worse people out there than this. The writing and the acting really didn't blend together as a Grease for teens. If you want to see a good movie musical, go rent Grease!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yah It GREeAT!","review":"Yup me and VerdRa loves This Movy. IT haas the bestestset coreografy.

I hate American Idol. The idea that a buch of small town, hick losers think they can be the next Britney Spears is the whole point of the show.

This film is proof, these two: the cute chick with the nice a@#, and the loser with the stupid hair cut, sing lame songs and act like two retards with no self esteem.

I walked out after 45 minutes. This movie makes \\"Who's that Girl\\" the \\"Gone with the Wind\\" of pop star flicks. It is possibly the worst thing I have seen ever. Justin looks ridiculous with his outdated hair and pancake powdered skin. Kelly looked like she was drinking to try to deal with her horrible lines she delivered in the deadpan style of a b-movie queen. The movie is inept and really depressing. These two 'stars' are on the way out, big time. Kelly will be holding up liquor stores and Justin will be doing porn movies. When you are quick to the top, the ride down is slow and painful. From Justin to Kelly is the perfect example.Bye Justin and Kelly."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was alright","review":"This movie was alright. I'm a huge Kelly fan! I dragged my mom and brother to the movie, and of course, they didn't like it. When I first heard about the movie, I knew that it was going to bomb, and it it. $3.8 million, or something like that. I think that if Kelly wasn't in it, then it would be worse ratings then that! I'm still buying the soundtrack (if there will be one), and the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"The words to describe this movie are pointless, bad, nosense and anything else that falls in the lame category.It isnt at all hard to see why this movie got so many bad reviews,Thsi movie is a total waste of time Go see Crossroads(with Britney Spears) or Glitter(with Mariah Carey) or even A walk to remember (Mandy Moore) or Gigli (Benifer) before watching this"},{"rating":"1","title":"PAINFUL!","review":"This movie represents what is absolutely wrong with the marketing machinery in Hollywood. Play on the hype of a dreary \\"reality TV\\" series, advertise the thing to death, invest as little as possible in script and story, milk a bunch of unfortunate teeny boppers dry and then release it to video and start all over again.This movie should have gone straight to video and then been canceled.The good news here (or the bad news if you're Kelly or Justin) is that this production and the careers of the principles will alot the obligatory fifteen minutes of fame and then we can go on to the next failed fad.Frankie and Annette (well on their way to senior citizenship) can breathe a sigh of relief. Justin and Kelly and this preposterous movie didn't even make a dent."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Movie!","review":"this movie is awesome! if you are a teenage girl that watched american idol or likes kelly clarkson then you will definately enjoy this movie!

I think it's definately worth buying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what has this world come to???","review":"ok first of all i'd like to say that justin and kelly don't have bad voices but they can't act worth their life. It is a sterio-typical movie with a predictable plot and stupid songs. Please don't waste your money on this sucky film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You Will Lose The Will to Live","review":"Good Lord.This is a film for anyone who thought BEACH BLANKET BINGO was robbed at the Oscars in 1964.The mistake the producers of this film made--and there are a lot of them--is the misguided belief that the same nation of couch potatoes that made AMERICAN IDOL a hit would sever their sizable posteriors from where they've been grafted to their furniture to actually leave the house to see a movie.No scientific evidence exists that would support this theory.So the movie tanked and went straight to DVD faster than Simon Cowell can sneer.Where was Paul Lynde and Eric Vonn Zipper when you need them?The only thing I liked about this creaking horror was that the only girl with any discernible talent (Kelly's voice) was the smallest breasted girl on the beach. Now that was funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie of the year","review":"What do you get when you mix bad acting, bad music and reality TV stars? You get \\"From Justin to Kelly.\\" The title alone should tell people what a horrible movie this is. The film tries to copy the old style beach musical comedies of the past and fails completely. Sure, those movies were cheesy but at least they were entertaining. There is NOTHING good about this movie. The music is down right awful! Neither one of these kids can sing and the choreography is the worst I have ever seen. I really don't understand what the winners of American Idol are doing in a movie. They won a contest for singing not acting. If they entered a contest for acting they would've been the first to be cut. This is without a doubt the worst movie of the year and maybe the worst movie ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"I just saw this movie and was disapointed. I was not attracted by the plot, but I am a fan of kelly Clarkson so I was excited to see it. The dancingwas explicit for anyone under 12. The movie \\"Blue Crush\\" was rated PG-13 for 'teen party-ing.' This movie, if rated for that, would be R! The plot is not original. However, although all the singing got to be stupid, the music was pretty good. So, all in all, a 3 out of ten, and a disapointment. WARNING! Explicit for those under the pre-teen age.

Not only is the movie itself aweful, it's also a cheap rip-off of the classic \\"Grease.\\" If there is a single good thing about this film, it's Kelly Clarkson's voice. She is, indeed, a great vocalist. Guarini, on the other hand, pales in comparison. Crooning along side Kelly doesn't really do Justin any good.

On top of that, the plot is a million miles away. The plot is a spec, practically non-existant. Why would anyone want to make a movie with Kelly, who no one gets a riff about, and Justin. Besides, how did he make second on American Idol. The man just can't sing, or act, or anything else useful. So, if you're a human being with eyes and ears and you run across this movie, step away from the aisle and run away. Very far away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"In order to appreciate this movie, you must enjoy either Justin or Kelly.

After hearing the outpouring of bad reviews, I decided I could live without seeing this movie, but alas, I got hit with it on the airplane a few weeks ago. I didn't have to watch it, I was just morbidly curious. True, Kelly and Justin aren't very good actors, but the shortcomings of this film aren't completely their fault. There's the bad writing, the bad direction, bad music, cliched plot devices - this project didn't have a prayer.

There's hardly any plot, and the storylines that exist go far too fast to be enjoyable. The characters are desperately underdeveloped. Justin is a likeable character, but that's about it, with the possible exception of his friend Ryan, and Kelly's friend Kaya (although she's a bit annoying in some parts) and Kaya's boyfriend Carlos. Most of the music sounds the same, though it is nice, and I would buy the soundtrack, if not for the film behind it. This is not a generation for musicals, and the sudden breakouts into song caused giggles in the theater. 'From Justin to Kelly\\" would be a box office failure if not for the leads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone who actually saw the movie","review":"I was just so curious, I had to go see this movie. This will probably become a cult classic. As cheesy as I thought it would be, it still outdid itself.

From the poor/no plot and the unbelievably bad writing (a 7th grader could have done better), they sure didn't have much to work with. I don't know how they were able to keep a straight face.I knew this was a musical, so I have no problem with people spontaneously breaking out in to song and dance, but it should at least relate to what is going on in the movie. Definitely not the case here.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"PAINFUL to watch...

When was this movie made? 2003? Then why were they wearing clothes that weren't even cool in the 1960's? This movie was an abortion.

This film is spectac!! Kelly and Justin hit a homerun with this lovable classic. What a beautifull story of dancing and beach fun. The best movie about American Idols ever!

THERE GREAT !!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie of all time","review":"This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. It makes Britney Spears in Crossroads look like an Oscar Winner. Justin and Kelly can both sing, but should NEVER act. In addition to the horrible acting, the writer of this movie should be shot. The singing is good but is so overwhelmingly drowned by bad plotlines and bad acting that it can't even begin to try to be a redeeming aspect of this film. One star is way to many stars to be given on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"AGHH AH, POOPY AHH!!!!","review":"OUCH! WOw, this movie is reprehensible. Not only does this movie score as one of the worst things I've ever seen, but it also gave me one of the most painful bouts of diarrhea I have personally ever experienced. Whenever the image of Justin popped into my mind again, I'd get that familiar feeling and look desperately for the nearest bathroom, where i'd noisily relieve myself. Please spare yourself the pain I have gone through."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Flops Again","review":"There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that when it really comes to movies, there really has to be a lot of chemistry within the works. It was just a shame that Kelly Clarkson was one of those who didn't have chemistry within her Thankful record, and it just goes even worse with From Justin To Kelly. If you're an American Idol fan, you'd surely love it, but it is the worst [...] I've ever had seen at the box office. I really thought the film could've showcased better chemistry between Justin and Kelly. Unfortunately, there wasn't any. If you really like these kind of teenage movie musicals, go get a copy of Grease with John Travolta. Trust me, you'll have a much better time seeing that 70's film instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelly CAN act","review":"Kelly and Justin CAN act. This is a good movie; I really don't see why it flopped. It was a good storyline for a teen movie. I watch this a lot. Kelly should do another movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Sucked","review":"The movie is the stupidest thing ever made period.I like that 11 year old kid who wrote that one review on here and said it sucked because he was right.The movie blows.Kelly Clarkson shouldstay with her day job (singing).Justin Guarini however should just go somewhere where no one will ever have to see that crappy hair again.The movie deserves to win \\"Worst Picture\\" at the Razzies.The movie is stupid.I give it an F! Anyone who says this movie is good should go to hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal. Even Bikinis can't save this one!","review":"Let me start off by saying I love Kelly, and sort of like Justin. However , let's be honest, this movie is dismal! First, and foremost, Kelly & Justin just don't click as a couple. There's nothing in the characters, fictional or real, that would attract each other to one another, even if you added another 95 minutes to an already tedious movie.Did I mention the movie was tedious? The plot was....well there really wasn't a plot. Not even a lot of skin and bikinis can save this one. Did anyone notice that Justin never had has shirt off? Go figure? Come to think of it, Kelly stayed fairly covered as well.Kelly has a fabulous voice and her duets with Justin blended well. It's too bad they didn't have a better vehicle to show off their talents.Other than the great singing voices, the best part of movie was the credits. It meant I was free to leave the theatre...finally.Two thumbs down! If I had more thumbs, they would be down as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEACH BLANKET IDOL","review":"For the most part, this film could have been a lot worse. It was a gimmick from the beginning and after two delays, it will now open in the heart of the Summer rush. Oddly enough, I actually enjoyed the movie itself more than the music. Kelly Clarkson deserved to win AMERICAN IDOL, but no one ever seems to give her a good song. Since it will be on video within three months, you might as well wait. This film is not worth paying for other than to keep the kiddies quiet for an hour and a half. There are indeed some funny moments, but the music provides too much of a distraction to give the film an even flow. God help us if there is a FROM CLAY TO RUBEN in our future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't mean to be rude, but...","review":"Well, I'll start by saying that I LOVE American Idol. Justin and Kelly are both very talented singers and their acting wasn't horrible, though it could have been better. I rented this movie not too long ago and I will just say that it was a complete waste of life. The plot for the movie is terrible. They were WAY too obsessed with text-messaging. To think that their problems would have been completely resolved if they'd done what normal people would do--CALL.I'm just grateful that they didn't make from Clay to Ruben."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Kelly, the movie blows!","review":"I am a HUGE American Idol fan.

I thought, what the hey, maybe it will become a cult classic bad movie! Maybe I will laugh til my eyes pop out! No such luck--it was painful. Predictable story line, hideous directing, dreadful acting, unbelievably horrid costuming--need I say more? I kept looking at the time on the screen---WHEN WILL IT END????!!!! On the flip side, what could John Waters or Tim Burton have done with this one? Either one of them could have made it a cult classic! I don't care about the few bucks I dropped on it, but I wish I had the hour and 17 minutes of my life back! The producer and director should be FINED for having the audacity to thrust this movie on the public!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, an attempt","review":"If you've seen The Real Cancun, and love spring break movies, DON'T SEE THIS ONE! Okay, I'll give credit to J&K's vocals(especially Kelly's well-done remake of 'Vacation') but this movie made no sense to me. The lines are cheap, and the dance moves look like a 3rd grader could've done them. But if you are a true Justin and Kelly fan, then this is a must-have for you guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest waste of time...","review":"I would give this movie a rating of -5 if I could. It was the worst thing I have ever seen. There was absolutely no talent. From the first 2 minutes in, it was a huge failure. You could tell right away that there was no acting or singing ability. Actually, Kelly doesn't have that bad of a voice....but the concept of them making a MUSICAL??? Bad call. Don't waste your time. It was major crap. From the beginning until it finally took me out of my misery and ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOLY COW!!","review":"Isn't it interesting how Hollywood continues to believe that the viewing audience is populated by mindless suckers who will unquestioningly buy off on actors who promote the premise that \\"if I act I can sing\\" or, in the case of FROM JUSTIN TO KELLY, \\"if I sing I can act.\\"Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini star in a movie that should never have been made. No plot. No direction. Nonsense! And the favorable comparisons to classic films of similar genre starring duos like Ann-Margret and Bobby Rydell (BYE BYE BIRDIE), Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello (BACK TO THE BEACH), and Deborah Walley and James Darren (GIDGET GOES HAWAIIAN) are absolutely irresponsible, if not idiotic.Pass on this one.

I'm not expecting academy award winning performances from them, nor should anyone else. Why can't this just be a positive stint? We know they can sing, right? So, why can't we just sit down and enjoy it. Besides, it is not there fault that they had to make this movie in the first place. Even if they wanted to make this movie on their own, good for them. It doesn't seem to have vulgarity, nudity, or violence in it, so I see that as positive not negative. All I know is that I'd much rather have my children watching this movie than any other movie out there!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't see the movie but.....","review":"They made this movie because Kelly N Justin were popular on American Idol and they just wanted to make more money on them........

What an awesome idea! I also like it because Justin lost, so he is the king of no talent hacks. These two can barely sing and then movie executives get the bright idea to try to make them act?

The only reason I would possibly own this movie would be to be ironic but yet the ironic virtue of owning it would be overshadowed by its overall [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is an awful movie. Kelly and Justin's acting is painful to watch, and the storyline is awful. The songs are awkward and irritating. I feel really bad for Kelly and Justin, I'm sure they didn't realize how bad this movie was and were just following the advice of studio executives looking to make a quick profit. However from what I've heard they really didn't! The movie bombed at the box office for a reason... DONT buy this movie!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear God........","review":"I have just one thing to say. There are millions of scripts and novels and songs written by unknowns every year and they go absolutly nowhere. Yet Corporate Hollywood continues to go along with fads to make a buck.

This movie ran in my town for three days, the rumor was it was pulled after a total of 5 ticket sales. I'd be embarrassed to have anything to do with this. What's next?

But it is fun, and nice to have a CART racing game for PS2."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game should not have CART in its title.....","review":"I was looking for a good CART simulation game that was like I was really racing in a CART race. This game has fantasy tracks and none of the real tracks that CART races on. Plus, there is jumps which a real CART car could not handle. This game is soo unrealistic that is should not even have CART in its title. The only thing that was realistic were the names of the drivers. That was it. I have never seen a CART race with as much crashing this one has and you can never keep up with the other cars unless they do crash and you use your so-called boost. This game is only for those looking to crash. There is no skilled required for this game. Not recommended for CART fans or even fans of serious racing games. It makes Mario Cart look good."},{"rating":"1","title":"CART Fury Not Realistic","review":"I am a very loyal and devoted racing fan. I enjoy playing realistic simulation games such as NASCAR, F1, and Gran Turismo. I have been waiting for along time for Playstaion to come out with a CART Game. When I saw it I just had to get it and I figured it would be a cool simulation and realitic game...But I was WRONG!!! There is no realism in the game. The tracks aren't real and the drivers aren't up-to-date. You can't even race long races, you can only race a few laps.They need to re-think what they did to this game and they need to come out with a real CART game. They can use the NASCAR and F1 games for examples.The game that they put forth needs to be only meant for the Arcade. And in that since it would be okay because it does have good graphics.But, looking at it from a true racefan stand point...The game is far from real. If you're a true racefan looking for a simulation game, I suggest at the most to rent this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"reallly bad","review":"I rented this game and it is just plain really bad.

The simulation mode seems decent, with the ability to tweak your car though even that is limited. I was disappointed to find there was no pit stops. There are shortcuts, but I found them to only slow me down. The sub-games are fun, i.e. demolition. But whose idea was it to make a two sentance background music EVERY TIME the game loads? (sloooooowly) It was enough to make me want to strap m-80s to it and blow it to pieces. Do yourself a favor and turn the music(I use that term loosely) off. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I wanted to give this game ZERO STARS\\"","review":"Wow,I rented this game and I still fell like I was taken.The concept,the gameplay and the graphics were awful.I could not believe that CART alowed such a game to bear it's name in despite of a alrady lackluster image the racing league has and this game does not help to improve that image.

THERE IS ABSOLUTLY NO REALISM IN THIS GAME, EVEN IN SIMULATION MODE. I'M A BIG CART FAN AND THIS GAME IS INSULTING TO PLAY FOR THOSE OF US WHO EXPECT REALISTIC RACING.

Sorry, but is better you wait for a real game...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad I only rented it!!!","review":"While the positives for this game include CART licensing, real driver names and track modeled after the real thing, the negative far out weigh the positives in CART Fury. Many negative aspects include the load time - I spent more time waiting for the game to load than playing it, the cartoon like graphics, the lack of turns on the tracks - the real life track names are only modeled after the real thing and many do not come close. All of the tracks are almost perfect ovals with very little turning involved.And Finally the game play.While I am Gran Turismo pro, loosing only a race here and there, the race AI in this game is completely unrealistic. It is not uncommon in this game to fall behind to last place for the first couple of laps only to astonishingly go form last to first on the last lap of the race.To sum it up, this game is so bad, I am forced to even consider renting a NASCAR game. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice map of the valley","review":"I like this map because of the 3D rendering of the mountains surrounding the valley.

Because it only has two or three good (not great) songs glued together with some horribly produced tracks that look like rejected demos. They sound like plastic with all those synth clich��s from the 80's. And many of them really seem to have been written for some other voice. It is weird that the amazing energy we find in Grace's previous albums is nowhere to be found here - except LOVE ON TOP OF LOVE and AMADO MIO that manage to rescue some of Grace's magic.It is no wonder that after such a disappointing album like this, Grace spent 19 years before the release of a new one.Sad, sad, sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the masters of piano","review":"Great performance.

This DVD series is even better than the TV version because they leave in all the previously cut and censored scenes. However, the producers of the DVD set decided to use flipper disks; disks recorded on both sides requiring you to flip them over to see the next set of programs. Flipper disks have an alignment problem when they are not recorded properly. The first set I bought had this problem and I had to exchange it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Television Porn.....","review":"The amount of suggestive content in this series, is enough to make one think that it should be rated NC-17.

Product was returned, and a new one has not been purchased since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncut? No...","review":"\\"Uncut and uncensored\\"...except for the original music.

I mean,it's the box set I will have my entire life and it's not even identical to the real version (the TV one),so I'm sorry to say that but I feel cheated,even worse,stolen,as I paid for this fake.A fake Gucci purse will never be a real one,even if there's Gucci written on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I bought this series as a gift and it was supposed to be brand new and did have the plastic around it, but the dvd's are scratched and can't even be watched.

An excellent opening for the series sets a great mood for a good pilot but a few episodes throughout the year seem a bit weak. The anamorphic transfers are decent, better then most TV shows to DVD but still look a bit soft. There is certainly a lot of eye candy in the ways of people and scenery with some cameos from a few lame celebrities. Overall, more entertaining then most of the junk on TV.Now if only I could remember the name of the song played over the Main Menu screen..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best TV SHOW!!!!","review":"I first watched an episode last year and was hooked right away. I got season one because I didn't really know the relationships between each character.

James Caan is amazing and Vanessa Marcil is just stunning! I ordered the second season right away when I finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"This product was exactly as it was described and shipped much faster than expected.

Hitting the Vegas Strip Never Was This Fun!","review":"Wow! A glitzy prime time soaper for men! Who would have thought? A great cast, led by James Caan, sparkles the Vegas strip with the high rollin' lives of the staff at the Montecito. The DVDs feature uncut versions of the episodes, which would be too hot for TV. Lots of action and sexy situations to keep a guy watching. Not a well rounded show, and certainly not family viewing, but it is a guilty pleasure for me. Almost like a male version of \\"Dynasty.\\" Lots of purty girls, rounghneckin' fights, and gamblin'!!! Popcorn entertainment. Don't ask why do I watch it, just watch and enjoy. It's like a free trip to Vegas every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth or an Alibi?","review":"Donald Lam was hired to verify a story of a client. However, while he found evidence that confirmed the story, he found a real investigation didn't hold water.What did that get him? Disgrace, in bad with the police, a dissolution of his partnership, and a struggle to do his client some REAL service.Indeed, while Lam's ethics are often thin in his adventures, he always was dedicated to his client. The question is whether he could not only provide his client with the REAL service he needed (innocence on a murder charge), but also make a profit and be able to stroll into his office without being a murder victim himself - at the hands of Bertha Cool, his partner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only okay.","review":"I kept trying to view it in context of the period. It does takes one back to a time before computers and cell phones when detectives worked occasionally on bribes and intimidation, but also on instinct and legwork. However, many of the conclusions reached by Lam are a bit hard to believe, and most of the characters are over the top. However, it is a detective story in the classic sense, and a black-and-white movie fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome!","review":"These litter mats are my favorite!

My band had the chance to open for these guys back in the winter of '89. Watching their lead singer jump off stage, grab a chair and stand on it while he delivered his dialogue during the songs were a sight to see. I just wished they could have captured the live show. It could have been their KISS \\"Alive\\" turning point but at that time every label gave you at most two shots and out due to the huge explosion of college alt rock. They weren't an indie band since they were on Geffen records but a pure rock band that wanted to share their story with the masses even if it did take eight minutes to tell it in a song. Great disc, I highly recommend it to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"slightly misled","review":"it was billed as the retail issue, but was not. seller was unwilling to renegotiate so i just shipped it back without even playing it. sorry about the long delay in the review, must've missed the email. was reimbursed in almost a timely fasion due to amazon i'm sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, It's On CD At Least...","review":"For starters, if you've heard of that 'horrible mix job' of the original album, that's the mix used here (sounds mono most of the time, but close listening reveals MINIMAL, and I mean minimal stereo separation). In this age, I would have hoped a fully remixed version would have been done, but you can't have everything. Maybe there weren't any tapes available for that purpose? Who knows. Anyway, this is a good album, it's no INDIAN WAR WHOOP or MORAY EELS... but instead it's a twisted country-rock album with occasional relapses of Rounder craziness. If you're not used to the Rounders this may be an odd album for you since other band members take vocals (Stampfel and Weber only get half the album), but on it's own merits, and if one can cast aside the bother of the mixing, GOOD TASTE IS TIMELESS may well prove to be, well, timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodstuff....","review":"I have listened to this album,and I think it is one his best so far. I have all of his other CDs which I think are just great. My favorite song is the current single, \\"Man Of Me\\". I highly recommend this album to any Gary Allan fans, or any country fan for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of 2001!","review":"There are some artists out there that I would buy their albums without hearing any songs on them. Johnny Cash and George Strait, and more recent acts Dixie Chicks and Gary Allan. \\"Alright Guy\\" is a superbly crafted album with so many styles it keeps the CD fresh and new each time you hear it. You can hear everything from hard core honky tonk \\"Devil's Candy\\" to Big Band era sound \\"What's On My Mind,\\" and everything in between. Gary wraps his voice around each song to make it distinctly his.The very thing that makes this album so great, it's diversity, might be what is holding Allan back from becoming a true star. Nashville wants nothing to do with you if you're into taking risks and sounding unique. I believe \\"Smoke Rings In The Dark\\" was a masterful CD, and this one falls just short of hitting that mark, but it's still better than 99% of the music coming out of Music City today."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is going to shock some people....","review":"Gary Allan struck big with \\"Smoke Rings in the Dark.\\" It was a very tasteful album with a retro, California-sounding country feel to it. In \\"Alright Guy,\\" Gary sticks with his retro, California country sound, but performs songs with lyrics that will shock most country fans. After listening to the title track, \\"Alright Guy,\\" I had to pick my jaw up off the ground. The lyrics are almost like those that would be heard in alternative music. This is a very bold step for Gary by using lyrics that are normally taboo in country music. The album is definitely new and innovative for country music. I would recommend this album to anybody wanting hear something new and different. Best songs on the album are definitely the first single \\"Man of Me,\\" the emotional ballad \\"The One,\\" and the somewhat sacreligious \\"What Would Willie Do\\" where he hints that Willie Nelson is a Christ-like figure. This album is definitely in-your-face edgy country music."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Timer","review":"This is my first Gary Allan CD and it's pretty good. I'm not really into the old time country singers like Garth Books, but I do like Gary Allan's CD. \\"The One\\" and \\"The Devil's Candy\\" are probably my favorite. If you like something new with a touch of tradition, this one is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Timer","review":"This is my first Gary Allan CD and it's pretty good. I'm not really into the old time country singers like Garth Books, but I do like Gary Allan's CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to this one.","review":"While Gary has triumphed in the past with Smoke Rings In The Dark, this effort falls very flat. Seems he is trying to be the rugid, tough guy with a sensitive side. Too much emphasis on either. Get back to the honky tonk and leave this smaltz behind. One stand-out song is \\"Devil's Candy\\" but most others, especially \\"The One\\" just kinda lay there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Guy!...","review":"I love this man. His albums are always so amazing and worth buying. This one is no acception. From \\"Alright Guy\\" to \\"Man of Me\\"...he's wonderful. And of course, who could deny \\"The One\\"??? This album is one that you listen to every song...you won't skip one because you don't like it. Again...he's made a hit of an album!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME! Watch out cuz here comes GARY ALLAN!","review":"Gary Allan's latest release \\"Alright Guy\\" is definately his best work to date! Each song showcases Gary's incredible vocal abilities, as well as his edgier (\\"Man of Me\\") and smooth side (\\"Adobe Walls\\"). I LOVE each song on the album--they're even better when performed live, especially \\"Alright Guy\\"! Get a copy of the album then head to the Gary Allan concert!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It just gets better and better!!","review":"Gary Allan and his Honky Tonk Wranglers scored another touchdown with the new release of Alright Guy. Anyone looking for a CD they can listen to all the way through without suffering through filler songs should snap this up immediately. He struts through rowdy driving country with What's in my Head, romances his way through sweet ballads like Adobe Walls, while stirring desire with The One. Everyone mentions how incredibly hot he is. There's no getting past that, but listen to his music, there's a lot more there than just a beautiful face. Order it now, you will NOT be disappointed. I've been listening to it non stop since I bought it three days ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alright Guy - Alright Album","review":"Having followed the carrer of Gary Allan since his debut, with 'Used Heart For Sale', I can say this is his second best effort. 'Smoke Rings in the Dark' set Gary as an elite alubm artist with every song flowing from one to the other. On 'Alright Guy' Gary continues to amaze his fans with his honky tonk voice and willingness to take on the risker songs that his contemperies would shy away from. However, this album is probably more geared towards true Gary Allan fans than the casual fan. The title track is stellar with 'Man of Me' following the gritty style of his previous efforts. The vocals on this album are rich, sentiment is full of anguish, and the honky tonk is distinguished. For a true fan this is a five star album, for the casual fan we're looking at a four."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gary Allan did it again!","review":"This CD is his best yet. There's not a bad song on this CD. Alright Guy is really funny, The One is sweet, and Man of Me is sexy. There's something for everyone on this CD! Buy it and you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break!","review":"If you like tough guy country this is it to buy for 2001. Hearing my first Gary Allan cd I was not very impressed at all there was to much tough guy rubbish and and alot of the songs lacked emotion. Allan does not sing like George Strait and Garth Brooks people call him not your usual nashville performer Gary Allan is not a bad performer at all but his cd's he should get a little more softer with his music and stay away from stuff like Man of me and Alright Guy. That was my opinion of this cd not impressed but it was not disgraceful niether go back to music like in Smoke Rings in the dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Solid Album","review":"This one is full of songs that will probably never get played on your corporate country station. That's too bad because this is an album that really hits on all cylinders. Gary Allan picks up the promise of \\"Smoke Rings In The Dark\\" and brings it all home."},{"rating":"2","title":"alright guy","review":"this is agreat c.d.Gary has a nice mix.\\"The One\\" has that Smokering sound,but it is differant.'Adobe Walls'is also a differant sound that is great.He has a more mature sound&the band is outstanding.this music is not the same old thing over&over.this c.d. is a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Willie Wouldn't Do","review":"Gary Allen asks, \\"What would Willie do?\\" One thing I think he wouldn't do would be to record a CD like this.I'm glad that so many other people seem to have liked this CD, but I found it very disappointing. Gary Allen has been billed as a \\"country music traditionalist,\\" but calling this music \\"traditional country\\" is kind of like calling Rod Steward \\"hard rock.\\"If you like the \\"hot young country\\" which is coming out of Nashville these days, you will probably like this CD. If you are expecting anything different, you will probably be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright guy?","review":"If you wanna hear an alright guy, check out Todd Snider, who wrote the track and played it 100 times better (IMHO). I think it's bare-faced cheek of this guy not only to do a bad cover of Todd's song but also use the name as the album title. I do not think he is an alright guy (musically speaking). I think he's just one more of these guys who think if they wear a cowboy hat and play \\"radio-friendly\\" music (pap), they'll make it big. Unfortunately, he may be right. Garth Brooks anyone? Do me a favour! There is so much good stuff out there, why waste your money on this? Buy Todd Snider instead, or John Prine, or Steve Earle, or Guy Clark, or..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gary Allan Rocks!!","review":"If you don't have this album already then you need to get it now. Gary Allan really knows how to rock. You will especially like this album if you like the style of Willie Nelson and the other legendary country artists. This is because Gary gets a lot of his influence from these individuals, not to mention he is a native from Bakersfield, too. But no matter what style of country you are into you will like the album because Gary tells it like it is and doesn't care what anyone thinks. All his songs are very real and they show his musical talents. My favs on the album would have to be \\"The One\\" and \\"Alright Guy.\\" But all the songs are great; he really brings back a traditional sound to back to country."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL ABOUT GARY","review":"I first got hooked on gary allan when I heard \\"Right Where I Need To Be\\" on the radio and it became my favorite song. Then I saw the video and well...Gary is the man. So not only is Gary so sexy he's also a great singer. I love his music it's country with sort of a rock edge. It's the kind of album that you want to listen to all of it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd!","review":"I really love all of Gary's work. I have been a fan since 1996, and have all of his cds (3 of which I had signed by him). This fourth album, I have to say though, is the least favorite of mine of the 4, though it has a lot of really good songs on it! I am partial to his first cd though (Used Heart For Sale), maybe because that is what I first heard from him and loved. I was tempted to give this 5 stars, just because I love Gary's music so much, but decided to be fair, since I like his others a bit better. He is really not appreciated enough in the country music world. He has an amazing voice that is indescribable and extremely unique to the music business. I highly recommend this cd (AND all of his others), as they are excellent! Take care all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gary Allan is more than an \\"Alright Guy\\"","review":"From the #1 hit \\"Man to Man\\" to the sexy \\"Man of Me\\" Gary Allan really delivers an eclectic CD. The tune \\"Alright Guy\\" is a fun song that really makes you tap your toes, while \\"Adobe Walls\\" takes you away to a sexy Mexican cantina. \\"Devil's Candy\\" is a seductively sexy song about the hold that alcohol can have on you [no....that song is not about a woman :-) ]. \\"The One\\" is a song that every woman would LOVE for their significant other to sing to them ;-) I own all 6 of Gary Allan's CD and I must say that this one is one of my favorites! It is just good country music!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Very Best of Sherlock","review":"I still run into people who've never seen a Sherlock Holmes episode starring Jeremy Brett.

Jorge Sanz deservedly won the Goya as best actor that year--bu the way, he gives Eduardo Noriega a run for his money in the looks department (inclkuding some frontal nudity).

It is considerably larger - length, width, and weight than the previous SafeSeat styles. Our baby fit in it well, but my husband and I both struggled with the weight of the combined baby and carseat by the time our son was 8 months old. Because of this, we switched over to a convertible seat at 9 months, making the extra $$ we paid for the large size worthless. Keep this in mind if you foresee carrying/transporting your baby around a lot. This is a very heavy car seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Color is great","review":"I bought this because I thought it had rated the best in a consumer's report article, and I loved the color. The straps are sometimes hard to work--they stick at times. Also, using this as part of the travel system with the stroller is a pain. It's not very sturdy and is sometimes difficult to release. The release is also sometimes problematic in the car base. The handle configuration is not easy on the back, esp. with a growing baby. The visor often falls down behind/under the carseat, which makes it a pain when transporting. I sometimes pull them off altogether to not be bothered with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward, Heavy, Where's the Slack?","review":"I bought this car seat based upon the written reviews here. Well, after having baby and working with this super-wide car seat, you quickly realize your walking is limited to about 10 steps. Now my baby is four days short of 5 months old and over 20 lbs. (! I know! Huge!) and together, this car seat and baby are approaching 40 lbs! I can barely lift it into my car, and cannot maneuver it at all. I am now moving him out of it and straight into a Britax Marathon and giving up on the \\"systems.\\" Also, I did move the straps on the Graco to the middle level and they are getting tight on junior, and I moved them to the top level and there is NO SLACK whatsoever - I almost cannot buckle in a 5-month old baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safeseat luxe","review":"Very nice.

This car seat is SOOOO much cuter then the picture shows. I love it. It's a little heaver then some - but it's designed to fit a bigger baby (up to 12 months) then the lighter ones. SO if you want lighter - buy a lighter one. If you want one that will fit your baby longer and weighs a little more - this is the car seat for you. It's awesome.

I have a 3 year old that we had spent extra $$ on buying her a Combi infant car seat in hopes of letting our future kids use it. And unfortunately when I took it down to wash for my son (while pregnant) the padding dissolved. So the search began for a new seat. I originally bought the Baby Trend and felt that it was cheap and too small (my son was 8+lbs on the ultrasound before delivery) so I took it back and found the SafeSeat. This seat is great because my rather large infant has time to grow into it (he is 16+ lbs and just turned 4 months) since the weight limit is around 30lbs instead of 23lbs, it is cute as can be, and he loves it. Only complaint is it is Heavy - but is that my son or the seat? :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes up WAY TOO MUCH SPACE!","review":"I can't stand this car seat because it takes up way too much front to back space on the car seat. In order to fit it into our Chrysler 300M we had to put it on the rear right side seat and move the passenger seat all the way forward! Our car has quite a bit of space in the back seats, but this car seat takes up way more than it should.You also have only one slot for the front buckle that goes between the baby's legs, so it's not adjustable in that sense.The mesh cover is nice and soft though :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I choose this one...","review":"The Graco Safe Seat is a great infant seat. It is larger than most seats so it lasts longer. My baby is only 6 mths old but is wearing 12-18 mths clothes. It might be heavy to carry a large seat with a large baby in it but if your child is asleep you have the option to leave them in the seat.There is plenty of width to the seat which I have seen some that are tight for a bigger baby. The seat belt is very easy to use because it don't have the puzzle type and when unbuckling just push the button and the belt pops out. Some seats require you to really squeeze hard and pull on the belts. It has the option to buckle the seat in without the base and fits in most carts and strollers. The only thing I didn't like was the handle could be more comfortable for carrying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great car seat!","review":"I bought a pair of these car seats for my daughter who was having twins about 2 years ago. They held up great and worked very well with the matching twin stroller I purchased at the same time. Easy to put in and take out of the car and she never had a problem with them. Easy to adjust the straps also. Taking apart to clean was a bit of a hassle, but to me that would be the case with any car seat. All in all very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This is the best car seat for safety and price! Plus, the Rittenhouse design is beautiful! Use this carseat with the Graco or Baby Trend Snap N Go and you have a perfect way to stroll baby around. I also have the Quattro Tour Deluxe stroller in the same design for longer strolls with rougher terrain.The carseat is heavier, but it accomadates your baby longer.***If you don't want to lug a heavy seat and baby, then skip it all together and get a covertible carseat that stays in the car and then you will not be lugging it all around. The bonus you will miss out on by having a covertible carseat is waking a sleeping baby when you must remove them from the car seat. Get the safeseat and you will love it---and the baby will not wake up when you remove the seat with baby from the car.

Add to that a lot of inaccurate information or inappropriate footage (saying the X-24B was the first powered lifting body and showing the X-24A).

If you are looking for a book to explain the religious experience of the bar/bat mitzvah, this book is definitely not for you. If you wish to have a big reception, then this book fits the bill. If the book is useful to you, I hope you will spend at least equal time in preparing for the religious element of bar/bat mitzvah and use an excellent guide such as \\"Putting God on Your Guest List.\\" My 4 star rating is based on the assumption that the reader wants a party planner only.

At the same time, she grows up and starts to leave her childhood, while learning about the fears and dangers of the world she never knew of before.

I don't care if she did it on purpose or not, it made the book harder to understand.I would give this book 0 stars out of 5 if I could. This book was trash, it was crap.

I like how this books brings us into a different life than what a lot of us know. It really takes you into the girl's life and how she thinks, it brings you into a small town of broken down homes, and in some cases broken down families. But on the down side, I found a lot of this book almost pointless, scattered and hard to follow. I think a lot of the stories in this novel where almost pointless and unnecessary.

The best thing I can say about the book is that it is very short and can be read in a few hours. Essentially, it takes the form of a diary/journal of a young teenage Hispanic girl in a poverty-sticken section of Chicago. The author obviously has a feminist viewpoint. I will concede that the author is capable of a poetic turn of phrase, but overall the book is not well-written and could not possibly have been assigned in a Literature course as an example of high-quality writing. Instead, it apparently was selected by people who agree with the sociological opinions of the author, and who feel that those should be foisted onto the ninth-graders."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for nerve, No stars for talent!","review":"It would be hard to criticize a woman with a following larger than Jim Jones, but here goes...Her stories are cute, like a cake decoration made out of buttercream that will eventually lead to diabetes, but I would hardly consider this book a literary blockbuster. She does manage to sell her ethnicity every time she makes references to butterflies, corn, and of course the Virgen de Guadalupe.

Perhaps this is of interest to SOMEBODY but not this middle aged man nor most teen boys. I felt like I was trapped in a chick book (not always bad), written by a poet (not always bad) celebrating diversity (not always good). The stories were short and the redeeming value was that there were so many partial pages that it was half as long as it looked.

Set up as a series of vignettes about her life growing up living with her brothers and sisters on Mango Street, every story is an extended prose poem. The chapters are short, with each word carefully chosen to bring her world vividly to life. Not a single syllable is wasted. My favorite chapter is \\"A House Of My Own,\\" where two tiny paragraphs express a longing so deep it is consuming. I highly recommend taking your time in savoring every word in this little book of beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for Mango Street","review":"I think this book is interesting and very easy to read. What makes this book different from other books I've read is there is no plot. Each chapter has its own story. When put together, the chapters make one large story that describes Esperanza's life and what she remembers about it.The main character, Esperanza, was a child in the beginning of the book, but she gradually matures and experiences real life situations. Esperanza wasn't like most of the other girls her age. She wanted to be independent and daydreamed of having her own house one day. Everything she went through led her to understand life better.I recommend this book to anyone because it isn't difficult to understand and because it is enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The House on Mango Street","review":"The House on Mango Street is a difficult book to follow for those who like a plot that is easy to find. I happen to be one of those people, and therefore did not think very highly of Cisneros novel. This book is merely a description of characters of those that live on Mango Street, and the happenings that occur there. Also this novel is written to the way of speaking on Mango Street, in improper English. There are quite a bit of different themes throughout the book. It seems the author was expressing a new theme with about every two chapters or so. Through the descriptions of Mango Street and its people, you notice the main character growing and becoming older. However this book does show character development, I do not recommend it, nor do I prefer it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The House on Mango Street","review":"The House on Mango Street is a book without chapters but small vignettes. The book is about a little girl in the latino section of Chicago where she grows up. The book approached from a plot standpoint is not a great book.

I wish my high school had better taste. I'm a fast reader and it took my 2 days to finish the book because I simply could not read this book in one sitting (and that'sa shame at 110 pages). The book was hard to swallow. All the really short stories were confusing, as if Esperanza had about three thousand mood swings. None of them had any connection unless you count the fact that they revolved aroud the world of the same person. I usually like reading between the lines but doing it in this book is like plulling teeth out. If you like reading between the lines, go read a book like The Thorn Birds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would you read this?","review":"This book is not something you should read if you feel like staying awake.

I thought the book had no plot at all, and it seemed almost unfinished. Esperanza seemed a little immature and too innoncent for a 7th grader that lives in the ghetto of Chicago. Each chapter is an average of 2 pages, and each is a totally different story. I could not follow the plot at all, if there was even a plot. The characters are undeveloped and I didn't find any main theme throughout the book except that Esperanza wants to get out of Mango Street, and she will eventually come back because that's where her home is.

It's just a jumbled up bunch of stories. Also, there are no quotation marks, which makes it rather difficult to understand.

I would recommend this book for people who love to read or people who just want to get an idea of a Hispanic Community in Chicago.Some people may find it confusing but it's not, it's a different style of writing.It's a short read but there are many small messages but you just got to pay close attention to it.Like some say, it's the quantity of the work that counts, it's the quality that really counts.If anyone is interested in poetry or curious about the life of a Hispanic Community then go out and read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful...","review":"The House on Mango Street by Sandra Cisneros is a beautifully written masterpeice.

I recommend it to anyone who doesn't care if a few things aren't gramatically correct, and will wonder and reach for the \\"why?\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The House on Mango Street","review":"The House on Mango Street told the tale of a young Latin girl, Esperanza, growing up in what was like the ghetto of Chicago. Her family was not rich and they did not have much except warm hearts and big dreams. Throughout the story, Esperanza faced many things and the story was ultimately about her growing up and trying to accept her maturity. Most of the time, I enjoyed the story--it was interesting and gave a perspective of life I'm not familiar with, while at the same time I could relate to what she was going through. It was a very unpredictable story which was another plus. I also liked that it wasn't too long-- if it had been dragged out longer it would have been boring. The only thing I didn't like was reading about the way that Esperanza handled some of her situations: it gave me an unsettled feeling, like \\"why would anybody do that?\\" Aside from that, this is a great story that I would recommend mostly to teenagers, girls in particular because you will easily relate."},{"rating":"2","title":"mango street","review":"I actually liked the novel. It is the first book that i've ever finished. I liked how each chapter was completely different.so it never really gor boaring.

It never got my attention. Maybe it was the way that it was written or maybe the contents of the book. There were very few parts of this book that I enjoyed. One part I enjoyed was when Louie's cousin stole a car and all of the kids asked where he got it from and he said, \\"get in.\\" Another part I liked was when she got her first kiss and it wasn't all she thought it was supposed to be. Esperanza said, \\"I waited my whole life. You're a liar.\\" Reading this book was like reading French, another language because it was a girl book. I would recommend this book to a girl, but not to a guy. \\"One day you wake up and they are there,\\" says Esperanza. She was talking about hips, and growing up from a girl to a young woman throughout the whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"My review on the book House On mago street","review":"The House on Mango Street by Sandra Cisneros , was like many poems put together to make a book. At the same time the book was being told by Esperanza the main character. This book was just wonderful. It's not the first nor the second time I have read this book, its been the fourth, I just can't stop reading it. Its wonderful how she tells her life in this book. How her life is in sections and how she succeeds in life with her sister and the people around her. reading this book seems like Sandra Cisneros should of been a poet not a writer, butt he way she combines things is nice. The main reason why I liked this book was because of the way how she combines two languages English and spanish, two great languages. To me after reading this book gave me a differentperpective on why people live the way they do, and that by dreaming things could become reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why I didn't like the book!","review":"I thought the vignettes were disjointed.

The short sonnets allow the reader to stay focussed and interested. It also is written in a creative and intersting way. I do not rate this book a five because it was not so intresting that I couldn't put it down. Just about anyone could relate the novel to their own life experiences and I believe it should be read for all cultures. After reading the novel I now feel that I know Sandra Cisneros as a writer and as a person. My favorite sonnet was \\"Where I Live.\\" Which basiclly talks about her home and neighborhood. Overall the novel was a great learning experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spare yet interesting","review":"I would recommend this book to just about anyone. It's not just about Mexican Americans experiencing the struggle, though the book has Mexican essence. Cisneros displayed the universal struggle for all nationalities to do better and be better than they are now, with a focus on Latin Americans. I loved the line towards the end of the book where Ezperanza is older and says she is \\"tired of looking at what she can't have.\\" Cisneros also did a wonderful job in Esperanza's realization that she didn't have much to brag about. Children don't realize they are poor until they get older,around the time they discover the parents aren't perfect. I look forward to reading more of Cisneros work; her vivid capture of the Latino's world."},{"rating":"1","title":"short shorts with nothing memorable","review":"My women's fiction class reccomended Sandra Cisneros so I figured I'll give it a try. I was highly dissapointed. Her stories are short which some might call short, shorts. That did not bother me but her lack of a beginning, middle and end made it impossible for me to get involved with the characters. For my taste if the stories are going to be a series of short, shorts than I need some insentive to continue reading. Her plots simply lacked interest and her dialoge was written with a ten year old's speach.

Some say it's very deep, which it undoubtedly is, iff the reader has the courage to read between the lines (in an unfortunate addition to the already astoundingly boring printed text), and iff the reader indeed cares about the girl and what she thinks at all (I did not).

Sandra Cisneros gets a bunch of credit for her fantastic writting, when she really needs to take a trip back to 1st grade and learn to put quotation marks in front of sentences that somebody is saying. She needs to indent, and make her vignettes longer than the mostly 2 paragraph long ones the book beholds. I'm only reading this crappy book because I have to, and believe me, it is all a waste of time, and the 11 dollars I paid for it at Barnes & Noble.Believe me, Sandra Cisneros is not the great writter she could be when she wrote this peace of s**t."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Inspired My Inner Whiny Immigrant","review":"Do you whine a lot?

To me, a good author is explaining things with their perspective as WELL as leading you to understand. It also seemed like every sentence was this girl wanting us to pity her for this 'awful' life she had. It was a book of 'pity this, pity that', and 'what a horrible life us hispanics lead'.

In the beginning I wasn't quite sure how I would enjoy this book, but as the discussion grew deeper, my interst in Esperenza grew. I felt her displeasure as she talked about her name, I felt her shyness at school. I could actually picture myself in her shoes.

Children are likelyto follow their parents' footsteps, but they have the choice to where they want to go in life.Sandra is telling usto remember where we came from and never forget.Sandra is also telling us to practice good stewardship so future generations will have a better life.I believe Esperanza's dream is to pack up and leave Mango Street so she can pursue her dreams."},{"rating":"1","title":"This author needs help, or the publisher does.","review":"Sorry to all you obscure people who think this a wonderful book, but this book is definetely not a good book by my standards.

Don't read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting better...","review":"Maybe I just don't like stories written as a series of vignettes. I'm not sure, but I just felt this book was boring and didn't really show me much about the Latin culture as I was expecting. It also was confusing because all the vignettes you weren't sure when took place and who all these people were in them. It needed more background information to make it more understandable. It was almost if the author was putting a bunch of poems together and expecting them to totally make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is what's wrong with our education system","review":"This book represents everything that is wrong with our education system. The liberals who have taken over our universities would rather cram political correctness down the throats of our young and impressionable than give them a solid foundation in composition.To all English professors out there: if you want to get your point across, then do it with a book that teaches what your class is supposed to teach.

The parts about her mother and her going to school are pointless and the only good part about it was the descriptive part. The book and all the hispanic heritage behind just did not do it for me. The only reason I read the stupid book is becuase it was a book we had to read for class.

The book follows her as she grows from a younger child to a maturing young adult. The story is told through a series of vignettes, instead of chapters.I liked this book because it is all about her experiences. It is written to show you what she thinks of the world around her, and the people around her, and also growing up, from her point of view. The book is tough to follow at times, but that is because it is written in the form of a monologue, or diary, and so there is no significantly apparent timeline. Even so, the book is very interesting and portrays very well how this young girl feels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severely Overrated","review":"While the writing here is engrossing and well done at times, it is quite self-indulgent and disconnected, too. I suppose it has been praised so extravagantly because it is written in such an accessible style. However, at times it reads like a poorly done imitation of Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Mangos","review":"The book was o.k. It was a little boring, but what I really liked was the name of the chapters. The rest of the book was not all that interesting. I like a book with action. This book has no type of action whatever. If it had a little of action I would have enjoyed it. The girl in the book has no life. She was telling boring stories about her life. So now I close with saying this is just my opinion not a fact. So you read at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was OK","review":"I finished reading this book about a week ago. Cisneros has quite a flair and I love her writing style. She is very poetic and has good word choice. One thing I did not like about her book was the very short chapters, they were well written and had good ideas, but you wanted to read more about that incident and the chapter was over, And the next chapter would have nothing to do with the prior one. This book would have been much better if it was consistent. I also think that she drew too much pity on to the main charector, who really didn't deserve it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book","review":"The House On Mango Street was the best book I have ever read.

So to coclude my opinion, the book wasn't terriable, it just wasn't my type of book."},{"rating":"2","title":"what i really think","review":"I really did like this book because it tells how mexican life's really are. The author writes well and different because she has chapter names in brief description, tells how the person fells, and gives the run down on everything. The girls name Ezpernza, is like mine in a way, so like that because we sometimes think the same. The way she discribes her dream house sounds like mine. The author really knew what she was writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are we reading this instead of a classic?","review":"The House on Mango Street, by Sandra Cisneros, was one of the most boring books I've ever read. I really didn't like Cisneros' writing style or the way she wrote about life on Mange Street in a series of vignettes. I feel that the book didn't really have a middle, and the ending didn't really end anything, the book just kind of stopped. The reading didn't effect me in any way. The characters are hard for me to relate to. The one part in the book that I do like, however, is the vignette in which the main character, Esperanza, describes how the only thing that she can talk to are the trees. Based on the above opinions, I would not recommend this book to anyone, and ask the question: why are we reading this book instead of a classic?"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The House on Mango Street\\"; an odd, but good book.","review":"The story \\"The House on Mango Street\\" by Sandra Cisneros is an odd, but good book. This book is written in a very different way. It is not written where there are chapters that describe an order of events. Instead this book contains many small chapters, or vignettes, that are a story in their own. They describe one subject and then the next chapter is something different. This confuses you a little, but by the end of the story everything starts fitting together. This makes it a very good book. While a person reads it they might get a little confused and not like the story, but by the end the reader will understand everything and will love this book.Fodor"},{"rating":"1","title":"House on Mango Street","review":"On a crowded little street in Chicago lives Esperanza, an extremely young Latino girl who has been growing up in a very bad neighborhood all her life.

He has special needs and we were unprepared for some of the chapters. While I understand that children need to be exposed to different cultures, enviroments, etc., I feel that there are many other books that could have done this better. There are chapters concerning domestic abuse, child abuse, male dominance, and molestation. To a special needs child, these can overshadow the intended theme of \\"hope\\", \\"loss of innocence\\" and \\"survival\\". This is not the type of book I would choose willingly for my child.

It is the Latin neighborhood on Mango St. where the character Esperenza finally moves to with her family after several apartments all over the city. Each vignette deals with a person on the block and their unique story to tell. The stories themselves can be confusing at times can leave the reader perplexed. There is no indication during the book that the story will change. They are brief and to the point which is good in a way. Growing up in Chicago I can relate to some of this story. If someone who is from a rural setting reads this book they might miss the point about life in the big city."},{"rating":"1","title":"The House on Mango Street","review":"I am a freshman going into high school, and this was one of the books for our summer reading.

I really wonder why. It was poorly written, first of all. The little mini-chapters leave you confused. I expected this to be a sort of fictional account of this girls life as told by her. Instead, I am reading 2 page short stories that sometimes make no sense. Many of these stories have really no relation to any storyline whatsoever. I can see that this book was written to inspire, but it really left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I am usually an avid reader. I read at least 40 pages a day, usually more. Yet this 110 page mini-novel was so terrible that I had trouble reading 10 a day. I literally had to force myself to bucke down and read this thing. It ended up taking me more than a week to read 110 measley pages that I expected to finish in 2 days. In closing, of all the books I've read this summer (I am reading Clan of the Cave Bear now, and even that is better than this), this is the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dull reading","review":"This book was not by any means inspirational. The style of writing was unorganized and hard to follow. The theme of a Hispanic girl trying to find her way in a place where it was hard to succeed could have been very good if not for the author's feel sorry for me theme rather then an inspirational story.The poems and collections of stories go nowhere. The book hardly kept me going and if I would have stopped after the first ten pages I would not have felt I missed anything. A good book grabs the reader's attention, but this book simply made me bored and impatient.Due to the lack of excitement and inspiration I found the book to be more negative then positive.

Cisneros did give us a good sub-story filled with a deeper meaning to the world around the main character Esperanza, but the theme itself, and the main story taking place, were quite poor to me. In some ways, I do not think this book appeals to the style of books that I enjoy, such as Anne Rice, or Piers Anthony, filled with a deeper writing and passages the role off your tongue like an ongoing poem of sweet music lined with sadness. For big \\"Fantasy-only\\" fans such as myself, I would not recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stories of Innocence Lost","review":"As you weave your way through the web of this book you will find many themes that all seem to be woven into one...and that one them is brutal loss of innocence.

All of the different vigenettes have nothing to do with each other. If you really want to understand the book you need to keep a notebook next to you to keep track of everything.

I hope you take my advice and not pick up this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Review","review":"I thought that this book was not that great as all the reviews say.

I'd say that if your looking for a good read, pick up a book by Crichton or Bakker,this book was a neat idea, but could've been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Digging Deeper","review":"Sandra Cisneros uses the character Esperanza to depict the hardships of minority women living in Chicago. Cisneros tries to put you in the many shoes of Esperanza as she grows up and faces more and more of the reality of coming of age.

But it wasn't the best or one of the best books I've read, I tend to like Stephen King and horror stories better.

Yes, it is written from a child's point of view of what is happening around them and to them but is really a sleeper.

It was an assignment, so I didn't willingly put myself through the torture of reading it. My whole perception of the story is that Sandra Cisneros was trying to create a book that was original and that would glorify her career...I thought that the overly-metaphorical style was terrible and did not suite her well. I have a clear recollection of reading a, \\"fight scene,\\" and laughing out loud when the children are sparring, \\"You're like cold frijoles,\\" \\"You're like bare feet in september.\\" Please.I hated the book...but I sure did get many compliments on the parody I wrote."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't make much sense to me","review":"I borrowed this book from the library expecting it to be a good read, considering the fact that so many people found it unique and everything. But I found it a little bit too unique; I didn't really understand anything. Each chapter was really short and was about something completely different from the others, and it was just confusing to me.

Esperanza's family didn't always live on Mango Street, her family moved around a lot which was kind of the main problem in the book. Her mom and dad always wanted to own a big house with two bathrooms and real stairs but what they got was nothing like what they imagined. Esperanza was embarrassed of her house and acted very childish however later on in the book as she grows older she gets mature and learns to understand her family more. I didn't really like the book because it was really hard to understand and many characters where just being \\"thrown\\" in the story.Claudia H."},{"rating":"1","title":"House on Mango Street","review":"What a disappointing selection for California's required Hispanic reading! This book is disjointed and written in such a juvenile manner that I thought originally throught it was just a very poor translation from the Spanish. While the concept is somewhat interesting, a Hispanic community in Chicago is harder for Californians to identify with. Why not a book about the Hispanic community ALL over Calfornia? More than the location though, I had trouble with the dull, repetitive tone of the book. What a snoozer!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"House on Mango Street","review":"The House on Mango Street follows the coming of age of young Esperanza through a series of vingettes.Though some consider it the newest in great literature, I disagree. It is fairly off the wall and is not to be compared to the likes of Charles Dickens and Mark Twain. The lack of quotaion marks throughout the novel left me wondering if the author had graduated from grammar school. Another annoying feature of this book is that it has no continuity. The story simply jumps from place to place with no warning and is garranteed to give the reader whiplash. Call me old fashion, but I would prefer Oliver Twist to this novel any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revulsion","review":"The popularity of this book perfectly represents the apex of a society whose only real values are the desire to include minority writers i.e diversity over quality. As a moron before said that in this book you need to read between the lined, it is impossible to read between the lines in this book which is essentialy a novel for the telvision age. A series of vignettes connected by nothing except schools' desire to buy a book by a minority author. In fact this literary window shopping is just another form of racism. Because the publishers of the book are simply adopting any Hispanic writer. This bias demeans the excellent Hispanic writers such as Lorca, Marquez and Cervantes. As an educated person, I deeply object to this broad prejudice against minorities."},{"rating":"2","title":"The House on Mango Street","review":"This surprising debut by Sandra Cisneros grabs you by the hand, and takes you back to your own childhood full of friends, fears, and fights. Through all of these obstacles, we watch Esperanza's desperate attempts to find the meaning of her life using different friends to identify herself with. She does all this, only to come back to where she had started, back to feeling like a lost and lonely child.Each distinct character brought to life on Mango Street displays a common struggle of Mexican Americans in that day as Esperanza observed them. She shares their feeling of being weighted down to that small, insignificant street, and is always thinking of ways to get away. She knows she has to make it out through, and with that same drive she resolves her inner struggles. Finally, Esperanza realizes that she must not forget her life on Mango Street, no matter how much she would like to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"The House on Mango Street is one of the best books I have read this year!

I had to read this for English class, and since it is about a Spanish girl (and I am part Spanish myself), I thought it would be fascinating.It wasn't.This book is composed of totally unrelated vignettes that have no sense. It is like the author starts out a chapter, then just goes off on a tangent. One chapter is about her name. Another is about hips. This book has no plot whatsoever and is very depressing. Esperanza pays people to be her friends and hates the house she lives in.

I seriously recommend reading ANYTHING but this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The House On Mango Street","review":"Honestly, I didnt really like this book. The book didnt keep me interestedand it didnt give a real message such as A Child Called It. In a child called it every thing was explained in detail what happened through out his life was brought up in great detail, but in The House On Mango Street nothing was explained in detail. The one good part of the book was at the end when the last part of the book referred back to the beginning. It concluded the book well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too...Hard...too...Follow","review":"In this book of vignettes, Sandra Cisneros takes you through the poverty and troubles of growing up in a Hispanic-American section of Chicago. She will introduce you to the life of Esperanza. You will venture from her childhood and up until she becomes an adult.In The House on Mango Street, you will be confused throughout a lot of the book. You will have to reread parts of the book to understand what point Cisneros may be trying to get across. If you get this book, you might have to read the book two to three times to fully understand it.An example of a part you might get confused at is when Esperanza compares herself to a red balloon tied down. Another example is when Esperanza compares her family to four skinny trees. Where she is tied down by her roots.All in all, this book isn't for the simple minded. The main reason being is it will make you think! It would have been a more enjoyable book if it was not so hard to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"The House on Mango Street","review":"I read The House on Mango Street. It was alright. It was kind of boring and didn't keep my interest very well. It was somewhat confusing at times because the author does not use quotes and it is hard to tell when someone is talking or thinking.

Again, I think this book was okay but I would not really recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twee","review":"Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, when asked what he thought of Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, is rumored to have responded \\"Subtle.\\" The description might be more reasonably applied to Cisneros' The House on Mango Street, which is a damn sight too subtle in my opinion. It is, as the previous review pedantically states, a series of vignettes. However, unless one is easily seduced by breathless prose and the kind of poetic resonance that is believed to swirl around descriptions which rely almost wholly on the reader attaching her own range of implications about character and setting to a few pedestrian facts, look elsewhere. For self-indulgence and wilful naivete, take Cisneros; for virtuoso writing combined with the excitement of plot and the interest of psychology look to Martin Amis or Michael Chabon."},{"rating":"1","title":"required reading for last summer - daughter didn't like it","review":"My Daughter is an avid reader, but she didn't like this one much.

Sandra Cisneros did a wonderful job in bringing Esperanza's story to life, but she did it in a way that was not very catching. The reason for me saying this is because Sandra has Esperanza tell her life story, but she breaks it up into sections that don't let the story go with its natural flow. For example, I was wondering why Esperanza went from talking about her house on Mango Street, to talking about the different hairstyles that her family has, and then to why her brothers would not talk to her sister and her. Sandra did this through the whole book, and I felt that this was not a great way to express the tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review through the eyes of me.","review":"I am a high school student, and an assignment I had was to read \\"The House on Mango Street\\". Our teacher had given us some print outs of reviews of this book. The reviews she gave us all had just about the same story: The author of the review wasn't looking foward to reading it, but after reading it, he/she had thouroughly enjoyed it. That got my hopes up for the book. I thought that maybe since the reviewers had enjoyed it, that maybe I could too. I am not much of a book reader, so maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it as much as I had expected. I do agree that the chapters were short and easy to read, but at some points I just couldn't follow along. There were a lot of different characters in the book, and since the chapters didn't go together in anyway, it got quite confusing. I think that if I would have gotten to read the book on my own time, and without all the worksheets, I would have been more satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"The House that had love","review":"I was not a big fan of the book, but I did like some parts. The thing is that the book does not have a flow to it. The book just has short stories. This I did not like. It made me feel like I was a kid.The book was choppy. The vignettes were not a good thing. The vignettes made the book seem boring. The book never really went in great detail about the year or how old she was in each of the vignettes. The book was good in some points. One is the stories did show the truth of the life in a poor neiborhood.

This is definitely an adult's book or a book for a young person who loves poetry. I think this book is perfect if you love language and you love the idea of interwoven yet scattered stories in a small neighborhood. These are lovely vignettes of life and friends and family, and while there are some connecting themes in the book, it doesn't follow a chronology or plot per se, just emotions. She's really a terrific writer and I keep hoping, if she hasn't already, that she will write something plot-driven, because I think it will be superb. The stories in The House on Mango Street are moving. If you liked The Color Purple or if you're a fan of Diane Ackerman or Marge Percy, then I think this might be a worthwhile read for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The House on Mango Street","review":"The House on Mango Street written by Sandra Cisneres in her younger days is a wonderful set of Vignettes.

She is stuck on Mango Street and is anchored down by her family and her gender. In the end, she does alright but she never forgets the small red house on that street she grew up on.This book will always be on my bookshelf and should be on yours.

Just like with office-style rubber bands they do degrade and eventually snap, so you have to buy replacements occasionally. However, I had my previous one for several years, so it's not an excessively frequent purchase. The Cando loop seems just the tiniest bit large; I'm pretty tall (5'10\\") with longish legs and when I do squats with it around my ankles it would ideally be a bit more taut. However, it certainly gets the job done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Resistance is too weak","review":"I am really disappointed in this band.

I recall seeing Corsair carrier footage while they were documenting the battle of Midway? The CD set isn't a total loss, as the information is very well put together, but they fell short on the editing, the footage, and the background music for sure.It is obvious that they spent a long time putting this together - I hope that they update the CD set and make it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crushing f*cking album","review":"Alright, everybody knows Howard went to Killswitch Engageto replace the excellent Jesse Leach.

I proceed to be bombarded by a barrage of mathy technical atrocity that to my pleasent surprise acutally carries it's weight instead of falling prey to those played out techniques I hear somthering the popular metal. This is full fledged Techinal Metal by definition, and it's visceral precision is jaw dropping at times. The only reason this album is short five stars is becuase of the god awful vocals, even this guys scream is untolerable, luckily some real musicains back him up.

This song makes me feel sooo good, really warm, cosy and positive. I'd say the sound is closer to Evanescence than any others, but with a more mature, original edge. Epic.

Personal, familial, and even community-wide shame is borne upon our protagonist's shoulders. Watching him achingly let these things roll off of his shoulders is one of the joys in this book. The second is the joy in discovering another person who will always be beautiful, riding her bike in front of Gilbert's old rusty second-hand truck.I would recommend this book to anyone who would care to give their life (or any other in that case) a closer look and appreciate the best of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Real","review":"I saw this movie about 5 times before I read the book.

All in all, I liked the book better and I strongly recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging","review":"I was thoroughly engaged with this book! It captured my attention right from the start and that same connection continued until the end. The author has a clever way of combining sadness, humor, joy and hurtfulness into his situations and characters. His characters are rich and well developed although their relationships with each other are often odd and uncomfortable. Perhaps that's one reason that makes the book so engaging. For a dull mid-Western town, Peter Hedges knows how to craft a fascinating tale of complex relationships which puzzle and satisfy the reader simultaneously."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Books I've ever Read","review":"Hands down and by far.

She walks at least 3-6 blocks away and the clarity is very good. My only complaint is that it's still difficult to understand the other person. The reception is great but it's almost like either the microphone inside the unit or the speaker inside are cheap and unable to reproduce the sound quality I'd like.

I saw the last tour and the acoustic set was one of the highlights. The guys should consider rearranging many of their classics in this format and taking this on tour.

It is useful as a general history of the chain, especially the family connections. However, it is not an objective or balanced work. It reads, especially in the portions covering the last 20 or so years, like a piece written by the PR department. No negative views are presented, though I know many current and former Walgreens' employees who would beg to differ when it comes to working conditions and pharmacy professionalism. I will use some of the material in my History of Pharmacy class when I discuss the rise of the chain stores, and the various approaches taken towards this goal, and for that, this is a decent resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing really new","review":"I guess if you don't work for Walgreens there would be some interesting anecdotes in this book for you to read. It looks to me like the author took the \\"Daily Dose of Dave\\"s and edited them all together in book format. If you've work for the company for a few years then you've probably read a lot of the stuff here already through Mr Jorndt's weekly bulletins. It's more a biography of Charles Walgreen than a look into the company. I would find someone else who owns it and ask to borrow their copy rather than buy it. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I seriously couldn't put this book down. It was a fun, easy read. I thought that the grammer was distracting, but overall I enjoyed the book.. The author was my Macro Econ teacher!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad, not bad","review":"eh, its pretty good. I was very impressed with the samples on the site, and I love Radiohead with an undying passion, so I got it. The only problem is that it gets old after a while. Or at least it did for me. And he did a few things that I didn't like, such as mess around with let down to make it sound stupid. And theres one chord too many in airbag so it ends badly. Otherwise, the guy is an amazing pianist and the cd's good. I still say you should definately get it if your a diehard radiohead fan, but if your just a lukewarm fan, dont get it unless your really into piano. I guess also get it if you're one of those panzies that likes the music but can't deal with \\"Thom's voice\\" and \\"all the angst\\" blah blah blah. Or you could get over it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...","review":"Yes, I do love Radiohead, in a spectrum slightly less than the one in which i praise Jeff Tweedy. I also have some talent at piano stuck in my head and heart somewhere. Considering these things, and the fact that I love it, I REALLY love this album. It's like listening to YHF (Wilco) for the first time, because it taps into me somehow. Please find out if it taps into you, it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Essential Album for Radiohead Fanatics","review":"Whether you are a hardcore Radiohead fan or simply a lover of classical piano, this album is an essential addition to your CD collection. O'Riley's sound is a classical reflection of Radiohead's alternative soul, and captures the true essence of their musical style.I have been myself a fan of Radiohead with an equal amount of adoration for classical music, and this album is truly one that quenches my thirst for both genres. It is harmoniously fulfilling to experience the occassional consonance and edginess of Radiohead's alternative style blended with O'Riley's talent as a classical pianist. It is difficult to pinpoint any one track on this album that can be considered the best, because literally every song is worth savoring.True Love Waits is quite the musical inspiration for both classical connoisseur and alternative aficionado alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"insulting","review":"This must be what getting slapped in the face, repeatedly, feels like. All the bombard and noises add up to one disappointing result: I find myself secretly wishing this guy would stop. Perhaps Radiohead would sue the living crap out of this 'pianist' .... and I use the term pianist very loosely here..... for ruining their exellent music. Really, listening to this stuff is like watching someone drawing a moustache on Mona Lisa."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"Easy-listening Radiohead for your ma&pop. Fans of the rock group will be disappointed by the album's smoothness and sameness, which bring to mind everything from Andrew Lloyd Webber to new-age muzak. Pianist Brad Mehldau brought an infinitely greater imagination, edginess, and individuality to his Radiohead transcriptions. O'Riley's are highly literal covers and leave one to wonder, what's the point of this exercise? After a few songs, his methods become predictable and the listener loses interest after all the banging and mushy note clusters that he employs song after song... All in all, this CD is a tedious listen that doesn't stand up as interesting music, whether \\"classical\\" or \\"pop\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing the main ingredient","review":"Radiohead has a sensibility that is totally absent from any of this music recorded by the earnest O'Riley. Naturally there arethose who can appreciate this cd based solely on its pianistic values, but one is forced to listen to the music by trying to forget that it is 'Radiohead' music. Sort of like playing a Bartok piano work in the style of Chopin: It might sound fine asChopin, but not as Bartok. Radiohead's music works as a total sound, sensibility and lyrical package, not simply as melodies alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great in theory. Doesn't work in practice","review":"We might admire a noble tribute to one of the great rock groups of our age, but Radiohead's sound simply can't be expressed by a solo piano. The best part of Radiohead's music is the tone established with novel textures, electronic sounds, and production techniques. The vagueness and pliability of these nontraditional instruments can express complicated rhythms and dissonance with a haunting tone that's relevant to the digital world. The piano conveys a classical, natural tone and produces discrete notes which overemphasize all the subtleties. Where Thom's slurred lyrics flow and swagger through the melodies and, O'Riley's piano marches and plonks.Though this CD does offer the listener a different interpretation of the music, most of the quality is lost in the translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great!","review":"If you are needing significant humidity.

He was tired of writing melodramatic, chauvinist, manipulative, and overly-sentimental plays. PETER PAN was brilliant and revolutionary because it was fantastic, escapist and playful. Unfortunately this film is almost EXACTLY what Barrie deplored! It is melodramatic, predictable, chauvinist, and maudlin. The acting is quite good, but Depp has done similiar work far too many times. He is a terrific actor but he should explore new territory.One scene does stand out: the creation of PETER PAN on stage. The audience's reaction tells all: they are either astounded, reviled, but never unmoved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paid $30 for a car commercial","review":"I gave this DVD a 1 star rating because of the abomination of being forced to watch a commercial on a disc for which I paid a lot of money.

It's not an epic story- it's a very intimate one. The movie's not clever or snappy or dangerous. It's personal in scope, and it offers thousands of shades of gray in what ultimately becomes a sympathetic and close examination of some of the more tender sides of the human spirit. Many films out there attest to the power of imagination, but this one shows-vividly-how incredibly poignant, colorful, and vivid the mind of the truly imaginative can be.There are characters and plot points that are predictable, but the movie more than makes up for that by showering you in goosebumps. We've all seen versions of the theme before, but this one is a whimsical, gently rendered affirmation of its central message: \\"Believe in magic; it's good for you.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I would buy from these guys again","review":"I have had a couple misfires over the years ordering movies online because you just never know, as the saying goes, but my DVD arrived early and in great condition - I would buy from these guys again:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"chaosprincess","review":"I left the theatre in tears, it was such a beautiful film that captures the mind and the spirit of make believe.

Barrie seems to have found Never Land and considers his mission in life is to guide others to this magical place. It appears to be less of a biography than a kind of road map to what many would consider to be a fantasy world.It would be nice to find a refuge from our corporeal world, where we can live out fantasies and reconnect with those who have departed.

Finding Neverland is just full of heartwarming moments, cute little kids with British accents, and a love story that works without any sex at all (and probably because of it).

It ate two hours of my life, cost me almost $9.00, and left me angry for having listened to the pinheads who recommended this drivel.Johnny Depp, in one of his worst film roles, mumbled his way through this exercise in tedium. I've enjoyed Mr. Depp in other roles, but the material here was lacking in, oh, maybe EVERYTHING necessary to be interesting. The movie plodded along and I mentally checked out after 20 minutes. Had I not been there with a friend, I would've left.The less said about this borefest, the better, but if you have any questions about what I thought of this waste of film, please re-read my first sentence.

Depp is consistently amazing and should be recognized for it. However, \\"Finding Neverland\\" is a pretentious waste of a film and the only thing that shines in it is the acting. Kate Winslet is good as the mother and so are the young male actors. The problem with this movie is it never gets off the ground. Believe me, I do not have a problem with movies that are slow, but this one never caught my interst.When I it was over, I did not really feel I watched a movie but more a blabber of sorts.

The music score is soppy and cliched, and the whole thing is shot like a Hallmark holiday TV special. A good idea for a movie that telegraphs its eventual resolutions about 20 minutes into the film; after that there's little point in watching. I kept waiting for some twist, some insight into their conditions, some surprise, but got none.

Blechity Blechity Blech! Those were the words that came out of my mouth when I left the theater. What kind of total garbage is this? Johnny Depp should stick to Tim burton films and Kate Winslet should stick to indie films. And besides, all the 'believe in Neverland' like Peter Pan is Jesus is horrible childish fantasy. And Kate's scene with the forest/pixie land just MAGICALLY APPEARING in her room is garbage. Pure, utter garbage. Kate Winslet, normally a talented actress who starred in some of my favorite movies ever like Eternal Sunshine and Titanic, shows her lemony side. Johnny Depp, a talented actor who does a great job in movies like Edward Scissorhands and Secret Window, stinks out loud. And don't even get me started on the little Brit kid who goes \\"But I didn't even finish my play\\"!, while his mother is having a violent cough attack. I'm sorry, Mr Depp and Mrs. Winslet, but 'Finding NeverLand' is NOT my idea of a grand old time at the movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Johnny does it again and Kate is perfect!

I wish I had words for it. Everything from the imagery to the acting to the overall everlasting, practical idealism just leaves you with a feeling of having a bird trapped in your chest, which can only be released by either laughing or crying. Everyone could use a dose of imagination in their life, even if it's just imagining the person standing next to you at the bus stop breaking out into a tap dance.I highly recommend this movie; as soon as it comes out nationwide, I'll be seeing it again. And as soon as it's on DVD, I'll be first in line to buy it. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding Neverland","review":"This is a terrific movie,\\"a Find\\"...It's a movie filled with a combination of humor,love,& sadness based upon real events!!!(The creation of Peter Pan.)It will be part of your permanent library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and Much More","review":"I was very touched by this film.

It is truly a beautiful movie, probably one of Johnny Dep's best. The portrayal of Barrie's journey to develop Peter Pan makes for an interesting and thoroughly touching story, even if it does occasionally wander into melodrama. Fans of Kate Winslet will enjoy her wonderful performance as Carrie's muse and Hoffman's role, though small, is hilarious. The movie basically plays up on the relationship he develops with 4 boys who play sons of Kate Winslett. They become his inspiration for writing Peter Pan. Even having said that, it can't begin to discribe how moving and touching the entire movie plays out. Johnny Dep brings out the kid in all of us. The movie has the perfect balance of humor and sadness"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece!","review":"\\"Finding Neverland\\" is a very enchanting, emotional, and fantastic movie. I laughed.

His feet are die-cast, and his plastic is durable and heavy. One thing the images don't show you is the fact that his cassette deck area is expanded so he can hold two cassettes. He comes with Ravage and Laserbeak. Some parts of the figure have chrome, which is awesome. He is a bit pricey, and now that I have him, I wish he cost less, because fifty dollars for this is a bit too much.

He was always one of my favorites, and is now one of his. He is only 4 years old, and the gen1 transformers are 100% easier for him to transform by hisself, whereas me and his mom battle with the current versions.... I'll stick to getting the gen1 transformers as he enjoys being able to transform the characters by himself and being able to relate to the cartoons more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soundwave Returns.","review":"This is a reissue I can't refuse. It is a repaint of Soundblaster (so he can hold two tapes instead of one). The batteries turn into weapons (although the gun can't shoot). He comes with Ravage and Laserbeak. If you put Ravage through a red glass item, he has the weak spots to Fortress Maximus (what the orignial Soundblaster had on Buzzsaw). He is a very nice figure and was my first Soundwave. Overall rating 10-10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long time favorite","review":"This book is incredibly interesting in that it deals with the changes (and curveballs) that life throws at people. It follows the journey that happens day in and day to real people. People don't always understand themselves let alone those around them which is a lot of the story here. (yes, I'm a counselor. sorry for sounding analytical) The characters behaviors stayed true to themselves as well which is harder and harder to find these days. The fact that its written by a male and female is evident and I believe is exactly what adds the realism and richness to the story. They are very likable people going through changes that they didn't expect to have to face.One of the reviewers gives a very surface look which doesn't take into account how true to form the characters are behaving. This is a book I keep in my library and have read many times. Well worth getting hold of a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I'm sorry to say I didn't care for this book. I kept reading it in the hopes that it would become better but no such luck. I didn't feel the main characters showed that undying love that we as romance readers love. In a way I was disappointed in the end because of everything that happened thru out the book seemed to be forgotten in the end. The whole story seemed to be about a mid-life crisis and its affect on the family. For those who aren't looking for a fairy tale romance this is the book for you, it definitely doesn't have a main male character you would hope of finding for your life mate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader in pa.","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

By the last track, I was extremely disappointed. It's a bit deeper than just surface-level similarities - in my opinion, this book covers about 5 \\"themes\\", expanded into about 30 \\"songs\\". In fact, you could probably learn the 5 themes and just improvise around the themes to get the same net effect.If you are looking to learn a banjo playing style AND some memorable songs, this might not be your best bet - this book doesn't quite deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upstart Mexican group","review":"I was somewhat anxious to hear this cd and for the most part I am quite satisfied with the material. I had never heard of this band, they were not promoted at all well. I first heard the song \\"Medias Negras\\" about a year ago on the radio without knowing who sang it. I had to search for it on the internet. \\"Medias Negras\\" is a really good song, it has very nostalgic feel, sort of like a story that you keep to yourself for years and then forget it altogether for more years, then it suddenly comes to mind and you treasure its memory. Some other good songs include \\"De rodillas te pido\\" (a very popular song, this is one of many covers), \\"Tu naciste para mi\\", \\"Casita de adobe\\", and \\"Nacimos para amarnos\\".

The new formula sucks. I had an awful night of sleep. It did almost nothing for my cough (I was still up coughing), I felt congested and had sweats/chills. It did not have that nice warm soothing feeling going down my throat and it did not \\"knock me out\\". The \\"old\\" NyQuil would have helped me sleep.

It is hardly even worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"actually, no stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"a very poorly constructed film, specifically plot-wise. like a previous reviewer stated, it's a \\"risky business\\" rip-off. The characters are not believeable, even loathsome and arrogant, especially the young boy who falls for this girl next door. The kicker is that the actual \\"girl\\" in girl next door serves no real purpose, she could have been just a cut out poster of some talent-less actress/model babe, well, maybe she was...this is not worth buying, it's a sad retelling of Hollywood nonsense, basically saying that the love of a young male can curb the damged self esteem of a young girl who has made some adult films. I mean, we never learn WHY she did porn, WHY she is this person who she is, actually, we learn little about who she is as a person. a very flimsy film, do not rent, buy, or speak its name, tis pure evil."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS FILM IS FOR VIRGINS.

IT just spirals down into the oblivion of bad comedys and this is one of the worst of 2004. Who would of guessed Timothy Olyphant (GO, A Man Apart) and James Remar (Drugstore Cowboy, 48HRS.) in this movie? I certainly didnt until the 2 showed up on screen.

Whether you identify with Matthew, as he gets a surprise view through the bedroom window of the gorgeous new girl next door, or if you like Danielle's attraction to a nice boy who needs to loosen up, you'll enjoy the people in this story.This movie works for the same reason that Romeo and Juliet works--you know eactly what each character is feeling. If you've ever been in love, or even just in lust, you can identify with what they're going through, and you can't wait to see how the story is going to turn out.If you've been in love, you'll love these characters--you'll remember your own experience with the guy or girl next door."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every dorks dream","review":"Ok so mabey this isnt the most realistic movie ever.

Offers a handful of PG-13 soft-core scenes (yes, even on the unrated dvd) designed to titillate teenage boys, but the other 90% of the movie fails to tie them together. Who ever thought characters could be SO unlikable and undeveloped? Seth Bullock's performance as the caricature [person] is easily the best thing about it. That, and seeing Elisha Cuthbert in a role she's more believable in than the counter-terror intelligence analyst on Fox's \\"24\\".

By the film's end, the situations are so unbelievable that the film is really laughable.Watch it if you run to it on TV or let a friend rent it. But I wouldn't go out and buy this one.

And seeing as how I truly love movies I wouldn't want you to waste yours on a bad one. Chris Marquette (Freddy Vs.

This album is not like WWW.COM, Doubelievengod, or any of their classics; Which should be a good thing, because all NATAS CDs are different and great in their own way. But this CD only has ONE track with Mastamind. Yes, you read correctly, ONE!!!! He raps a decently sub-par third verse on the title track. This is basically a TNT and Esham album. And also, what the HELL was Esham thinking when he did a Metallica \\"Enter Sandman\\" ripoff track featuring SYN in the chorus?!?!?!? The drum loop sounds exactly like the drums in Run DMC's cover of \\"Walk This Way\\". This is disgusting. I am very dissapointed.

Some insanely fast and complex riffing here from the masters themselves, Eric Rutan of Morbid Angel, and Doug Cerrito of the now disbanded Suffocation. The drummer, Tim Yeung Iv'e never heard of and I don't think anyone has but he definately has skills! Sometimes the drums are so fast that their hard to hear! The bassist is great too, and he contributes some high pitched black metal style screams also. This isn't for people who like slow death metal like Six feet Under*cough* or Entombed. This is for the Dying Fetus, Nile, Cryptopsy, Immolation, and Goatwhore fans.

The narrator is dull. The score is irritating. Most of the time, the narration has nothing to do with the visuals. It's like trying to listen to a discussion on the solar system while watching a video about the process of photosynthesis. And they just keep looping the same footage over and over again. In one particularly distracting part, they were discussing some tactical fighting by the Germans, while showing footage of factory workers. It literally made no sense.

What arrived were just green olives, raw, green, uncured, green olives. Also, about five pounds and no liquid, after I poured the olives into a large jar, there was about one inch of liquid. the rest of the olives were not all that good. Not good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Hesitate","review":"I opened the first bag ordered and received today, wondering how they could be as good as I'd anticipated. Well, they are. The 5 pounds is the drained weight and they are fresh, firm, tasty and not too salty. There is a minimal amount of liquid, and I've not seen any that are mushy. I separated the olives into jars for three and put the remaining half (yes that's right, half) into a FoodSaver medium sized cannister and vacuum sealed that one. I gave two of the jars away and received great thanks and praise for this thrifty online purchase of high quality olives. The spices are minimal, which was a concern of mine. Can't wait to receive the Antipasto Olives next week for comparison. I'd definitely buy these again and serve them to any person who loves olives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rating and a rant","review":"This was a great deal! The amount of olives seems overwhelming at first glance but quickly dwindles after some divvying up with friends and a few parties. One of the varieties of olive did become mushy upon refrigeration but the others held their firmness. Now, I myself can't purchase them again because Amazon has declined to ship groceries to Alaska any longer. I really cant fathom why some companies choose to treat both Alaska & Hawaii as though we are located on another planet. If you are shipping from the west coast, it is the same amount to ship to either Alaska or the east coast. How 'bout cutting off New jersey's olive supply?

It isn't slim but you can minimize the bulk by rotating 3 months of your planner at a time. I use the two day planner sets. You can also add full letter size documents if you use a standard hole puncher. It also has a nice expanding pouch for letter size documents inside the front cover.Well worth the price from what I've seen in the stores.

The rings inside don't line up properly and each time the portfolio is opened the paper pages tear free.4. The picture makes it look like there are two zippers (preffered) but there is only one (bad idea).5. The included calendar has no numbers, dates or holidays shown. It's a \\"fill in the blanks yourself\\" kind of calendar.6. The filler paper that comes with the portfolio is unuseable. It has the toughness of toilet paper and you will have to buy a replacement.I got this Day Timer for Christmas and started using it in early May. It's now June 1st and I am looking for a replacement.

The opening track is probably the best of both CD's and is a superb build up for higher energy. Unfortunately this energy never fully shows up. The second CD has little or nothing to write home about, while CD 1 does contain some satisfying bass lines and vocal tracks (Tracks 7 & 11).

I have used it in its lowest configuration for macro flower shots to its fully extended set up. I have not tried it fully extended (with the extension tube) with the 70-300 lens, but is works great with the 40-150 and 14-42 kit zoom lenses. With the 70-300 lens I keep the extension tube down.I also purchased the Manfrotto 323 R62 Rapid Connect Adapter for use on this tripod.

As the previous review stated, Release is great. However, this show pales in comparison to Osaka the next night, even with a superior setlist. I have 15 bootlegs from the fanclub on this tour, Tokyo and Osaka being two of them. I think that casual fans can enjoy this show, but Pearl Jam fans who don't already have a bunch of the bootlegs may want to wait for the behemoth that is State College...34 songs, tons of improvs, over 3 hours...I would NOT recommend that one to the casual fan, simply too much to digest.So in short, the casual fan will do fine by this show, the non-fanatical Pearl Jam fan should wait. The fanatical Pearl Jam fan already has it :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid show with a great set list","review":"Dude, this show was solid.

I really enjoyed 'Portofino' and 'Saving Grandma', but this book did not work for me. It is set in the period between the two earlier books, but appears to cover much of the same material as 'Saving Grandma', which I'm sure would make no sense after reading this. There are no significant new characters and Calvin's adventures are covered rather superficially. There seemed to be a lot more religious content to this book than the previous two, which I found rather distracting and did not enhance my enjoyment. The style is the same as the other two books, and if you liked those you will probably enjoy this, but just don't expect too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too basic","review":"This book is almost too basic.

Songs like \\"Shake Dat Jelly\\" and \\"F*ck That Sh*t\\" should have been scrapped long before the CD was printed. \\"Like A Pimp Remix\\" doesn't even come close to representing the UGK classic like it should.

The funny thing is, even though they changed their style and line up, they still never really broke into the TRL mainstream (most artists on TRL are crap anyway, so they would fit in perfectly).If you buy this album, you are supporting some terrible artists (if you can call them that) that are only making music for profit.

For the most part (with one, possibly two exceptions) - none of the previous offerings have caught my attention as much as this one. In my opinion, his best effort since the Blow by Blow/Wired days. Each track is different, refreshing and highlights his mastery of the guitar. While others of his generation rest on their laurels - JB still walks on the edge and the creativity shows. You should enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing indeed","review":"I have been a Jeff beck fan for over 20 years and really enjoy his music. However this latest album just is not for me. The music style has changed into something more like my sixteen year old son listens to - lots of noise and little in the way of music. And the vocals on some tracks don't add anything either.Listen to it if you can before buying and hoepfully you will avoid being really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Just got my copy of \\"Jeff\\" this morning. Had a few listens.... first impression.... too samey. Most of the tracks sound too unstructured as if JB has just been cut and pasted into tracks. His guitar tone has been better, most of this sounds like a Line 6 POD (I think some of it is) with some samples and kit thrown in... can't hear much bass. No real stand out tracks.I think YHIC was miles better, also had more musicians on it. I really like electronic music but don't see this as groundbreaking. Too many vocal samples used to try and spice up things.A thing that is starting to show in the compositions is there are not a lot of real arrangements with key changes etc... just grooves in one key.I know some of you guys are going to rip me to shreds for all this but this is my own opinion. I still think JB is an amazing performer live but needs more clear defined ideas/melodies in the studio.Dissapointing"},{"rating":"2","title":"A W E S O M E","review":"All I knew about Jeff Beck before this album was one song I heard on the radio.This guy is awesome! He ranks up there probably above Joe Satriani!Sometimes he is a little \\"hard\\" for my taste but his virtuosity is astounding.

I've read all these Amazon comments about Beck going techno with this album, and after listening to it more than a few times, it seems like this is the kind of record that Jimi Hendrix would be happy to make if he were still alive. Jeff Beck is consistently out on the bleeding edge, making new music and coaxing wild new sounds from his guitar, and I hope he continues to push the boundaries for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put on your seat belt !!!!","review":"Contrary to previous reviews I think this may be Jeff's best album yet. The groves are intense (very Prince like) and the guitar licks show why Jeff is the standard by which all others are judged.

WOW!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential.","review":"Just enough of all the things that make Jeff the great player he is. My favorite is still \\"Jeff Beck's Guitar Shop\\", though I have many listens to go before I will be able to absorb all of this. If you are into Jeff this is a must have. If you are into instrumental rock guitar by a true master, this is a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a good album","review":"A few decent JB licks, but the idiotic vocalizations are so distracting as to be an impediment to the whole work. Thinking about editing out the singers. I only wish they'd provide master copies to the customer so you could import the songs into Audacity and mute the vocals. THEN it would be a decent listen. Not Beck's best by FAR but if you could cut out the overly-precious Saffron, et. al. then it would be OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best one yet...","review":"In my opinion this is possibly his best work yet. It took me several listens to get into it but as a guitarist myself I'd say that Jeff Beck's 'touch' has certainly come back on this one. The last 2 CDs were very good with moments of the old Jeff Beck magic from the 1970s, but generally they weren't up to his old standards. But this one is back on form. The musical texture, character and atmosphere he creates by using what can only be described as jaw-dropping guitar techniques is like nothing else I've ever heard. I think possibly that some of the less glowing reviews here are the result of people not giving it enough time to really appreciate it. I think this will become a classic.If you play guitar you should certainly get it...and listen carefully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overproduced Techno Mess","review":"If you are big Jeff Beck fan, there are moments of guitar brilliance on this new CD that you will enjoy. However, having to endure the samples and drum machine in order to hear those moments is difficult. Not to mention the songs themselves!!The album is a mess. The production is way off and the whole thing should have been scrapped.Jeff is such a great guitar player and over the years I have had to put up with terrible songs just to hear his playing. This latest release is just ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh Food for my EARS !!!","review":"If U are looking for something fresh like I always do!!!Choose this one!!!Jeff Beck is just one of the best players and one of the few who has something NEW to offer.As a player myself I recomend Jeff Beck's three last albums!!!Have fun and most of all ENJOY !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beck continues to blow doors...","review":"Jeff Beck's CDs are among the few that I will buy on the spot without hearing a single note--and I've yet to be disappointed over his past four or five releases. The new CD has some great tracks on it, interesting synth stuff made unique through his fantastic style. Yeah, the vocal samples are a bit annoying in places, but that's a style that's been on the past few albums too, so it's not really a surprise. The only wish I have is for a few more traditional songs with normal vocals, etc. But I'm digging this."},{"rating":"1","title":"jeff","review":"There is no doubt that Jeff Beck ranks up there...way up there.However, lately his records are not something one can relate to.Why are his records now featuring electronica?.Another thing, he is too much of a recluse.And in addition, pays too much attention on false looks. Come on, no man nearing 60 has that much hair, not even Mick Jagger. Yes people, he is wearing a wig. Like Nigel Tufnel. I prefer his days with Rod Stewart and Ron Wood."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Guys Actually Like This Sell-Out House Trash?","review":"I'm not sure what is worse; the new Jeff Beck CD or all the reviewers giving it 5 stars. Seriously, as I began listening to this CD in my car, my first reaction was to literally throw it out the window.What Jeff has done is taken his beautifully crafted, melodic songs and completely thrown them out in exchange for lifeless, uninspired, beat box-rap-house-hip hop crap. Whatever happened to the great drumming of Simon Phillips or Terry Bozzio? I'm not expecting \\"Wired 2\\" or \\"Blow By Blow Redux.\\" Just something with some life to it.Sorry Jeff. I'm being generous and giving you 1 star and zero stars to all of the misguided reviewers who have forgotten (or never heard) Jeff Beck's masterpieces from the seventies. Say I'm stuck in the past but brilliant work is brilliant work - no matter how old it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Noise Maker Bites the Dust!","review":"Jeff Beck hasn't released anything decent since \\"Wired.\\" He has forgotton what the words \\"taste\\" and \\"melody\\" mean. He's totally into noise and gimmicks. I saw him live recently on an A@E BB king special and he couldn't even play a simple decent blues solo.( all noise and gimmicks) That's sad. He used to be my favorite guitarist. Remember the dark burgundy Les Paul on the cover of \\"Blow by Blow\\"? I was the last person to own that guitar before he bought it at \\"Strings and Things\\" in Memphis. I know what I'm talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, Indeed","review":"Isn't it time for Jeff to find a new direction? This collection does continue in the vein of \\"Who Else!\\" and \\"You Had it Coming\\" but I found both of those to be more groundbreaking and enjoyable. I'm a big Jeff Beck fan and I like his propensity to push the edge, but he is subject to an occasional wrong turn. This CD is not so much a wrong turn as it is pointless. Move on to something else, Jeff. Please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best.","review":"I have been a fan of Jeff Beck for quite some time, and was excited to hear this new CD. Unfortunately, it failed to satisfy. This new album is essentially an extenstion of his previous album, \\"You Had It Comin'.\\" While YHIC was a great album, hearing the same computer edited dance-mix songs on \\"Jeff\\" led me to wonder where Jeff's creativity went. Of his past three endeavors, \\"Who Else!\\" was the greatest and most innovative, and probably one of his career best albums. The two follow-up albums are still good, but not nearly as strong.Although I was disappointed by \\"Jeff,\\" his guitar playing is still some of the greatest in the world, and he truly remains one of the best living guitar players, thus the 4-Star review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeff Disappoints","review":"In my opinion, this trend of seeking new listeners and alienating existing ones started with Santana's \\"Supernatural\\", continued with Clapton's \\"Reptile\\", and now with Jeff Beck's \\"Jeff\\". Anyone hoping for a return to the \\"Blow By Blow\\" and \\"Wired\\" era will be extremely disappointed. If one could only separate the guitar tracks from the sampling and inane \\"Yoko-like\\" vocals, maybe there would be something listenable. For anyone seeking modern sounds from Jeff Beck, I highly recommend the soundtrack recording from \\"Frankie's House\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!","review":"First let me say that I'm a hugh Jeff Beck fan. I have all his cds. The last cd was pretty bad but this is pure noise. I can honestly say I couldn't get through this cd. It was starting to give me a headache. Beck plays real fast riffs against drum machines. There is all kind of stuff going on hear but none of it is music. Go back and listen to the Yardbirds, the Jeff Beck Group, Blow by Blow etc. Leave this one alone unless you lie noise that makes no sense what so ever. What was he thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst.......yet","review":"As much as I disliked \\"Flash\\", this is the absolute worst. I liked \\"Who else\\" and \\"You had it coming\\", but \\"Jeff\\" sounds like music that had been picked over from a scrap heap and put togetherjust to fulfill a lost bet or something. I can't believe a talent like Beck would allow this garbage to get out to the public. His first two albums are classics. His work with Tench andMiddleton were good. His jazz fusion period was sensational. Since then it's as if he's lost his direction. His live albums are always good, but Beck, do what you do best and quit trying toreinvent yourself. You only put out a couple albums every ten years, so please play some rock again."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"Who wants to go to the Royal Albert Hall with me in June! If you are a true Jeff Beck fan then you'll hardly be able to contain yourself when you hear this music.

My favorite cut is \\"So What,\\" which ignites the album and sets the tone. I can listen to this album over and over and over. As in previous albums, he names many of the songs after garage talk, and the rev'd up music is as snarling as some of the cars he tinkers with. \\"Grease Monkey,\\" \\"Hod Rod Honeymoon,\\" and \\"Trouble Man,\\" are all sizzlers. I highly recommend this album if you want something to blow the cobwebs off your pipes as you fly down the freeway. If you are looking for Rod Stewart, you've come to the wrong garage."},{"rating":"2","title":"You go Jeff!","review":"I got You Had It Coming a few years ago and liked it, but it wasn't one of my favorites. However, Jeff Beck hits all the right notes with Jeff! It is one of my favorite albums I own and is definitely the best album I've heard all year. Those might seem like exaggerations but I think this album is really great. \\"Seasons\\" and \\"Why Lord Oh Why?\\" are haunting and magnificent!! \\"Bulgaria\\" too. \\"My Thing\\" really kicks and Jeff tears it up on \\"Plan B!\\" I like the live drumming too, much better than the sterile computers of You Had It Coming.Jeff: Beautiful, rocking, emotional, and daring! But don't take it from me... buy it and give it a listen yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many dull ballads here!","review":"Freddie Jackson's Do Me Again is just too dull in most places. Most of the songs sound just like stuff from his 1985, 1986 and 1988 albums. Love Me Down sounds too 1985 to me, it's scary! And don't tell about the bland Do Me Again--it sounds so faceless and the music lacks feeling. Main Course sounds so cheesy and dinky sounding--did someone play that on some cheap $50 keyboards from some flea market? It Takes Two's pseudo-disco sound doesn't help either. But songs like Live For the Moment and Second Time For Love are okay and break away from the '80s similarities of his early hits. Do Me Again sounds so very complacent and stagnant, nothing new to break away from the pattern of his early hits. The Paul Laurence-produced songs are easily the worst that he's done for Freddie and the Barry Eastmond-produced efforts are missing something. I find his other albums far better than this piece of mediocre tripe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Make a bundle of all sizes.","review":"good deal.

This concert, filmed live at a club in NYC, is hot! First, it's Nas, the bravehearts, and a few special guest (Ludacris, Jadakiss, DMC). Nas performs a number of his hits & a few songs I haven't heard before. Lyrically, Nas is easily top 3 in the rap game. Some of his songs should be used in schools to teach kids about our history. Just the fact that it's Nas with a mic & maybe one or two other cats with a mike on the stage & not 10 people with mikes screaming & not making any sense, make this concert one that can show those who don't know, what really hip hop is! No crazy lights, lasers, dancers, just a MC, DJ, turntable & a mike! DMC while a ICON, seems out of sort with his ranting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nas is rich in words but this effort is poor","review":"Nas is one of my favorite rappers so when I saw this I was pretty much shocked.First of all, the picture-quality is very cheap... I have VHS-movies with better quality than this DVD.The sound is also very bad, and NAS doesn't seem to care alot to make this concert extra special with the camera-crew around.At many times NAS doesn't even rap in whole sentences but leaves the rest of the words to be said by The Braveharts which by the way u can't hardly hear anything from, my guess is they forgot to turn on their microphones.The concert only lasts for 49 Minutes...Shame on u NAS, go and buy PUBLE ENEMY - LIVE AT THE HOUSE OF BLUES instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Field tested?","review":"These questions seem hodge podge.

The author came out with two other books after this that were equally satisfying but sadly I cannot say the same for her recent books as Susan Carroll. The complex relationship between Phaedra and James is realistic,simmering with anguish and sexual tension which leads to a revelation that only their love can over come.

He meets Bobby's pathetic family: son, daughter, and second wife.80 pages in two people end up dead. Soon Bobby is accused of the murder and soon he is considered not guilty. Then, one of the suspects jumps to his death after somewhat confessing. But with that being on page 200 of 380 pages there must be more.

I found it much tougher to stay on the program without a personal trainer (after the 6 weeks was over) as it really helps to have an appointment to work out and weigh in 3x a week. It also was tough to stay on it the last 2 of the 6 weeks as it is only 1000 calories a day and I am 5'10\\", but I stuck it out. If I wasn't part of the study for the book, I would have stuck to 1200 calories a day.

This one was neither of those. Julias was a bit too aloof for me. I do not mind dark mysterious men that are rakes and seem to have plenty of reasons for their troubled ways. Julius seemed to have a wonderful family and a perfect life so he just came off a bit spoiled to me. There is no question that Elspith is ripe for a man like this, who wouldn't be after marrying such a horrible older man as Lord Grafton. He just gave me chills. For Elspith to find some emotional solace with Julius was wonderful and truly captured my heart. She seemed like a woman that deserved happiness and finally Julius came up to snuff for her. But for me there was just a tiny bit missing from his side and if I was a betting person I would say they would not be totally happily ever after."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it.","review":"Gratuitous and explicit sex was a turn off for me.

Not to mention the heroine has 3 \\"wet dreams\\" every night. Ain't happenin', sorry.I made it to a little over halfway through, when I couldn't read any further. There was no depth to either character. No plot other than their rampant lust for each other. And no chemistry between the two.

When he finally is able to overcome them and enjoy the blessings of his emancipation, he cannot let go of his own sense of failure. The relationships he has in the latter part of his life are not fufilling because he focuses on the lack in these people, not thier ability. Joseph fails to value people as individuals. As a result, he is destined to be ordinary and unhappy instead of trying to be extraordinary. At the end of the novel he is given a chance to change his outlook on life. This novel was an easy read and full of beautiful, descriptive imagery."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have liked Ozick to be in the room with me...","review":". . . Yes, the novel is well written, and Ms. Ozick certainly has a highly developed vocabulary... or at least she has access to a good thesaurus. . . .The main point of the book is that while some of us dream, strive and struggle for intellectual greatness, we usually wind up being just a bunch of ordinary folks. How silly, how depressing! What unrealistic, high falootin' ideas of greatness this woman has! She illustrates her idea of ordinariness by telling us that unless we're great we're doomed to be mere \\"plumbers\\". Don't plumbers think? She never passes up a chance to heft her great intellectual superiority complex on the lower forms of life that she and, apparantly, her characters are destined to rub elbows with.I found Ozick's tone infuriatingly patronizing and false.

The Mambo King exemplifies what was at that time new, and exciting. The musicians were some of the finest there were out of New York; the lead trumpet, Jack Mootz, was the finest on the East Coast, and I'm not just saying that because he was my dad (yes I am).

Lacks the humor, grace, and deft touches of the more recent Royal Ballet staging with CojocaruTchaikovsky: The Sleeping Beauty (The Royal Ballet), not to mention the brilliant clarity and rich color of the Blu-Ray disc. I find the pace sluggish (has classical ballet conducting slowed down in recent years?). The dancing of the corps de ballet and the principals is only average. The non-dancing Lilac Fairy of the original production is certainly historically authentic, but I miss the lively dancing Lilac that soon replaced her. Almost any Russian production from Bolshoi or Kirov/Mariinsky gives me more pleasure (and brisker tempos).To me the sets are ponderous and dark, and the voluminous costumes--well, the performers look more upholstered than costumed. I could swear there's a Balinese or Indonesian influence in the ballerinas' headdresses--beautiful but a bit incongruous. Will not watch this disc a second time."},{"rating":"2","title":"All-Time Favorite","review":"For years I was looking for this particular CD to come out.

An American version of \\"Riders\\". As Coreene said, it really could have used tighter copy editing and proofreading (one character's name keeps changing throughout the book), but for me, this did not detract from the quality of the tale. In fact, this book kept me up all night! Gains an Excellent rating for horsey accuracy; the characters and plot pull you in. All in all, an excellent hunter-jumper novel - perhaps not *quite* as accurate a depiction of H/J in 2005 as \\"The Show Gypsies\\" is of H/J in the 1970s, but very close.Special note to bibliophiles: I'd buy a few copies now in hardcover if I were you, because I have a feeling this one will be worth megabucks in 20 years just as \\"The Show Gypsies\\" is right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"I paid for this?","review":"Well, if you like Fabio type hair flipping and his typical manly man behaviors, lots of XXX sex scenes, extramarital activities, and a shameless plug of the authors pro-life views( which would of been fine in moderation, but not a cluebyfour to the head of every reader, for half the book), with horses thrown in as a background, then this is the book for you. OH, am I forgeting the partial sentences... on every page. Its not \\"He walked into the room, and said hello.\\", oh, that would be too common...it's \\"Walked into room. Said hello.\\" As an avid reader, and rider, it just didn't do it for me. And I paid money for this book? Bleh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"There are too few books revolving around this sport with a storyline worth following, as well as an accurate protrayal of the sport itself. I agree with the previous comments about the clipped writing style, I wasn't sure what I was getting into, but was enthrawled by the third paragraph and could not put it down.This woman knows horses and knows showjumping, and there wasn't a single moment of \\"who does that\\"? in this book.Very much appreciated, can't wait for 'year two'."},{"rating":"1","title":"A word of warning","review":"I just thought maybe someone should explain that this book is explicit in describing the sexual escapades that take place.I was taken by surprise, and very glad I had not bought it for my niece to read. When I tell you it is explicit - I do mean explicit. You not only know sex is taking place - you know every move made and how it feels to what parts.So - for those who 'get off' on this kind of thing, heres a book for you.For those looking for a 'horse book' minus the bodice ripper aspects - skip this one.Personally, I found the people to be haughty, selfish, crude and rude. Not at all likeable persons. I need to like the characters in a book if I am going to enjoy it. For me - the bits and pieces about the horses weren't enough to make up for the horrible people found in these pages.If this is what the blessed, blooded horse, High Life is like - then I can truly say I'm glad to have been spared such blessings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but unnecessarily graphic...","review":"Meh. The first half of the book read like a Harlequin romance novel, only those are better written. I plugged on through because I loved the horsey bits, but then it started picking up the latter half and then I was hooked. If the author could stop using sentence fragments and leave out about 90% of the sex details, this would be a GREAT summer read.

I had the same experience. The somewhat conversational, clipped style of much of the narrative bothered me at times, but I was swept along regardless. Most horse books for adults don't seem very accurate to me, but this one was clearly written by a true horsewoman who knows her stuff. The horses are realistically portrayed and the \\"voiceover\\" for QL towards the end made me laugh and laugh because it sounded EXACTLY like what that mare would say!It's honestly impossible to put down and I can't wait for the next installment.

If it is the latter, well, I found the story lacking in intrigue and action. I would have rated a one if it were the case.

Nowhere did I ponder wow..a bit much...instead I was surprised at the character developments and plot lines that are eloquently written so that you fall head over heels into the story.She (Ms. Dane) has taken the \\"Taboo\\" and written it in as a \\"must do\\" with situations outside the characters control.The characters are strongly written and quite explosive, and the plot is utterly mesmerizing!You are left wondering exactly how FAST you can get the next in this series!If you haven't yet \\"Sampled\\" any of Ms. Danes works...Do so NOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I was hoping for more of a Paranormal triad of power.

Of course you have to suspend disbelief to accept the situation but that's why it's called fiction. The New Orleans setting gives it the proper atmosphere to carry the story along.

I am more convinced than ever after reading this book that Karla Faye Tucker got exactly what she deserved. This book portrays her as some sort of wonderful, mislead, genuine person who made a mistake. I am stunned beyond belief at this portrayal of a murderer. It sounds to me after reading this book, that Karla Faye did not make any genuine changes, she just simply learned how to play the game, and in this case ultimately and fortunatley did not win."},{"rating":"1","title":"Karla Faye Tucker knew how to put on the sweet girl act.","review":"Before I read this book I had mixed feelings about Karla Faye Tucker being put to death. After reading the book I think it was the only thing that could be done. She was a dangerous monster. Beverly Lowery told how Karla Faye would smile and as she talked about her travels with the Allman Brothers Band. I believe Karla Faye would have loved to be back in her old life style. Being locked up she done what was necessary to get the attention, putting on this 'Born Again' act. It got her by and almost got her free. This was an evil person that was proud of what she had done,or as she said \\"I don't know what it was that I done\\". I hate the death penalty but what can you do with a person like her? She would have killed again, with out a doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone write about her victims","review":"The author seemed all too willing to forget what Ms. Tucker did. No matter how \\"rehabilitated\\" a murderer claims to be or how much they claim to to have \\"changed\\", that does not bring back their victim(s).(I feel sorry for Richard Thornton's loss, but what was his wife Deborah doing in another man's apartment in the middle of the night. I don't think I would mourn the loss of a spouse who cheated on me. I also cannot believe how the victims' siblings could buy her act and forgive her.)Question: would Pat Robertson have plead for the life of a murderer who'd \\"converted\\" to Judaism or <gasp!> Islam?"},{"rating":"1","title":"True Crime Memoir of a Pick Ax Murderer","review":"This book, in the true crime genre, is about a female pick ax murderer on death row. It is a biographical retrospective from a psychological perspective and examines Karla's early involvement with hard drugs, her upbringing by a drug addicted and prostitute mother and other environmental influences.The author juxtaposes a memoir or her son who was recently killed in a hit-run accident. He, too, was a 'child-gone-bad' - - skirmishes with the law, school drop-out. \\"There but for fortune\\"......she thinks.Though interesting, this book misses the boat. Karla has become 'decent' - - a christian, caring woman. However, I ended the book still thinking, 'Who is she?', and ultimately, 'so what!'. Perhaps, being of the mindset that reality rests as much in behavior as thought, I did not find Lowry's analysis of events convincing or cohesive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cross this one out","review":"Ecchh. I really thought I was going to enjoy this book. However, it didn't take too many pages to realize I would never finish it. I do feel for the author and could get a sense of her horrible pain over her son's death. I think I would have rather read about that and just left Karla Faye Tucker out of the whole thing. I just couldn't empathize with her story. Hard childhood, blah blah, blah. I am ambivalent towards capital punishment but here I felt no pain for Ms. Tucker or her family. I saw the female victim's (Townsend) husband on TV and he pointed out that no one commuted her death sentence so eye for an eye. Not really recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Untruth after untruth, this should be science fiction!","review":"As one of the people who is intimately involved in the case that this literary piece is supposed to be realistically portraying, I am surprised that anyone could believe that any of this actually happened the way the author portrays it. The convicted murderer is shown as being a wonderful person. I have not met too many \\"wonderful\\" people who are capable of swinging a pick axe into two different people more than 60 different times and enjoying it so much that they told several people that they had a sexual orgasm with each swing. That is sick. This was not an isolated incident; within a day after the first two murders, this individual was planning several more murders which would have been carried out if she had not been apprehended. She had no religion and no remorse until AFTER she was in jail. The reason I know all this? Tucker murdered my wife, Deborah Ruth Thornton.

They perform some of their most well-known songs such as 'Jeremy' and 'Daughter' as well as some material from the new album, 'Riot Act'. At times, the material from 'Riot Act' sounds more interesting and energetic than it did on the album!Basically, fans can get a good idea of where the band is at this point in time, with some older songs thrown in for nostalgic purposes. There are even some interesting covers thrown in for fun and a guest appearance from Hunters and Collectors front man Mark Seymour thrown in. Even though the set gets a bit lacklustre at times, it's still an interesting listen and well worth a look.

And I must say, It has most certainly lived up to my expectations. This album is hard to categorize, it's electronica, but at the same time it has many elements of rock in it to.

The story needed smoothing, pieces of it didn't mesh with the rest, but the pros themselves are really very nicely done.

Magic or books advocating that style of discipline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very helpful","review":"I bought this book two years ago and still have not finished the reading. The way this book is written is so boring. Other books I bought are much more helpful and insightful, such as 'How to Talk So Kids Will Listen...' and '1-2-3'. I reread both books twice since I bought them. You could really try the skills in those books and see the results. But I am not sure I could apply anything I read so far with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in Theory","review":"The messages in this book cannot be faulted: treat your child with respect and teach self control. The prequel, \\"Raising Your Spirited Child\\", teaches parents to first adjust to their child's temperament and is quite good. Much of content is repeated in this book. The disadvantage of this book is that the messages get lost in the overly abundant stories used to humanize and illustrate behavioral points. And all have simple causes and neat conclusions. Reading was slow and not particularly beneficial. For a parenting book that better addresses common problems, common responses and better responses, read \\"How to Talk to Your Child\\". However, there's still the need for a book that addresses how to handle situations where time doesn't allow diplomacy or diplomacy doesn't yield results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands down the Best Parenting Book I have ever read","review":"This is a really, really helpful book. Highly recommend it for any parent -- it has extremely useful tips for avoiding power struggles, getting through temper tantrums when they do occur, and teaching your child right from wrong in a compassionate way.

I wish you could buy extra microphone hairbrushes in lots of colors because my son (1 year old) would love one, too! We got this toy for our daughter's 3rd birthday and she adores it! It is pretty sturdy, the starshaped mirror lights up and is a safety mirror, the chair does not easily tip and the MICROPHONE hairbrush lights up when you turn it on. It is awesome! The gem shaped buttons under the mirror play upbeat/hip versions of old favs like Itsy Bitsy Spider, 5 Little Mokeys and more. There is an applause button, too! My husband did use a power screwdriver to attach the pink vanity top to the white base (with included screws) because our wimpy screwdrivers could not break through the thick plastic to do the job. But other than that assemply was easy, took less than 30 minutes. Very sweet toy and easy to clean!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OLP Rocks!","review":"If you're a fan of the band, and even if you're not, this CD belongs in your collection. Raine's vocals, amazing in studio, are even more incredible live. I like how they let the audience sing along... it's pretty amazing to hear all those voices singing together. It's one of my top ten life goals to see OLP live. A couple of songs are missing, but the only true downside to the CD is the inclusion of 'Not Enough'. Can someone tell me what that's doing on their live CD? In my opinion, it's the weakest song in their entire collection.

This CD will bring back nostalgic memories to those of us who heard it on the radio as kids, on the record player at Christmas or a birthday. With little knowlege of Spanish or Mexican culture one can appreciate and enjoy these songs and the more you know the more you appreciate them. I never tire of hearing them. They are ageless and well worth getting. The songs of Cri Cri run the gamut of funny and entertaining(El Raton Vaquero and La Holla y El Comal), educational(Marcha De Las Letras) as well as touching and nostalgic(El Ropero and Di Porque).

With the exit of her producing and writing partner, Lesette Wilson, Meli'sa bombs on \\"The Lady In Me\\". Vocally, Morgan remains in fine shape throughout the CD. However, the majority of the material was very lackluster. The lead single \\"Can You Give Me What I Want\\" was catchy but only managed a moderate placing on the R&B charts. Morgan was soon dropped from the Capitol roster after this disasterous CD. She would later sign with Pendulum Records and release an incredible CD \\"Still In Love\\" with material more befitting of a vocalist of her caliber. In 2005, Morgan is scheduled to drop her first CD in 13 years. Let's hope she sticks with the formula that works so well for her and not make the same mis-steps that occurred with \\"The Lady In Me\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy!","review":"This a wonderful book. It certainly can be read very quickly, but why would you want to? Take your time and enjoy the words on the pages. See and feel the beauty in all things the way Thoreau did. After reading a selection from the book, I always came away with good feelings, very serene. I will likely read it again and again. I've just recently moved to Oregon where it is lush and beatiful.

This is one of those guys.half an hour and $17 dollars later- it's a total and complete waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traditional Country Triumph","review":"Marty Stuart seems to be able to take traditional country music and present it in a modern setting without making it pop or rock like the vast majority of what is at the top of the country charts these days. First of all, his song selection is a great blend of old and new. \\"Farmer Blues\\" is the standout of this CD. But his remake of the Johnny Cash song \\"Walls of A Prison\\" is a very close second. \\"A Satisfied Man\\" starts the CD on a high note and the remainder of the tunes match that standard.If this CD agrees with you ,take a look back at \\"The Pilgrim\\" which was criminally under-rated by the Nashville powers that be. That CD has to be Stuart's finest to date, if not one of the top recordings out of Nashville in quite a few years.One look at Marty Stuart's resume and you will quickly understand why he can play traditional country better than anyone else in the younger generation. True country music will be heard as long as Marty Stuart keeps playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Pilgrim, but better than 99.9% of whats out there!","review":"I am not a huge fan of current country. I do like the \\"Outlaw\\" genre of Willie, Waylon, Johnny Cash and Merle. That said 1999's \\"The Pilgrim\\" is one the of best albums/CDs ever released period. IMHO, it ranks with Pet Sounds, Who's next, Kind of Blue as a true desert island disk. So it is no wonder that follwing it up would be a herculian task. \\"Country Music\\" is a great album. Full of great songs and performances. I would not hesitate recomending it to any of my aging rocker friends and look forward to Marty's next release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very \\"country\\"","review":"While there is SOME \\"real\\" country on this, the little that is on, seems to be plagiarized. For example, \\"Farmer's Blues\\" is a good song. It is VERY country....but, take note! When I first heard this, I thought the tune sounded a LOT like the old Hank Williams, Sr. song, \\"I Heard That Lonesome Whistle Blow\\"...and it didn't stop there. A line was lifted right out of the Hank,Sr. song, too, about him hanging his head and crying, \\"when the evening train goes by\\"--and it's at the same place in the tune as Hank's line .

Mariah pioneered the concept of female artists mixing hip-hop with pop & r/b music, and this album is testament to her talent in doing that.There are 2 dics, one a house remix and the other an r&b hip-hop remix. The hip-hop remix is my favorite. The best songs on the house disc are \\"anytime you need a friend\\" & \\"through the rain\\". \\"Sweetheart\\" is probably my least favorite song on the hip-hop disc, all the rest are just excellent.I listen to this record almost everyday, and I never get tired of hearing her sing.

If this is one's cup of tea, then one's \\"thirst\\" will be satisfied.Though I'm partial to the first disc, the second one should grow on me after listening repeatedly to it.With a total running time of 140:39, there's a lot of \\"Mimi\\" from which to listen, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the better remixed songs?","review":"I do like this cd but it is missing some songs that should have been on there as well.

I own all her albums. This, however, was a joke! Instead of putting the full length remixes on the 1st CD, they should have included the shorter \\"edit\\" versions to make room for RARE remixes that most folks haven't heard (aka Butterfly, Butterfly (Reprise), Do You Know, Emotions, Fantasy, The Roof, ABMB, Can't Take That Away, etc.) These remixes done by Morales, DJ Meme, and others are only found on her rare Mexican & Brazilian promos. Why not include those on a CD like this? It's not like they don't own the rights to the songs. The 2nd CD is a bit better. However, why include songs that clearly aren't remixes? Clearly Sony threw this together at the last moment. Dont waste your time.

Once I listened to it, I was sort of disappointed. The first CD, all the dance remixes can get annoying, I mean...they are too long of just pure dance. The second part, the hip hop/rap collaborations are OK but some of them have TOO much hip hop and rap that you forget it's actually Mariah Carey that you're listening to. I think Mariah should put out a Bsides album, that would probably do a lot better for sales and my collection.

Disc 1 is decent in my opinion, I never really liked dance remixes, but they are good. Disc 2 is AMAZING!!! If you are a fan of the hip-hop and R&B Mariah, this is the CD for you. Tracks like \\"Fantasy\\" with ODB and \\"Heartbreaker\\" featuring Da Brat and Missy are timeless remixes that will never go out of date. I suggest to others who read these reviews to make sure you focus on the ones who give Mariah negative reviews on this album, none of them focus on the actual album, just on their personal opinions of Mariah and her career.

Bonus points for having a well-developed heroine who evolves over the course of the book, and I suspect will develop more over the course of the series. I'm not chomping at the bit to read the rest of the series though, because while this was written well with a solid character, nothing about the world really stood out to me and had me begging for more. Oh, there are little things that caught my interest, things that I think will develop over the course of the series, but I can wait to read those for when my bookshelves are a little emptier, and I'm looking to kick back with a good adventure yarn. Still, as an example of women writing space opera/adventure with female protags, this is a good one, and worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vatta War 2","review":"Ky Vatta was a military cadet destined for great things, until an act of kindness incurred her Academy's wrath and ended her career.Instead of the expected disgrace, her rich trader family gave her captaincy of a small ship, to sell for scrap. In flagrant disregard of orders, she saw the opportunity to make a profit and save the ship. Several upgrades later, Ky is determined to retain the ship and her independence in the cut-throat world of interplanetary trading.

The daughters are one type A the other a free spirit with past lives who thinks she is African American. The son lives in the woods because he killed someone. That is the story in a nut shell except for Grandma Pearl who is gay without coming out. Then there are chapters about the death of a dog that go on and on. I listened to this on Audio and had it not be time in traffic I would have thrown this out the window. If you are a new age kind of person, go for it. This is for you.

Bon Scott and Angus Young are in their finest; aw, the entire band does a great thing!I love this cd all the way through, but my favourite would include Let There Be Rock (possibly their best song ever) which is filled with incredible guitar licks from Angus, Riff Raff (featuring one of the best riffs I've ever heard) and High Voltage (which sounds to me as incredible rock n' roll wannabe theme).

Now I'm not at all saying that Brian Johnson isn't great; he is, but he can't hold a candle to Bon, in my opinion.And this live record, originally released in 1978 on Atlantic but reissued on Epic in the early 2000s, proves how great AC/DC is. With songs like 'Whole Lotta Rosie,' 'Rock And Roll Damnation,' and 'High Voltage,' you know this album is gonna rock.And, I think Epic did an awesome job remastering this. The sound quality is superb.While Scott was alive, he made some mighty fine records with AC/DC. And 'If You Want Blood You've Got It' (which is one of the best live records ever put out, in my opinion) is one of the best records that AC/DC ever put out.Highly recommended for any rock or AC/DC fan. Classic heavy metal at it's finest. Well worth listening to, and better yet, owning.

My 4 and 5 year old students were planning on singing Feliz Navidad a capella but have decided to have this rendition playing in the background when they perform for their parents. Personally, the drums in Little Drummer Boy just blow me away!

Particularly strong cuts include \\"Let It Snow\\",\\"The Christmas Song\\", \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" and \\"Feliz Navidad\\", the latter featuring a Beach Boys-like background vocal. Young and old will love this album! Buy it! You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adds the \\"Chicago\\" groove to your favorite yultide tunes!","review":"Overall, it's fun to hear how Chicago has taken and reworked popular Christmas tunes. Some with great success, others only moderately so. \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\\" features Bill Champlin on vocals, and the great brass arrangements Chicago is known for. Also especially good is \\"Let It Snow\\" with brass player Lee Loughnane taking lead vocals -- a great arrangement, and maybe a guy who needs to sing more oftern; it's terrific. Some, like \\"O come All Ye Faithful,\\" \\"Silent Night\\" and \\"God Rest Ye Merry Genltlemen\\" don't fare as well, partially due to Jason Scheff's screetchy vocals -- they might have done well to have taken them all down musically about a third. For Chicago fans, it's a \\"must own\\" - for others, not as adept to the band, think about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you could pick just ONE Christmas CD","review":"This is it! I collect Christmas music and am always looking for a nice combination of fresh twists and classic renditions of Christmas tunes. This CD has a very distinct Chicago flavor and is sure to be a holiday favorite of yours from the first listen! It rocks at times, is thoughtful at times, but is a fantastic listen for any Christmas music fan! Without a doubt the most played Christmas CD in my house!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicago's slant on Christmas is innovative & thrilling!","review":"Chicago XXV is dominated by great vocals and the brass section. Bill Champlin lead and backing vocals dominate this effort. What Child Is This? is breathtaking and really showcases his tallents. He even gets funky with his organ playing and soulful voice on Santa Clause is Coming To Town. Then Robert Lamm does his thing on Christmas Time Is Here. He also has lead vocals on three other songs. This album continues Lamm's return to the forefront as a vocal force for this band which started with Night & Day (Big Band). The horn section blares throughout the CD also a continuation from Night & Day. My 7 year old daughter just loves this CD and so will you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicago has never sounded better","review":"The arrangements, performances, and recording quality on Chicago 25 are absolutely top-notch. If you are a fan of Chicago's original sound (and not the over-synthesized power ballads of their '80's work), and then this CD is a must have. My faves are Little Drummer Boy (outstanding vocal arrangement), The Christmas Song, Christmas Time is Here (from Charlie Brown Christmas soundtrack, beautifully arranged), and Let It Snow (rockin' horns)."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"What?? They aren't serious, are they??\\"","review":"That was a quote from me when I first heard the news of this project. I thought it was a horrible idea. I had been waiting since 1991 for a new oroginal CD from these guys and I was not going to buy some Christmas album!So...gritting my teeth, I gave it a listen when it came out and my Bah Humbug-ish attitude melted away.This is a wonderful CD. The band, with producer Roy Bittan, put down \\"Chicago-ized\\" versions of the old classics. And it works.A real Christmas surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas Album","review":"This is the only Christmas album I have ever heard that I would enjoy outside of the Christmas Season. The music is very enjoyable and clearly displays these musicians talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicago rediscovers The Sound","review":"After spending the '80's turning out non-descript pop ballads, Chicago has rediscovered the sound that made their '70's output so special. On Chicago 25, the horns are out front and have never sounded better, thanks to great arrangements by James Pankow. The big drums and tacky synthesizers from Chicago 16-21 are thankfully absent. Bill Champlin is in fine voice - his vocal arrangement for Little Drummer Boy is simply outstanding. And its nice to hear Robert Lamm singing lead on several songs - contrary to another review, I think his vocals and arrangements are terrific. The album's sound is clear and well balanced, a truly excellent recording job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrifying","review":"Heard it with a friend and then downloaded. Almost so bad that it's funny... but not quite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it was a \\"Silent Night\\"","review":"Awkward singing and playing of Christmas songs. Unlike their previous collection of standards, this falls short and is hard to listen to. Chicago was once one of the best bands of the 70s but this album's predictablity makes it seem like contract filler. Should have asked Cetera back for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The must-buy Christmas album of this century.","review":"Yes, I know that sounds a bit exaggerated, but one listen to this collection of Christmas songs done in the inimitable Chicago-style is all it will take to make you a believer. Just when you thought that there is nothing new and exciting to be found in the dozens of new Christmas albums released each year...Chicago breaks the rules! Even if you are tired of hundreds of different artists singing the same familiar carols...this album will revitalize your interest in Christmas music for sure. The best compliment I can give this album is that, unlike most other Christmas albums, you do not immediately recognize the song by the instrumental opening...it is only when the words are sung when the little light bulb goes off! A truly remarkable album. Christmas music aficionados will enjoy this album, and Chicago fans will absolutely LOVE it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spike the eggnog...Your'e gonna need it.","review":"I purchased this CD a few years ago, hoping for a solid effort from this talented legendary band....Just horrible renditions of classic Christmas songs that do not deserve this kind of treatment.This CD just sounds sickening to me.There are so many horrible versions of Christmas songs, and the vocals?????C'mon guys your better than this....or at least you used to be.Simply the WORST Christmas CD I've ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"How the Mighty Have Fallen","review":"There is one, I repeat, only one good song on this entire CD. Christmas Time is Here perfectly blends that unmistakable Chicago sound with the warmth and spirit of the holidays, thanks to Robert Lamm's smooth vocals and some fine underplaying from the horn section. The rest of the disc is a travesty with the band totally embarrassing themselves by trying to rock out on such numbers as The Little Drummer Boy, Feliz Navidad (?!?) and Santa Claus is Coming to Town. All of the inappropriate (and often downright silly) arrangements make them sound like the second rate over-the-hill party band that they've truly become. I'm sure if this album were made in their heyday under the production of a James William Guercio, Phil Ramone or a David Foster, the results would have been much different."},{"rating":"1","title":"I use it as a coaster for my drink","review":"I love Chicago but this CD was such a disappointment. I listened to it over and over but I just couldn't get into it. I never listen to it, that's how bad I think it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas Gift from Chicago","review":"This CD is my most favarite christmas record.Some tracks are popular Christmas songs, but Chicago plays them in their great performance. So if you were not familiar to this band, you may enjoy enough. Especially Chicago's many Lead Vocalists(Bobby Lamm, Bill Champlin, etc )that have each some different singing style and voice, make very colourful Christmas party. Personally, I like Jason's \\"O Come All Ye Faithful\\" best. And \\"Let it snow\\" sung by Trumpetter Lee Loughnane is a very nice tune, too.(The band plays this song at their show often.) I think this is one of the most successful Christmas CD by single artist(Songer or Band)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds like Chicago playing Christmas music","review":"No real surprises here.

Fifty pages later, the cartridge was dry and the machine inoperable, necessitating the purchase of a new toner cartridge. In effect, the refurbished unit cost an extra $70. This is not a bargain. The machine is fine. Single page printing is fast, a lot faster than my HP 4000. The rate of two sided printing is about the same as the HP. Print quality is excellent.

Not only is his playing often sloppy and rushing the orchestra, not only is the orchestration bland and unexciting, but this piece shows a severe lack of understanding anything about the musical idiom in which he is writing. The vivace is not fast, the Adagio is not slow. The fanfare is not a fanfare, the Fugue is not even remotely a fugue. But even if we are to remove these faults, and take the music for what it is, there is nothing interesting. It doesn't work as rock music, because its quite boring, and uninspired. It lacks any personality or originality. It doesn't work as classical music, because its poorly written and poorly executed. It again lacks personality or originality.

The acoustic guitar parts are awful, the over picked piezo sound on the Ademas ovation is a good exercise in how not to play an acoustic guitar.The orchestra tries in vain to keep up with YJM's bad timekeeping, but fails consistantly. The conductor needs to reherese his orchestra more for this type of event.This guy YJM needs to control his skill, he can be very good but this concert is just big Ego trip for him and it becomes a sad Joke on guitar fans.Thank goodness this ultra show-off shread metal style guitar is now old fashioned and no longer to be respected.Don't waste your money on this fiasco!Get Eric Johnson live from Austin and be amazed by comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extraordinary performance!","review":"This DVD includes a brief interview with Yngwie in which he describes this performance as the \\"peak\\" of his career. Indeed, it represents some of his very best guitar playing. I've seen him play live twice with the rock band backing him up and things got somewhat wild and crazy in that context. However, with the full orchestra and a conductor taking lead, Yngwie seems to really be in his element. Here he exhibits his extraordinary technical mastery of the guitar in a performance of beauty and grace."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't ery good","review":"Being a big time Yngwie fan I must say this doesn't show him very well. It was disappointing that he didn't seem to work very hard on his sound, performance or timing. This just seemed like he didn't rehearse and came out like his backing band was there ready to go but it was an Orchestra.He seemed poised at any moment to go fill tilt into his Shtick which is bothersome to his long time fans that think, scratch that.. \\"know\\" like everyone else it's a bit overdone now and wonders, why doesn't he go back into his Alcratraz/Rising force way's and keep it clean, tight yet bad ass? Unfortunately, in order to get the good, you have to put up with some bad. That's kinda how I see this dvd. There are parts of pure Yngiwe genius so I gave it an added star but overall he seems noisy and in over his head. Since he didn't write it (Dave Rosenthal) did. [...] and cannot write I'm not surprised but he could have put a little more into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seekers of Monster Talent look no further","review":"I grew up hearing my father playing classical piano(plenty of records too),and yet found myself fascinated with the early hard rock/metal stuff,followed by fusion and currently hard prog., so when I acquired this concert a couple years ago(Japanese Import),I thought I was in Heaven! Superb composition (needless to say, Yngwie wrote the music for all the instruments and choral) plus an orchestra that cares, combined with Yngwie's unequalled technical virtuosity make for a truly jaw dropping experience. Everyone I've shown this concert to, including casual music fans, is fascinated and knocked out. Openminded, adventurous music buffs should pick this up. By the way, on the last G3 tour, after Yngwie opened, the one and only Steve Vai said after his first number \\"How about that Yngwie Malmsteen,is he a freak or what? and I mean that in a good way\\".

Yngwie plays flawlessly and the orchestra adds a lot to the music. My only complaint is the sound quality. This is definitly not the best recording. The volume changes in the middle of songs, like the engineer changes mics or sources in mid-stream. There are places you can barely hear the guitar over the strings and horns. Beyond that, this is a must have for any Yngwie fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gods of war have spoken!","review":"This DVD is perfect. Yngwie Malmsteen flys and is flawless in allthe songs. I actually get chills when he plays, floored and in awe are understatements. its like he is possessed by the gods of war! the last review says ...Steve Vai says.... what? haha Steve Vai has nothing on Malmsteen! he sounds like my gramps in comparison!

I couldn't decide whether this book was meant to be funny (which it isn't) or profound (which it isn't). Clumsy attempts to weave pseudoreligious and misunderstood metaphysical concepts into a present-day parable about a psychotherapist (leave out the therapist part) who is convinced he is the new Messiah because his inner voice gives him stock market tips, propel a story filled with nonsense that will only seem illuminating to those sad, grossly unenlightened seekers who get their religious ideas from Jerry Springer and self-help tapes. Only train-wreck fascination kept me going in an effort to glean some true point from this fractured fable until the accumulating insult and violence done to plot, character, metaphysics, religion, and punctuation ultimately compelled me to hurl this book out the window. One star for being a good projectile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comb By Ahhhh","review":"I must have bumped my head on something, because I paid $40 for a similar comb from a fancy website that features \\"fine\\" dog grooming products.

I have been through regular style, happy-go-lucky cartooning to comic book style to manga. I just wasn't getting the hang of them. Then I saw this book. I figured since I was a Dexter's Lab fan, I would give it a try. It was so easy for me to do! It just clicked with me.I had found Christopher Hart books to range from well-explained to poorly-explained. This one falls deeply into the well-explained category! It explains differences in representing genders, how different types of eyes and other features can change a school girl into a sexy seductress. There are just so many tips that take the regular lessons and sort of glue them together or reinforce them.It goes without saying that everyone is going to have one style they can do better than any other. If you have tried the others like I had, give this one a shot and don't be suprised if it is the one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I has a lot of helpful information and awesome examples! I really enjoy the range of character types it talks about as well as the characteristics it mentions. It gives some pointers on slouching/posture of characters as well as shoulders on women.

It is really useful for those looking for help or references to retro or stylized characters. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book. Leave it be.","review":"Like all of Chris Hart's books, Cartoon Cool is filled with hack drawings and bad drawing advice.If you really want to draw in the Retro style, here's a tip: Go look at the cartoons and the artists that inspired the retro style in the first place. Ed Benedict, Mary Blair, M. Sasek, 50's era Hank Ketcham, Gene Dietch.These are the people that Craig McKracken and Genndy Tartokovsky and Lynne Naylor are inspired by.Google the names.

This time there tried and true formula of power chords and guitar solo's over Johnsons skreeching scream, is annoying. And the lryics are getting dull. Not to say you can't find a decent song or two. Nervous Shakedown and Flick the Switch make for a couple good listens every year or two. Other than that, it's been there done that, at least 10 times, or what ever number this cd is.

It is way too soft and I felt like I was sinking in a big hole. I have back problems and this huge piece of foam made things worse for me. It also feels like it got real hot while laying on it.

Yeah it is soft, but it's like a marshmallow. It is soft, but if you put any weight/pressure on it, it just flattens out and becomes useless. It is just a big piece of foam with square edges. Mine did not come with a cover, like one reviewer said theirs did. (didn't say came with cover, just saying because a reviewer said it did) It was shipped in the packing box only and plastic. It was not packed with a retail box, no labels of any brand or anything. It also was packed so tightly that you have to rip apart the shipping box just to get it out.

But once I opened it up and started reading through it, I was greatly disappointed. Out of hundreds of pages, I could only use maybe 5 or 6 pages of it. The book is filled with all kinds of chemistry to make your own paints from pigments like the artists back in the day used to do. Not many of us have the finances or the time to that junk anymore. The book only had a small section about actual painting, which is what I do. The rest is full of details on how to make the supplies you would otherwise buy at artist supply stores, and many, many other forms of art techniques like lithograph, screen printing, ironwork, etc. I sent it back. Even though it was a good price, the $15 was not worth only 5 pages of usefulness to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sentimental","review":"I really like the pairing of Julie Andrews and James Garner in their older years.

Having an affair behind the back of a disabled person?","review":"I was shocked by this movie, and shocked that the people in it would even accept the script.

I am frankly startled to note I am the first person to write a bad review for this movie. I like James Garner and Julie Andrews, so I thought how bad could it be? Well, I think they did their parts, but the plot and the script writing were so incredibly bad, I guess they did the best they could do with what they had. I didn't feel the movie explored in depth any of the following topics: Alzheimers, being the spouse or family member of someone with Alzheimers, widowhood, winter romance (ha ha), or even romance. The topic material had a lot of potential, but they just didn't go anywhere with it.

The acting and timing are perfect, believable, and the movie leaves you feeling pleased. Definitely buy it on DVD and be amazed at how low priced it is, I sure was!

And it goes further into tackling why."},{"rating":"1","title":"is life really so shallow and boring as a fairytale?","review":"Centuries of romances have been lived and written about in books full of passion.Than we have Cinderella. This book would let women believe that \\"cinderella's way\\" is the only right one for happyness (...let alone being it realistic). I don't think life, romance and relashionship is so straight, simple and...boring. Please women go for some more challenging book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely informitive","review":"I married young, and got a divorce 15 years later only to enter the grueling world of dating.I had no idea what I was doing. Do you give them your number? Do they pay? What about online dating? And really, what I desperately wanted to know as one guy after another just suddenly stopped calling... how do I tell if they are really interested?A male friend kept telling me to get this book. After a while I relented and finally ordered it.What an eye opener. Point blank, laid out in black and white, what a guy really thinks. How do you know a guys really interested? He pays attention. And he isn't afraid to say your his girl.After reading this book I stopped wasting my time on guys clearly just saying what I wanted to hear and eventually met a very sweet guy. He was shy at first, and it took him a little while to go after me, but just like the book says... he was interested, and he shows it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe","review":"Offensively Rules-y and sexist, this book was written by comedians as a joke and readers shouldn't be treating it as actual romantic advice. Just because Oprah had a show on it doesn't make it brilliant.Even the episode of Sex & the City that this is based on concluded that relationships are not this simple. Since when are men not allowed to be shy, and women not allowed to ask them out? 1950?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good advice to save yourself from heartache","review":"When I first bought this book, I laughed at some of the things that Greg said. I thought that surely there must be some reason why a guy doesn't call, or doesn't want to date you exclusively, or won't talk about marriage. After making countless excuses for my guy, it turns out that Greg was right all along. He just wasn't that into me! I could have saved myself a year of trouble and walked away at the first warning sign. Read this book. It will help you recognize when a man is just not that into you so you can move on to something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This book was referred to me by my therapist, although she never read the book. After reading chapter 1, you've read it all. I find Mr. Behrendt a bit insulting, sometimes you even wonder if he doesn't think he's Dr. Phil. Keep in mind that the book was not written by professionals (psychologists) and you cannot generalize, every man, every couple and every situation is different and the way they give it to you is way too simple. Relationships are more complex than that. For me, this book is more for entertainment than reading into the signs. Women are not that stupid, we know when a guy is into us or not..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is now my BIble","review":"This is the best thing I ever read.

I wasted the pretty on a guy that just wasn't into me. But the one thing I did do was dump him lickey split. Afterwards, I re-read the book again and had pages of post-it notes that were soooo true. I am gonna give the book as a gift to a friend of mine (she ain't getting my copy!!!) Empowerment can be a pretty strong thing, and I will not forget the valuable lesson's learned in this book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please read this... and make your friends read it too!","review":"It makes so much sense.

This, apparently, has become the book of \\"the hour\\".I picked it up from our local library because I bought into the hype and thought it would be something similar to Sex and the City.BIG MISTAKE.This book is DANGEROUS because it promotes the idea of a one size fits all. Therefore, every guy and every girl and every relationship should be identical. What is that about?This book tells you that you should NEVER consider any kind of circumstances at all. If he doesn't do this, its because he is not into you AND NO EXCUSES. That's crap. If only life were THAT simple.I hate people like these authors or like Dr. Phil. They make everything so black and white. I would love to spend some time in their lives to see just how black and white their lives really are.I have been on both sides of the fence (when the guy was into me and when he wasn't) and let me tell ya, it just ain't that simple.This book is simply dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is so negative.","review":"Why is everything always about women trying to figure the dudes out? Why couldn't the title be - He doesn't understand that I rule! instead of something that sounds like a slam! I believe this book prey's on women's insecurities. Good for the writers. They won't have a desk job any time soon. Because I have heard this book is selling like hot cakes. Everyone wants answers. There are as many answers as there are people.

Even for trash books its really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book ruined my relationship","review":"This book makes women see problems were there are none. I was accused of so many selfish things and there was no truth to it. This is written by a lousy television show writer. What does that tell you? I don't need George Lucas writing me books about hyperspace or religion. I don't need Sex and the City to tell me about relationships. Women and men need to think instead of going to television for answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"life is gray and this book is tritely black and white!","review":"While I think this book is witty, and perhaps even helpful to women with unusually low self esteem, Greg's so-called wisdom is simplistic to a fault. If Sex & The City taught one thing it's that relationships are complex and take time. By urging women to keep up their defenses so high, this book kills love before it even has a chance to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Objectification anyone?","review":"The grammatical structure of title alone exemplifies The Centerfold Syndrome as written by Gary Brooks. Read it ladies. 'nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Advice","review":"Good advice for women attracted to men who are not attracted to them, using them for sex, or are just plain losers. But do women really need to hear it repeated as many times as it was in this book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the insight I've been looking for","review":"I have found Greg's book to be very helpful. I am still not dating but at least now I know what to look out for in the kind of man I want and want to spend the rest of my life with.I don't agree with everything Greg wrote but it's just a book, not a 'How to manual' to deal with men. Good to know that men are really simple creatures. So, now that I know the secrets, where are the men?Thank you,Julie"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Trendy\\" best describes this book","review":"This book helped me dump my boyfriend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Please read it before you go out on that date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally -a book that tells it like it is","review":"Finally, a book on dating that actually is useful. When you read this book you will laugh, cringe, cry and likely change the way you approach relationships from now on. The truth hurts, but it will also set you free. This book is witty, and a quick read.If you like Sex in the City, you will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's Just Not That Into You","review":"He's Just Not That Into You was a great read. It was fun and very informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Single Woman Needs This Book","review":"Oh how I wish I had this book when I was in my 20s; it would have saved me so much time and so many endless phone calls with grilfriends as we analyzed and rationalized our dates' behavior!!This should be required reading for all single women of all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guys create this for themselves by lying in the first place...","review":"This book just continues to show us how shallow men can be- but thankfully it isn't all men. There are men out there who are able to tell the truth from the beginning and not tell women they will call when they won't.While he does hit the nail on the head about how women make excuses for men and keep hoping they will call or change or marry them, the thing is that men are not being congruent in the first place.How is it that they can run the business world but then the presence of women who they don't like leaves them lying and making up stories about why they can't call.Come on guys grow up and just tell us what you feel. It is better to tell us to our faces rather than continue to show us how insecure you guys are having to cover up your feelings with lies. We are big girls and can handle it -after all we have to handle the weeks of living with the lies you tell up front."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry!","review":"\\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" was a little too harsh for my liking. When reading it, I felt even though it was full of little signs & signals to watch for in relationship; the way the book was written made the average woman feel ignorant for not seeing these things on her own. I much preferred Ian Kerner's book \\"YOU'RE NOT THAT INTO HIM EITHER\\". The author takes many different approaches to identify what kind of man you are actually dating, describes dating fatigue, looks at the definition of booty call, friends with benefits, hookup, No strings attached, etc. This book uses a \\"self-help\\" approach, instead of making the reader feel ignorant for not seeing these facts without reading a book about them.I know this is a very popular and well read book. It has also had a lot of celebrity hype and media attention, sorry; it just didn't do it for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grate book, grate amazon service!!","review":"The book was grate!! but the best is the service thah Amazon gives me... I'm from Mexico, and I bought the normal international mailing, and the book arrive really soon. Congratulations!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for your self image","review":"This was great. It was a fun read and I think every woman should read this book. This novel will give you the ability to look in the mirror and know that you are worth more then you ever thought you were. I loved this book and I loved Whispers of the wicked saints. You should read them both."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eye opener...","review":"Every woman needs to read this book before they get married. Trust me....unless you are a lesbian.

It completely makes sense and I think that every girl should read it and take note!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe you should have listened to your Mom!!!","review":"I decided to read this book after hearing about it from friends and family. I just wanted to see what all the hype was about. Okay, the book is funny, but there is nothing new here. It's the same advice and information that my mom used to give to me when I first started dating. Maybe this book would have been useful if I was 13 and not 30."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read. Really bad advice!","review":"I don't know how this person conducted his research but the book is clearly a farce, it amusing (especially for women) and makes a funny gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"read the product description","review":"Ok, men are simple. Mixed messages mean that \\"they're just not that into you.\\" Ok, 176 pages later... the same thing. Read the product description. Save yourself some time. Do or read something productive (maybe then men will actually be into you and you won't need a book to decipher your inadequacy and failure) It sums it up nicely. Or, God forbid, watch the \\"Sex in the City\\" Episode. Cary Bradshaw probably types it on her laptop in the form of a horribly trite and insipid rhetorical question. She's a writer!!! It's cute... Buy this book with The Da Vinci Code and The South Beach Diet if you are completely retarded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh!","review":"So, I read this on the recommendation of a few good friends who said that, even if I didn't necessarily need the self-help side of it, I would still find it amusing.I didn't.It's all so obvious and so done to death. I couldn't even get through it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"At first I thought that a guy could read this book and add an S to He and you'd have the guys version. After reading it, I realized I was wrong. He's Just not that into you is a humerous book and a joy to read, while still making a point. A must for men and women to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book! Greg Behrendt is a genius!","review":"I love this book so much. I am very happy I purchased it. It's nice to hear a male's perspective on things; one that makes so much sense. This book is very helpful for single women and non-single women. For now on I will be able tell if he really is \\"Just Not That into Me\\" instead of guessing, assuming, or making excuses for him. I won't as Greg says, \\"waste the pretty.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"never received this item or a refund","review":"I never received this item. I never received a refund because I didn't get it.

Too bad a book can't be canceled.......if you can't take the hint when a guy claims to be \\"too busy\\" to call you back or to make plans with you, then you don't need a book, you need a dose of self-esteem and maybe a restraining order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever","review":"This is a fabulous book and a must read for women of all ages. I keep having to buy new copies because I always give mine away to women I think could benefit from it's lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate","review":"This is a difficult book to read because it's not what you want to hear but if you look back on your past relationships, you know this guy knows what he's talking about. It's definitely a great guide to not wasting years on recycling men who just aren't that excited about you. Takes the guessing game out of dating and just pull this book out the next time you start wondering about \\"mixed signals\\" or other games these guys are playing. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tongue-in-cheek humor, a good read.","review":"Some of the suggestions are light-hearted and fun. Don't take this book too seriously. Some guys just need time to get to know you so don't dump them too soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"what was all the hype for?","review":"bla bla bla. This stuff was so obvious! I mean, if he doesn't call you back then he's not into you. Do you really need a book to tell you that?? Phleease."},{"rating":"1","title":"he doesnt want you","review":"The cover of this book makes the book look very interesting, it it is an easy read but this book is not a page turner.This book try to expose mens feelings which really does not work. Also this book is not for a man to read because he will end up putting it down. This is only one side and basically does not give men leeway."},{"rating":"1","title":"No woman in her right mind would enjoy this book.","review":"Aside from the half hearted attempts by the author to make the reader feel mediocre about their physical appearance, this book is a great way to ruin a woman's self confidence. The authors produce a few valid points, but overall I felt they were saying, \\"Give up on men because none of them like you.\\" I feel bad for the young, impressionable minds who read this book and have their self-esteem and confidence detroyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, duh","review":"Mr. Behrendt writes a book and makes money by telling us what we really already know: some guys are afraid of commitment, some can't express their feelings.....\\"Men are From Mars and Women are From Venus\\" does this much better PLUS it tells us how we can learn to communicate with our men. If you want validation for your suspicions of why your relationship didn't work out with your dream guy, this might be worth a read....but read it off the shelf in the bookstore. It's funny but not worth the money. Don't spend the $."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Takes Two","review":"This book was a waste of money. Most of the material revealed in this book was obvious. In addition, this book focuses a lot on what men do inorder to decide whether or not a guy is into a particular women. But it takes two people to make a relationship of any kind work. I am not defending men and their ways. But ladies, if you don't do your part, no matter how much a guy is into you, he is not going to show it or waste his time. I have asked some of my male friends about stuff revealed in this book and they say that it is somewhat true. But they also say it depends on what the lady does that makes them act the way they act. I don't know what group of people were surveyed for this book, but some of the letters to Greg seemed stupid. Who would really write letter like those. As far a comedy, the book was not even really entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"So tough to let go...","review":"Where oh where has this book been all my life? Not to mention the lives of so many other women (and men, for that matter) who have clung to people who are clearly not into them. Funny but I can take all of these scenarios and examples and say \\"Wow, that happened to so-and-so, and things didn't turn out well!\\" Sometimes the so-and-so was me.This is a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but true","review":"I'll say it fast, and I'll say it clearly. I was a hot, cute, young, single woman and attracted my share of men. I am now happily married to a guy who chased me. Not one guy that *I* pursued ever worked out. EVER. I was trained to go after things in work situations. I could never figure it out. I hate to accept the fact that men don't like to be called, asked out, etc. But it just doesn't work. If it works for you, then you have something I don't have!Sadly enough even though I'm married I have had to apply this to several girlfriends. The ones who say they'd love to get together but don't have time. Buh-bye!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"I won't bother giving the premise of the book as everyone seems to know about it.All I will say is that I am really mad at myself for having falling for the hype. I thought this would be a fun book to read.Instead, it seems to make a mockery of relationships and sends the message that all relationships should be the same. I agree with the previous reviewer who said this book is dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'M JUST NOT BUYING THIS BOOK","review":"This book gives misleading information about men who are already in relationships. It claims that a man will string-along his girlfriend while he waits for someone 'better' to come along. The reality is, that most men just take longer to make relationship commitments than women do. Research in psychology and neuroscience confirms this. Most mature men do actually want commitments. Many a woman who reads this book now believes that her boyfriend is 'just not that into her', when really, her guy is just on a different timeline.*I recommend books like \\"What Could He Be Thinking? How a Man's Mind Really Works\\" by Michael Gurian, and also the work of John Gray. Books such as these provide well-researched* insights into understanding men and relationships.Lastly, I think it's a shame that a Hollywood t.v. writer can parade around as if he were an expert in human behavior, and receive so much positive attention for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as \\"earth-shattering\\" as all the hype....","review":"I hate to sound rude, but this book repeats itself SO much....It became annoying to me while reading it. Also, it seemed that the \\"advice\\" provided is more common sense/common knowledge to anyone who's ever had a male friend. Seems more an insult to women than an offer of assistance. If you must read it, buy a used copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, but nowhere near insightful","review":"This book did have some humorous veins, but I did not find it to be the insightful, eye-opening revalation that some claim. Little of the information in this book was new to me. And I am no relationship expert. It seems quite obvious to me that if a man stands me up, beats me, or doesn't call, he is not interested.If you're looking for a quick read, this is a good choice. The large print and varying fonts make it easy to breeze through. I read through the book in about 2 hours.I would NOT recommend this book for someone who has common sense or standards for how she would like to be treated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing in life is this simple","review":"I have not read this book, but I have flipped through it at a bookstore and did see the Oprah episode. I think that this book is far too simplistic and overlooks the fact that everyone is different and that it is impossible to see into someone's mind and know what he or she is thinking. And how dull to constantly have to evaluate your relationships with other people and judge them against someone else's guidelines!The whole self-help trend, particularly in terms of dating books, just feels really creepy and controlling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for a Confidence Boost and a Pick Me Up","review":"I bought this book about a month ago after having it on my \\"want list\\" for a while. I have only skimmed through it a couple times, but I found it to be a great pick me up. It reminds me not to settle for anything (any guy) less than I deserve. If you are like me and have dated the bad boys who don't really put much effort into the relationship but still string you along, this book is a great to give you a wake up call. I love it. It is a must for any woman's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent advice.","review":"This is a great book for how to recognize failure in a relationship/potential relationship. Sometimes things just aren't just going to work out no matter what and you need to recognize it. This book is excellent in this aspect.

Yes... Educational? No...","review":"Anyone that has had a serious relationship should find this humorous, but simplistic.It's all common sense, and not any sort of stellar epiphany within these series of case studies represented by supposed letters from 'women' such as 'Nikki' who seems like the most lobotomized female I have ever read about.If you have had a relationship of any kind, have self-esteem, or are over the age of 17, you should already realize that ACTIONS are what matter, and that men are not that complicated.I recommend that you buy \\"Date Like a Man\\" or \\"Why Men Love Bitches\\" as those are hilarious as well, and while also not really telling anything new, contains useful behavior modification techniques for the lay person. ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"lame","review":"i have read about 1/4 or more into it and lost interest. it makes girls look stupid and i don't like the way it's written - dear abby format. it's lame and a waste of money. i wish i could return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not even dating","review":"This sounded fun and i saw an Oprah show about it.

So, maybe we need the repetition...Hmm, now I'm wondering if I may need to read it again to make sure it soaks in!And just in case you were wondering, none of the guys that I've talked to that have read this have contradicted a single word of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is GREAT!","review":"When I first read this book I was amazed at how much crap and excuses I put up with.

She probably already knows there isn't wholehearted interest! The audience for this book is self-selecting, and while i'm glad it's helped some women out, I do believe there are multiple reasons a man doesn't pursue. The real question is: so now what?

The guide is probably also useful for men similar to him. However, not all men are cast in one mold! If all women followed his advice, there would be a lot of unhappy singles walking around.Greg advises women to drop men who treat them poorly. OK, this is good advice.However, among Greg's strictures: never ask a guy out, never call a guy first, etc., etc. Basically, he is very opposed to a female making the first move. This is ridiculous for two reasons. First, many shy men would find themselves in a bad spot, as well as women who are partial to shy men. Secondly, in this modern day and age, his book simply perpetuates gender roles which are no longer meaningful to a large portion of society.Greg defines relationships with rules and games rather than understanding and communication."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's all the hype about?","review":"I didn't learn a thing about \\"understanding guys\\" from this book. It is lacking in the area of communication and teaching how to get past the facads. This book portrays men in a single category, the kind that are unavailable and dishonest game players to begin with. I agree with a reviewer below, not every guy is the same, and not every woman is the same either. I was more disappointed in this book than I thought I would be. It's over hyped and doesn't deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the currently brokenhearted","review":"This might be a good book if you're confused about why that guy you met 2 weeks ago hasn't called you like he said he would, or why your crush doesn't ever look your way... But this is NOT a book I'd recommend reading after you've been dumped by a guy and you're completely heartbroken. While it might give you a reality-check in other situations, it actually made me feel worse about the breakup, because it basically told me how much my ex-boyfriend doesn't want me and won't ever speak to me again. It might be the truth, but it's not what a girl wants to hear after being dumped! For the brokenhearted women out there, choose \\"It's Called a Breakup Because It's Broken\\" (Behrendt) instead - MUCH better advice that makes you feel good about yourself and the situation at hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really","review":"This book would leave one with the impression that if a man didn't hound you for 6 weeks to date you, then propose within the year, that he's not worth the trouble because he's never gonna commit.It's not without its sound advice, but I think most people are better off trusting their own instincts than a flippant book written by some dude who thinks he knows it all, and some chick who doesn't seem to have much common sense if it isn't first spelled out to her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for humor, not for understanding men","review":"Greg Behrendt may be one of those guys who hates having women call him, but he and his co-writer should be ashamed for writing an entire book based on a stereotype. Most guys do NOT mind being called for a date, especially by women they gave their number to for that purpose!Go ahead and get this book if you're a fan of SATC, but don't assume the advice will apply to more than a relative handful of men. If you're meeting guys who seem like the ones described here, you need to start looking somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, they don't let you give zero stars","review":"I know this book has a billion reviews but I thought I'd do my part to add to the one star reviews as a public service, especially since the movie is coming out. Mind you, one star only because you can't choose zero.My friend instructed me to borrow her copy of this book. At the time I was a self conscious and lonely single woman and thought it might help me learn what I'm doing wrong. Even though I was already annoyed and insulted at the title, I read it.Many have made good points so I won't be a broken record. I just want to share that I met a guy a couple years ago. While he did email me first, he was very slow to respond to me after that. If I listened to this dumb book I wouldn't be married to this wonderful but very shy guy who constantly tells me how lucky he feels to be with me.I guess in Gregg's world men aren't allowed to be shy, they all have to be giant A--holes like him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well it's about time.","review":"I wish every woman would read this book, because it says all the things I never have the heart to say in the face of a friend's breakup issues.This books tells it straight and keeps it to the point. I like that it's said in a man's upfront, no-frills manner, too. What a joy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was true!","review":"I read the book after my sister bought it for herself. In my experience, almost everything in it is true. Except that I don't have to sleep with all of my boyfriends.Example: My new boyfriend was telling me about his past right after I read this book. He said he \\"dated\\" this girl for a little while, but never really \\"asked her out\\" because, as he said, \\"I just didn't like her THAT much\\" - he might as well have said \\"I just wasn't that into her\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"DID Not ever get it yet!","review":"I am very very disapointed... i still have BOT even gotten my book... i bought it for a birthday gift for my sister and i still have NOT gotten it! i am very upset and would like to recieve it soonJessica Kelsey"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dirty Lowdown Truth!","review":"In addition to being funny and a great read, this book really tells it like it is. Not the sugarcoated, politically-correct, picture of how dating is supposed to work, but the actual truth about how it goes in the real world.It is like Sex and the City without the fantasy glitz. It is becoming my bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't take this to heart ladies","review":"I found this book to be horrifying to any woman who's wondering whether or not a guy is into you. First of all it's written by a married man who has to tell you throughout the book how wonderful you are after he says something to push you to tears. The second half is written by a single woman. Not someone I feel comfortable taking advice from if you're looking to find a man to settle down with. What good is her advice if she can't land a man?I read \\"Be Honest, You're Not Really That Into Him\\" and found that to be of much more tremendous help. We don't need to hear why men aren't into us, we need to learn what we're doing wrong. Skip this book and read the suggested one or if you've already read this and feel like total crap, read the later title and you'll feel better in an instant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"It was just an empowering book. I think it speaks very positively of women and is just encouraging us to take men as they are. If they are not into us...we need to get over it, and I think Greg has many good points."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shockingly dead-on target! An eye-opener! Must read!","review":"Although I admit that at first while I was reading, I was starting to feel a little depressed! Oh. So, he just wasn't that into me. Wow. But the more I read and the more I realized this was actually a release of sorts-the better I felt. I don't have to waste time any more wondering this or pondering that. And, I've realized there are certain types that I attract that Hey! Are just not going to be that into me! So therefore, I need to change the parts of me that are attracting that stuff that just is not that good for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A marketing gimmick","review":"If you cannot see how the authors of this book are playing with your heads, then the book is targeted at you.Many men in the dating game treat dating as just that, a game. Women who fall for the good looking trash driving posh cars to hide their insecurities are not \\"thinking clearly\\" to begin with. The players will continue to play and everything in the book describes those players.However, a significant number of men aren't players. There are so many genuine and this book does not do any justice to them.This book tells you what you want to hear to feel good. Of course you will like the book, just as you will like a massage (or any kind of attention that pampers you). If you can't see behind the screen, you deserve to be brainwashed and lose the best men out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Not That Into This Book","review":"I was really disappointed with this book. It is definitely not worth buying in hardcover. I searched for this book, and once I finally found it I was bummed. Girls know everything in this book, but as the book says, they keep questioning themselves. Woman are emotional. Woman get attached. This book isn't going to make me any stronger than I already am when a guy doesn't call me back. Instead of wasting your time reading this book, get out there and meet a guy who'll be just that into you."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying","review":"Frankly I just did not enjoy this book and wish I hadn't spend 12 dollars on it. I wanted to punch the author in the face from the get-go. While I appreciate the intention of the book, the author is condescending and patronizing towards women [\\"at 0400 (that's 4 am, ladies!)\\"] Just irritated me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm just not that into it.","review":"It's pages and pages of whining and excuses. What a waste of time. Never even finish this book. I don't get what the hype is about. The movie was excellent, this book is the complete opposite. I guess I'm not much of a self-help book. I much rather The MANual: A True Bad Boy Explains How Men Think,Date,and Mate--and What Women Can Do to Come Out on Top by Steve Santagati. Much better than this pity party book."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRAVO!!","review":"This book will have you laughing while realizing just how ignorant us women can be. It gives you an outside view as to how dumb we all sound when we make poor excuses for the guy who really isn't worth our time. Greg hits the nail on the head! Its about time there was someone out there who isn't afraid to tell how it really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"There should be a \\"star\\" for infinity!!!","review":"From the moment I heard Mr. Behrendt and co-author on TV talking about this book, I HAD to get it!!! Since it was FLYING off the shelves, I lucked out and got a friendly associate at a bookstore that took my number and called me days later after they got more in, THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!The format of the book is perfect, as if you are having a conversation with the authors. They said some things that I already knew and many that I had thought about but seeing it written in a book validated my thoughts.Easy read, straightforward ways to deal with guys who simply are just not that into you. I tend to read toooo much into guys and try to figure out why they do what they do. Sometimes even blaming myself for a relationship not working out. But to say \\"he just wasn't that into me\\", stops me in my tracks. I don't try to \\"figure\\" guys out now and I see signs much quicker.Thank you for a WONDERFUL book!!

I thought that \\"Why Men Love Bitches\\" was more informative in that respect. There was more hands on advice about what you can do if you have this problem in dating. But if you get tired of reading all these books about how to date, another book I really enjoyed, which was just pure fun for women is \\"Bedtime Stories For Women\\" by Nancy Madore. The sexual fairy tales in her book are definitely more fun than the dates I have been on lately."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Kidding","review":"I already knew all this stuff in this book. I think most people do know this but they deny it when it happens to them. I have seen men actually do the same things this book acuses women of, which is basically chasing someone who doesn't want to be with them. I'm sure this problem has been around for a long time and we have all done it. Hopefully you learn after the second or third (or fourth) time! If you find yourself constantly falling for people who don't to be with you, even this book won't help you. The best thing about this book was the funny way that it was written. It was hilarious to read these scenerios which most of us have experienced from another point of view. It makes you feel a little better about it.Another book I thought was above average is Bedtime Stories for Women, written by Nancy Madore."},{"rating":"1","title":"You know, I really wanted to like it....","review":"Ok. I'll admit it...the guy is funny, and he has written a funny book. But, halfway through, in the midst of my laughter, I realized something: These are real women I am laughing at! This book is Mr. Behrendt's nice way of calling all of us women naive and silly, and he is going to be the one profiting from our supposed inability to \\"understand the male psyche\\"! Ladies, I can sum it up in one sentence: If you don't feel like the guy is crazy about you, and you spend hours analyzing every decision he makes (and making your friends do the same),then you probably deserve better. If you think you deserve flowers and romance and marriage, and he's not willing to offer it---go find a great guy that will. Yes, it is a funny book, but if you are looking for sound relationship advice, I just gave it to you for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I bought this book for entertainment value, thinking it was humor. When I realized it's a completely serious, self help book, I couldn't believe it. Each chapter says the same thing (even thought I couldn't make it past 3 before doing a quick scan the rest of the way.) If anyone actually NEEDS this book to tell them what it does, I feel really bad for those people. I know some men that need to be told when a woman is not that into them (hint, hint) so maybe there are women this dense out there. If you are intelligent, not desperate and looking for a humorous book, you can find one elsewhere.If I'm making a mistake and it was written for humorous purposes, it's not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful!","review":"I found this book to be very insightful, I now feel like I can make wiser decisions when I meet someone and determine if I should move on more quickly..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comedy","review":"If this book were written as is but identified as a broad satiric \\"fictional\\" comedy, then I think it would be more accurate. However, it's presented as a sincere \\"self-improvement\\" book that is being gobbled up as gospel by both men and women which is both sad and dangerous. The publishers missed a great chance at creating a comic gem that is a reflection of our times. Apparently, the makers of the film that was inspired by this book, blew that chance as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am not that into it...","review":"I have yet to find a relationship book that doesn't sugarcoat the truths. It will be difficult, because those truths are ugly. To every situation this book offers a comforting answer that \\"he is not into you\\", while it doesnt anwer the most burning question \\"why\\" and all these women happily continue to make the same mistake again. A few times this book had shining moments, like that guys would be glad to destroy \\"friendship\\" for sex, but they are so shy they almost go unnoticed. You will never learn anything useful from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"great money making scam A BOOK","review":"This book was so incredibly stupid I can't believe this.

I couldn't even make it through the entire book simply because I got tired of all the excuses made by these dillusional women for men who really aren't even worth it. This book is a generalization stating that all men are the same, when they are not. Each situation is different, and all it takes to figure out that a man is not that into you is a little common sense. Anyone who feels they actually need advice from this complete stranger, obviously needs a book on common sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever!","review":"This is truely a great book.

I read this book and came to a realization...a man that is INTO YOU will not treat you this way. Not long after, I met a great guy who treats me like a Queen, makes me his #1 priority and there was no doubt or question in my mind about how much he loves me.As women, we like to make excuses for men instead of facing the truth...HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU HONEY.

If you are having trouble in your intimate relationships why don't you go and learn about YOURself and the things INSIDE you that could be getting in the way? It's a hard journey but well worth the price. The two stars go to the authors (doomed) effort to try and help their best in this complicated arena."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love at first sight or nothing at all?","review":"Greg is suggesting that all good relationships begin with love at first sight - the two are completely smitten with each other from the get go and that if this does not happen then then nothing will ever happen...Look at all the relationships around you and ask yourself how often this is the case? I believe that love can grow over time as people get to know each other. I'm not saying that if you're into a guy you should keep calling/stalking him when he's not getting in touch with you - I'm just saying that it's not always as clear cut as Greg suggests.He's also forgetting about shy guys who are totally into you but would rather live a loney life then risk the embarrassment of being rejected. And there are many of them.Quite entertaining, light, magazine like reading though which is why I give it the second star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harsh, but makes sense","review":"I saw this book on the shelf at my local library, picked it up, started thumbing through it, then sat down and read pretty much the whole thing, right there at the library. I ended up checking it out and bringing it home, so that I could read passages to a very dear friend who was going through a breakup. In the past, I had found myself making excuses for the guy, pretty much like the women in this book. After reading this, I think I finally understood that no one who really cared about my friend would treat her like he did. In the end, though it is harsh, this book is empowering. For my friend, it was better to say \\"he's not that into me\\" and move on, versus going around and around about what she might have said, or done, etc.I think that some of the examples in this book were a bit extreme, but of course they were there to illustrate or prove a point. A quick read, but one whose message has stuck with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gives it to you straight","review":"It took me three days to read this book, simply because it was giving it to me straight.

That's not a boyfriend, that's a stalker. In fact, I had one of those guys once, and now have a restraining order against him. Women enjoy a challenge too.

I could not put the book down because the responses were quite funny. The scenarios and answers were blantantly obvious, but reading Greg's responses were a good laugh. Sometimes the book was a little offensive to women's intelligence, but then I looked at many of my friends (and myself included) and realized women do and think dumb things when it comes to men! Sometimes you do just need that slap in the face to know he's just not that into you! The book is obviously intended for laughs, not for any real self help when it comes to men, so if you are looking for just a good laugh, get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MOST HONEST AND FUNNY BOOK I EVER READ!","review":"This book basically throws in your face all the rotten stupid pathetic excuses we give for the jerks in our life and makes you realize that it's not \\"ok\\" to settle for crap and that it's better to alone then with someone and \\"lonely\\" ..The book hit home like no other and I recommend this book to any successful, talented, beautiful woman out there who is still asking herself why she keeps attracting losers and accepting less then what she deserves. You will realize that the excuses you've been given to these losers is a joke and that they aren't worth a second more of your time. Thanks Greg and Liz.

I am sharing it with all of my single friends!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth that everyone's too scared to believe","review":"Ladies, if you are having a hard time with the reality of relationships, or if you tend to miss all the signs that guys are sending you, then this is the book for you. This book is coming from the perspective of a real man, Greg, who isn't afraid to be truthful. Greg states the good, bad and the ugly of dating and being in a committed relationship. This book includes advice, truth and fun humor that can give you the courage to be single and free. It was a great read, especially for girls and younger women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't all this stuff a NO DUH?!?!","review":"Come on girls... think with your heads! The problem we women have is that we think too much with our hearts, and we stop seeing what's right in front of us. Maybe if we woke up collectively, books like this wouldn't have to be written. Having said all that, the book was well-written, but for what I paid for it, I expected it to last more than 4 hours (which is what it took me to finish it). If you've been through the married man, the man that will never get married again, the relationship with no passion, and any variations of the aforementioned, I think you will find this book not quite as interesting as many of the readers do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truthiness and the some.","review":"So I found this book in the lounge where I work and flipped through during lunch. If you get past the myriad of typos, the flawed/non-existent logic, and the fact it's not funny, there's pretty much nothing left but a nice looking cover.Still, even though I don't think of myself as an idiot, I took the book to heart. So days later when I ended up in the ER and had a very gorgeous doctor who seemed wildly attentive considering I only had a sprained ankle (he asked me for my number) and he didn't call, I assumed, \\"Hey, he's just not into me.\\" and went about my life.Flash forward six months later, I get a call from a number I don't recognize. I let it go to voice mail purgatory only to discover it's my \\"He's just not into you\\" Doctor saying, \\"I've been waiting the required six months before I could call you. I practiced calling you every day.\\"Hmmm, you think he's just not into me? or maybe this worked out because I played by the \\"rules\\". who knows? It's all hooey."},{"rating":"1","title":"and the problem is.....","review":"The problem is not that he's just not that into you.... it's that you're wayyy too much into him!!!Ladies! Get a life and stop pining!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"this book is worthless and the women who read it for serious help are idiots. to understand the problems with the book, look no further than the 2 authors: 1 man and 1 woman.first: women do not understand how men think, and if they try to tell you otherwise they are morons.second: you may say \\"but hey, look a guy co-authored the book!\\" so it must be factual. but no straight man would ever participate in creating a book like this. and if the author is gay then he has just as little insight into the mind of a straight man as the female author.so, buy this book as a gag gift or something, but if you have to be a fool to take it seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Women you have to earn our love!","review":"Greg Behrendt is a genius who is the executive editor of \\"Sex in the City\\" it's no wonder this book is #1, he was on the Lary king Live and Opera Winfrey. It just goes to show you women if a guy is not feeling it that doesn't means he's gay or intimidated your just not his type or classey or smart enough also he's knows he's out of your league. Men don't always go by looks. Women are imature to understand this book and Greg Behrendt cause he's a real man who is out of a 1,000 women league."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's Just Not That Into You: The No-Excuses Truth to Understanding Guys","review":"Loved the book!

I read on a for men website that if I ask for a break, that means I really want to break up with him. Not true. I recently just asked for some time apart in my relationship. My reason? I just want to see how into me he really is, if my absense making his heart grow fonder and vice versa. If the feelings are still there, I definitly want to continue the relationship. Though some of the things may be signs, you can't base a failed relationship with it. Haven't you ever held back in some ways because you fear rejection and don't want to put yourself out there or look to needy? Maybe men are that way too. Read this book reviews from the men, almost 100% of them do not agree with the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not that into this book","review":"I bought this book expecting to be drawn in with witty writing and relevent stories. I just could not get into it past the first 2 pages, and the book has been collecting dust ever since. Pretty cover design though, and good title. Still, money wasted as far as I'm concerned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surely You Jest...","review":"I've never seen \\"Sex and the City\\", and now I'll make sure I never do. This book just rehashes \\"The Rules\\" ad nauseum. If you accept simplistic stereotypes of the sexes, then enjoy. But if you have evolved enough as a human being to understand that people/relationships are complex, skip this book. OK, I confess; I didn't read it entirely, either; just a portion. That's as much time as I was willing to waste, and I'm CERTAINLY glad I didn't invest any money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious/Honest","review":"I just haaad to write SOMETHING about this book. I had been on NUMEROUS dates in the past month-- going from one frog to another. It gets you down after a while. I decided to pick up this book and read it- LOVED IT! Greg is so honest that it's funny how us women actually MISS the red flags that men show us. This book will certainly help you determine the difference between a red flag and a shadow in your relationship....and will give you the confidence that will help you say \\"SEE YA\\" to Mr. WRONG! =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"From a 24 year old male...","review":"this book really misses the mark. it clearly lumps us men into a dumb, unemotional, self-absorbed category. yet it preaches that women should be able to dump their man with no emotional consequences and that the relationship should revolve their every wants, needs and desires. it speaks nothing of a mutually benefital relationship or a way to mend the problems plaguing the relationship, it's just dump him, dump him, dump him and oh i forgot to mention dump him. the one star is given because it is great for holding the door open and also letting any jerry springer type women know they shouldn't date a married man."},{"rating":"1","title":"forget the book, read these reviews!","review":"I bought the book at a recent book signing (I'm a sucker for marketing) and have read some of it (it doesn't say anything new after the title). The book isn't as smart as it positions itself to be, and is actually quite shallow and not well thought out at all. Moreover, there is a typo within the first few pages \\"he let's you know\\" which shows you how quickly they slapped this together.What you *should* do is read the reviews on here. They are waaaay funnier than the book, and a lot of them are actually insightful, with good, well thought out advice... everything this book is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not applicable to every relationship","review":"As a guy, I feel that Greg Behrendth extremely oversimplifies mens' relationship to women in this book. While his ideas may be applicable a portion of the time (and a large portion for that matter), the book gives the message that any man giving mixed signals is not interestd in a relationship. When I saw Mr. Behrendth on the Oprah Winfrey show last year, I was very dissapointed that this message was being sent out to thousands of women who may now have lost men who really loved them but, for whatever reason, were not yet able to commit or were giving mixed signals for a variety of other reasons. I don't think he should lead readers to assume that the lack of strong, direct signals indicate a relationship is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't buy this- you deserve better","review":"Ok, so I have a brother and a large number of male friends who come to me for advice on women. I can tell you this much: if never pays to generalize- you will make a lot of harmful assumptions. Generalization gives us all sorts of negative things, such as sexism and racism, and even marketing for that matter. The best we can ever do is use common sense, and get advice from people who respect us and who know a particular situation. Sure you can read a book that tells you \\"Don't get tricked into asking him out. If he likes you, he'll do the asking.\\" and pretend that there is no shy guy out there who is intimidated by your looks and intelligence and doesn't think he can get a girl like you. You could lose good opportunities that way. Also, think of the endless paranoia that reading a plethora of \\"he's not interested\\" situations can bring.In short, save yourself some money. Use common sense instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Advice","review":"I have just read the book and have found the advice very helpful. As the book says..every women should have this book on their nightstand!!!! Not only is the book for women but men can relate to it as well. Good Job in writing such a wonderful interpretation into guys (and some womens) excuses!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely one sided","review":"Wow, seriously! I'll admit there is some good common sense information in this book a lot of women could use. If the guy you're interested doesn't call you back or doesn't want to sleep with you, duh! But this author is way too ethnocentric. He's coming from a typical aggressive American kind of attitude that is absolutely not the way that ALL men are. What if the guy you like is from India, (or France, or Germany or...) do you think he'll behave in the exact predictable way that this author would? Hardly- he completely denies that men are different, have different emotional needs, different backgrounds, morals and values. All men do not behave in exactly the same predictable ways. Give me a break Greg!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money girls!","review":"This book was so depressing, I couldn't even finish reading it and I'm sorry I read as much as I did. I was depressed for a week after reading it. This book oversimplifies the very complex world of dating and male/female relationships. Basically it tells you in a dozen chapters what could be said in one page. This book focuses on alot of the bad things guys do but it gives little hope or advice on where to find a good man who will treat you with respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right On!","review":"This book may sound like psycho babble b.s. but when you get right down to it, it's right on! I loved that there was a female interjection at the end of every chapter because after all, that's what us females do! It's good advice delivered in a comedic package, thanks Greg!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So helpful","review":"I cannot tell you how helpful this book was for me.So many excuses we make for the men in our lives,rather than admitting that he probably aint that interested.Funny and heartfelt at points,worth a read if you are dating,at any age."},{"rating":"1","title":"so now what do I do?","review":"Ok, so he's not that into me. I got the message. Now what? This is where I was hoping for answers, and just didn't get them. The book is funny and easy to read, but it doesn't give more in the area of what to do next. I wish it did."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm just not that into this book","review":"If there is one word to sum up this book it's overrated.Honestly, I don't own this but my sister does. I was frustrated with some dating foibles a few years back when she hoisted 165 pages of pure unabridged crapfest into my direction.It's almost insulting, yet is so poorly written that it's comical, amusing, and entertaining. Plus it's a fast read, sort of a \\"wham, bam, thank you for wasting the last 2 hours of my life\\"Perhaps it serves as a reminder to those girls that are not dismissive of guys that just don't call? Maybe so, and in that, it's a noble endeavor.Quit obsessing over lame-o's, girls and maybe you can spend the $15 on something more worthwhile than this book, like martinis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Book to Demean Women","review":"I think a good number of the newer self-help (dating/relationship) books out there give a pass to the men who are selfish, immature, and like game-playing when it comes to dating. This book supports the belief that women are objects to either be chosen or discarded at the man's whim. It also supports the myth that every woman who is dating wants to marry and very soon. In a nutshell, this book paints most men to be so egotistical, that they couldn't spot a decent woman if they saw one. Nor would they want her if she was available because they have so many other choices. Do you really want to take relationship advice from a writer from \\"Sex and the City\\". Nah, I didn't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book says excuses not doing, you need to find a reason why not.","review":"This book purports the easy way out, quitting. If you take the author's advice you will fall into the \`self help book quandary.' That being you will find an excuse NOT to when you need to find a reason WHY NOT. Forever you will find reasons and rationalizations. I bet, if you are old enough, the rules didn't work either. Neither will this!As a guy, I say that I don't agree with this book. In a world where men's traditional role in society is under attack (not a bad thing) and women are gaining power and influence in society, men are having self esteem issues. Not every man is Mr. Big, we don't all know we can \`get' whatever we want. Thus when a man is not coming after you 110% it MAY just be that he is not 110% sure in himself. It used to be that men would be chasing women however, in a brave new world, women need to chase men a little more. Give us a nudge and we will go a mile with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only read if you would like to be called an idiot!","review":"This book is the most degrading thing I have ever read. The author cleary does not actually LIKE women. Although I may agree that he is making some points here that we all know and advise that we could all give to our friends, but have a hard time following ourselves, I feel that the way this book is written it is actually extremely insulting. I would highly recommend reading the book, \\"Be Honest, You're Just Not That Into Him Either\\" by Ian Kerner - who is an actual sex tharapist and psychologist and who can also be very honest, but in a way that at least leaves a woman feeling like he is not calling her an idiot. His book is much more helpful, this one is not worth your wasted time!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this is gonna be a gift for some girls I know :)","review":"The number of times I have felt the need to bang my head against the wall while listening to one of my girlfriends lament that she \\"can't understand\\" this guy she likes are uncountable. Women have conditioned themselves to make excuses for guys and fall over themselves to make themselves \\"better\\" for their perceived love interest. It's nice to see a book that says, don't bother. Behrendt is refreshing and honest (isn't that how we want our men to be?) and explains that not only are some guys not interested, but it doesn't matter because if you stop fretting over the ones that aren't you'll find the one who is. Now instead of having to try to shake some sense into my friends, I can hand them this book and say \\"don't talk to me about your problems with so-and-so until you finish reading this.\\" Of course, then if that doesn't work, I could throw the book at them and KNOCK some sense into them..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing in life is this simple","review":"I have not read this book, but I have flipped through it at a bookstore, and I did watch the Oprah episode. I find the whole concept kind of creepy and controlling...as many others have mentioned, people are complex and none of us really know what is going on in someone else's mind. People tend to get so obsessed with self-help books searching for that perfect solution to what are basically just the trials of living life. My thought is that you should just be yourself and follow your heart- yes, you may get hurt, but what kind of life are you going to lead if you worry about every little signal a guy sends you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"ok so most men really are punks who arent str84ward, so?","review":"Women, don't buy this book. If you don't know what the authors are saying then 1) you're seriously naive; 2) you're in complete denial; 3) you're seriously retarded or perhaps you're all three. Yes, men aren't usually straightforward and instead of just \\"I'm not feelin's you\\" they have to do all kinds of bs to let you know that. However, this is not rocket science nor some new, startling revelation. You do not need to spend $19.95 to find this out (and I'm glad I didn't...skimming is great!). What would be a great revelation (and what Greg conviniently leaves out) is why most men act like scared little mice when they're not into a girl and just don't come forward with the truth. Then again I guess that not too hard to figure out either although I'm sure someone will unforunately write a book on that too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually a negative 1","review":"Sex in the City is over. Over. This is just a thinly veiled disguise of the male pig. 100% pure chauvenism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Negativity","review":"I don't even understand why this book is so popular. I suppose I should blame Oprah.I'm a firm believer that you can be with anyone you wish to be with. It is how you approach the situation. If you approach a man with wearing all of your insecurities on your sleeve, he probably won't be \\"that into you\\". And, this here is a the perfect segue into the main problem with this book.Most relationship problems are related to self-esteem issues and negativity. This book does not address how to manage your self-esteem. It does not go into why you feel that you need this one person. It tries to provide a simple solution to a not so simple problem a lot of women have. Worst of all none of these people have any degrees on psychology at all!Maybe this book is good for the few women that cannot get past the negativity they feel for being ignored, cheated on, ditched, ect. At this point though, I would recommend taking a break from relationships in general, but I digress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book is very simple, and maybe a little too easy to read. The advice is practical and clear cut; very helpful when one is in the 'fog' of a breakup. It is written in a way that makes you laugh at yourself and your painful situation; definitely helps keep break-ups into perspective. Each chapter lists a different form of break-up excuses, eventually you reach one that matches your own situation, and you quickly identify with it. I think many give the author 'guru' like qualities he does not deserve, and the \\"he's just not into you\\" is quite repetitive, but that's the basic point. A great book, I am glad I read it, it did help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't we just be ourselves?","review":"Behrendt's attempt at labeling and dividing makes me cringe. My experience tells me that both men and women are merely humans, good and bad, hot and not. After all, we're all a \\"can of worms\\" to some extent, so isn't it a matter of going about our lives, keeping our eyes open for opportunities to mesh our \\"worms\\" with someone else's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Good","review":"I bought this book after seeing iton The [...] Show. It seemed like areally good informational book but, It wasextremely boring and gaveinformation most women already know"},{"rating":"1","title":"The title pretty much sums it up...","review":"Not much need to read the book if you've read the title. The author states it outright: men are not that complicated...but then we knew that all along. Food, sleep, sex and sports -- what else do they need?Behrendt tries to soften the blow with continual assurances that we are hot, pretty and deserve someone better. He's right about that, too, and if we stop giving it up for men who don't deserve us, it's more likely that we will find someone who does. So when men are no longer getting sex, they will have Behrendt to thank for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a helpful book for women in \\"relationships\\".","review":"Read this book with numerous girlfriends and we all loved it! Every excuse that we have ever made for a guy is covered and ripped apart! Left us all feeling empowered and sure that we would be able to detect the next time a guy just wasn't that into us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obvious","review":"The \\"review\\" by Karen Hudson probably is better advise than anything he wrote in the book. He states the blatantly obvious and he has clearly hung out with a less than stellar croud of men. If it isn't terribly obvious that's because that particular advise is wrong 50% of the time. The best thing he said was don't chase, which if you are chasing a guy, he's running for a reason so forget him."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK SUCKS!!","review":"This is the worst book I've ever read! Ladies, if you have any shred of self respect, dignity, and self-confidence...DO NOT waste your money! All this book does is fatten the bank account of an egotistical maniac who provided advice and input on a terrible TV show about a bunch of women with low self esteem who liked to sleep around. Save your money, or better yet, spend it on a book that is actually very well written: \\"Get Smart With Your Heart\\" by Suzanne Lopez."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate","review":"While this book was an entertaining read, it was above all inaccurate. When I finished reading this book, the impression I got was, unless he buys you a diamond ring on your 3 month anniversary, or lets 12 hours go by before calling after a date, he's just not that into you. Oh, ok. So if he leaves towels on my bathroom floor, it MUST be because he's not that into me, versus the obvious fact that he's lazy when it comes to hanging up towels.If I were a man and a woman I was interested in avoided doing any work in the relationship whatsoever to test how interested I was, believe me, it wouldn't last long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass...","review":"Some of the things in this book are things that we all know. If he doesnt call you then he doesnt like you... thats simple. But in this book they make you think that if everything wasnt perfect then \\"hes not that into you\\".If you are reading it for fun then fine. But if you need help to know if he is the one... pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time...","review":"There are lots of great books on relationships out there... this is definately NOT one of them. Written totally from a man's point of view (center of the universe it would seem) and an admitted \\"dog\\" as a single man, this book was somewhat amusing at times. However, if you are looking for real advice on relationships or dating, look elsewhere! Dateworthy by Dennie Hughes is a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"My wife would have dumped me","review":"If she had read the book. Now she's very happy I'm her husband (we have been married 17 years). She stood by be in the days when my confidence was shaken and I was not \\"All There\\" It makes me love here more knowing she didn't give up on me.I read the book to see if it could help my teenage daughter. Not appropriate for teenagers! Too much mature info.The book is too hard on men. We are not perfect. I know that's not what we should say now a days, but its true. Guys have fears and guys have doubts. There are jerks and dead-beats out there. However some of guys will break-up because they don't think they are good enough for this wonderful lady.100% of guys surveyed said, \\"We are not perfect. We do get depressed. We say and do things we regret.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A boor's cheap attempts at rationalizing matelessness","review":"Greg Behrendt is a comic, and a very successful one at that. And, as the executive producer of a trashy but wildly popular TV series, he's likely highly qualified to write about the tricks of boors, philanders, and charlatans. But he's not a psychologist, and therefore his opinions concerning human behavior are just that, his opinions. Yet, he makes sickening generalizations like, \\"... a guy will ask out a woman ... if he's into her. He might need a little more encouragement than normal, I'll give you that. You might have to lead [him] to water, but you better not help ask him out. Once again, ladies, a wink and a smile will do it.\\"Using Behrendt's childishly superficial logic, obese men are that way because they don't to be slim, unemployed men are without work because they don't want jobs, and shy men who endure lifetimes of crushing loneliness do so because they're \\"just not into you.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"He's Just Not That Into You","review":"Great book! I loved it! Good and easy reading to help you through a time of questionning the validity and quality of what you're doing in your relationship, or who you're in the relationship with. The authors answer your questions with ease, humor and sarcasm! They don't keep you guessing AT ALL on how they feel. I liked the male and female perspective in each chapter. I liked the way they empowered the reader and made you feel like they were speaking specifically to you, the reader. It's good to read once, and then reference certain chapters a few more times to drill what they're saying in your head! I'd definetly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent advice!!!!","review":"This book will save lives. Literally. It is written in an easy to read format, lots of good humor, sensible advice, very down to earth. It's like sitting down for a serious chat with the big brother a lot of us women needed but never had.And if a woman follows the advice, even just the advice in the first few chapters, she will greatly lower the odds of becoming trapped in any sort of abusive relationship - physically abusive or emotionally abusive. Yes, the authors do cover the abusive relationship in the last chapter, but you don't have to read even that far for sound advice on how to avoid such unhappiness.And it's *much* easier to have fun on the dating scene if you know how to tell the diff between a guy who really just wants to have a good time that day and one who's in love with *you*."},{"rating":"2","title":"Striking a chord","review":"This book isn't the gosple of dating, but the advice it gives on dating is pretty liberating.

Not one of us was, in Greg's very special opinion, was going out with a guy who was really into us. Not one of us had ever met a guy who was really into us. The book depressed us for about a week. Then we decided we had to forget about it. The book says if you're not with Romeo, you're with a jerk. Of course, Greg might be right. I'm not a guy, I don't know. But it seems like less of a way for girls and women to find good men, and more of something to help guys get girls out of their faces.

But this book isn't correct. Let me tell you my own (short) story. I was a single guy, dating occasionally, enjoying the city. Couple of times I met women and began to get serious, only to get dumped/burned and hurt.Then I meet a great girl and this time I think \\"better slow right down, it it's to be, it'll be\\". I made the first call, but after a dinner or two, I got on with my life and waited for an occasion where we were with mutual friends again. I should stress that I wasn't playing games, just protecting my heart.Result? Five years of happy (with ups and downs) marriage later, two beautiful boys and a gorgeous wife I'd support in all she does and wants to be.Behrendt on the other hand, would have you believe that my not pursuing her like a dog on heat meant I wasn't interested.The lesson? No idea. But I guess what's meant for you, won't pass by you."},{"rating":"1","title":"For daters, not married people","review":"Relationships dont work when a man and women are totally equal 50/50. Too much tension, and power struggling. The most successful marriages I know are when either the man or woman has slightly more control.

The key to getting something out ofthis book is to read it with an open mind. Having this book written byBehrendt you get the male perspective on things which is nice. Ithought the check lists after each chapter were helpful because itreinforces what you just learned. This book I would say isappropriate for women in their twenties who have not been in long-termcommitted relationship. I think there are enough examples in this bookfor everyone to get something out of it. What I took away from the bookis that life is short and there are many more fish in the sea.

Particularly women who feel that they are not been treated the way they should be treated by the man in their life. I enjoyed reading this book. It gave me a lot of insite into men and their actions. I read this book as a way of getting over a failed relationship. Reading the letters from women in the book showed me how I was accepting less (much less actually) than I deserved just to have someone in my life. I now realize that if someone really cares about me, he wouldn't treat me like crap and that I can do much better and deserve much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"It may save you some heart ache","review":"Ok, read this book before you go out and start to date. I like this book from the perspective that before you get invested with the guy watch how the treats you. Now once again, do not get invested with a guy until you see how he treats you. This book suggests you deserve someone that will treat you the way you want to be treated. Do not settle for less.It is a little cold hearted, but I think for the most part this book might save you some anguish. This book almost employs the tough love approach. You can not work from the perspective that you can make someone into the person that you want them to be, but if they do not match your standards move on, immediately.Once again this book isn't about forming deep and meaningful relationships, but should really be a way to cull through the men in your life, and finding your keepers.

I'm very glad I did. I think it was originally done in 1999, and obviously technology has jumped leaps and bounds since then, but I found this dvd very informative and it did not put me to sleep, as almost every single instructional video has. I have purchased several instructional videos over the years for a variety of instruments such as guitar, drums, keyboards, bass and recording, and I think this has definitely been the most watchable, thus probably most useful. Is some of it a bit corny, sure, but I'm sure there was no million dollar budget to make it, either. I feel they put a lot of work into it to make it a little offbeat and mixed humor with information. The information was very very helpful.Again, I highly recommend it and am grateful to the producers of the dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"I still do not know what this dvd is supposed to teach...","review":"I find the dvd useless.

Unfortunately the adult who has to put this together is going to be ticked off when they realized the piece of crap they are about to deal with. The four post of the bed are very poorly made, if you give it one squeeze too much, you just cracked the wood on the bed. If you twist the bed post to not crack them, you will see how lose and wobbly they are. Its a no win situation. You have to crack the wood (which they warn to not twist too tight to prevent this) in order for it to align right. Garbage, but I put it together and the material covers the cracks. I suppose if you wanted to go all out you could putty and paint them back up.The canopy on top has two rails, but its not enough to hold the canopy up and it keeps sinking or sliding off.

I called the company, but they were closed. They are only open Monday-Thursday and this was Friday. Needless to say my daughter was disappointed, and I had to return the item to the store. I wonder how many defective cribs they shipped this holiday season! Interestingly enough, they include a flyer that if a product is defective to please call them and not contact the seller. After seeing the poor quality of this product I would not risk buying from this company again. I had just bought the Melissa and Doug high chair, which was a breeze to set up.

In addition, it's release comes at a time when male vocalists are paying more attention to lyrics that can stand on their own as literature, which is truly Rosa's niche. Without a doubt this is not only Rosa's best effort yet in his long career, but is one of the best bodies of work collected this year. If you love Matchbox 20 and The Wallflowers, you'll love this album. If you love reading Neruda, Rimbaud and Simic, then buy it for no other reason than to listen to the words of \\"Then\\". Here's hoping this gets some campus radio play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stabbing your eardrums with toothpicks would be more entertaining...","review":"Dear God - this is pretentious, bland pop trash at it's worst.First, right out of the way, let me say that I was looking forward to getting this disk, after listening to a snippet of the first track, 'Embryo'.Also let me say, I hadn't listened to any of Rosa's solo albums prior to that snippet, but I was a big fan of his work with Maggie's Dream, and I can't say that I was prejudiced against him regarding the whole Menudo thing. You break into the business however you can, I guess.But this...The first track being the exception here, the music is bland and uninspired, the lyrics are pretentious attempts at 'poetry', and Rosa's voice has the most annoying, droning whine imaginable to it.Ug.Luckily enough, I got it used for less than $5."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent introduction to Irish martial arts","review":"Before you see Martin Scorcese's film 'Gangs Of New York', read John W. Hurley's book 'Irish Gangs And Stick-Fighting'. Scorcese's film is based on the first half of the book'The Gangs Of New York' which deals exclusively with Irish gangs. And while it's flashy and exotic, there isn't much substance in the original book; it doesn't explain the traditions of the Irish gangs or the famous Irish shillelagh, it simply describes them in a sensational way. Hurley's book remedies this problem. It provides first hand accounts of Irish gangs and fights, written by a 'reformed' Irish stick-fighter, and vividly describes Ireland's fighting culture which was goverened by a code of honour which Hurley rightly calls 'Shillelagh Law'. If you are Irish or have an interest in Irish gangs, Irish boxing, the shillelagh, or Scorcese's film, you will really enjoy this book - I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Subject","review":"As the works of Carleton can be read for free at Google books for one the only reason to spend money on this book is for the introduction and notes. The editor has expanded on the introduction in his work on the shillelagh so you would be better off spending your coin on that instead. The notes are interesting but anyone who can make it through Dickens won't have any trouble with Carleton.The Faction Fight story is full of the negative Irish stereotypes the editor campaigns against. Neal Malone is a mysoginistic folk talethat was probably socially acceptable when it was written. The best of the bunch by far is the Party Fight and Funeral, which is a biographical essay.I would recommend \\"Shillelagh\\" before this book, but based on its own merits I got four stars worth of entertainment and education from this tome."},{"rating":"1","title":"I needed help, but sorely disappointed!","review":"I thought that this book would be more helpful than it was. In fact, out of the church seasons I have used it, Advent through Easter, I have used material from it only twice. The format is appealing if you use a lectionary to develop your preaching calendar, but for the cost, it should be more productive. Part of the problem is that it is much to brief on a week to week basis. Not helpful at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst World History SAT Book I've Seen","review":"I bought this book out of hope for a supplement to the official guide. However, the tests in this book deviate drastically from the official tests and the collegeboard book on world history and U.S. history. It focuses very much (about 10% of all questions) on post-WWII history, while that portion of history merely represents around 1% of the real test.I would advise people who are looking at this Kaplan book to consider other options, especially the official one. I haven't used the Princeton Review one yet but Barrons is another option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong book, study and succeed","review":"I studied only from this book, and got an 800 on the test even though my world history class failed to cover most of the material and I had to learn it from scratch. This book will give you the tools you need to succeed-add hard work and stir for a good score.The only downside is that I wish there were more practice questions at the end of the review sections, because it's sometimes hard to know if you've really mastered the right material."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"Prince Mirsky's good old book has in fact not been excelled by any other work concerning Russian literature from its beginnings to 1900. It is packed with information, and still very comprehensive and intriguing indeed in its analyses and anecdotes.It also provides some entertaining lingual gems - the writer Derzhavin's prose, for example, is by Mirsky characterised as 'virile', and his philosophy as 'manfully thankful for the joys of ephemeral life', while the influent literary criticist Belinsky's style is condemned as 'execrable lingo'.Anyone interested in Russian literature should read this book. As a reference book it serves excellently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I really love this boxed set, it comes nicely packaged unlike Family Tree which was pretty, but unruly. I didn't have plans to buy this as I have all the concets on DVD and didn't think it would add much to have them on cd. Well I was wrong, this is a great boxed set to have and all the cd's are really, really excellent! I especially loved An Echo, A Stain on the Vespertine disc and 5 Years on the Homogenic disc. I recommend listening to all of the discs with a GOOD pair of headphones!!! A definite must have. Here's to you Bjork!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Footnote to my previous review","review":"I'll concede that, yes, I was a bit too harsh in my condemnation of the box set. One way or another, you need to hear the \`unplugged' Debut material and the \`Jools Holland show' performances...But, as I said, these and other items are already available on DVD. Only one and a half discs of previously-unreleased material is not worth forty-something US dollars, even with the mini-DVD and booklet taken into account.And my criticisms still stand regarding the \\"play-it-safe\\" track selection. Perfectionism is not a virtue where archival releases are concerned - someone like Bjork who puts so much experimentation and improvisation into her live performances requires a live album - if you get my drift - less like 'Frampton Comes Alive' and more like \`You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore'."},{"rating":"2","title":"BJ-RK IS THE BEST!!!","review":"YAYYYY, I LOVED THIS BOX SET, IT HAS PLUTO LIVE ON HOMOGENIC LIVE, IT'S THE BEST!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok, So I'm cheating....","review":"I just placed my order for this, though I have not recieved it.

I've seen all the DVDs and if this is in fact like those then I would happily have those versions playing in the car or wherever I can't bring my DVD player.More importantly I want to know if anyone else noticed the amazing anomaly on \\"Enjoy\\" (track one, Post disc). It's from the Shepard's Bush Empire concert. Something went very wrong with the sampler it seems, but it sounds so amazing I am excited like a 7 year old on his birthday with dinosaurs on his cake that this version is included.I noticed this a long time ago and I posted a question concerning this a while ago on a message board.

IMO, this is certainly one of the most aggressive and also most talented bands amongst the death metal bands. The more I listen to this record, the more I get it. This is an ultra dark work of metal....total death! Oh, and this has to be one of the best album covers yet made."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I can say is, Holy crap!!!","review":"Wow, just wow, this album blew me away. It is incredibly heavy as f***!! There isn't one song that is disappointing, it delivers a crushing blow to your ear drums and I absolutely love every song on this CD.

But beyond that, this guy lives a life many of us, me included would love to. He gets these zany ideas, then he acts on them! Kind of like George Plimpton's inside view on sports, this is vicarious pleasure. In this book, Wallace pledges to say \\"Yes,\\" to everything. The results of this simple, yet profound manifesto, are hilarious, amazing and even moving. We not only follow Wallace's adventures, but the journey of his conscience, his internal battles as he fights to stay true to his commitment. I alternated between thinking the guy was certifiably crazy, with bouts of wishing I had his nerve. A totally fun and engaging read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and with a point","review":"This book was great for a good laugh and also for a different perspective on life.

I had seen it years ago and was familiar with it and what it was about; but actually read it after seeing the movie. I knew that the book was much different than the movie (it was non-fiction - not a novel) before I started. Never-the-less there is quite a bit in the book that made it, in a different form, into the film. Of course a Hollywood movie is going to ham things up quite a bit.The book, and the movie as well, both have a nice, positive message - say yes more often and new, gratifying experiences will follow - and it is true!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very enjoyable read","review":"i highly enjoyed the author's spirit of positive thinkingespecially when he says yes when it's a big no situationhe gets himself in strange and hilarious situations,goes to places and meets people he would never had metand that's the power of YESit is a very funny book and YES i recommend it alot"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary, Inspiring and Downright Funny!","review":"If you don't laugh while reading this book, you probably don't have a pulse. It's that simple. 'Yes Man' is Danny Wallace's journey through the pitfalls of forcing himself -for a short while- to say yes to every single opportunity that presented itself. The book is a description of his personal experiences during this undertaking, and it could not be more scary, inspiring, and downright funny.Think for two seconds about what your life would be like if you answered every single question asked of you with a Yes! and acted upon it. That will give you an idea of what the experience of this book is about. An absolutely brilliant must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dice Man - with more heart and more humour","review":"An extremely enjoyable and entertaining read. For those who have not read the dice man (an excellent read also by the way), the main theme that is shared is the central character giving up control of his life - in the dice man it is by setting out outcomes and letting the dice decide, and in \\"Yes Man\\" it is by the simple act of saying \\"yes\\" to everything. Saying \\"yes\\" to dinners with ex-girlfriends on first dates, saying \\"yes\\" to attending boring co-worker parties, saying \\"yes\\" to an Internet email plea to help one of the Sultan of Oman's sons smuggle 40mm dollars out of the country (not recommended). This is an orgy of \\"yes\\". In doing so Danny opens himself up to a world of new people and new opportunities and his experiences and humerous anecdotes are laid out in an easily digestable and entertaining read. At first the humour seemed a little forced but as the story unwound it was touching, hilarious and a very fun read. Enjoy, and say \\"yes\\" more."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Idea","review":"After hearing an NPR interview with the author, I bought this book for the title - as a gift to someone I once nicknamed a \\"yes man\\" . Once it arrived, I realized that my friend was unlikely to ever read it, so I did before passing it along. I'm a smallish town female U.S. Baby Boomer and much of the book just didn't speak to me; however, there were bits of fun and treasures of stories tucked throughout. I especially loved his response to the ubiquitous scam of \\"my [insert African country here] father died and left a fortune that he scammed from government, I just need your help to get it out of the country.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent motivator","review":"This book affected me in a strange way, but a positive way. It really makes you analyze your own life. How many opportunities do you pass up because it is just so easy to say \\"no\\"? After reading the book, I find myself being motivated to \\"say yes more\\", and I am capitalizing on a lot more opportunies.It is a good, quick, entertaining read. I also got a kick out of the UK dialect. It is one of the few book I've read that I try to force my friends to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sparky","review":"In which charges of thievery, usurpation and cloning are for once both perfectly justified and relevent. But it really doesn't matter. This is a great album any way you listen to it. Who cares if it's derivative? Who cares if Jurgen Fritz's keyboard work sounds suspiciously like Keith Emerson's? And so what if Helmut Kollen never sounded more like Greg Lake, or if Hans Bathelt's drum work sounds ever more like Carl Palmer's? Who cares if it's yet another one of those blasted concept albums?

It almost seems like an SACD or DVD-A.Dave"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"Although it is not as dark an album as I expected considering it is a concept album about Spartacus who freed the Gladiators and slaves in Rome. I certainly understand why people elude to E.L.P., for the keyboard/synth/moog are very similar. The difference I feel is the music is not as complex as E.L.P. The vocals here are good but not as good as Greg Lake was at that time and I feel the drumming cannot compare to Cozy or Carl but that being said this cd is worth buying. Great cd and certainly great prog from the early 70's. In addition the long wait for these to be remastered has been worthwhile as they did an excellent job of bringing this cd up to standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Watch","review":"Bought two of these at Big 5 for gifts. Both of them had broken wristbands. The adjustment pins are threaded instead of just push-out. All but 2 of them were stripped making the watchband impossible to adjust. Both watches were this way. Both watches had the luminous paint put on by a little kid. The part that connects the band to the watch looks solid but is actually just a piece of flat metal very cheaply made. It makes the watch lighter and cheaper feeling. The luminous paint is useful only for 20 minutes or so. The crown does not always connect to the gear that sets the time. Sometimes you can turn it forward a few hours then back half that then forward a few more. I'd rather own a quartz with a calculator on it. I give it 1 star instead of 0 stars because the box it came in is a useful ashtray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crotton difamed!","review":"Disappointment .THE HR MARKERS 3 FELT OFF PREVENTING THE SECONDS NEEDLE TO ROTATE.Had it fix by certify distributor.the glass gets foggy.The STAINLESS STEEL BAND IS BUT THE PIN THAT HOLDS IT IT IS NOT SO IT WOULD FELT OFF WITH ANY LITTLE BITTY RESISTANCE.I have bought this brand before it looks like this was made at china by a Chinese who made sure it was a crappy watch.Or simply a replica.Just will not ever by this brand.I owned 23 watches from 3 brands so I know enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hinda of a ho-hum effort","review":"When I picked up Fly on the wall many years ago, It was the one AC/DC album that didnt get into my regular rotation. In fact, its just not that good. I know some people really love this album, and some say you have to be a huge AC/DC fan to like this..I will tell ya, I am not a huge fan of the band with the Johnson Days, but love the Bon Scott Era. I do think that Back in Black and The Razors Edge are the best in the Johnson Era (Flick of the Switch aint to bad either) yet this album seems a little dull. There are only a hanful of good songs on this, and it seems like mostly filler material. This might be the worst of all thier albums, yet its not a one star dud, yet since they could have done better, I can only give it 2. This is the AC/DC crapola album"},{"rating":"1","title":"anh, not so great","review":"This 1985 cd was the second in a duo of self-produced albums by AC/DC. I own the original vinyl record, and have never listened to the cd. It's got some pretty catchy songs on it, but clearly this was the low point in the Australian rockers' career. Here's how it breaks down:1. Fly On The Wall: okay for most bands, but complete crap for the Young brothers. 3/102. Shake Your Foundations: catchy chourus, not much more. 5/103. First Blood: along with back in buisness, best song on album. 7/104. Danger: funny lyrics are the only thing that saved this one. 4/105. Sink The Pink: i have no idea how this song made it as the single on this album. 2/106. Playing With Girls: again, funny lyrics. 4/107. Stand Up: not that bad, but not that good, either. 6/108. Hell Or High Water: crap. 3/109. Back In Buisness: with First Blood, best song on album. 7/1010.

Looking back I can see why. No new ground was made. Still the same old AC/DC, sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll, with the same old sound. Shake Your Foundations, and Sink The Pink, are the two best known songs off this cd, but that is not saying alot. Boring with a capital B. The playing is lifeless. Only Playing With Girls, seems to have any fire behind it.

Unlike a lot of other AC/DC fans, I LOVED \\"Flick Of The Switch,\\" and I anxiously awaited the follow-up. Boy, was I in for a letdown. The problem with this record is, there is just nothing here that grabs you by the throat like on their earlier releases. \\"Shake Your Foundations\\" is the only song that stands out, if only for the chants of,\\"AI AI OH!\\" The saddest thing about this record, though, is that it was all downhill from here for the boys. Except for a brief resurgence with \\"The Razor's Edge\\" in 1990, AC/DC was never the same again.

The pages now are dusty with flour, and stained a bit with my too-happy cooking efforts. The recipes here are DELICIOUS. I'm Polish heritage and my husband is French-Lebanese (and a professional chef), so we do not always agree on food - haha. But we completely agree on every single recipe I have made from this book: \\"Seconds, please!\\" This book makes it all so easy. I have made numerous recipes from this book for my family and for parties, always the response is the same, \\"Oh my god this is so good! I want some more. How did you make it?\\" Then I tell them about this cookbook.....Thank you, Lydia!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"I love her magazine and her cookbooks and view on life.

Though it was written many decades ago, it is very relevant to modern readers. Wood's main strength is that he is able to take the Eastern ideals of yoga practice and express them in a meaningful way to Western readers. He gives equal attention to the eight limbs of yoga, unlike many modern books which tend to focus too much on asanas and perhaps pranayama, with no consideration for the other, equally important aspects of yoga, like pratyahara, dharana, dhyana, and samadhi. A very important book for anyone who is interested in yoga as a spiritual path, and not just a physical exercise routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"IMPORTANT REVIEW","review":"If you are short on time and happen to be short on patience as well, write the author of the book and demand an abridged version. It seems he had a mandatory work count he had to hit, because he overstated things. Alot. And then he did it again. Alot. Get my point. He used the phrases \\"emerging generations\\" and \\"holistic worship\\" a couple hundred times. (That's a tad annoying) Not only that, the book really seemed to stray from what i thought it was going to be, a book about creating worsip gatherings.

You can literally place your head up and down several inches without finding the \\"spot\\" you need. It's not uncomfortable, just lacking structure and thus lacking therapeutic benefit.

The foam is so stiff it doesn't allow this and it made my neck alignment worse. In fact, the padding is in itself painful after several minutes. Memory foam would be a MUCH better application here as the curve of the device would allow the alignment of the neck to be corrected. The device smells like industrial glue or something.Ive seen \\"chiropractor\\" reviews here that have to be fake. I cant imagine recommending this to anyone.Additionally, BUYER BEWARE with these sellers. Advantage Medical wont take a return if you open the package, which is a cardboard box in this instance.

I actually hate it and am mad I wasted my money.First, the blue foam part is scratchy itchy material that is not comfortable at all.Second, the small white piece that curves under your neck is not stable at all, so your head tilts from side to side unless you want to not relax and try to balance.Lastly, it just did not feel like a drastic enough curve for my neck although it appears that it is in the photo, most of that curve is the piece that wraps up around your head.Bottom line is, it might work well for some and not for others and you'll have to decide if you want to spend the money to find out if it does or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm one of the disappointed","review":"Sounds like a wonderful idea, looks like just what I wanted. It might work IF it had a really wide, stable base. You can only use it lying on the floor, or it feels really wobbly. In my case, I used it lying on the bed, and after a while of my neck trying to stay really still, using some muscles I wasn't used to using in a delicate way like that, those muscles tensed up like crazy and triggered a really bad episode where I had a week of complete pain being unable even to lift my head to normal position. I had to walk around with my face towards the floor which felt idiotic. Chiropractor told me he could only do so much fixing while my muscles were irritated like that, and I had to just lie on ice packs a while. Ouch.

I suffer from severe neck and shoulder problems due to the nature of my work. I was diagnosed as having 'military neck' years ago, which means that I really have no natural curvature in my neck. This little device is best used when lying on the floor and allows me to lay with my head cradled in the specially shaped and padded head rest. It is incredibly relaxing and I feel immediate relief on both my neck and my shoulders.

I repeated several more times and it still has a slight smell. Amazon offered to take it back, but I'm just too tired from my fibro and pain to pack it up and get a refund. Have not tried it, but I can tell you this, it is way overpriced for the product you receive. It should be $9.95 at most. It's just cheap plastic and foam that is similar to a cheap packing material.

And if you are wondering about quality consider this - yes, the materials are worth a LOT less than the finished product but balancing that is the fact that there is definitely enough quality there to get the job done.

They charge $25 for every telephone call (if out of waranty) and 129$ starting fee for repair service out of warranty. And their products are made in China, so you can gurantee that you are going to end up in some problem or the other. Nice way to make a tidy profit"},{"rating":"2","title":"uhmm so far so good","review":"I have owned this palm pilot for two months or so now and I only noticed one thing and that was that the live drive would freeze up on me from time to time. I think this issue is caused do to many task at once, i.e. touching one link then another then the fist link again real fist seems to make the system or processor move slow or freeze. I your palm freeze's just take a brake because you will need to wait for it to die before you can use this item again. Other then that which is caused by the operator not the gear itself this is assume. Everything your read on this site is accurate and correct.

The web browsing capabilities are lame, bluethooth functions crash the machine sometimes - and it doesnt play well with third party sofware. Palm killed handhelds basically a long time ago & keeps driving the spike into the coffin with this one.Handsprings were so much more solid & worked alot better.

Then it failed. Customer service was consistently superior to Dell's or HP's, but the refurbished replacement they sent me failed. The next refurbished replacement was defective. The refurbished replacement following that was also defective. They finally sent me a new replacement. That one has just failed, but now it's out of warranty. I will not be buying another Palm product again--ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 yrs and still going.....","review":"I've had my LifeDrive since it came out and love it. Sure, the wifi is slow but I don't use it that often. I imagine the newer models are faster if you really need it for the internet. I have had times when it froze on me but I was able to track down the fixes on the discusssion groups and get it going again. The problems were usually caused by my installing incompatible software. I just recently lost the ability to use the stylus for input making the unit unusable. But I kept messing with it with resets and reboots and was finally able to get the stylus setting software to take the input and it's working great now. I know that it's just a matter of time tho as none of these things last forever and I was sad to find they aren't making it still. Guess I'll have to go for the TX when at last my beloved LifeDrive dies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this","review":"This device is a disaster. Believe it or not, it is slower than the Palm III I had five years ago. The versamail never worked and, naturally, palm will give you no support whatsoever. After less than three months using it, the Life Drive died. Palm did not respond to my e-mails but sent me a customer service survey. Infuriating.I think the problem is they tried to put too may functions into it and the technology is just not ready. I would like to avoid all palm products in the future, but unfortunately I have five years of data in palm format and reviews for other PDAs are just as bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"big spectacular","review":"The handheld is stable, beautiful, not so slow as some people say (sometimes it takes 4 or 5 seconds to open an big aplication but in average, it takes 1 or 2 seconds).

It's perfect for health students (to put books and medical softwares), businesmen, etc.The main problem is its size: If you put it in your pocket, your pocket will become stewed and it's a little unconfortable.Sorry for the bad English, I'm brazilian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still needs a lot of improvement","review":"I bought this PDA and had to return it after 10 days.

Unlike the Palm IIIx and earlier models with the rock solid Palm operating system and Graffiti handwriting recognition, the Life Drive frequently locks up and crashes. The Grafitti 2 software has very poor recognition (as well as being less intuitive than original Grafitti), runs slowly, and often cannot recognize \\"T\\" and \\"L\\". With an unreliable digitizing pad (which causes characters to breakup and be read as other characters), text entry is an exercise in frustration; on average characters must be entered twice. Mine is being returned for repair for the 2nd time in 18 months but it has never operated anywhere near satisfactorily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifedrive Not SO Good","review":"I bought this item because of the 4 gig hard drive. It was priced at $436.00 new. The OS crashed the first day I used it. It then crashed at least twice a day there after. I figured that the item I got was defective. PALM stated the the hard drive was messed up. Amazon did a quick return and I purchased another. To my disappointment the second one did the exact same thing. I read several reviews and it seems that 1 out of 10 Lifedrives actually works good enough that you can depend on it. I heard recently that there is some sort of class action lawsuit against Palm over this item. Anyhow I returned it to Amazon again and now use a notepad that fits perfectly in my pocket. I recommend that you stay away from this product unless you can get it for under $75.00Good Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read This...","review":"I was considering buying this seemingly \\"cool\\" product because my friend had one. My friend used to bring it to work but that lasted only for a month. Why? It froze.I was lured by the manufacturer's presentation of its specs but I knew that they were only deceiving me. Most of the cool stuff featured are the ones that customers of Amazon are complaining about. My opinion is based on the 117 reviews on Amazon. I have painstakingly read every one of them. I have noticed that the customers who gave high ratings are the ones who have been using their Lifedrive for less than 4 months and/or those who have never experienced a major crash yet.

I've been playing around with it trying to figure it all out. For the most part it works well. As with any device it will lock up from time to time if I try to do to many things at once. The quick buttons are not like the old palms so it takes some getting used to. I'm happy with this product the only down side right now is it is too new so there aren't many useful accesories available. for the most part it has tons of memory and can hold every file I've thrown at it. The Documents to go program works well and any windows document can be trnsfered on to your palm so you can work on it on the road. If you don't need all the things this on can do though go with the tungstun (sp?) series.

Very disappoinging. It crashes frequently and needs hard resets once or twice a week. This never happened on my ealier Palms nor on my wife's Palm. Some of the features are good, such as a very readable screen. However, the hassle factor of having to reset the hard drive, which takes sevearl minutes to reboot, make it sluggish and unappealing. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"This product is not at all what I had hoped for. After using the Palm Tungsten T5 and being a loyal follower of all of the Palm line, I was excited to receive this product. That excitement went south in a hurry.

I use it as a physician and have had a Tungsten C, and Visor and Palm V, each of which represented continuous improvement in speed and usability. The lifedrive was so slow switching between applications, up to 2 minutes and usually thirty to 90 seconds that I couldn't function. Also the programs I used ran more slowly (10-20 seconds for steps that were instantaneous before) than before or than on the T|X with which I have replaced it . Iuse a prescription program and it links to epocrates which meant every time it would take several minutes to perform a task that took 10-20 seconds previously.On the plus side the multimedia and PIM functions worked well if you waited for them to start. It has a sharp screen and pictures. The dictaion feature was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Life Drive.","review":"I purchased a Life Drive PDA because of the large memory capacity.

Get ready to wait for windows and to pray for programs not to jam.The hotsync itself is outrageous. It always, and I mean ALWAYS jams the LifeDrive AND my desktop in the end of it. The online support can't explain what's happening. And I'm only using software that came with this thing.I'm sticking with my old Zire 71 with poors 16m of internal memory.

It has a 4 gig hard drive, which is awesome, and it holds so much information. The touch screen responds well, the wifi picks up as good as my laptop, and when I set it up with the bluetooth keyboard it is ALMOST like having my own little netbook. I say almost, because obviously the screen size is small, and not everything fits well onto such a small screen. But I am able to check email, surf the web, and stay up to date on sports, news, etc. I also like the MP3 player and the voice recorder. My only issue with this is a short lifespan. I have had 2 of these, and both of them lasted about a year before they crashed. One was still under warranty so I got it replaced, and then the next one crashed a little over a year later.

I installed Iambic's Agendus, which I've used various versions of since my Newton and the Lifedrive didn't like it at all. It crashed and rebooted left and right because of it. The internet browser has a bug that doesn't allow you to download anything like patches. You'll get an error message saying that your harddisk or card is full.The last I heard the Lifedrive has been discontinued and there are no plans of a v.o 2.0.

It's absurd, even being AC/DC, my favourite band.THere are five songs here: four from their first album, released only in Australia back in 1974, called \\"HIGH VOLTAGE\\", and one from the Australian version of \\"DIrty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\\", the master piece track called \\"Jailbreak\\". Why on Earth, (back in 1981, when Atlantic finally released \\"Dirty Deeds\\" in the US) they chose to take \\"Jailbreak\\" out from the album and replace it is beyond my compreension....Well, you got my point... this album, altough the five songs are very good, makes no sense at all. IT was born as a greedy decision by Atlantic, nothing more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst music AC/DC ever released","review":"I love AC/DC and would easily consider them one of the top 10 maybe top 5 bands of all time but this ep isn't worth the $10. In fact out of the 5 songs I think You Ain't Got A Hold On Me is the only good one. They all sound alike to me and I don't dig the blues side of AC/DC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grade F","review":"Nothing here at all. Hard to image that this is the heavy metal group of the 80's. More hard rock than metal. Song writing skills are very lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"AC/DC - ' '74 Jailbreak' (Sony)","review":"Until I recently dug this five-track mini-album up, I can't remember the last time I heard this vintage title. Think I once had a vinyl copy of this record. No matter, this is AC/DC at their very earliest work. Raw, angry and just plain heavy. However, at the same time, I think '74 Jailbreak' may be more bluesy than any of their other lp's. Play this one repeatedly, you'll have time.Classic track listing: \\"Jailbreak\\"(4:40), \\"You Ain't Got A Hold On Me\\"(3:30), \\"Show Business\\"(4:43), \\"Soul Stripper\\"(6:23) and their Big Joe Williams standard cover \\"Baby,Please Don't Go\\"(4:50). Simply, a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock N Roll!","review":"Got this brand spanking new from Fopp in Shaftsbury Ave for a fiver. I'd have been a bit pissed at having to pay a tenner for it, as it's an EP, really. First listen told me this was nothing on the sound they developed and made big time in the hard rock vein. This is a Rock N Roll thang. Very bluesy, and Bon actually sings a bit thanks to Young's chinkier and funkier sound, as opposed to the crunchy, nosebleed sound he popularised. 'Baby please dont go' is a track that was made for DC! The Booklet has some great early shots of the boys, and the back photo is a corker of Bon, with Angus scrutinizing him up close! Well worth a fiver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective","review":"I purchased two \\"parking mats\\" and couldn't be less satisfied with them. They do not stay in place and have to be adjusted consistently so that we don't bump the wall in our rather small garage. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Park Smart Parking Mat is Greatest Invention Made","review":"This mat is made of heavy duty rubber so you can roll over it again and again with your car. Once set in the right place, it works much better than hanging the old tennis ball. When the car hits the flat part right before the bump, the mat holds still. You roll over the bump with one tire and you are parked just in the right place. I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned the item","review":"Did not suite my needs. Much harder than I anticipated and the two sided tape did not work on my epoxy garage floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible vinyl rip masquerading as a commercial product","review":"A funky as hell soundtrack--but it's an awful vinyl rip off of a very dusty and scratchy LP. I wish I never bought it. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"Loaded with bum notes! A poorly choreographed piece that accompanies one of the greatest Overtures the theater has ever known??? Why on earth would they want to stage that??And then the orchestra is often dire.. That famous overture is leaden and I heard trumpet split-notes! This is an abomination! Performers are only adequate and the staging is skimpy to threadbare. Stick with Hal Prince's 1986 New York City Opera version or even the recent concert. This is so cheap and lousy that if Bernstein were still alive- this would kill him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur","review":"This production is seriously lacking something. Candide is a silly silly show anyway. The one with Kristin Chenaweth is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"killer krautrock","review":"As a long time fan of Krautrock bands such as Neu! Can, Cluster, Harmonia, et al, I was pleasantly surprised by how different Faust were to other bands of their ilk. Faust are a band that obviously didn't take themselves that seriously as evidenced by song lyrics like \\"daddy take the banana, tomorrow is sunday\\", delivered in a thick german accent with a Stooges style guitar motif. This compilation of their first two albums is a lot of fun, their second release So Far deserves particular mention. Imagine The Beach Boys, The Residents, The Stooges and Uncle Meat era Mothers of Invention all jamming in a German Farmhouse and you might get an idea of the eclecticism at work here. Highly reccomended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What other band could...","review":"Relistening to this album always fills me with awe/surprise. What other band could take The Velvet Underground's White Light/White Heat sound & turn it into a hypnotic bubblegum-pop track with a smoking sax solo? Then follow it with something that (honestly) passes for a Steve Howe acoustic piece? Right before surging into a faithful recreation of Pink Floyd's Atom Heart Mother sound, trashing it mid-song to rock out again? Only Faust, my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aussy Underground Legends","review":"This one is the '71 debut from one of the best Australian psych rock bands who played late 60s psychedelic rock becoming the progressive rock of the early 70s, with innovative long roaming tracks like post-Syd Barrett Pink Floyd or more obscure bands like Secondhand. Spoken of as underground stars back then in the same breath as late 60s/early 70s Masters Apprentices."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES","review":"I recently saw the lonesome organist live and was very impressed, so I picked this album up at my work. I felt compelled to review this and raise the average customer rating. Seeing this live might give a person more respect for the music, but I think it stands on it's own, having some sweet sounds on here for just about everyone. I'm looking forward to checking out his previous releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I thought this was going to be much more unusual and eclectic than it ended up being. The songs are bland, repetative and go nowhere. I read in a review that this album was unique because it mixed strange carnival like music with ragtime, barrelhouse, classical riffs, bells, chimes and hauntingly weird vocals. Yeah right. It's all dreadfully boring uninspired weirdness that isn't remotely engaging. I thought these pieces would at least convey some sort of moody and strange atmosphere that I thought was suggested by the review and the odd cover and song titles. But the melodies are not melodies, and it sounds amateurish- like a kid who walks up to a piano and plays the same five notes over and over because he doesn't know anything about piano. Even the flip book which comes with the cd is a dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"stalled","review":"once you pause the movie it never recovered. it continued to stall and then fast forward. if i tried to rewind it stalled even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under Rated","review":"I don't know why people didn't like this movie.

It helps her feel as if she is accomplishing something and also she is using her mind and hands to stay in the lines. It's an ideal coloring book for anyone who wishes to color like they use to."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating toy","review":"This toy is very frustrating to my 4 and a half year old son. The helmet doesn't fit in such a way that it \\"snaps\\" on, it sort of rests over Luke's head and falls off continuously. The light-saber is really cool because it lights up, but it is very difficult for my son to get into Luke's hand. The little space suit that comes with it is just a piece of junk, it doesn't fit his waist properly and snaps off all too easily. I'm frustrated with this toy since I'm constantly having to put the light-saber back in Luke's hand or fix the space suit. My son does enjoy putting him in the X-wing that you can purchase separately, which we bought first. But I wish we had instead bought the smaller model that comes with Luke and R2-D2. That has less parts, would probably be less frustrating for all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, great software, A++","review":"I had previously owned an Olympus D460 zoom digital camera, and it broke on me after owning it for 10 days!! Not to mention that it came with crummy software and NO USB cable but rather a serial port cable.I waited a while to get a new camera and then came across this gem. The pictures and 2.1 megapixels provide crystal-clear images, while the software allows you to edit pictures, inserting captions, bacgrounds, frames, etc. I'm by no means a \\"technical\\" person, yet I manage to use this camera with ease.

I just got rid of my hp 618 and got a Sony S-75. The 618 took one set of very satisfactory pictures and then went bonkers (to use a technical term). The stored images (not the LCD) became EXTREMELY grainy regardless of how viewed. HP has about the worst tech support in a world of dismal tech support so I decided to eat a 20% restocking fee and returned it to the vendor. Yes, it looks good on paper. Pentax optics, HP electronics, 30 bit color depth (vs 24 for comparable units), upgradable firmware (really nice) and excellent included software. The USB transfer worked flawlessly. So, why didn't I send it to HP for repair ?? Well, I found other user reviews on the I-net that complained about the identical problem that I had.

I had to buy a card reader. Battery life was very short. The camera circuit board blew in less than 18 months and would cost $250 to fix, making it worthless. I'll never buy another HP camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!!","review":"I don't know if its the camera or the software but after taking two sets of pictures and uploading them to my computer something decided to call it quits. When I connect the camera to the computer with a USB cable the software states that the memory card is not present or that there are no images on the memory card. Tried using a flash card reader but that doesn't work either. Have tried using different flashcards, including the one that came with the camera but none of them work. Theres no point in buying this camera if you can't transfer your photos. HP support is essentially useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"I bought this camera more than a year ago. I'd rate it 5 stars except that I had the following problem: The door of my battery compartment got broken! The problem looks silly enough, but upon calling HP they \\"simply\\" told me that my product is 'out-of-warranty' and they don't service it anymore. Even worse, they offered a trade up with a newer model. After checking the prices for the newer models, it turned out that they're buying back my camera for less! All the service centers that I could find on their websites told me that they don't service digital cameras (not only mine).

Equal parts goatherder and revolutionary, Corbett covers in detail a variety of issues ranging from the dietary requirements of goats and people in the desert to an account of the legal hassles Guatamalan refugees encountered after successfully walking across the desert to the apparent safety of Tucson AZ. This book is a poetic snapshot of the people affected by last stages of the US's outdated coldwar policies and an educated loner who gave a damn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical realism and the law","review":"Indiana's stark, unflinching and almost unbearably frank journey of self-discovery is among the most beautiful books I have ever read. The book's exploration of the magical realistic qualities of life, in which physical and intellectual impossibilities are overcome with a wink and a metaphysical shrug, and its almost fanatically methodical construction -- 3(b) invariably follows 3(a), and thereupon verges ineluctably towards 4 -- will change your life in ways that are, admittedly, imperceptible to you and everyone else. A book neither to be put down nor read, Indiana's monumental rules apply not only to court, but also to life, love, the pursuit of food and, to quote the author, \\"as otherwise provided by law.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this one","review":"A delicious romp, just the right mixture of suspense, pathos, romance and humor.

I can't wait for the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crass commercial cash-in!","review":"It becomes evident early on that the work is geared toward film adaptation. Much of the material comes across as unnecessary and expendable. The plots are feeble and the ending is unnatural, and throughout, we encounter tense situations that are artificial, at best. Critical acclaim and commercial success have rendered the author lethargic in his prose. Apparently he is interested more in cashing a big paycheck than producing memorable literature. Nevertheless, the material will likely gain acceptance from the credulous movie-going public, much like last summer's film version of \`New Mexico' and the straight-to-video \`California Rules of Civil Procedure III: Beach Barristers.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and pedantic","review":"Indiana, while endeavoring to add to the (unfortunate) trend in legal thrillers, is anything but. The is no Grisham - the prose here is stilted, the characters are leaden. The work wanders from one topic to the next, as if written by committee.

My children argue over who gets to ride in the Starriser. For some reason they are not as comfortable in the Parkway. My theory is that it is too much like a car seat rather than a booster -- and they feel \\"too snug\\" in it. They even look uncomfortable in it. The one advantage of the Parkway over the Starriser is the increase neck protection if they should fall asleep. If I had to do it over, I would have purchased two of the Starrisers instead of the Parkway. BTW, I purchased the Britax Companion for my infant and I LOVE it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much for too little","review":"I've used this car seat for over a year. My daughter didn't care for it too much. I'm not sure what she hated more the head rest or the seat which is about as soft as a towel covering a rock. The cup holders can in no way function as a cup holder. The car seat head unit is made up of a flexible plastic, Styrofoam, covered with cloth. Somehow during the moving the car seat around we cracked the Styrofoam in two places. Thus foam was falling out of the head rest. Well a call to Britax and waiting on hold for about 30 mins I was told it would cost $10 for a replacement piece. A car booster seat needs to last longer however I was able to damage mine in about a year.

Since my purchase of this CD, I have been playing it quite often. Being a huge fan of Expose and Gioia, I initially picked up my copy of this soundtrack for this very reason. But as I listened to the other cuts on this CD, I have enjoyed every song. Fortunately, the dance beats on \\"Walking on Thin Ice\\", overpower Yoko's voice. No disrespect to John Lennon, but she does not have a strong, appealing voice. Overall, the album gives me an adrenaline rush and great motivation to dance and work out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Head down to the dance floor","review":"This is a great cd, it contains some of the hottest club anthems around, but the problem is that it only has eight songs on the first cd. The second cd, in my opinion, is disposable. I wouldn't go as far as to say that this cd is better than the second season. Although, it does have better songs, like Ono's \\"Walking On Thin Ice\\" and the Tiesto mix of \\"Never Past Tense.\\" Overall, I would have given it a five star rating if it weren't for the useless second cd and because the first cd is too short."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun and inspiring","review":"Been thinking about a small boat for a while now, and this book is just enough motivation.

The book contains full plans for 3 or 4 S&G; boats as well as a similar number of complete plans for \\"conventional\\" Instant Boats.

It starts of each chapter with some personal stories on boat building and fails to deliver any real content on actual construction of a boat. If you want to build a boat, find another text! I started a project that stated \\"$40-50\\" in material and have allready spent in excess of $250.00 on materials alone. This book really leaves you hanging, about half way through the project I realized I was completely on my own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!","review":"Payson takes the intimidation factor out of boatbuilding. I'd been toying with the idea of building a boat for years, but didn't have enough confidence in my own woodworking ability. This book (1) explains the necessary fundamentals, (2) goes into great detail with loads of helpful hints on step by step construction, (3) has a really helpful glossary, (4) has several plans to select from, and (5) is written in a folksy, easy to read style. It was well worth the low purchase price and was thoroughly enjoyable reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone Can Build a Boat","review":"The eleven boats described here can't really be called weekend projects for a beginner, and some of the building techniques are a little complex, but a careful reader should be able to build a working small boat within several weeks of weekends using only the plans in the book. A few pieces of plywood, glue, glass and resin and a ripped down 2x4 for trim is all that is required to be out on the water, well, next year. Plans cover the whole spectrum of small craft from a boxy dingy to an outboard skiff and even a tiny schooner. Most of these boats are strictly functional, although the first design, Gypsy, is a nice trim rowing or sailing dory. Payson does a good job of sharing his own love of small boats by describing some interesting points about woodworking and sailing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Payson makes it so simple even I could do it.

The case itself isn't very heavy but it is quite solid. It got bumped and dropped a few times and none of the stogies showed any signs of damage.My only complaint has to do with the attached strap. It comes with a clip which to me implies it can be fastened to your backpack or belt loop when hiking along. There is a little plastic cap which pinches down to hold the two ends of the string together and that cap gave way shortly after clipping it on. This is nothing that tying a knot can not fix, but I was not impressed with the amount of thought put into that particular part of the design.Despite that small problem, I would definitely buy this one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for 2 microphones","review":"I use it to hold 2 AKG 480 microphones.SUPER STRONG CASE yet small!I would buy more if I needed them"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After seeing the ratings, I thought this would be a great Bocelli concert - I own the others - but it did not live up to the rating - the NY philharmonic was great, as were the guest instumentalists, but the guest singers did not measure up, nor did the material chosen.

The least of these is the very unlikely claim that Sears was a Christian when he undertook his research/writing this book. What I really found troubling was the gross misunderstanding of or loose interpretation of the Bible. He took little snippets here and there and used them to prove his points rather than taking the passage in context to understand what is said. His faulty use of research and prophecy shot the books credibility before it had even gotten to what Bahaullah had to say. As the book stands, the only value it has is in understanding the Baha'i faith.I recommend the review by a Baha'i that describes well the problems I had with the book: [...]I would also recommend people read the Bible in a modern translation as well as \\"The Case for the Real Jesus\\" or \\"More Than a Carpenter\\" for a better look at who Jesus really is and what the Bible has to say about him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind Blowing","review":"Wow, you don't exptct what the outcome is once it is revealed.

On the lake, keep one in your kayak/boat to wipe dry after use. To maintain, just wash it in the washer. Never develops a sour odor. Great product. This is my 'Magic Towel'!BTW, Sham-Wow works okay for the above, but does not dry surfaces without streaking. Also, you must maintain it more, by not washing it with softeners.

Bad customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea, but bad execution","review":"I bought this headset when I bought a new phone that had a built in mp3 player with bluetooth 2. It is a great idea, but lousy execution. Here's what's wrong.1. The part that fits in your ear is HUGE. I read reviews that said not to get it if you have small ears and thought nothing of it. I have pretty big ears. Apparently this was designed for giants. I can't get them in my ear without fiddling with it for 10 minutes or more.2. Both ear pieces look the same, where one could have just been an ear bud something much less obvious. Wearing both of them makes you look like a dweeb.I cannot comment on battery life, call quality or anything like that, since the headphones are basically useless to me since I don't have enormous ears.If you have huge ears and don't care what you look like while you're listening to music or talking on the phone this headset might be right for you. Otherwise, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"kernal","review":"Had this for over 5 years. Still works fine. Earloop did break. Caller ID does not show name unless the contact is saved on the unit itself. Dailing from unit works fine; sometimes you have to turn on the phone before you can dial a saved number.Quality is decent. Barely can hear any static. Volume is loud enough for calls. Playing music is not loud enough at times. Using this during a workout is not practical. Sweat caused the unit to go bad twice; had to let it dry for couple of weeks before it worked again.Unit is very noticable when you wear it. Would go for a smaller unit with less functionality next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great but decent, Jabra support nightmare","review":"Good concept but poorly implemented.I had the stereo pair for two years now and the headset has been progressively failing in more than one way.First 3 months, good, echo on the other side. Months 4-6 issues with the control of the phone from the headset, it goes from 1-2 second delays to non-responsiveness.Months 7-12, sound is getting worse and sometimes I get a lot of interference; first earhook broke, requested Jabra to replace them...no good...they said they ran out, they simply do not care about any of the other sound issues. So I bought some earhooks.Months 13-24, noise is pretty bad most of the time with intermittent silent moments, horrible. I already went trough four earhooks and I am about to buy a Plantronics or Motorola. I contacted Jabra and after a few weeks they respond with a no good, good luck with your problems attitude.Jabra is out for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great BT headset, with a feature not listed","review":"The other reviews sum up this device pretty well. It works great, the sound is really pretty outstanding for a BT stereo headset. As good a ~$20 corded headset w/o the cord. The great thing this has is a vibraing call feature. I got this device on a whim and was very happy it came w/ this feature. Its great for people who don't want to have a headset in their ear like a fashion statement. I can put the ear clip on my shirt (clip sticking out)and the headset inside the shirt and can feel incomming calls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not stay on your ear","review":"Jabra missed the basic mark on this headset. Save your money.One of the things a bluetooth headset requires most is the ability to stay on your ear. The BT8010, does not fill that requirement.The headset will not stay on. You'll find yourself losing the ear hooks frequently. Sometimes the ear hooks fall off all together or they will stay hooked to your ear.

The author's reflection upon the Blood Orchid , a plant of dubious character, can be seen as a reflection of man kind itself and its disregard for all creation. Through the eyes of the native American, Bowden relates the loss of spiritual as well as the tempral well being. Dark and moody, the related subject matter goes from atomic destruction to insider trading. It demintrated the reality that, \\" everything is for sale.\\" Strong, painful and forthright Bowden's Blood Orchid wrinches the soul and rveals hidden truths that enlightens, but often frightens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Western literature here!","review":"Wow- what a compelling novel. Couldn't put it down. I'd recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood Orchid","review":"This book reeks of \\"stinky-oscity!\\" Bowden tries too hard to write an artful dialogue, and loses (more like frustrates) the reader in this book of rants.

He comes across as sarcastic, disgusted, and fooled.He sticks with the blood orchid metaphor throughout the book, which works great for his purposes, but America is not that bad, is it? Didn't we fight a bunch of wars to ensure that America would be free? Sure, we have problems; our impoverished Wal-Mart workers have to choose between food and gas, and our government is convinced that it is the answer to our happiness, but the government is wrong, after all.This book provides a down-to-Earth look at our world and raises good questions about our society. I like to think Bowden has been too close to academia and has forgotten how great it is to be free to write this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT JUST DOES NOT HAVE IT","review":"Very few books I start that I just cannot finish. This, I admit, was one of them. I did give it two stars because the author does have a way with words, but that is about it. This is quite typical of some of the junk writing which came out of the 60s and 70s as a result of one too many acid trips. You kind of have to feels sorry for the author. He must be a rather sad and miserable sort of an individual. Just about anyone with an ounce of observance in them can find things to whine and rant about...the author takes this to new heights. I would strongly suggest the author drive another 7,000 thousand miles and take another look. I suppose if you are a sort of \\"anti-everything-guy or gal\\" type, you might find this work interesting. Myself, I found the work to be depressing and not all that coherent. I cannot recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blood orchid","review":"As the Hammer Orchid seduces its prey with false promises of satisfaction, Charles Bowden draws his readers into his own personal saga of pain with an impressive display of anger and wrath. Multitudes of partially coherent and mostly unrelated images of sex and war are thrown to the reader at a steadily unrelenting pace, leaving one with the choice of either leaving them at the table, or ingesting them wholly and accepting the emotional heartburn that will accompany the feast. For those who choose the path of greater resistance, the rewards will follow. A highly recommended but particularly difficult read, intended for those with a passionate devotion to nature, man, history and their shared bonds."},{"rating":"2","title":"The newest \\"notes from the underground\\" by Charles Bowden","review":"Charles Bowden's \\"Blood Orchid\\" saturates his readers with honest,stream of consciousness reality from the depths of his cynical,twisted mind.Graphic sexual references hide around every corner tempting readers to find out what is this guy up to.Injections of candid truths relating Charles Keating are fascinating forays into our economic standards and the monsters created by a free market society.Stories don't get more brutal that this without real blood.A good read for those that understand their own capabilities,limitations,and appreciate the ugly potential of being human.Dostoyevsky would have been proud."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Blood of the Human Orchid","review":"We are blood orchids, accordign to Charles Bowden. We have appetites-- sex, violence, mind-numbing pills. I liked the the last quote at the end of the book-- \\"Joy to the World.\\" That song says it all. \\"Never understood a single word he said but I helped him drink his wine.\\" That goes double for Bowden. I don't understand a single word he said (not all, anyway), but I drink his words all the same. Blood Orchid is as mind numbing as anything else. I'm numb after reading it. Maybe as I human orchid, I'm just bleeding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dixie's DVD Reviews","review":"I threw this disc into the trash after just one viewing.

It leads up to the 1976 Paris Tasting that compared some California wines to some French wines - it gives all of the background to the wines involved, as well as the people. It is written by the one reporter that was actually present at the tasting. The book describes how this was a turning point in the development of international wines and the resulting impact.Unfortunately it does not stop there. It then tries to give an update on the current state of international wines, and thus rather than a book about a point in time, which would remain timeless, puts itself at a point in time (2004/5)looking at the wine landscape, and thus becomes dated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Historical Read","review":"This is a great read for those interested in how California emerged as a leading wine producer and those who were responsible."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Napa Valley Wine Puzzle","review":"After 30 years of tasting wines in the Napa Valley, I finally found a book that puts all the pieces together.

Highly recommended.Then Taber spends the last 20% of his book looking at a few wineries in a few wine regions around the world, and an update on the French and Napa regions since the competition in 1976.

Taught by the legendary Elmore James, J.B. Hutto learned to play the guitar when he was an adult, and his fiery vocal response was his distinguishing characteristic. As the strongest of the Second-Generation Chicago blues singers, Hutto's trained voice wails over his simple slide, favoring blitz-line wails up to the 12th fret. As a bandleader, he often shared the stage with Hound Dog Taylor, and the two traded solos between hands of poker. The sessions visited here feature JB with his band in prime form, split between Mothers and Turner's in 1966 and 1972. As many more of these closed club sessions are becoming available to the public, they open a door to the younger generation to gain appreciation for what would have been an average Wednesday night in 1967."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I thought this would improve the sound of the psp a lot more than it did...I can still hardly hear it."},{"rating":"1","title":"PSP Sound System","review":"I did not like this product as it did not line up with the psp system I brought in 2007.

The subject matter is divided into about 100 topics. Each is covered in a two-page spread, no more, no less. (All the news that fits, we print.) Surprisingly, the rigid structure works. The author has brief, quality content on each topic. He addresses selection among the different types of bicycles, basic techniques for off-road and on, health and fitness issues, racing skills, maintainance, et al.

The book is lavishly illustrated with color photos on virtually every page. As an informal treatment on the subject of bicycling, it does an average job. While the book tries to cover everything from road biking to mountain biking, the information is scarce and only provides thumbnail glimpses of each topic that is covered. Most of the photographs seem rather dark and underexposed. This may be a result of the publisher not keeping an eye out on quality control. This book is rather expensive and thin. For the price of this book, you would probably do better to purchase \\"Richard's 21st Century Bike Book\\" which does a much better job of covering bicycling."},{"rating":"1","title":"An expensive \\"Coffee Table\\" book","review":"This book has lots and lots of pictures but is more of a coffee table book than a serious bicycle book.

If it wasn't for track 9) Fully Heated w/ B-Legit, I would have given this album 1 star. Track 9) Fully Heated is a decent cut, but not great - definately not worth scrappin up 12 bucks for the whole album.

The browning elements do not light up evenly by appearance and the toast is much darker on one side than the other using the right two slice side. The left two slice side seems to work much better but it is so slow the bread is dried out by the time it is toasted. I am used to moist bread on the inside and toasted on the outside, not with this toaster, just dry all the way through. My mother got a Kitchenaide for a little more money and loves it.

You have to watch your hands, because the top chrome is not covered around the edges like other toasters and it gets very hot.Unfortunately, the elements to toast do not, unless you are just using the bagel function. It takes awhile to toast.The joke in my family is that I purchased the energy saver toaster. The elements started to go after 4months.

On calling T-Fal I was told to ship them the whole toaster, proof of purchase, and RETURN SHIPPING MONEY! They would then look at it and DECIDE if it needed repair , replacement, or would be returned AS IS. If they did not feel it was neccesary, they would not even repair it.

However, after two years of moderate use, one set of heating coils stopped working. Normally this should be a straightforward repair (clean, repair, or replace elements).However, when dismantling the appliance, it was clear that T-Fal never intended that the product be repairable.

The two slots on the right side are merely passable. The toasting cycles take a long time and sometimes you need more than 1 cycle to get good medium-done toast.

The handles are loose-feeling and the whole thing gives the impression of not wanting to be overworked.Six weeks after purchasing this toaster, the left side stopped working entirely.The company's customer service couldn't have been worse, as they seem to have deliberately hidden any ways to call a human being at T-Fal. Upon reaching a representative (finally) I was told that I would have to send the toaster to them (at my expense) and that they would decide after two or three weeks whether to repair or replace the toaster.

With the extreme low level of heat that it is actually capable of producing, it is more of a bread drier than a toaster.In the beginning, it would make toast... eventually. Over time it has gotten worse and worse and is now useless. The bread ejector buttons are poorly engineered enough that they usually don't work.

The toasting took a long time (longer than my old one.)and when I tried to get it to toast again one of the handles would not stay down at all.

The toast cycle takes forever and the bread/muffins do not toast evenly. There are too many parts of the coils that do not heat up. The angled slots are functionally gumby, although eye appealing.

I'm wondering if the browning control knobs are connected to anything, now. maybe it's just a Fisher-Price toy that T-Fal accidentally marketed as an actual toaster.

However,I did figure out it is attached by taking off the reflector from the pedal.I have no clue what the extra metal piece is for.

Save your money for a pair of clipless pedals!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clipped!","review":"Installation was easy although there were no instructions included.

My equipment weight is only 3.5 pounds, so I consider that a flaw and was planning to return it.The trouble is, the ball head is so extremely lightweight, I barely notice the weight of it, along with the Gitzo legs (Gitzo GT0531 Series 0 6X Carbon Fiber 3-Section Tripod with G-Lock), when carrying them in my camera backpack. The next size up is considerably heavier and larger, so much so that the tripod weight becomes noticeable. So even though it doesn't perform up to spec, I can't bring myself to return it.UPDATE: Perhaps the ballhead was completely flawed from the start. While using it with a much lighter 17-40 lens a month after writing this review, it slipped out of lock permanently. It's no longer usable and no longer under the return period.

Upon opening the box, I discovered the stationary side rail had several gouges in the wood and several areas with chipped paint. I e-mailed the manufacturer and they promptly sent me a new siderail. I was impressed by their customer service. We proceeded to put it together, which was fairly easy. The color is lovely and I get tons of compliments on how nicely it fits in with the room decor. The only complaint (and it's major) is that we find it extremely difficult to raise and lower the siderail. It takes ALOT of effort and the bed shakes and the legs sway which makes me question the sturdiness of this product. I will keep this crib because it is only for occasional use, and I don't think we will be using the siderail much, but I would not recommend it as the baby's primary bed.

The group's leader, Mick Farren, has gone on to be an influential writer and critic on both sides of the Atlantic. Among other things, the fantastic fold-out artwork is one of my favorite album covers. It's \\"underground\\" in the sense that the group obviously weren't trying to be the next Beatles.

My Kindle dictionary got used more with this book than any other. I did keep reading and am glad that I did. It was a great story, exciting and well filled with heroes, heroines, and some nasty bad guys (and gals). A few minor flaws in the story kept me from giving it five stars.

The author suffers from what I will politely refer to as \\"character obsession.\\" Her favorites are obvious, and they can do no wrong in her eyes. The descriptions are over exaggerated, painful, almost childish in their eroticism. There's nothing satisfying about any of the interactions, and the plot highlights are marred by the author's desire to insert sex throughout. The level of detail is unnecessary and awkward.I'm not sure how this equates to Robin Hood as a mythology. A few cherry-picked names stick out, but this is nothing but erotic fantasy fan-fiction. It doesn't even work as an \\"I just want a dumb read\\" novel. Very disappointing.

I was curious because I enjoyed some of the songs on the Elton John Soundtrack, and I wanted to see how the music fit the story....Let me just say, I was real impressed that Amazon had it, I had not been able to find it anywhere, and the picture quality, sound quality was great, but.....that cannot save a bad movie, and that is what this was. Everything just happened to quick, it was simply lame, I can't really think of any other way to put it. Yes, I am a guy, but even I can enjoy a truly heartfelt romance, which this was trying to be, but didn't make the grade. Before I saw the movie, I had all of these images in my mind, when I would hear the music, picturing what a great story this could be, I really hope someday I will be able to hear the music again, without it being horribly tainted by this film. Would you believe, after giving this bad review, I still have plans to order the sequel, go figure...."},{"rating":"2","title":"70's era dream movie","review":"Ditto as Tim just reviewed. This movie played the 'midnight show' circuit in the 70's before Rocky Horror became the rage, and I missed it somehow. I searched for so many years but no luck finding anywhere in video stores. They never heard of it and had no record of it. Have wanted to experience the movie to go with the beautiful soundtrack of Elton John that I have enjoyed for 30 years.This movie will bring back visions and memories of college days and first love from that era. Although 'Animal House', 'Fast Times', and 'Ferris Bueller' might be the generation films from the 70's and early 80's, \\"Friends\\" should be the 'love' film for the early 70's 'peace' generation to yearn for.

I used it to make a beef braised in red wine. Sauteing the beef and then the chopped vegetables was a breeze. I thought that the oblong pan might be a problem with my stove, which his a flat glass top. But it worked out great. The fact that part of the pan is not under the burner was actually a benefit, because I could push the cooked vegetables to the less heated part and thus prevent overcooking. I then put the whole concoction (with the red wine, broth, etc.) covered in the oven for the 3 hours need to braise the meat. The rubber handles, while they still need to be handled with a pot holder, were not scorching hot like metal handles would have bee. This is going to be my new go-to pot for all stove-to-oven cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent purchase!","review":"Bought this pan for my mom as a Mother's Day gift. She absolutely loves it!

The only drawback I've found is that, unlike a round pan, the lid can fall into the dish. It made quite a mess when I dropped it into the chili I was making - so I'll definitely have to be more careful next time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical AND Unpractical","review":"This pan is great for making a large skillet meal and even for boiling or roasting things on top of the stove. I do, however, find it hard to store because of its length and it doesn't quite fit on any burner on my stove. It has plenty of uses, but it's the non-cooking aspects that are unpractical. Also, just like the full set of RR Hard Anodized pots and pans, it has bolts on the interior of the pan where the handles are. Food likes to get up in there and stick. Nothing that can't be handled, but you need to put attention into cleaning that area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"All I can say is that this pan is Excellent!

In this ecological disater tale, Strieber and Kunetka use some of the devices they used during Warday, particularly Government Reports, Newspaper Articles and witness interviews to give the feeling your reading a true story. Yet, unlike Warday, this not a \\"fake documentary\\" but a good, action filled story with so very well drawn characters. I'm not sure of the science behind the whole situation that the writers use, or whether this cautionary tale is even remotely likely, biut as a story, it works. Here they uses some classic science fiction themes reminiscent of Phillip K.

Read it even if you're not about to leave for the Peace Corps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Start but typical Ethnocentric white person","review":"While I enjoyed the beginning of the book, the middle and ending were tedious. I loved the exploration of culture and all that is Bhutan until Mz. Zeppa forsakes her school and travels to the university. I thought it rude to desert what she started out and learned to love (the remote village). When she gets to the university, fights with coworkers, tries to change the Bhutanese women, I felt badly for all that is western culture. I am tired of people going to the east and trying to impose their culture, social morays, and precepts. I truly feel sorry for the child that is split between cultures and lacking a true essential - father - in life. Please do not buy this book and further subsidize White Ethnocentrism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable reading","review":"Ideal for those planning a visit to this remote place, Zeppa's book smoothly introduces you to a diverse culture, providing many hints on customs and daily life, all in a colloquial (and sometimes amusing) tone. She is always respectful of others (not sacrificing some constructive critic in the way). Many would wish for this book to have been longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for anyone who is really interested in Bhutan","review":"As someone from Eastern Bhutan, I think Jamie has done a really wonderful job of portraying Bhutan as it is. Having been away from Bhutan for quite a long time, this book really helped bring back fond memories. Many times while reading this book, I couldn't help myself from thinking \\"yes, that's exactly how it is there\\". I really like her style of writing and her sense of humor, and I personally feel that this is the one book that really describes Bhutan the most accurately. I disagree with the reviewer who says that she comes off as being self centered and shallow. This book is all about explaining Bhutan. If you are planning on visiting Bhutan because you are interested in it's people/culture, this book is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One point about Jamie Zeppa's stay in Bhutan","review":"Just a response to some of the reviews of this book....Jamie Zeppa did not live in Bhutan for three years. She lived there for about ten years. Her experience as recounted in the book is a lot deeper and richer than a short stay would provide. A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Took Time To Appreciate, But The Payoff Is There For Those Who Persist","review":"I started out hating this book and its author. Jamie Zeppa was an English student, preparing to get her doctorate. On a whim, she decided to teach for two years in Bhutan, a remote, tiny country precariously situated between India and China. Her fiance was not amused.I found Zeppa's initial observations of Bhutan pedestrian and whiny. It took her about six months to fall in love with the country and its people, and as she did, she became more interesting and grounded, letting go of and struggling with her sense of cultural supremacy.This book is a love story between the author, the country and a rather remarkable young man."},{"rating":"1","title":"to me it was too superficial","review":"As i sad before, the whole story was superficial and the writer was kind of naive, I missed some deeper info about Bhutanese culture"},{"rating":"2","title":"A journey for any reader prepared to enter remarkable world","review":"This is a beautiful book that is at once funny, sad, informative and always honest. This book is truly a \\"journey into Bhutan\\" for both writer and reader. Zeppa's recounts her early experiences in Bhutan and the proccess of adapting to a vastly different foreign culture in a way that is both humourous and rings true. Her love story with Bhutan's landscape and its people is obvious, and her language carries the reader every step of the way. Zeppa's subsequent realization of her idealized perspective and understanding of the country's true complexity is a theme to which any overseas adventurer can relate. The book ends a bit abruptly, but overall a moving and wonderful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of these reviews are thoughtless","review":"Before criticizing an author who has undoubtedly poured years of sweat and toil into her first book, some of these reviewers should look a little closer at themselves. A memoir--and this book IS a memoir--is \\"self-centered\\" by its very nature. It is about one person's experience, and their particular view of the world through that lens. To criticize a memoirist for writing too much \\"about herself\\" is like criticizing a biographer for writing to much \\"about someone else.\\" If you wanted a travel guide, to Fodor's with you. Instead what you got is a very honest description of a young woman's trials and tribulations in a very foreign country. Some of this took courage to write, too, and we should respect that, rather than trying to use some of that honesty (some brief passages about her sex life, for example) against her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book.","review":"This is a great book and I recommend it for anyone - especially those who are travelling or starting a new adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"This book will leave you thinking about it long after you've read it. I thought the author's transformation throughout her experience was so interesting to read about. I was disappointd that she didn't give more info about how her relationship with her lover ended because she had been so thorough about how they fell in love. Otherwise, it was a great book. I learned a lot about Bhutan's culture (I had never even heard of this country before I read the book.) and have recommended this book to other friends and colleagues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better luck next time","review":"I'm afraid I have to agree with those who found this book disappointing. I've long had a fascination with the country of Bhutan, but this book seems to have little to do with it. It comes across more like a whiny memoir from a privileged westerner more interested in complaining about her problems (many of them brought on herself) rather than giving anyone real insights into Bhutanese society, culture or history. Like others, I found myself amazed at the rather caviler attitude Zeppa displays in the book about many of her decidedly unprofessional actions.Despite my assessment of this book, I actually would be interested in reading another from the same author -- perhaps one written on the same subject when she has grown up some."},{"rating":"2","title":"its ok.","review":"It's an ok mixer.

I was pleasantly surprise to find that book covers in great detail black holes, dark matter and dark energy. For students willing to broaden their understanding and appreciation of cosmology. It is a serious book, though there is very little math in it, one needs concentration and patience to absorb the material.

It was more of a winters day piece with songs like 'Wind Chimes' and 'Whistle In' confusing me but staying with me for a long time. Twenty years later I bought the CD and I realise what a brilliant, if uneven, bit of work this is. The harmonies are first rate and some of the ideas are 'out there' but demands patience. If only the unreleased 'Smile' was a reality, the course of rock history could have changed in 1967. The alternate takes of 'Good Vibrations' see the mad genius Brian Wilson in full flight.

Smiley Smile is a stoned-sounding mess, many of the songs are incoherently awful and even the tuneful ones have seriously dumb lyrics (\\"I love my vegetables\\") or aural noise experiments (laughing, speeding-up, etc.) that make them painful as background music.

Even though the cover art - reproducing that of the vinyl LP - says \\"For STEREO phonographs\\" leaving me to suspect that Capitol Records intentionally tricked people into buying this. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTREMELY ANNOYING","review":"Might very well be the most annoying game ever played.

From page 82 to 202 there were only charts. Alot of these charts are totally useless to me and I know many others. Out of a 205 page book there are only 70 pages of any information to read about and then it is only charts. I read the reading material in about 2 hours and found nothing useful and highlighted nothing in the book. If you want a great pendulum book buy \\"Pendulums and the Light\\" by Diane Stein. You get a whole book of awesome and useful information. For me it would have been more practical to highlight the parts that I didn't need so much since most of the book is now highlighted that is how much information was so wonderful and useful and helpful. Sorry to say that Walter Lubeck's book is a sad comparison to Diane Stein's.

But that doesn't much matter, overall.What does matter is the music itself, and this is from beginning to end one of the best albums I've heard in ages. \\"Drowning in Wonderful Thoughts About Her\\" is a perfect album opener. \\"Jo-Anna Says\\" is perhaps the best Beatle-esque song since the Beatles themselves. And it just continues from there. It's eclectic, yet with lots of pop and rock appeal, and it's as fun as music gets.Per Gessle's solo work is the best kept musical secret of the past decade.

Pepper's is the most psychedelic album to come out of the sixties, the Godz are sure to blow your minds. They range from improv folk to rambling chaotic breakdowns--a testament to minds at work. Jangling detuned guitars, backed by BANG! POW! drums and random bass lines, fall together amid powerful and even catchy vocals. Songs such as Where, Permanent Green Light, and Soon the Moon stand as amazing documents of non-mainstream psychedelia. The Godz are in many ways the opposite of pop music; they might start with a melody one would sing in the shower, but they soon proceed to break away all pre-conceived notions of what music is. Experimenting heavily with primitive rhythms, the Godz are a relic of all that is right with improv and experimentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Different Bands!","review":"Description is NOT of this title or band.

I remember when I had one of these 30 years ago and it would go so much higher. It lasted for months. This time? My son and I went outside and it never went more than 20 feet high. On the fourth attempt, the rocket landed on the roof and never worked again due to a hairline crack in the very brittle plastic. It would never pressurize with air again and has been sent directly to the trash can.

For starters, the rockets are constructed with lighter plastic. But the pump is where the problems really lie.The shaft is plastic and seems like it will break. That would not be so bad except that air and water begin to leak after 5 pumps. I purchased two sets and both pumps have identical issues. The air did not leak on the older version and the rocket would travel at least 25 feet (I remember many a > 20 fooot roof-top retrieval ventures) vertically. Now you are lucky if it goes over 15 feet.The rockets are distinctly lighter as well. I remember mine crashing nose-first onto the cement with a thud whereas these flay in the wind and gingerly fall on their sides."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER WORKED: DO NOT BUY","review":"I remember these water rockets from my childhood - there wasn't much that was more fun.So it was extremely disappointing to buy one for my son for his birthday, and make a big deal about shooting it off, only to have the thing never work.Design is the same as I remember, but the manufacturiing quality is extremely poor. Find another source.Sean"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Buy!","review":"This launcher may be alright for very young kids but the durability factor is less than impressive. The pump can only withstand lower pressures which means the rockets will not fly too high. The \\"rockets\\" that come with are fine except for the fact that once they break they are done and you are out of a rocket. The best water rocket system that I have purchased and repeatedly used was found on eBay under \\"soda bottle rocket launcher.\\" This launcher allows you to use soda bottles (easily replaceable) and holds very high pressures (incredible heights).

I love how King took his time with the plot and as always his attention to detail. I've found people either love or hate this movie. More than anything I like what he did with the character of Andre Linoge. How his character is never fully explored, hardly ever says anything throughout the entire movie. But for me, that makes his charaacter even better. You don't need a character to be completely developed and blabbering the entire movie to be good. This was the first of Colm Feore's movies that I saw and I was very much impressed. I'll even go as far as to say his acting is the best of the cast, just behind him is Tim Daly of course.

But I am also honest and wont get swayed by what I hoped would be an excellent movie, remember a high rating is normally ascertained and potential low markers wont bother with a complaining review. I thought I had to. The film started perfectly, no waiting for action - and when the evil arrived in Maine, and got seen! , he still didnt go away. This had be on the edge of my seat. The middle slowed a bit but was still quite good (the file should have been about 3 - 3.5 hours). The ending was a problem, there should have been more to the ending, and more time should have been spent on the bad character and his profile and past. Id give this 3.5 and call it an average to good film, nothing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"This movie takes place in a small town isolated on an Island off Maine. And as the title suggest, it is hit by the worse storm ever. Snow so thick it is hard to see through and wind so strong that the waves of the ocean start to claim buildings. This alone would make for an exciting adventure movie. But of course King gives us more. A truly supernatural villain comes to town and knows everyone secrets. He starts to kill them off and keeps asking to be given \`what he wants.\\" As we watch the movie we are trying to figure out what he wants...and also wondering why the villagers do not give it to them.The movie is suspenseful. And the acting is great. Everyone in this movie acts well, including the children. Of course the best is Colm Feore as the villain Andre Linge, and Tim Daly as the town Constable Michael Anderson. Better then most movies made today.Only thing I would have added, is for a book to have been written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has to be the best ever.","review":"Storm of the Century is very well done. It has a way of captivating you to the point where you simply forget how long the film is (about 4 hours) and you just want to see what's going to happen next.

He has been in BIG blockbusters (Iron Eagle II, Pearl Harbor) but...and again but it is actually in this movie, I believe, that Mr. Colm has surpassed the very best standards that have been set in Hollywood.COLM FEORE as ANDRE LINOGE is the very best there is in this art medium of showbiz.\\"Give me what I want, and I'll go away...refuse and you shall walk into the sea two by two, like you saw it in your dreams.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite for an afternoon in the snow!!","review":"When the radio calls out that school is closed for that day-long winter snowstorm, shovel the walkway, make the hot chocolate and bunker-down for an afternoon with one of the best story tellers! Stephen King's creepy blizzard set on a small-town New England island in Maine (of course) is a great way to spend 4 hours snowed-in and on the edge of your seat. The direction and performances in SOTC are outmatched only by the fine special effects (the SNOW!), and if you happen to live somewhere where it doesn't snow, this 4 hour flick will make you believe you're in need of a bag of ice-melt and a snow plow!

The plot is intruiging, but the movie is sooooo long. It's like, what, five hours? The movie pulls you in with an interesting begining, and keeps you watching with a so-so middle, but there is really no point. There is so much unneccesary information and there are so many pointless scenes. Yeah, like, seven people or so die, but there isn't really anything all too exciting about it. After a while, this movie becomes quite annoying, and you just want to see what the guy wants, and what he wants is rather idiotic, and is very anti-climactic. So, in my opinion, don't waste your time watching this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment","review":"When it first aired as a \\"big event\\" television miniseries, it was rightly billed as King's first \\"novel for television.\\" That is its only merit.The pace is slow, interspersed with brief moments of suspense.

As a parent I think it's pretty farfetched to think all the parents except one would go along with the horrible choice of giving a child to an inhuman monster to raise. This for me completely ruined the film. Because of it I found the characters quite unlikable, unusual for King to find most of the people unsympathetic. Yes I know what you're thinking. They had no choice. But I am telling you most parents would die first, and would probably rather see their child dead.

In these bleak and worrying times, just listen to the sheer joy in Neil's final song in this set. \\"Good to See You\\" must be seen and heard to be believed; Neil's playing is impeccable on all cuts, but is particularly noticable here. How could one not be uplifted by such a great song? Highly recommended for anyone who loves fine acoustic performances. This is certainly one of the very best available -- bar none!"},{"rating":"2","title":"neil young-as good as ever!","review":"After seeing Neil Young's acoustic tour last year in Boston, I have raved about the show to all fans who weren't there. I was pleased to find a DVD version of this concert for everyone to enjoy. The only negative is that it didn't include all the great old songs he performed that night but about 60 minutes worth of new and a few old. A great \\"Philadelphia\\" and \\"Harvest Moon\\" alone would be worth buying. The DVD sound is perfect and makes you feel that you part of the intimate audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Excellent sound quality but Neil's performance seems a shadow of his former self.This is flaccid stuff. Heavy on guitars, light on artistic content. If he was a baseball pitcher he would have hung up his glove, or whatever accoutrements apply, long ago.Perhaps this is what Bob Dylan means when he talks about technology having outpaced art. Great sound, negligible content.This is not the spirt of rock, but of rococo."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice surprise from Neil Young","review":"Shakey Pictures is an accurate pseudonym for Neil Young's video productions - most of his concert films leave a lot to be desired. This, however, is a genuine pleasure to watch and conveys the same warmth and emotion as the album by the same name. There are a few old favorites thrown in as well as a few numbers from the latest CSNY outing, but this is largely new material, purely solo and acoustic and extremely well-performed.Videophiles may be annoyed by the blue and pink shadows (especially distracting on the DVD) that fall over Neil's face during several of the piano and organ numbers, but the music is just fine. One particular standout is a pump organ version of \\"Long May You Run,\\" reminiscent of UNPLUGGED's \\"Like a Hurricane.\\"A definite recommended buy for any Neil Young fan and a must-have for those thrilled by the latest album, SILVER & GOLD."},{"rating":"2","title":"U.k.

I have been fascinated by Elizabeth since childhood, after all she was a powerful woman in a time when women were considered the property of their fathers and afterwards of their husbands. This book is still one of the perfect books to curl up next to a fire with hot cider and immerse yourself in. Kay is frankly one of the best authors I have been lucky enough to discover, rivalling any bestselling author. Her other novel, Phantom, also sucks you into the color and passion of the story, making both novels unforgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've read this dozens of times!","review":"I absolutely love this novel. Susan Kay is a master story teller who has recreated the time of Elizabeth I with beautiful prose and a masterfully constructed arch. Her extensive research is evident in every chapter.

This work has accomplished what it sets out to do: entertain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elizabeth Her men","review":"This is a lengthy book covering the life of Elizabth and the men who played pivotal roles in her reign and her life. The author successfully captures the intricacies of Ellizabth in her dealings withnthe ambitions of the men in her world, the politics of her kingdom in relation to the rest of the European nations and monarchies and the trials of a female monarch in the male dominated society. The author reveals Elizabeth's frailties, foiables and insecurities, but also carefully portrays her strengths and political savvy.

This DVD is no more than a visual sampler of the bands and their live performances in poor quality. This was all shot at one show and throughout the duration of the tour. so what you hear is what you get. some of the performances are not of the bands best.I really enjoyed the used performance live, as well as MCR's, and i was hoping to see more than just a SINGLE performance each on the dvd!

The fact that he was a medical student is no excuse - he knew it was wrong, not to mention illegal, otherwise he would have no need for secrecy. Didn't he get enough dissection and vivisection in his medical school classes? Apparently not. I don't buy his explanation that the clandestine torture and killing of these animals was done to further his studies - if that were the case, he would have done the experiements IN SCHOOL under the SUPERVISION of a professor. Yes, it's impressive that he was a medical student - he is obviously intelligent.

His system removes the stress and anxiety for men that are associated with dating, both before and after. Amazingly, Fenton's methods are grounded in a healthy respect for both women and men, and they create win-win situations for both parties. You will, however, need to be mature and disciplined to implement these strategies.

Woodard's book does a nice job of establishing what needs to go into an editorial plan but it completely ignores production issues, printing, advertising and funding. It's a little like telling someone how to design a car without mentioning that in addition to nice upholstery and great body work it needs an engine and tires.

For one thing, it seems to assume that if you're going to publish a magaine you had better have a lot of money. I didn't have a lot of money, so this book started out by making me feel like I ought to throw my idea away. Second, it has a lot of information about management (how to make business decisions, budgeting, strategy, subscribers are a leaking bucket, blah blah) but I was already past that. I just wanted to know how to get started. Nothing truly practical here. If you're just thinking about starting a magazine, this book gives a decent overview of how to think about and plan your idea.

My son will watch it from across the room even when he's out of the crib. He seems mesmerized by it. The projection feature is an added bonus for those nightime \\"calm-me-down\\" sessions. It's nice that you have four music selections, and the remote is great if you want to start up the mobile without baby seeing you. Most of the time baby is asleep by the time the music stops. I also like how easy it is to attach to the side of the crib. It's very stable, but does not damage the crib at all.

They have a pretty rough surface so it's not really that good for grinding at first until you wear it out. They are not \\"polished\\" like what other superlite trucks said in the description so I guess that's the reason why. They are very sturdy though and does not feel cheap at all. The problem is it feels heavier than most other trucks. There are holes and areas where they leave hollow to remove weight but I still find it pretty heavy. It's still a very solid pair of trucks, the extra weight isn't too big of a problem but I think it's worth mentioning. Turning is good, and I find it really stable even at higher speeds."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT SINGING, MEDIOCRE OPERA","review":"FIRST, THIS RE-ISSUE BRINGS NO LIBRETTO AND SCANT NOTES.

THE STORY OF A TYPHOID MARY RUSSIAN PRINCESS WHO COMMITS SUICIDE WHEN HER LOVER DOES NOT FORGIVE HER (BUT, YES, HE DOES, TOO LATE)FOR WIPING OUT HIS FAMILY, HAS NONE OF THE UNIVERSAL THEMES A WORK OF ART MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO SURVIVE.

There was no one on this team of writers who was fluent in English, which makes the going tough at times. While there is information here which the hardcore student will find worthwhile, be warned that it is a challenging read nonetheless. The writers also wrote from the viewpoint of the Chinese Communist government, with occasional disparagements of Western governments and their policies in China thrown in.

It starts off really strong but the ending, while good, is not as good as the rest of the book. It's the story of Claire, a therapist who many years ago gave up an infant daughter for adoption, and Claire's patient Jody, a young woman confused about her future. Claire begins to suspect that Jody is the daughter she gave away. Both women have slightly troubling personal lives. Many of their relationships have shortcomings that neither is particularly happy with and they begin to rely on the patient-therapist relationship too much. This is a witty, darkly comic psychological thriller that is very, very readable. I really could not put it down. As I said earlier, the ending is not as strong as the beginning, but it's still quite good. The not-so-rosy picture of the world Homes paints for us rings very true. If you like dark humor, you'll like this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Is Missing","review":"The first book I ever read by Homes was The End of Alice. I went into Mother trying not to compare the topics or the material, but expecting to see some of the flare Homes had in Alice, and Music for Torching; unfortunately, it fell short. Country of Mothers is a wonderful idea, a psychologist believing a client is her long lost daughter she gave up for adoption 23 years earlier, but poorly executed. The characters have conflicting actions to motivation, and are one dimensional at best. It seems Homes had not yet found her voice or talent for creating engrossing characters and motivations. I found myself fighting the urge to flip forward several pages at a time, certain I would not miss any plot twists, since they were few and far between. I encourage fans of Alice to read Mother if for no other reason then to see the very aparent evolution of a writer, as it is obvious Homes was not at her best during In the Country of Mothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who was crazier?

It should be called The Puppetmaster because there are some masterful manipulations in this series.I wholeheartedly agree with my fellow reviewer; however, I wish (s)he had not posted the d-addicts synopsis as it gives too much away. The story hits the ground running within the first few minutes of the first episode and doesn't stop. Yes, there's a little bit of romance (Asian shows are big on their romance), but it's a very little bit. Plus, the triangle is interesting as they are the main characters.If you've never watched a tv show that wasn't in English, get over it and broaden your horizons!

Tempi may be a bit slow at times, but that isn't a problem on this music.There's only one flaw that makes me deny this one a fifth star. The soprano's Latin pronunciation is not good. She has a flaw apparently common among German singers in Latin, but on this work it's especially obvious, because of the text of her first solo: \\"Ti dicit hymnus, Dius, in Sion; it tibi ridditur votum in Jirusaleem.\\" It just sticks out too much for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst performance I know for Mozart's Requiem","review":"Karajan, like Karajan, gives a well-polished performance, but lacking the slightest esprit. The singers are very good, the orchestra and the choir are well coordinated, but it all sounds like an army discipline. The military associations do not end up here: in fortissimo pieces (like the Dies Irae) Karajan, as always, exposes all his aggressiveness. He's not powerful, but violent. Even in pieces like the Lacrimosa it seems as though the choir sounds sad because someone gave them an order to sound sad.Leave Karajan in anything that needs an expression of true sentiment (in short: in anything having to do with music...). If you want a good performance of Mozart's requiem - turn to Barenboim's early recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"La peor grabaci��n del requiem de Mozart que tengo","review":"Poseo unas 10 grabaciones de esta obra, y definitivamente esta es la peor (por mucho!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total brain fart","review":"I doubt that Edgar Allan Poe would want to put his name to this total piece of garbage.

The only thing i didn't like so much was the tempo changed greatly from song to song which isn't such a bad thing, but it kind of takes me out of the \\"trance\\" that i like when listening to good music. I think most true music listeners will appreciate it. If you're looking for their more hardcore side you should probably get one of the first two albums.Good album but a little bit different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frickin Awesome!","review":"I haven't heard Ill Nino since their first cd. I just got this one and it is really good. I really like the percussion on this cd more than anything else. They show that you can actually make all different kinds of drums sound good together. Unlike Slipknot where you can't even tell that there is more than one drummer. The screaming is pretty awesome, but I like the singing alot too. Just because some of the songs at the end aren't that hard doesn't mean this cd sucks. Music needs to have structure, not just the same thing over and over again. If you appreciate good musicianship then you should buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rock Revolution","review":"Never have I heard a band this interesting and creative, since Godsmack or Killswitch Engage. Most likely, their sequel will be just as good, if not better. Enigma will soon hit the shelves this summer on July 27th and you can bet I'll buy it. Ill Nino, in my opinion, is not like any band you've heard before. The factors that noticibly set them apart from other heavy metal bands is they don't usually have the same material for every album, but they also don't stray from it truly means to be a band. I also would also like to note that I and Ill Nino come from the same state, which is New Jersey and I also plan to go to (hopefully) one their concerts live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Study Aid","review":"Excellent study aid for tests and very informative for those interested in the rationale behind US Supreme Court decisions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Constitutional Analysis in a Lucid and Concise Nutshell","review":"Anyone interested in Consitutional Law would do well to purchase this book.

Joanna's voice is incredibly versatile - sometimes she sounds like a higher-pitched and purer Mariah Carey, sometimes a bit like Kelly Clarkson, and even a bit like singer Abra Moore on the spine-tingling ballad \\"This Crazy Life.\\" The song \\"Let It Slide\\" has a smooth, non-glossy feel that maybe should be found more on the album. She also sounds very strong on the rocker \\"Drifter.\\" The other songs are pleasant and Joanna displays very good songwriting ability. The songs she picked by other writers are also solidly written. Diane Warren is a hit and miss songwriter, but her \\"Your Obsession\\" is sexy. I think on Joanna's next album, her style will grow, and her songs will stand out more. It's good if songs don't tire you out with their catchiness, but you need to be able to really remember a CD for it to be great."},{"rating":"2","title":"China Beach Soundtrack","review":"I bought this CD in 1990 (approx) by accident.

Already men among boys when they came to popularity in the late 1960's these fellows have, over a tortuous path and a large number of years, continued to produce authentic, well-crafted rock n roll. Music that still matters. While Levon Helm may not sing with the power he once did, his sly delivery remains absolutely unique and absolutely recognizable. An archtype. Rick Danko, despite well documented troubles with drugs and alcohol, remains a wonderfully talented player and singer. Garth Hudson, who wraps the all of The Band's music in shimmering sonic invention, continues as one of the greatest (and most underrated) musicians on the planet. Not what they were in 1969, true enough (but who would really want to be?), but incredibly musical and still immensely satisfying.

After only having them a few months, the dot on the 1 C. measure has completely worn off and a couple of others are showing wear. These have always been washed by hand, too. This is particularly inconvenient because the 2/3 and 3/4 cups make it much harder to distinguish by size just by looking at them. Someone needs to go back to design and start over."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are awful.","review":"I have had the black and the white versions, and the colored dot with the number wore off very quickly, even though it said on the package that it was \\"guaranteed not to wear off!\\" So, of course I called the company, who to their credit promptly sent me a new set, whose numbers again wore off. I'm still left guessing if I'm using the correct cup because now, a couple years later, there is no sign that there was ever even a number on them. I'm writing this review today because I'm finally buying a new set in a different brand. I also had trouble with OXO's stainless steel cups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice grip, but otherwise junk","review":"The rubber grips are nice, but as others have noted, the capacity circles (painted on) starts flaking off pretty quickly. Also, they are relatively shallow, so it makes it hard to get an accurate measure. If you don't want to dirty up several of them (for example, you need 1-1/2 cups worth), the shallowness makes it difficult to \\"eyeball\\" a half cup. I found I used an older, cheaper, taller set that I bought 20 years ago (for $1) more often. They also don't have a good pouring lip like on some others. With the paint flaking off, they look ratty. I can't remember if I threw them out or donated them."},{"rating":"1","title":"They are ok BUT...","review":"I originally decided to buy these OXO measuring cups because the price was reasonable and it has more cups then normal. At first I thought the extra cups were nice even though they are not really necessary.I've had them less than a month and already the numbers are coming off. LESS THAN A MONTH! I've come to realize the extra cups are actually a liability because they are hard to tell apart without the numbers on them. I would not buy these again. I feel like I've wasted my money. I should have just spent more money on cups with etched numbers on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Do not waste your money on these measuring cups. The size of the cup is written on a brightly colored dot on the handle of each cup which is very nice BUT it promptly washes off after just a couple of times in the sink. Mine have never seen the inside of a dishwasher and did not last for more than a month. A very disappointing purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you're not into exact measurements","review":"These measuring cups are very comfortable to use but the measurements washed off after about 3 cycles in the dishwasher. Now I have to guess at which measurement the cup is by eyeballing the size, which is not as much fun as it sounds. The actual cup portion has held up well. If the numbers were etched into the cups this would make this product worth buying. Oh, and the 7th piece (the egg separater) should be named the \\"yolk breaker\\" as it does not work at all, ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing numberfs","review":"I love OXO products but not these measuring cups. Same issue as others - the numbers vanish quickly. It's easy to always find the 1 cup measure, but when you want to quickly pull out the cups and know that you've grabbed the 1/3 cp measure vs. the 1/4 cup measure, you can't do it.

First, the plastic ring that holds the cups together is extremely flimsy and can easily break. But my biggest complaint is that the labels will quickly wash off even if you hand wash them! After a while, it becomes difficult to tell what is what in regards to size. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. This is not the first time I have been disappointed by an Oxo product but it will be my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best for liquid measure","review":"When I purchased these measuring cups, I mainly bought them for the 3/4 cup option which is not very common among measuring cups. The cups are fine, but be aware, there is a line within each cup to measure the contents which is nice for liquid measure--you don't spill the liquid. But when you have dry ingredients you cannot level the contents--you must \\"eyeball\\" shake and \\"eyeball\\" it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"THESE ARE REALLY GOOD CUPS!","review":"I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR A SIX PIECE MEASURING CUP SET FOR THE LONGEST TIME AND THEY ARE BLACK!

SO HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE."},{"rating":"2","title":"OXO Does it again!","review":"I can always rely on innovative products from this company! Perfectly balanced and shaped measuring cups--it even includes a 2/3 measure which I've never seen before. Durable enough, I can even throw them in the dishwasher without fear of fading colors or melting. A beautiful set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extra handy sizes and great egg separator","review":"This is the first time I've had a larger set of measuring cups, and I find the 2/3 and 3/4 cups absolutely essential for cooking now. The cups are light, but the grippy plastic on the handles makes them easy to use. I've been using my set for over a year and washing them in the dishwasher the entire time without the labels showing any signs of coming off, and the different color for each size makes identification simple, especially between the very similarly sized cups. Lastly, the egg separator has been a godsend for the key lime pies I make frequently. If you're having a difficult time with this tool, which handily sits across a cup with its little tab, you're either breaking the eggs too far above it, or they're not fresh enough - fresher eggs will have firmer yolks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"The markings on the measuring cups washed off, only washed by hand. I also purchased measuring spoons same result. Company said to mail back not worth postage. Won't buy oxo again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plastic Measuring cups","review":"Oxo is a safe choice for good products at reasonable prices and that's true of these cups. There are six in the set so pretty much all of the sizes you might need are covered. The shape is elongated instead of round, so they may be an easier fit into some canisters than round measures. The sizes are marked in different colors on raised lettering, so even if the paint wears off, you should still be able to read the sizes.Because these measures are plastic and not metal, some powdered ingredients seem to slightly stick to them, and oil is a bit harder to clean off. They are also a little bit bulky compared to metal measuring cups. That's why I am only giving them four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Measurements wear off","review":"I have these cups in black. I have had them for a long time and I only wash them by hand. Within the first 3 months the measurement dots began to wear off. I used my husband's modeling paint to paint the numbers back onto all of the cups and the modeling paint has lasted longer than the original measurements! The sizes of the cups are perfect for baking, however given the poor quality of the size dots, I would look to another product."},{"rating":"1","title":"guess the cup size","review":"I received these as a gift last Christmas & have had the same issues as everyone else...the numbers quickly wear off. (Hand washed only) and because of the extra cups, the sizes are so similar it is difficult to distinguish the cup size. Also, ingredients don't \\"release\\" well from the cups. Even dry ingredients such as sugar & flour will often stick to the insides of the cups. The soft plastic can also make them difficult to clean, especially if you've used butter or shortening. I'm on a search for a stainless steel measuring cup with the measurements stamped into them to avoid these issues in the future.On the plus side, the egg separator works really well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another product get rubber...","review":"The measuring cup are no different than any other set except OXO has added some features to make them better. First thing you will notice is the are not ROUND they are oval; and have rubber on the handle of each cup, and brightly colored raised markings, and they easily remove from the ring to use one at a time, and then securely fasten back onto the ring.This means no more opening a ring to remove a cup, or washing all the cups because you need to use one and got another dirty; and you won't loose them because they fasten securely back to the ring. These are also dishwasher safe. The price of these are a little more than the plastic ones you get in the store, but you are getting a lifetime warranty on the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and easy to use","review":"As plastic measuring cups go, these are attractive and easy to use. The Oxo is more sturdy than most others. The edge is angled, allowing for better compaction when scooping the ingredients. The scoop is oval, making it a little more narrow, and therefore easier to dip into smaller jars.It's difficult to compare a tool as straightforward as a measuring cup. Most others will perform the same function with different price points based on the materials used and the manufacturer.Overall, I would recommend these measuring cups. A less expensive set would also work fine, but Oxo does deliver additional functionality and style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I really liked the look of this set, however like others have said the stickers that tell you what size it is came off after just a few washes. I agree they should be part of the mold like my old Tupperware set which I'm now reaching for instead of these.

Since I couldn't exactly fit a vacuum cleaner under the bed to RE-deflate them, I spent the next ten minutes lying on the floor, wrestling these bags from under the bed.

Most of the songs have been redone in different styles from the original and still different from each other. Clearly Cerati put a lot of time and effort into the session. I never cared for \\"En la ciudad de la furia\\" until I heard this version. Andrea Echeverry was an excellent choice for backing vocals and adds a great deal to the song. Un misil en mi placard is completely different from its studio counterpart (which had a very \\"Police\\" style sound to it) and much fuller than the original.

It is full of one-line references to his songs, but you don't have to be a parrot-head to enjoy it. It is reminiscent of A Confederacy of Dunces, full of unusual characters, but with a more sympathetic hero.

Concerts, restaurants, t-shirts, CDs...if it's Buffett, I've either been there or done that. \\"Where Is Joe Merchant?\\" is my favorite of Jimmy's books. I first read this book in the mid 90s and went back to it recently. It's still such a great tale about an adventure on the run in the Caribbean. Buffett knows how to make his characters come alive. He makes you just wanna get up and escape every day life to have fun in the sun. If you are looking for either a relaxing read or maybe an easy escape, try it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fans dig it, but is it good?","review":"Colorful characters and some excellent settings.

If you love the music, you may be entertained by some of the references between the songs and the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Joe Merchant? Who cares?","review":"Once again I am left dissappointed with Buffett's incredibly shallow writing. With no character development and constant, shameless self promotion (using song titles, lyrics throughout the book in an attempt to sell more of his music) I've found his writing to be the perfect cure for my insomnia. I wish he'd stick to song writing and give up trying to become a novelist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I like Jimmy Buffett - I really do; and I wanted to like his book, Where is Joe Merchant? Unfortunately, the book wasn't very good. The plot was labored and the story itself did not hold my interest. It was not a good sign when midway through the book I couldn't care less if they found Joe Merchant or not. (The search for an allegedly deceased pop who is regularly sighted? Where have I seen THAT headline before?)While the hero, Frank Brown's mis-adventures were mildly entertaining, and the sly allusions to characters in old Buffett songs was clever, it was not enough for me give it a higher rating. As other reviewers have mentioned, perhaps Jimmy was trying too hard. Buffett's first effort at writing is by far the better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't have left Margaritaville....","review":"Only the most blindly dedicated Parrothead (and I thought I was one) could truly enjoy this book. I had to work too hard at trying to find an interesting plot amidst the New Age mishmash.

I read Joe Merchant after reading \\"A Pirate Looks At Fifty.\\" I loved the travel aspects and the fun Jimmy seems to have. I also enjoyed his style of writing. I was not disappointed by Joe Merchant either. If there is any criticism it would be that there are too many characters. I often had to go back to find out who they were. I fell in love with the descriptions of Carribean life. Jimmy, keep playing music, and give us a sequel to Joe Merchant. You have a new Parrothead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This is the kind of book you want to read when you need to get away from life in the city.

And because of that, thankfully, you get a sense that even though everything looks really bad--this too shall pass.The story flows easily and you are quickly absorbed into the mind of an eighth grader...who loves drums and of course, girls. It is his internal struggles and typical 13 year-old dialogue that makes you enjoy this book. You laugh out loud at his awkward trip ups and feel his passion for drumming. But I especially appreciated his thoughts and connection to his brother Jeffery. (I imagine every shrink in the country deals with sibling rivalry.)Someone in your family going through cancer treatment will really mature a person.

The only reservation I have of the book is Mr. Griffith makes it difficult for you to agree with his conclusions because he sometimes appears to be pushing a strangely reactionary and conservative military barrow. As a citizen of a nation that suffered as much as any in the 1914-18 holocaust, his belief in the offensive sounds all to much like a justification the semi-mystical cult of the offensive that created that unnecessary disaster.

I also discovered that features that were once free of charge, like the ability to create a family finder report are now only available if you pay their incredibly high fees. I bought this version hoping it would be an improvment over my old version. instead, I just wasted $45 as I've removed it and gone back to using my old version.

They're quick-thinking comedians who act, do impersonations, impressions, and sing, and they develop innocent ideas into whimsically funny situations. The show was popular for a simple reason: this is an example of real adult entertainment. They don't run to the toilet every two minutes, yet they don't avoid sex or anything that happens to the average Jo. They focus on human experience and the often absurd nature of human interaction and the human condition. It's often silly, but it's also witty and fresh and unpretentious.

Instead I bought this piece of junk. First, the different shape is a disadvantage, if you have a place made for your tape measure in your tool belt, it doesn't fit as well as the standard square shaped tapes. Second, the recoil is way to strong and not very smooth working at all. You have to use extra care when you recoil it if you don't want to get sliced or pinched by the tape. Third, the tape it self is very thin and cheap. If something falls on it or it gets pinched it is pemanently dented and mis-shapen. Also the cheap little plastic piece that prevents the tape from going too far inside the housing fell off, so now I have to dig the tape out. Oh yeah, and after about a dozen times after using it, the recoil doesn't work at all anymore.

I taught out of this book to freshmen.A lot of the notation in this book is horrible and I feel this makes it harder for people new to the subject to read. Also there are very few exercises for the students to practice. In addition, too many of the answers in the back of the book are incorrect (this really confuses students).I will not be teaching out of this book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"There has to be something better.","review":"This was the required text for my Introduction to Probability and Statistics course. The course was a required pre-requisite for the bachelor of science nursing program. The intended membership of the course was non-math majors, ie nursing and business majors. The book was very difficult to use. There were not enough example problems nor are there enough simple english explanations. In my course evaluation at the end of the term I emphatically stated the department needed to find a new text for the course. I was very happy to sell it back. The study guide is not worth the money either. Every other odd problem is not enough to learn from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately Book Required By Professor!","review":"I purchased textbook because it was required by my Biostatistics professor in my graduate program. Personally, I do not like the book. It makes problems more complicated than they need to be. I feel a good textbook is one in which you can read on your own and basically understand it without a whole lot of instruction and review by your professor. It would be very difficult to just read this textbook and then take an exam. I have only had the book for several weeks and I think it makes Biostats more complicated. I did purchase the supplement that goes with it, which is good for practice and the CD allows you to take self-test. If you are not savvy in stats, purchasing the supplemental practice book may be the thing for you to do if your professor requires use of the textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good as a required text","review":"This was the required text for a 2003 graduate Biostatistics course, so you should already know the basics.

Great job Frank!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant - somewhat along the lines of Angela's Ashes","review":"In a style all his own, this author leads you down the garden path into the briar patch. The story is a barefaced look at a young life lived in the old days of a 1950's poor, dysfunctional, working-class Cape Cod family. I wept for him and laughed out loud with him.One scene in particular refuses to leave me, I laugh each time it crosses my mind. I can just see the short, rotund neighbor \\"lady\\" trotting down the dusty dirt road in pink pumps (he never said they were pink, but they MUST have been), poofs of dust clouds popping up at each footfall, a jowly grin on her face as she anticipates grossing out her busybody competitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as he puts it...A Dramedy","review":"This author's work will hold you captive from start to finish with his talent of combining humor with the fierce drama of reality. This book will have you laughing at times and crying at others as you feel what the main character is feeling through each and every chapter. My hope is for a sequel as I was wanting to know more about what roads lie ahead for this young man. It was refreshing to read such a powerful non-fiction piece in this world of fantasy. Well done author. Eagerly awaiting the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising","review":"I was looking for a funny read aloud book for 8th graders. This book is neither. It had f-bombs, sex, and was quite sad. It says you will laugh out loud...not once.The story is about a very poor boy in a small, resort town. His father is incapacitated and his mother is very abusive.Are you laughing yet?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book of Quick and Subtle Wit","review":"The work by this author grabs you and won't let go as he leads you through his own brand of humor. One minute you're laughing until tears begin to fall. Underneath the comedy is a life made bearable by a quick and ready wit. Some of the humor is subtle and at other times it's a whirlwind and you're caught in the middle. Worth reading more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Tell All Your Friends\\" kind of book.............","review":"This book is a true masterpiece. I usually fall asleep before I can turn the first page of any book I read. This book kept me up way past my bedtime! I couldn't put it down. I was laughing aloud then reduced to tears within minutes of either occurance. I have shared this book with numerous friends, all of whom loved it as much as I did. I will read this book again and again throughout my lifetime. The comforting wit, humor and wisdom this book affords its readers will be something you will, undoubtedly, want to share with the rest of the world. Thank you Mr. Bosworth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for 1 year","review":"We have owned this scale for about 1 year. Worked OK for that time. I have noticed the \\"repeats your last weight\\" thing that it does. Now it will not settle on a weight, and then gives the \\"bree\\" error code. Just try to find out what \\"bree\\" means! The Taylor web site is worthless. Stay away from this scale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheating scale","review":"I have a different scale (Tanita) at home but have been using this scale while I housesit. It LIES. It fakes \\"accuracy\\" by storing your recent weight(s) and rounding your measured weight to the closest stored weight.So it's totally useless to see if you're gaining/losing weight, unless it's a big change.Bad scale! No wonder my mom complains about her weight suddenly fluctuating. This thing tells her she's staying the same until the change is extreme enough for it to ignore the stored results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This scale won't zero. Stepping on then off gives an Err0 code. The readings, although repeatable, are by no means accurate. We've given up on it and are looking for another scale.UPDATE:After about a year, when we step on it it says bAtt, indicating a low battery. It gets used about twice a month, what's the point of a Lithium battery?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is This Scale Accurate?","review":"I get different readings that can vary by 5 pounds just by stepping on and off this scale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taylor Scale","review":"I really do like this new scale. I love the digital screen and I love how it gives tenths. It is easy to read and appears to be accurate. The only problem I found was that when I picked up an object while being on the scale, it did not recalculate. I had to step off and then back on with the object in hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great scale for the price","review":"I have this scale and like it. It is easy to read - even before I put my glasses on in the morning. It is consistent and looks good in my bathroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive pseudo-repeatability","review":"When I weigh myself twice in a row, it gives the same reading...to 0.1 lbs! That is not accuracy, however; it's clearly a case of the instrument remembering the last reading and repeating it if the next reading is close. For example, if I weigh myself, then someone else weighs themself, then I weigh myself a second time, the second weighing can be quite different from the first weighing. It's commonly shifts by about 1 pound. If I weigh myself twice in a row, without someone else weighing themselves, then it returns to the previous value *exactly*.It's one thing for a bathroom scale to be somewhat inaccurate. It's quite another when the company programs the chip to repeat the last reading in order to fake accuracy that doesn't exist!It's being returned to seller, and I won't touch another Taylor product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accuracy?","review":"I have a problem with this scales accuracy. It seems to save your weight from the last time you weighed yourself. Very frustrating to someone who has been losing weight and wants to see progress. Every morning we play the same game. Step on, see yesterdays weight. Step off. Repeat x number of times. Step on with weights to \\"clear\\" the weight from yesterday. Step on and off. Repeat. Decide which weight might be right.The only reason I am not giving it 1 star is because I have had worse scales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too good to be just for teens...","review":"If it weren't for the main character's age and the fact that there is no requisite sex scene, this could be any one of the better adult paranormal/fantasy novels on the market today. I think this one actually stands out because of the nature of Jennifer's 'beast'. The authors do an exquisite job of fleshing out the book's teen heroine. She is moody, angsty, and removed from her parents. She is desperate to be anything but the 'freak', she just wants to fit in. The plot from start to finish is entertaining. Now for my minor complaints...the story feels rushed. Maybe it's because it was originally intended to be a YA novel, but its too short to hold the story. This definately should have been fleshed out more. The book seems to end abruptly. I guess its probably a good thing because it certainly left this reviewer wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Entertainment","review":"I just picked up this book in the 4 for 3 bin at Amazon on a whim. Iam not going to write a synopsis of the story as it has been done bybetter and more literate that me.Allow me to say that this is a cute, well written novel that depictsa teenager as one with all the crying, cutting up ,screeching and bitchingthat goes along with raising a normal girl, not to mention a were-dragon.It's enough to make you pull your hair out and stamp your feet and scream.And just wait till I give it to my daughter to read. She will love it also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"My mom bought this for me for Christmas and I love this book! I can't wait to read the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Urgh!","review":"I found this at my local library, and I'm so glad I decided to test the series that way before buying it. I have never read a book with a more insulting protagonist! Honestly, Jennifer Scales has zero personality outside of being a whiny, spoiled brat. She spends the first part of the book (before her \\"transformation\\") yelling at all of her friends and saying downright-cruel things to her mother. It was a wonder that everyone hasn't abandoned her yet--how can she have friends?! I crossed my fingers that she would redeem herself by the end...but I just couldn't finish it. I got about 50 pages in before I no longer cared about anything I was reading. And by the look of other reviews, I'm not missing anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"His music still sounds fresh---even thought it is old.","review":"Chris is a very sensitive writer/artist who wants to please God, even down to his thought life.

This is an album that everyone should have. I can't stop listening to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleck! Invest in the metal spoons.","review":"I bought these a couple years ago, because I wanted a decent set of measuring spoons, and because the match my measuring cups. I hate them both! They have become horribly stained, and the measurement is placed on with a sticker that has rubbed off of most of the spoons. I have to guess which is which size, and while it's not that difficult, it's inconvenient. The ring that they are on is flimsy, and while it is easy to remove them, it's a pain. They often fall off, and I've stopped using it all together. I do NOT recommend these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful, but doesn't hold up.","review":"I bought these spoons having bought a black version of them years ago. Loved them. However, over time, they broke for various reasons (i.e., got trashed in the garbage disposal). I needed a new full set so I thought to get these. Sadly, I'm quite disappointed because the markings, that tell you the measurements, have slowly been rubbing off. So much that I can't read it on some of them and have resorted to giving them to my kids to add to their play kitchen stuff. I never put them in the dishwasher either. I always hand washed them. The spoons themselves are great but I'm surprised that whatever material is used to show the measurements is so cheap. I've since gotten metal ones where the markings are etched in. Can't say I'd recommend anyone buying them unless you use them infrequently."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Secret Envy of the Unsaved","review":"Rebecca Frederickson's Secret Envy of the Unsaved is more than a book of poetry. Poignant,touching, covering deeply sensitive subjects it provides a keen insight into the lives and personalities of residents of a small, close-knit northern community in BC. It's a book that begs to be read in one sitting but left handy for re -reading.In the slim volumes's short burst of poems, the author has drawn honest vignettes of outpost life, honing in on every day events and portraits of ordinary people. So skillfully has she woven the poems together that they paint a vivid picture in a few words. Many a noted author of long novels might take note. I loved this book and read into the night until I'd finished it. I'd advise anyone to buy it. It has general interest for all walks of life and is a thought provoking read for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"You know you have to get started, so get rid of the excuses!","review":"Feeling job stuck and investigating the need to go out on your own? It's time to just stop all the theorizing and get started... Over the years I have bought scores of entrepreneur/business books and most of them, more or less, teach what they claim. Additionally, I rarely ever write reviews. However it would have been very selfish of me if I didn't write one for this book - learning so much from revewers on amazon every day. This concise, inspiring book is yet another commendable effort from these authors. The book is a fantastic resource for any self-motivated budding businesss person who has ever been stuck, for any reason, in the bringing to life of their business idea, it contains very relevant and practical advice. Get this book and you should have no more excuses. I certainly now don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Time","review":"I read this book for a book club I belong too. WOW, what a waste of time! The characters are flat, the writing less than mediocre and nothing draws you into the story line. Ghandi is not in the book as the title would suggest, in fact you don't learn anything about Ghandi fact or fiction. The author wants me to feel things and you know this throughout reading the book, but unfortunately his writing doesn't make or allow you to feel it. Oh it was 1 of the worst books I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"good dvd but","review":"I bought this dvd because of the high rating it received in modern drummer magazine. I was really disappointed with the content. I am assuming that this was based on a clinic he may have been giving with some performances mixed in. The dvd really was not edited well and seems to jump around. For example I would be getting into a concept he was talking about then it jumps to him performing with a bass player which has no connection to the concept he was talking about. As an experienced drummer we all should have internal clocks to help us count, help with the groove and, to keep the music going he really is not covering anything new or unknown. There are some morsels of knowledge but I am actually shocked that this is highly rated for anyone other than a beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy DVD","review":"This is an hour and a half of Billy listening to himself talk.

I liked Danilo's Don Diego / Percy Blakeney-ish character, and Arilyn's background as an \\"honorable assassin\\" is original. The book has a good premise carried out in enjoyable writing and plotting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite amusing reading.","review":"This novel is sort of fantasy detective. If you don't love the detectives, you could read this book all the same, because there are many adventures and action in that novel and detective part, I'll hang over the main story. It's exalted book from exalted author, look for her other works - most of them much better (it doesn't mean this book is bad)."},{"rating":"1","title":"a painful read","review":"I'm a huge fan of forgotten realms books, but this is possibly one of the worst I have read. This book is extremely unrealistic (If that is possible for DnD) Arilyn, the main character, is possibly the lamest character in all of faerun. (Matching an elven weaponmaster in battle at about the age of 10???) Although it is nice to see someone besides the master R.A. Salvatore write a story with an elf as the main charater. Danilo on the other hand is a fairly well made character. But his true potential as a character is never seen as Cunningham keeps him as somewhat of a comedy relief.

I tried to install their software and was told immediately to upgrade my Winsock.dll. I did. Then I installed their product and lost connectivity to my internal network.Again I contacted tech support via email. To make an 8 hour story short, their tech support gave me TCP/IP settings that simply don't work or follow any book I have ever read. Then I learned after several hours that installing WinProxy will \\"toast\\" the TCP/IP stack on Windows95.

Lovely quality, perfect price, sturdy and well-made. I've been wanting a decent Santoku to tide me over until I can get a Damascus steel Shun Santoku, and this knife fits the bill perfectly. Well balanced and extremely sharp, hollow ground on both sides of the blade, tactile grip that does not slip in the hand. Perfect weight. Handles every job I've thrown at it like a champ, from mincing garlic to thinly slicing onions or tomatoes to preparing meats and poultry.Some advice: Clean this knife properly and dry it thoroughly as soon as you're done using it. Also, be sure to buy a good blade guard for it. I received the Victorinox 47302 Cutlery BladeSafe for 6-Inch to 8-Inch Knife Blades at the same time. Fits perfectly, snaps shut securely, holds blade firmly, does not come open unexpectedly, yet easy to open when it comes time to use the knife.

It skips many intermediate steps that even a mid-level developer would probably need. I looked at these comments prior to purchasing the book, but thought these people are probably really good programmers that already *know it all* and are being way too critical. I can say that wasn't the case at all, and they were right on. I believe this book was put together very poorly and Mark Robinson could have done a much better job in explaining these intermediate steps that can make all the difference in the world. (VERY LAZY INSTRUCTIONS) As many of you may know, when you miss just 1 step, it can make all the difference in the world.
