Illadelph Half life is all right, I didn't enjoy it as much as The Tipping point. Organix is tight as well, but the Tipping point is the joint! Phrenology was good, experimental in some areas and conventional in others. The Tipping point is aggressive, beautiful, tight, soft, hard, fast, slow and real all at the same time. It doesn't compare to their live album, but I did say best \\"studio\\" album. I love this album. This is the Roots at the top of their game. ?uestlove's drum beats are the illest on this album, and Black Thought's rhymes flow like water or butter. A must have for all Roots fans and all hip hop heads. This is one hip hop masterpiece instant classic"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Disappointed","review":"This album did not have the live instrumentation feel that I was looking for.

Even though the album only has 10 tracks with 2 hidden ones is still one of the roots best cd's out there. the cd comes jam packed with real hip hop beats and tight lyrics by the great Black Thought. there is no such thing as a skip button when you listen to the tipping point. From the first track of \\"Star\\" to the last one of \\"why\\" what's most prodominant of this album is that it gets you going makes you feel how real hip hop is. What i am saying is that if you are into real music you got to pick up this album, and i have noticed a lot of people are tired of the crappy music they are playing on the radio now a days so its good that the roots are finally getting much deserved love out there. With this album the roots will spark a beginning of showing everyone what real hip hop and real music is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Roots Best since DYWM???!?!?","review":"This CD is tight, compact, direct and HOT!

The intro \\"Pointro\\" was innovative and well done in the fashion that the Roots can only do.

Tracks like \\"Star\\", \\"Web\\" and \\"Boom\\" move the CD along just fine. \\"Don't say nothing\\" along with the second hidden track save this entry in the Roots catalog from getting only 3 stars. Buy it and try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Sure Yet!","review":"Tipping Point is a good album, as a matter of a fact it is a very good album. I am just having a hard time identifying it as a Roots album. Phrenology was the album ,where the fellas steeped out side of the box that made them so unique. They continue that trend on \\"Tipping Point\\". But there is something missing on this LP that Phrenology and their previous discs had. I am not quite sure what that is yet.

Phrenology made me wish my record store's return policy was more lenient.

You need to give this album a chance,, it is a necessity for anyone who was ever a fan of the group. Peace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"another amazing effort","review":"I will admit this album is not as groundbreaking as Things Fall Apart and Phrenology were but this album really lets the roots of The Roots shine. This brings me back to more of their Organix days. The beats are kept simple, yes, but this really lets Black Thought shine as one of the greatest MCs ever. I think Black Thougt is the most underrated MC ever. After all of their experimenting on their last two albums, this is a step back, or a tribute to true hip-hop. Either way, Black Thought really shines on this album. Now I can't compare Roots albums to other ones because each album is different and amazing in their own right. So to compare this to Phrenology is unfair. Look at it as a Roots album and the magic will come through. Please give this album more than one listen. It rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little bit of everything","review":"First of all I think this album along with the rest of The Roots albun just penetrates me. I mean how can anyone say bad things about this every single song has it's unique sound and I just catch myself almost breaking my neck bobbin my head to these jams. I think people really really need to stop comparing this to other people or other Roots albums. Just take it for what it is. They ain't going commercial. Sure they might be trying to reach out to more people but I just know The Roots ain't gonna change. I ain't about to analyze all there songs beacuse who am I to do so. Just buy this CD and if you like some funky jazzy groovy music!!That's one of the problems with us Americans now always comparing stuff always having expectations of whatever, always finding someone or something to put the blame on.

It requires work, dedication, money, and knowledge.The author argues that the future for student housing is bright.

The underlying story of the mage storms was interesting but the developement was weak. In each of the books Karal is used a a mage channel to prevent desaster. I could see it happening once, possibly even twice, but not all three times. Lackey even brought back Vanyel and Stephen for this book and basicly did nothing with them in the end.

The writer and the director of this film are totally clueless about the game of poker. The film is unwatchable. The poker sequences are laughably bad. I could not watch the whole thing, I just turned it off about half way through. For the poker, I give it zero stars on a scale of 1 to 5. As a movie above and beyond the technical aspects, about 2 or 3 stars because of muddled plot development and so-so characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie stunk!","review":"i really did not like it. it was a crapy version of the Cininatti kid meets the sting. they even used some vital lines from the Cininatti kid. and why did they had to kill off my Jamie Foxx?? i was not a happy viewer when i saw this one. very dissapointed. i didn't even look at it all the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Loving Memory","review":"If you ever feel abandoned, lost or confused, listen to Gladys Knight performing the swedish hymn How Great Thou Art.

Ho hum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted time reading this book","review":"The book itself is not a typical Stephen King horror book. It is more like a bad 80s slasher movie, which deals with a bunch of kids on some kind of a road race where losers are killed. I must admit that though I did not quite find it thrilling, once I had started reading it I wanted to know what it was really all about and how it would all end. Needless to say, I was angrily disappointed with the ending. There are much better Stephen King's novels out there, and this is certainly not one of the best. I do not find it to be even a good novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Long Walk\\" is an exhausting read","review":"Every year, 100 teenage boys are selected for the Long Walk. Everyone gets a canteen, processed food belts and 3 warnings. After 3, your simply shot. You must not walk under 4 mph, speed walk, or come to a complete stop. You must not harm or help the other walkers. An interesting premise, of course. But, how Stephen King, (Bachman) can write 370 pages of this psyche, it's very tiresome. It's very effective material, because as Ray Garraty, our protagonist, gets weaker and weaker throughout the walk, mentally and physically. YOU get weaker and weaker during the LONG read. I found myself staggering, tired, rushing to complete this book.And they walk on..and they walk on..and they walk on. A conversation...and they walk on. A 2 page flashback...and they walk on. New terrain...rain...and they walk on.This book is as excruciating to read, as this very review I'm sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your time","review":"I have read 1000s of books and have rarely been disappointed. This story was a major disappointment. I will admit that it was an original idea for the time it was written but to be so invested in the characters and to simply end the story the way it ended was stupid. DO NOT waste your time. Go for a real walk and enjoy life! Hey King, you owe me $6.95 and 2 wasted evenings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired legs","review":"Richard Bachman's OK, I guess, but he's no Stephen King. At least, not here. I was actually quite shocked at how shallow this book was -- King's tales are usually multi-layed wonders with unexpected twists and turns, but \\"The Long Walk\\" is so one-dimensional and underdeveloped that I had to keep glancing at the cover to make sure I hadn't picked up the wrong book by mistake. And don't even get me started on the ending, which is so graceless and sudden that it left me feeling like an amputee. Skip this one, kids...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised by the high ratings","review":"I've read nearly all of Stephen King's/Richard Bachman's books. As much as I usually love his stories, the endings usually fall flat. This book, however, was boring the whole time. It dragged on. Then it just stopped. There's not even an attempt at a proper ending. Perhaps that's the point. Either way, was disappointed. It only earned the two stars I gave it for a couple of interesting scenes in the later chapters. I thought the book was finally getting good, but it didn't last. Oh well...on to my next read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book but not creepy like most of King's books","review":"This is an excellent book of King and probably the best he's written as Richard Bachman. The flow of the book is perfect, the characters are extremely real and likeable but the scare factor isn't there. Yes, its shocking and weird but not scary like most horror books. If you want a good scare I'd recommend Blood Crazy by Simon Clark or Darker Than Night by Owl Goingback. You don't get much scarier than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"First book that I have read that I couldn't put down. The ending could have been a little better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Long Walk","review":"This was a great book, for me, anyway. It was a page turner (as some may call it) because the first day I got it I read it for five hours (three in the morning and two at night) and the next day I read it for another two hours and finally finished. It was so exciting even though the idea was kind of silly that these mindless, emotionless soldiers would blow 14-16 year old kids' brains out. There was quite a few gory scenes in it. My favorite part was that King got into the characters so well, you either hated them or liked them. But the main characters Ray, Pete, Art, Stebbins and so on (there were so many characters) were so real. I actually missed and felt bad for them when they died. Even some of the characters some people might hate, like Barkovitch and Olson and Parker, I still liked them, in a way. Anyway this is a good book and I recommend you read it and pass it on to a friend. Although i thought it was good, some people won't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Dark Future....","review":"I have to admit that I've been less than enthralled by King for the longest time. I'm either disappointed at an ending that is an anti-climax or just can't get past the half-way point without dozing due to boredom. This is a surprising exception. From the very beginning King held my interest by not allowing much information to be given about 'being ticketed'. It also helps that the Walkers, for the most part, are given a three-demensional existence so the readers can sympathize with them. This is real, flesh-and-blood, individual youth being manipulated in order to compete in a popular 'game' which, in turn, reflects on just how bloodthirsty this wretched society has become. I would say that this is one of King's best efforts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Not the most exciting boook but it really gets you in the mind of the characters.

I bought this book at least 6 times, I give books away that I like, then I want to read it again, so I buy it again. This was the first Bachman book I read. To me it's the coming of age book. What does it tell me? What did I get from it? It told me I like to read a good story, and I got enjoyment and a little fright, each time I read it I get something I didn't see before.

I read \\"The Long Walk\\" several years ago and was horrified, it is a story every SK fan should read! It was so scary, sickening & engrossing that even when I could have upchucked at the amazing minute details (SK is the master!) I would put the book down, shaken to the bone & grab it back up again!

The other well known Bachman story is \\"The Running Man\\" and \\"Thinner\\", which were released as a movie. I notice that these titles are all available separately for around $8.00 but they were once published as a set, and this set can be bought used for around $5.00. There is also a Kindle version of this.

From the opening 3 pages of the book to the very end. A grueling walk that if you even try to stop,the guards following in the white jeep will shoot the Long Walkersafter 3 warnings, until there is only one Long Walker left. This book is very descriptive about the walkers death. Stephen King has several ways to keep his audience into the book and entertained. The book also gives great descriptive information on how the Long Walkers become tired and exhausted. Another good descriptive passagesas how muscle spasms in the back of the legs in the back of the calfs. Stephen King uses the characters in the book to keep the Long Walking paceand keeping the audience informed about the characters by having them make conversations and began to tell about their lives. This book really gives great and intensifying action for any Stephen King fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one will NEVER be a Movie","review":"I've read all of King's published fiction, and this is one of his best - top 5 I'd say. A great premise that pulls you in slowly but surely until it's too late, you're hooked - trying to figure out what you'd do and why some characters lose it. With Gerald's Game, his only works that will never have a video version. period (Although I'd love to see Michelle Pfieffer play Jessie - or Michelle Williams for that matter, who cares she's not 39)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King is one of my favorite authors.","review":"I love to read any book by Stephen King, and this book was no exception.

It just suddenly stopped. I don't want to spoil the ending, but can somebody help me with this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Read","review":"A long walk is a great book!

He is my all time favorite author! I have read almost every one of his books. Normally I am very satisfied at the end, even when the dreaded villian shows he will return some day. However, The Long Walk is much like Cell in that you are waiting for the conclusion or ENDING and it just doesn't come. To say that both these books leave you wanting more is a HUGE understatement. It makes you angry you ever started reading it. I felt jipped. I have many other books I could have spent my time on rather than one that was such a disappointment.Don't give up on SK because of a few duds. He is a mastermind and has MANY really awesome books!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"King's The Long Walk","review":"Steven King is known for his suspense filled stories and edge of your seat tension. This story however failed to meet the expectations I have come to expect from King. This lacked the suspense of the dome and the creeps of Bag of Bones.

Some I love, like the dark tower series (especially wizard and glass) others not so much (Tommyknockers). But the Long Walk easily falls into one of my favorite stories, not just from him, but overall. The premise sounds boring but by the end of the journey you have gone through the whole range of human emotion and felt real tangible fear of the machine that controls us all. The story is completely relevant with the now ended war in Iraq, the continuing war in Afghanistan and the \\"War\\" on terror in general, and how we view the service of our children towards our nation. I seriously can't encourage people to view this one enough, I normally don't write reviews but had to put in my .02 when I saw this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great great great book","review":"I love this book!

But once you sit down and become involved with the story, and the characters in it, it turns out to be one of Stephen King's best books. Many would think that the whole concept of the book to be boring. But it's not. I was never bored during one point of The Long Walk. King writes at a steady pace, and the novel ends up being a quick and easy read. We read along, waiting to see who will get it next, and how it will happen. Sure, you know that it's going to happen to your favorite character, but you wish that it won't, so you keep reading along. A surprising hit from Stephen King, that was written unders his alias Richard Bachman.

I don't really know how to describe it but I had this feeling like it wasn't totally finished yet... I knew right from the start that Garraty was going to out-walk them all. Another thing is that once more than one fourth of them had died, the rest of them just started dying too quickly. Apart from those few pointers, this book was very nice to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible ending, not one of his best","review":"Was a bit of a disturbing book that isn't for everyone. He left alot of things unexplained, which was annoying. The ending sucked, in my opinion. Far from one of his best novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"transparent","review":"I'm writing this as a counter-point to other reviews of \\"The long walk\\". In many ways, this is typical King; if you like this author, you will probably like this book. In other ways, King has written a truly transparent metaphor for the human condition. The story about a long walk in which you die if you stop walking suggests trite comparisons to our collective journey through life. The ending of the book also conjures up a parallel with the inevitability of death; the winner of the Long Walk doesn't truly win, he dies like the rest of the contestants, much as all of us will ultimately die regardless of our walk through life. Overall, this is the \\"pulpy\\" King at his pulpy best, and the \\"philosophical\\" King at his philosophical worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"Despite this being a \\"Richard Bachman\\" novel, the book is a complete loss. You become easily lost from the beginning of the story and become entrapped into this vicious cycle of losing random characters back and forth. If you cannot keep up with the characters and what conversations that they have held with Ray Garraty, then you will be completely lost.I do not see how Stephen King came up with such a lame idea for a story! It's absolutely horrible and I would not recommend reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are these other readers?!","review":"This is was honestly one of the worst books I've ever read. I recently got on a Stephen King kick, and read (and enjoyed) The Stand (complete and uncut) followed by 11/22/63. I chose this one to read next since it seemed to have some pretty good reviews.BAD.IDEA. There is no better way to describe the plot than \\"a long walk.\\" It was as dull as watching paint dry.100 kids go on a walk. They walked 5 miles. One died. They walked 5 more miles. Another dies. That's essentially how it reads. Just repeat that for 400 pages.I don't know who in their right mind is recommending this garbage, but save your sanity. Avoid it at all costs. Read one of the two mentioned previously, or Insomnia or Dreamcatcher - books by King I've read and loved (although I was greatly disappointed in the ending for The Stand, I'd still recommend it).This book is an embarassment to Stephen King's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrifying experience","review":"99 guys walk towards death.One walks towards glory.But he doesn't know.A great book about loss of innocence, about the border between life and death, about friendship.

The characterizations of the main and supporting characters were mundane. The ordeal they were going through never hit it with regards in making the reader feel the pain and exhaustion one should feel in a story like this.

Once I realized the kids were all going to get shot dead (one by one, in the road, like dogs), the book kind of lost all appeal for me. I just couldn't get past the premise, knowing they were pretty much all going to die. The whole thing seemed ludicrous, that mothers would let their kids basically commit suicide or play some kind of slim-chances Russian Roulette. This book is really disturbing, even for SK (Bachman).

Then you realize within the first few pages that you've made a lot of mistakes in your life and if you were honest with yourself, you would never listen to your own advice.The problem with this book, other than the fact that it was written by Steven King, is that the plot is so implausible that you laugh at the absurdity. I was waiting to see what mental asylum these teens broke out of to join a competition in which there is a 99 percent chance you die. Perhaps this was Steven Kings way of saying \\"I can put my name on anything and it will sell because my name is Steven F-ing King.\\" He then proves how gullible the public is by writing a book about walking.

It's obvious that the first-person narrator is going to survive, so there is really no suspense. The reader simply plods along with the walkers, waiting for the next one to die.

The Long Walk was one of the WORST books I have ever read. It did not even make sense. Maybe there is some kind of deep symbolism at play that just went over my head? 100 boys go for a walk & get shot if they walk too slowly.

Stephen King is such an extraordinary writer. He's not called the King for nothing.Those awards are well-deserved. The reader is with the narrator Garrity throughout that book,walking alongside him, feeling the terror, the pain, the despair and thegrim determination that keeps him putting one foot in front of the other.This is a true horror story but the monsters are just regular people. Areally quite unbelievable premise when you look on the face of it, (sortof akin to Shirley Jackson's The Lottery) but it is his attention to detailthat makes The Long Walk a great book, instead of just a good one. King'scharacterization, description, his sensory details are pure genius. Heinhabits the character's skin and never falters. A gripping page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good short read","review":"Fascinating story and this story itself is going to make me buy the rest of King's/Bachman's stories to read.My only complaint?

Even though its a Bachman book and some dont consider this a true SK book, it does not fail to grab you a great book. Not at all scary just a thriller. I recomend anybody who liked The Running Man. Same concept also if you liked this book I recomend The Hunger Games. Even though its a young adult book its still a good series. Also if you liked the Hunger Games this is the book for you. Still not for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book","review":"A book like this should be on every kindle! I couldn't take my eyes off the pages.

This story is phenomenal. I had never heard of it, and stumbled upon it when looking for \\"just about anything\\" to download. I asked my King-expert friend if he had read it, and he hadn't. I am very glad that I did. The beginning of the book doesn't make much sense, King hints at things, and writes as if we already know what is happening. But he withholds the truth from us long enough to formulate a guess or two. I had my own \\"is (x) what's going on here?\\" thoughts, and then when (x) happened, I wished I had been wrong. There is something simply dark, and truly mesmerizing about this novel. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Walk of Life","review":"This story depicts the long walk of life where friends fall by the wayside as we walk along.

The book pits yin against yang: reason against passion; social responsibility against individual needs; abstract against concrete; past against future. Hesse's hero lives an inspiring life and dies a fitting death. Poems and three short stories add to the beauty and wisdom of the work. This book will change your life and as Joseph Knecht awakens, so will you."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best work","review":"Although Hesse is not in fashion among academics these days, this book (unlike some of his earlier more romantic stuff) deserves to be noticed as a great work of the 20th century. It's very complex, and can be frustrating (especially if you have little or no knowledge of German history, literature and music); it's nevertheless an important, and often very moving reflection on the nature of modern society (and isn't yet outdated), and equally on some of the dangers of trying to escape that society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magisterial","review":"A magisterial work of art (excuse the pun)! A synthesis of profound philosophy, captivating storytelling and that distinctive smattering of sublime moments particular to the greatest of novels. In masterful fashion, Hesse achieves a seemingly impossible balancing trick of, on the one hand, invoking the game as a metaphor for the sum of human experience and knowledge yet, on the other hand, never allowing the reader to directly encounter it's practice. Would that it were so that one were fortunate enough to have the time to re-read this book many times over."},{"rating":"1","title":"I FEEL CHEATED!!!","review":"SPOILER WARNING!!!

It seems like a really good book, but the length keeps me from being able to finish it before I HAVE to read another book for school or just get to busy. By the time I come back to it I need to start over and that's a little frustrating. I think if you can find the time and get through a little rocky translation and to read it all without getting pulled too far away from it, it will be a very good read. Be prepared to be in for the long haul though, as with all Hesse books you do not want to rush through it and miss things. keep the faith, dEx"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Hesse's book","review":"First time I read it when I was 15, and I thought it was one of the best books I've ever read. One has to be prepared to read this book and to be able to accept all: strange combination of math, music, language, different ideas, search for harmony. I reread this book every 2-3 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Pictures and Stories","review":"In my humble opinion The Glass Bead Game is the greatest novel of the 20th Century. A fine piece of art which will simply weave its way into the readers subconscious as subtly as the sublime nature of its content will inspire a feeling of peace during and after the reading Hesse's opus. I found the first 100 pages truly fascinating but can understand how one could stumble through the opening and take leave of the book to return at a later date. Indeed many of my friends, from all accounts, have this book sitting on their shelf unread seeming to both call to them and daunt them as well. Oh my panthiestic friends, fear not childern for it is you who truly have the keys and a full tank of gas for your journey to self fulfillment. As for me, I ate the last page of my book after the first read. I plan on reading this book a few more time throughout my life the last of which should roll me gently into my convalescent bliss. Please do enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literature with Constructive Meaning","review":"It's a synthesis. Imagine the sum of human perspectives and knowledge reduced into symbols and played like a symphony to permute meanings and explore conclusions. That's the glass bead game, which approaches a spiritual experience if played correctly. Frankly, it's a wonderful dream.Despite the flaws of old literature and translations, I found this book riveting. The first fifty pages of background is not absorbing, and the style makes it hard it get into. The wonderfulness is because rather than the soul-crushing themes hedonism and nihilism present in so much modern 'literature,' this book is a celebration of living life and the best of man. The conceptualization of the Glass Bead Game itself overshadowed the flaws in plot structure and the overwhelming use of telling over showing into unimportant considerations.A classic work that's stood the test of time, much more than the sum of it's parts. Recommended read for intellectuals."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's all thought","review":"Alright, I just finished reading this mammoth novel a few moments ago, except for the short stories at the end. The AP english class at my school had to read it last year and this year there were extra copies so I grabbed one thinking alright this might be fun. Well, I'll admit, I struggled with it. And I'm a pretty avid reader but I had to put it down and read other things in between. In the end though, it's remarkable. When Mann said this was a \\"treasure of purest thought\\" he hit the mark. The next to last chapter \\"The Circular Letter\\" changed my whole way of looking at this book. Yes, it's dry. And Yes, parts of it may seem boring and too drawn out. But for the reader that toils through it, it's an amazing novel and very deeply thought out. There are times I wanted to burn this book, but now I'm honestly very glad I read it. It's beautiful and more relevant to today's day and age than one might think. In that sense I suppose it's timeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paris Shopping","review":"I didn't use this book at all.

Some think very highly of SOME of his interpretations (e.g., the Vienna or Toronto no. 7, and the Vienna or Leipzig no. 3), but others consider them to be too adventurous and deviant when compared with Mahler's score.This recording, however, provides one of Scherchen's best Mahler interpretations caught on a disc: the studio 1959 Vienna take of symphony no. 2. It is as adventurous as one could expect from Scherchen, but this works well with the \\"sense of drama\\" that this symphony requires in order to be really successful.Recording quality is acceptable as an early stereo take, but strings are quite weak (too few).This interpretation exist in many incarnations, most of them hard to find since they are deleted from the catalogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could rate it a \\"0.\\"","review":"I despised this printer. Set-up was easy, but it was a pain to keep the paper compartment completely dust free. If any dust settles on the paper at all, it results in white specks on the final print and you have to re-do it. Print time was about the same as a inkjet. It was also pretty noisy, but that wasn't a big issue for me. The real deal-breaker was that the colors were not at all realistic. They were completely oversaturated and inaccurate.

Lon Chaney Jr. is fun to watch so young.All these guys keep pouring out this tunnel and ride their horses down the SAME trail, that's how you know the chase is on. We've got a guy with a dial-o-disaster on his chest plate and a rocket launcher that can't possibly be accurate. But all is in fun.

Ray \\"Crash\\" Corrigan is an engaging action hero, even when he has to utter lines such as \\"Go ahead and ram!\\" It's also nice to see Lon Chaney Jr. as a slimy villain in one of his early films. \\"Undersea Kingdom\\" may seem a bit hokey by today's standards, but it's the kind of nostalgic escapism that's impossible to resist."},{"rating":"1","title":"VCI VERSION - CDR COPY","review":"This is a warning to anyone considering the VCI version of this title.

I do give it 4 stars rather than 5, because of the cheating in a couple of chapters. Especially one of the great chapter endings ever, Chapter 8, only to discover the cheating at the beginning of Chapter 9. Also a little more than usual carelessness...Corrigan is bare headed at the beginning of one sequence and is suddenly wearing the cumbersome helmet...A chariot and team of horses unexplainably is waiting right by where they need it... But hey, don't you expect a bit of that in serials?It's the spectacle, developing plot, good acting that make this an important serial for your collection. Lots of familiar names in this one including Lon Chaney Jr., William Farnum, Monte Blue (as the villain), Smiley Burnette as the comic relief, Lee Van Atta as the feisty kid.This definitely should be in your basic serial collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrills galore in this one!!","review":"As serials go, I'd say this is one no serial fan should be without.

Greenberg does an excellent job of suiting the tenor of the verse to the dramatic occasion, ranging from low comical to sublime lyric. Whereas the majority of previous English translations tend (mistakenly) strive for a uniformly \\"elevated\\" tone, Greenberg's translation gets the nuances right. A central idea running throughout Goethe's works is that in any comprehensive formulation of life, extremes must be united. The range of poetic styles in Faust--from high to low, comic to tragic, beautiful to sublime, \\"volk\\" slang to epic vaunt--also follows this general rule, and again Greenberg's sensativity to this range is wonderful. While the other translations are not bad, if you really want to experience the fantastic emotional-intellectual rollercoaster ride of Faust, this translation does it best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book description","review":"Enduring legend of the old philosopher who sells his soul to the devil in exchange for knowledge and power.Translated in a performing version by Robert David MacDonaldCover painting by Peter FarmerThe story of the philosopher-scientist who, in order to pierce the only mysteries unknown to him, sells his soul to the devil for a period of total knowledge and absolute power, is one of the most potent myths of our civilisation.Goethe's gigantic epic poem, the greatest dramatic work in German literature, has not attained the same degree of acceptance outside of Germany that such a masterpiece deserves.Now, at last, in a brilliant new translation, specifically made for, and already successfully produced in the theatre, the narrative sweep, shorn of metaphysical digressions and diversions is made accessible to both the reader and the playgoer..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Artist, Bad choice","review":"What a horrible choice of songs passing for a so-called\\"Greatest Hits\\" package...Since when has Laura Branigan been famous for singing Show Me Heaven, Dim All The Lights and The Power of Love...?

Oh wait there they are, stuck at the end, like an afterthought...Ok, ok, so I'm exaggerating, the important hits are all here, and they sound great, but what makes people decide that a Laura Branigan Fan (which I am) is going to be interested in an album padded out with [poor] filler.

The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because Laura has an EXCEPTIONALLY good voice. But my praise for this cd ends there. I can't think of one song Laura sang that I like. All of them are boring and don't interest me at all. Laura Branigan is proof that not everything from the 80s is worth revisiting.

Also I like the voice of Jennifer Rush when she sings the same number but Laura Branigan has her flasy style and grace. The Lucky one is a very originally sung song esp. when Laura sings ...The lucky one and the music rolls by. Self Control is all time hits and my fav. Laura Branigan's Gloria is another of my very fav song and I luv the way she sings Calling gloria....I guess thats the best part of her vocals that the music vibrates loud behind her bold n loud clear voice!

Plus there's \\"The Power Of Love\\" and \\"How Am I Supposed To Live\\", done years before Celine Dion and Michael Bolton sang them. The lesser known tracks here are all wonderful also.

May be the new songs could have been added as Bonus tacks at the end of the CD, but they were scattered in the middle of the other hits songs.If you want to have a \\"Greatest hits\\" compilation, I recommend \\"Laura Branigan Platinum Collection\\" or \\"Very Best of Laura Branigan\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"great compilation of an artist at her best !","review":"Laura is often overlooked when thinking of great vocalist. With this compilation of material the listener will experience the Branigan voice. Show Me Heaven would have made a powerful single but was not promoted as such. Dim all the Lights is a great tribute to Donna Summer but Laura still makes the song her own. Self Control and Ti Amo are a great flashback to the 80's , as is Gloria and The Lucky One. The only possible error I see in this CD is the missing songs that were needed..

The text is often confusing and raises more questions than it actually answers. This confusion is compounded by the artwork. The illustrations are appealing to the eye and well suited for children, but they do not work particularly well with this topic. The pictures that accompany the text are often confusing and do not interact well with the written word. (Not to mention the fact that all people represented in the art are white.)

Until they improve the way the plates are shipped, I would recommend that you do not purchase any."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic of modern time travel","review":"An involving story that cuts no intellectual corners, but is still quite easy to read. Ultimately, I believe this story deals with man's understanding of history as a mechanism; as a river of people rolling through the backdrop of the universe, with a structure and rules that man can attempt to understand and influence (perhaps vainly). The characters are understandable and easy to identify with, and they spend most of their time doing what people spend most of their time doing: flirting with the idea of love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind Blower","review":"This book goes far, far beyond the typical UFO books which dwell on lights in the sky or someone's autobiography. Even if only a small fraction of the reported UFO crashes are true this is still worth the read. Not to be read once, but perhaps several times then to be used as a reference in any future research, the book has \\"meat\\" and substance.One of the many high points of this book is a copy of the citation award given to Harry B. Cooper, father of Tim Cooper by Gen. Curtis E. Lemay. The award cites Harry Cooper for his exemplary knowledge in support of the Air Force UFO program. This citation and a lot more make this book a non stop thriller and a must read for anyone seriously interested in the UFO phenomena; you won't be sorry you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and Switch","review":"Avoid this one!

For their style they have always been ahead of the game. Yes Transmissions isn't their best, but it's far further advanced than what many groups are putting together in '99/'00.The music is what the song title implies. They do a very good job of that.Laughing gas coulnd't make more sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best, but better than most","review":"Tracing Juno Reactor's evolution is very interesting. Beyond the Infinite was a pure trance dream. Bible of Dreams upped the ante, expanding their horizons while staying true to their trance heart. It started with Transmissions and it started off very well. While sometimes still raw, the sound of Juno Reactor on this album is definitely good. It's sometimes this rawness of sound itself that makes the tracks so good, while at times genius that is later seen can be glimpsed on certain tracks. Check out Beyond the Infinite and then come to Transmissions."},{"rating":"1","title":"unimaginative, boring, and irritating","review":"Quite some time ago, my old one-star review for TRANSMISSIONS was surrounded by nothing but five-star reviews, wearing a crown of \\"0 of 33\\" helpful votes before being strangely lost into oblivion. Hence, the rewrite. When I bought this in 1999 I began with a very strong desire to like it, and I expected I probably WOULD like it since old Underworld fans such as myself used to frequently receive Fluke and Juno Reactor recommendations. But the unimaginative electronica on TRANSMISSIONS was so inanely boring my listening partner and I finished it feeling most irritated. Oh, and it's not the genre I loathe - I've heard some great stuff (especially from acts I never knew the name of!) but this CD sounds unforgivingly dated, sparse and fumbled, like a science experiment developed by mechanical nerds gone awry."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is hard-pulse acid/trance techno at its best!","review":"If you're into acid or trance, you're going to LOVE this album. From the opening title track, the beat is hard and fast, with only two \\"breather\\" tracks in there (\\"Contact\\" and \\"Landing\\") that slow down to a more sedate pace. The album loves to fool you, too -- many of the tracks start slow, making you think they're going to be more ambient, then suddenly break into a fast (120+ beat per minute) trance/acid beat. For me, the best tracks have to be \\"Luna-Tic\\" and \\"Laughing Gas\\", but the whole album is great. If you've never heard Juno Reactor before, this is a GREAT way to be introduced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing, because it wasn't my first.","review":"Given, this is a old cd before JR had fully blossomed, and it shows.

The video spends as much as 5 minutes on important places like Notre Dame or the Effiel Tower, and in the end you have a good overview of what is worth seeing, and why, and some of the history that helps make the city what it is. I never knew that the Bastille was overthrown, Marie Antoinette & the King guillotined, in part because of the enormous debt the French governemnt ran up helping the American colonies fight the War of Independence against England.At first the tone of the narrators makes you think they are talking to middle school kids, but it comes off fine and you could watch this video a couple of times and not get bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone can be a camera operator!","review":"One word for the \\"professionals\\" who shot this footage...Tripod!Yep, its pretty much home movie quality here, but if you want the info and don't mind the shakes...go ahead, make their day and buy one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Focus","review":"I purchased this video and another from this collection as a gift for my father and was sorely dissapointed.

They are suitable for all ages, too - no profanity or anything similar is to be found here. But despite the \\"kiddy friendly\\" image, they are great for older fans like myself too - all of them are catchy and singable, and have that \\"coolness\\" that few songs have these days without squeezing a dozen swear words into each verse.For animé fans, young children (or their parents), this is the perfect CD for every occasion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah Pokemon ROCKS","review":"I wanna be the very best, the best that ever was. du du du.

I prefer the main character to be heroic is some aspect. While it's great that Emma is smart,capable and has amazing resources, its disconcerting to have the supporting role be so superior and more functional. I get the social commentary that government employees are sub-standard intellectually and morally, but feel strongly that the main character should be heroic, or at least not weak and indecisive. Joe does more harm to incidental characters and never protects anyone he puts in danger. What's that about? We should admire him for feeling guilty?

It wasn't long before I realized this was going to be an expensive proposition. You must buy a minimum of 50 sleeves (10 pods per sleeve) at a time. 50 sleeves is $22.50 plus shipping. Then there's maintenance - descaling kits, etc. Well now, that's not bad for good coffee. When the machine gives out after thirteen months and you're told there is a $120 flate rate repair fee - that's bad. Actually, not bad, a ripoff. It's also stupid.

What kept me reading was the way the book was written rather than the plot itself. Simple sentences had so much meaning and depth, it really made me think. As the novel moves on and some plot finally begins to develop I became intrigued in the characters. Throughout the book I was not able to take sides with one character over another. Yet, I kept reading because I wanted to learn more about each one of their attributes and the reasons of why they did certain things.

The journeys of the soul were mesmerizing. The guidance for drumming was most useful. The songs presented were short, easy to remember, and inspiring.

It's neither about shamanism nor drumming. The (very little) material about shamanism is just a few quotes from other, better, sources. There is practically nothing about drumming. But if you want to get a New Agey opinion about the colors of your chakras, this is the book for you. Altogether, this book is nothing but a thin collection of shallow New Age platitudes.If you want some good books on hand drumming for non-professionals, I suggest the many fine books by Dworsky and Sansby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what i expected","review":"well its a good book but in comparison to the other books, its really quite a boring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Dark, Too Slow, too Cruel","review":"This book starts off as a fairly interesting story but becomes mundane about midway through and absolutely darkly cruel toward the end.

This book turned out extremely slow and boring. Even reading the book made me feel lethargic. It draggged along, with maybe one cool thing per. chapter if you were lucky. It was definetely the worst Molly Moon book so far, not really worth reading. But, if you really want to see how bad it is (I know I would), then you should get it.

Not quite sure how hypnosis can cause time travel, but either way, it's up to Molly to save the day!I highly recommend this book. It is intelligent and doesn't talk down to kids.

The ending is not only illogical, but impossible, as far as I can tell. Not to mention the other thing that happens, which I can't tell you without spoiling the book.The rest of the book is fairly exciting and scary. Toby Jugg (\\"ahaha\\") is confined to a wheelchair. He is staying in a remote mansion in Wales (DW seems to be very anti-Welsh, by the way) and gets imprisoned. Then he gets visited by demons, falls in love, etc etc.Not Dennis Wheatley's best book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad","review":"Having read many tales of the supernatural (my favorite being Dorothy Macardle's The Uninvited), I looked forward to reading this. But after a promising start, I was disappointed to find this book to be pretty dull and I skimmed most of the last 200 of 300 pages. It's a journal written by a crippled RAF airmen and his rambling discourses are sometimes very boring. The story could have been trimmed by 100 or more pages at least.

Fortunately it didn't just fly off the router or it could have cause me to ruin my workpiece or worse. But now the guide is useless, after less than one use. I'm hesitant to try any of the other sizes now for fear of the same thing happening. It's just not worth it.Another reviewer suggested using the Bosch adapter for PC template guides.

I got the audio version from the library and only made it through about chapter 6. The biggest problem was the narrator. Her voice was awful. It is very rare that I turn off a tape due to the narrator's voice, but I just couldn't take it. The characters were not the least bit likable. I haven't read or listened to any other of Rosenberg's books, but based on this one, I don't think I will. Also, nothing personal, but I will avoid books narrated by Sandra Burr."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Believe This Was a Bestseller","review":"NT Rosenberg clearly knows the law. Like Linda Fairstein, at times she provides procedural info that serves little purpose other than to show she knows her stuff. Unlike Fairstein, this author falls down in her plotting, which is terribly simple and obvious. Much of the dialogue had me laughing, it was so artificial. At the very least, I held out hope for a decent climax but it just suddenly ended. There are way too many strong authors of legal thrillers to bother with Rosenberg's books. Even in the 'mindless' beach fiction category, there are much better options."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Average","review":"I read through Chapter 7, at which point I simply gave up. How a supposedly brilliant woman could surround herself with such despicable characters spoiled the underlying \\"mystery\\".

I found the book slow and boring. Ms. Rosenburg writes like this was a sequal, but yet it isn't. I've been corrected it is a sequal, sorry. Things are mentioned liked we, as the read, are suppose to know already about them. The characters in the book are ho hum. They are very one sided or flat. Many different story lines start the book and then are dropped when the \\"real story\\" starts. Then they are picked back up later and treated as not important. I will say this Ms. Rosenburg does know about the law, but knowing about the law and writing an interesting book about it are two totally different things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I eagerly awaited the latest Nancy Taylor Rosenberg novel and was very disappointed by the characters. Lily was annoying and her daughter, Shana, bordered on the unstable. I found every character to be unpleasant and obnoxious. That said, some of the story line had interesting turns.

She has a deadbeat ex-husband, a troubled daughter, and a stormy past, including some dark secrets that she is desperate to keep hidden. This novel falls short on a number of counts. The dialogue is stilted, the characters are undeveloped and the plot is contrived and unrealistic. Lily's character never comes alive. Her love interest is Richard Fowler, a gorgeous and wealthy lawyer who holds a torch for Lily. Neither Lily's and Richard's relationship nor the various legal plot lines in \\"Buried Evidence\\" held my intrerest. This is a thriller that never comes to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read.","review":"This is a must-read for anyone considering home ownership.

There is a lot that goes into the process that most people don't even consider. This author attempts to make that as painless as possible and gives you detailed information.

The song is marvellous; we sing it regularly and of course on thoses \\"adoption day\\" celebrations."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wanted To Like This Book","review":"Books about adoption are very important to me. My wife and I have adopted two girls from China so we want to read them stories that show adoption as something beautiful. Happy Adoption Day has great color, lots of smiles, and even comes with a song that you can play on the piano or some other instrument. Unfortunately I didn't like some of McCutcheon's lyrics. I don't like how he repeatedly says, For out of a world so tattered and torn, You came to our house on that wonderful morn...\\". The entire world is messed up, and I don't like this \\"we saved you\\" mentality. Elsewhere John writes, \\"Some parents come different, some come the same...\\". If you come from a conservative mindset, I can see how you might want to explain this in a different manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upbeat but somewhat awkward and disturbing word choices","review":"After reading this book my husband and I were a little disheartened by some of the content. We are hesitant to be able to enjoy this book with our little one from China because of the words, \\"For out of a world so tattered and torn, You came to our house on that wonderful morn...\\" We don't want to make her feel like she came out of the ghetto to come to us and want her to feel good about her birth country. Anyway, there's no getting away from these words--they appear on 4 pages of this little book and of course the song also includes them. It sounds a little arrogant to us, sort of like, Good riddance to China... We were disappointed in the book for this reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conflicting info in Product Review Section","review":"Why does the reading level under \\"Product Details\\" say ages 4-8, when reviews by School Library Journal and others say that this a book for toddlers and kindergarteners?

Families are Forever was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"As an adoptee...","review":"While I understand the intent of the book is genuine, it does not acknowledge the LOSS that the adoptee must feel and grieve throughout their life.Celebrating the day an adoptee came to their new family is great for the family; but it is also the day they will NEVER be able to return to their biological family. It is the day they officially have no recourse; no possibility to go back.As an adult adoptee, I can sympathize with the reasoning behind it; it does echo \\"acceptance.\\" but, what many adopted parents also need to acknowledge is that the loss many adoptees feel - can never be forgotten or even mended by acceptance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for adoption through a public agency","review":"I was a little disappointed this book only addressed going to another location for adoption. We adopted through our local DSS so it doesn't really pertain to us. We have an Adoption Day, but not like one described in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice book","review":"I think this is a nice book that defintitely has a very positive message that children will find reassuring. A child joining a family should be celebrated whether through birth or adoption! There are a couple of spots where the wording is slightly awkward...but writing in verse, and still getting your desired message across, is quite difficult. The overall feeling of this book is warm and fuzzy, while the illustrations are bright and cheerful.

There are just too many slow and quiet songs on 'Star Bright' and they begin to sound the same. I think she needed a better producer and arranger for 'Star Bright' as her voice is as beatuiful as ever. There is one track I truly love, and it's her gospel version of \\"Mary Had A Baby/Go Tell It On The Mountain\\" but it's also found on David Fosters 'The Christas Album' which I enjoy much more than this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sacred and Soulful!","review":"I own many Christmas CD's and this is definitely my favorite. Vanessa injects her soulful spirit into each and every song, without taking away from the tradition and sacredness of the music. So much holiday music is the same, yet this R&B treatment of some of the classics is unique, upbeat, and inspiring. She also includes 3 new compositions from songwriter Rob Mathes.Through all my years of growing up, I don't ever remember paying attention to the words of \\"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\\" or \\"Angels We Have Heard on High\\" the way I do when my children and I are jamming along with Vanessa. It is obvious that her intention was to make an impact...and she does.On the lighter side, her duet with Bobby Caldwell on \\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\" is smooth, sweet, and jazzy.If you like to be uplifted by music, this CD is a must-have for Christmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vanessa Williams Beautiful Christmas.","review":"This happens to be the kind of an album you want to get cozy in well candle-lit bedroom on Christmas Eve. Vanessa's first Christmas Album(Which is also known as The 20th Century Christmas Collection) has the best Christmas music worth listening to. The Best time to listen is late at night. Her voice is very sexy and seductive and my personal favorite tracks on this album are 1,4,8,9, & 12. Track 9 & 11 were previously recorded on other albums. Track 9 was Recorded for \\"A Special Olympics Christmas 2\\"; and Track 11 was used in David Foster's Christmas Album. \\"Star Bright\\" remains one the best Christmas Albums that will eventually stand through the test of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Choice for the Christmas Collection","review":"I have put this in the CD player every December for 3 or 4 years now and it continues to be in heavy rotation.The sub gets a workout on several of the tunes.Some of the songs do run together, but then something jazzy or soulful comes along to get you back into the music.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fit on '92 Accord!","review":"Bought this set of knobs to replace 1 original knob that I broke (took them off to wipe the dash, dropped one into the passenger foot area, forgot about it and my bf stepped on it.

They do fit well though and pretty flush with the panel. At first they seemed like they were perhaps too tight, based on how the original knobs came on&off;, but they did indeed fit, just needed a little extra push.I ended up replacing both the broken knob and the other original one so as not to be mismatched.

Not a jolt of recognition (wow, he's really found something wonderful there!) but of puzzlement (what is he doing?) Tempos seem either slow or fast; aspirated (ha-ha-ha) passages by soloists and choir are ugly (and given the latter's skill, I think unneeded).

The problem I had is that he never bothers to dig very far into the psychology of the father, never offers us more than a hazy, opaque figure at the center of the story. The father's thoughts, feeling and motivations remain unexplored, as if the author were reluctant to poke around too much into the man's private world. He thus remains more an archetype than a fully rounded human being. I'm afraid I have to agree with the Boston Globe, which said of the book: \\"It's an awkward story, awkwardly told. Not only do the multiple viewpoints pose a problem, but so does Murray's palpable unease with the subject, and a cliche-soaked style that frequently plummets into bathos and self-dramatizing.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!

It brings back all of the amazing memories of Christmases as a kid. It's upbeat, fun and a little 'lyrically challenged' and still perfect, for me anyway.

I am Imagestyler user and was impressed by its functionality and ease of use. Imagestyler 1.0 is a great product especially for web designers who would like pixel-point accuracy and flexible layouting tool.But it has some limitations though which I expected to have been addressed into Livemotion. Instead Adobe put animation features into Livemotion to rival that of Flash.When I evaluated Livemotion, these are what I found out: 1. Livemotion could not rival Flash in terms of animation and it will probably take 2 or more releases before it can be at par with Flash. 2. Livemotion is no better than Imagestyler instead its even slower.So what Adobe did is they dropped the Imagestyler which is a good product on its own and now they try to compete with Flash with Livemotion but its is no contest. So Adobe, please give us Imagestyler 2.0."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oklahoma... It's okay.","review":"The first Broadway musical to truly capture itself on record, you need to own this recording for the history and the performances alone--Alfred Drake, Joan Roberts, and Celeste Holm (among others) are more than worth it. That said, the recording itself is less than ideal--it was cobbled together from at least two recordings of the songs, and sounds like it. Plus, due to the recording standards of the day, there are a number of significant cuts and some oddities--Alfred Drake singing \\"Lonely Room,\\" which he never sang onstage, for example. Nonetheless, it's great to have the score preserved by its great original cast, and for all its problems, it should be in everyone's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"original broadway cast and great.","review":"brings back warm memories. no following version can exceed or equal this great album. i happily suggest that you buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original Cast Album of Oklahoma!","review":"The item arrived in a very timely way and was just as good as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably not the one you're looking for","review":"I thought I was buying the film soundtrack and it turns out it's just a subset of the tracks.This is the one you're probably looking for:Oklahoma!

It is an intriguing story of her personal ordeal over five long years, caught up in the sometimes faceless and inhumane global political conflicts of a dramatic time in world history, early in the Cold War era, and at the height of America's anti-communist McCarthy terrorism. Erica Wallach's vivid memories of her long ordeal provide a compelling portrayal of a critical period in the formation of America's current international political position, and of a very intimate battle for survival and personal integrity. This is a book worthy of study by serious historians of the period as well as for the interest of its intended audience, namely the concerned and interested American citizen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Overview","review":"While it could have been better, this collection gives a balanced look at Jimmy's career.

Yes, the novelties are here as well as a few of the jump tunes, but it's the ballads that will enhance your appreciation of Little Jimmy Dickens.

What is a book going to tell me about my individual children,\\" but as I read it, I found DOZENS of correlations between my two very different identical twin sons and the general findings in her research, which weren't very general at all, they were very detailed and right on. Reading this book has given me the much needed tools to sit back and ask - Are my kids misbehaving or are they acting their age? Based on that assessment, I can communicate disipline much more effectively, and I have been. Having the tools to understand our kids has decreased their frustrations with us as parents and increased our patience levels with them as toddlers.This was an easy read and very informative.

The information is substantial but easy to understand. The pictures are great as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painful but fascinating","review":"Maugham shows himself to be a misogynist, and perhaps even a misanthropist given the lack of likeable characters (including the narrator) in this cerebral novel. Nevertheless, it holds one's interest from start to finish, like good gossip. The diverse stages of the painter's life, and the people he disrupts along the way, illustrate the power of obsession, for good and ill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely worth reading","review":"Maugham wrote quite an interesting story with manifold aspects about art, finding your way in life, passion and devotion. Even though the book contains some interesting and difficult questions and opinions about life & art the book is easy to read because of the fluidity of Maugham's writing style. It doesn't take you long to get into it and to be fascinated by the main characters of the book, mainly by Charles Strickland, whose indifference to the world is really extreme and unique. You feel your own life being questioned by Strickland's attitude, which makes the book even more interesting because you want to find out if he succeeds with his way of living."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd suggest cakes and ale","review":"This is very far from Maugham's best (to me, his short stories and novellas). The character, Strickland, genius painter perhaps based on Gauguin, is just not believable. Real great artists (such as Gauguin) may be odd in their personal lives, but they do spend time with other artists, they do discuss art; they don't seem to be the ignorant brutes this fellow is. The book feeds off a popular idea of the artist as outsider, and certainly there have been many who were. Yet even Van Gogh, exemplary nutter genius, talked to other painters, including Gauguin. Strickland's art comes out of a personal vacuum, which seems unrealistic.So unlikely is the main character that before the book ended I lost interest and stopped reading. For a better book by Maugham on the unexpected personal life of great artists, read Cakes and Ale instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"an overblown main character","review":"The plot of the story is quite interesting, there are many nice descriptions about houses and some of the people. But since I gave only two stars, there must be some criticism: the description of the various characters is extreamly different, Strickland seems to be of an unreal cruelty, much too strong expression of only one part of his character while the rest is left untold. Instead the characters of some other characters (e.g. the women ) aren't reported sufficently, only superficially. And then, another thing I was missing, is Maugham's lack of knowledge of real culture, or at least the lack of the influence from the Tahitian customs and live style (which is quite different from the English) on Strickland's life. The novel concentrates too much on Strickland's problems and thoughts till it's almost unbearable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow your way!","review":"The main character is Charles Strickland, a successful stockbroker. He gives up everything to follow his own vocation. He's obsessed by the passion to create beauty. Even though you don't know much about his daily life you get involved in the spirit of art and the way artists live and think. The last part of the book when Strickland's life in Thahiti is narrated by people who got in touch with him there. There you learn most about his character and you understand his feelings better.Somerset Maugham was inspired by the life of Paul Gauguin when he wrote this book. But it's not a boring biography which contains each detail of Paul Gauguin's life, a lot of the events in the book didn't happen in his real life at all. I really enjoyed reading this book and Ican recommend to read it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"not Maugham's best, but still very good","review":"The book revisits a theme that Maugham took up severaltimes - that of an artist completely devoted to his art.Interestingly, there is no attempt to look for the causesof the destructive behavior of the main character, or evento pass judgment on it. Strickland's life and actionsare examined, sometimes in great detail. However, after the author'sinitial disapprobation, he comes to some sort of acceptance ofStrickland strange way of life.W. Somerset Maugham is best when he writes aboutrelationships. While this book seems a bit forced at times,Maugham had such a unique view of the topic that always makeshis writing interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite an interesting story","review":"The characters in this book are well chosen and with the death of Strickland Maugham shows the unimportance of man's existence. The thing Strickland did was more important than himself as a person. Yet sometimes Strickland gets a bit unrealistic, because he seems to be so selfish and really doesn't care about anything else but his inner urge to paint. The story describes the life of the great painter Gauguin although he is not mentioned by name but there are a lot of similarities between the two. Exotic places are also an important part in the novel, which makes it interesting and easy to read to read. On the whole it's a well written story."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy bit of second-tier literature to devour...","review":"The Moon and Sixpence is a short, intelligent, well-written, sophisticated, episodic piece of second-class literature written by a first-class (though not genius-level) writer.It is not featured on the MLA's list of the hundred best novels of the 20th century, and I can see why--withal its superiority to inferior works that ARE on the list.Maugham has a very pleasing (though not dumbed-down) style, which makes for swift and pleasurable reading. This book is not as good as The Razor's Edge or Of Human Bondage, but it is not something one would be ashamed to have on the resume either. It's a book that can be read in a day, and which probably won't change your life...but it should enhance you nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Quality","review":"Fair delivery but poor quality. I choose the 'used-very good' but got a 'used-unacceptable'. I can tell that this book must be very very old version. The cover is different from the one I saw online and it's a half-naked female. The back cover and other pages are almost leaving the spine. I love the article and appreciate the opportunity to buy a used book. But the lie about the quality is not acceptable. The only reason I would not to return it is the cost. Other buyer's should be aware of the 'real' quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Counterpoint","review":"OK, so the author's storytelling talent is great, he told a counterintuitive story and Paul Gauguin's works continue to inspire a broad swath of humanity a century later .... The novel is not that interesting. The artist is an ass. He cares for nothing. Even his commitment to art, beauty and truth is nothing more than an obsession. The obsession is not well described. The third party commentator approach becomes boring. The characterization of four potentially inspiring locations is weak, almost bleached out. There may have been a time when the artist's courage to provide a countervailing perspective, running against the inertia of the culture, was a heroic act, worthy of praise. Today it seems pedestrian, self-serving, even formulaic. I appreciate many of Maugham's other works, but this one fell flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful classic","review":"Maugham gives a subtle, believable portrait of a man driven by his need for artistic creation, a person very unlike ordinary human beings. There is nothing like reading a famous old writer -- the language, the diction, the story development! It was a pleasure to read. Plus, in this case I presume, I learned something about Paul Gauguin."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit tedious","review":"Of course well written (W.Somerst Maugham).A bit tedious and stilted.

What I like best about it - entomologies of the words. So many dictionaries leave off the origins of words, which is so very important when writing history and historical fiction.It's painstakingly edited and without flaws from start to finish.

My earliest memories are of the Druggist scooping it into a a small round tin and labelling it. With Ichthammol being more difficult to find at local Drug Stores, I'm glad to get this \\"industrial size\\". It seems to last forever and is a medicine cabinet staple.A glob on a band-aid strategically placed on bug bites, boils or splinters, softens the boo-boo and brings the splinter, stinger or pus to the surface usually within 24 hours. Just be aware the oily, tarry salve WILL STAIN clothes, bedding etc. and NEEDS to be covered.Through the years we've used this on both humans and animals, it works well. My Dad, a carpenter, seemed to always have a deep splinter, us kids with boils, pets with ailments kept my parents doctoring us. You didn't go to the REAL doctor until their treatments failed...I lived to tell about it and treat my kid too !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Made for Horses, Great on People","review":"We used this as a alternative remedy for a deep splinter under the skin, cyst forming due to a clogged skin pore, and a retained tick head.

Often when we have a windy day, maybe twice a month on average, the wind BLOWS OUT the pilot light. There is no pilot adjustment screw on the pilot. We have spent hours trying to figure out how to increase the pilot flame size to no avail.We have read all the documentation that came with the unit and all the Bosch documentation online. For some reason Bosch documention is very careful to not discuss this issue. They keep refering to: \\"call your local service representative\\"! We do not want to pay for a service call for something as simple as adjusting the flame size of the pilot!Often the pilot will blow out at night leaving us with out hot water for our morning showers!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Functions very well, except for the pilot light not staying lit all the time","review":"We've been using this water heater for 6 years, and overall it performs very well. Putting this outside made room inside in the old water heater closet, where we then installed a stackable washer/dryer. It was a huge improvement to our house.It provides plenty of hot water for our small 2 bedroom house, acting as the only water heater we have. The only complaint I have is that the pilot light does occasionally go out. We live on the coast near San Francisco, and I think the fog takes its toll on the thermocouple. Every 6 months or so I have to relight the pilot, and sometimes it just won't stay lit unless I take out the thermocouple and clean it with some emery paper. I'm finally replacing the thermocouple this week. It's a $10 part and if you are someone mechanically inclined a simple job to do.Overall I've been pretty pleased with it and would buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute cover picture, but not a little kids book","review":"My 3 and 4 year old just tuned this out.

I wish I had bought it used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very admirable book","review":"To be completly honest, I would rate this book thirteen, but that's not an option. This work of art has many unique features. Though the story is short and the synopsis sounds child-like, the layers of meaning are clearly meant for more comprehensive readers. The vocabulary displayed also betrays the mature audience the book was written for. The end struck me as particularly profound. It is the sort of literature that leaves you numb in your chair after finishing. Thinking about it for hours without tire has led me to the conclusion that this book that appears to be for a mere child is truly magnificent, and meant for all. I would recommend that children, if you read it, pick it up again when you have grown older. You will uncover more treasures with each pasing year.

It's one of the earliest books written in the USA, and was written by a woman. Set in Fall River, Massachussetts in the 18th century, it tells the tale of a young girl who is seduced, impregnated, and then abandoned and defamed by an scoundrel of a minister. What was truely striking (apart from the quality of the writing), was how little things had changed in the intervening period. As I was reading the galleys, a very similar case was being tried in the same area. Well worth reading, not only for its style, but also for its content, and for its depiction of life in New England in that time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Resource","review":"A contemporary work to \\"Warplanes Of The Third Reich.\\" This book lacks the sheer number of photographs in \\"Warplanes...\\", but is an invaluable resource nonetheless.

Buy it and experience!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blissful even after 20 years","review":"I bought this album on vinyl when it came out at the ripe old age of 14 because my guitar teacher told me to. I listened to it the whole way through and hated it. Where is the guitar, I thought? The title track was a cacophony I didn't understand and the rest sounded like Muzak.So I shelved it and bought a few other, older Metheny albums and finally got back to it three years later. My ears had matured in that time and was surprised to discover what a fantastic album it was, now one of my favorite albums of all time. I love buying an album that you still love with all your heart even though you have heard it a thousand times. To me that means it appeals to the mind as well as the ear. Buy this album and force yourself to listen to it over and over and you will know what I mean. The vinyl edition is more satisfying than the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Offramp 2010 Vinyl Review","review":"If you're looking at this item, then you likely already know the music. You're just wondering if it is worth buying this new 180 gram version, right?ECM Records always made high quality pressings back in the day. This new version is no exception. I do not have a copy of the original version to compare with, but I think you will be happy with this copy. As stated, it is on 180g vinyl, very clean, no noise. The packaging appears to be the same as the original; i.e. no new liner notes, bonus tracks, etc. Perhaps the sleeve is made from heavier stock(?).So have no hesitations about buying this version. I'm very happy with mine. I think this is probably Pat Methney Group's best recording. The music floats on a cloud of reverb, but that is part of its appeal.My advice? Go for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OH SO BORING!!!!","review":"I find this album, cd or whatever you want to call it pretty boring. I mean Metheny is obviously a master, but if your expecting anything comparable to bright size life you'll be disappointed. Imagine Kenny G with a guitar synth and some cool wind noises behind it.

Me encanto \\"The Dream of Return\\". Años más tarde encontré el Album Offramp, donde \\"¿Are you going with me?\\" Es toda una joya, porque su encanto esta en lo sencillo de un bajo que conduce el tema, porque menos siempre es más, porque el talento no puede describirse, solo se puede sentir.El otro track: Au lait, es de una sensibilidad enorme, todo un bálsamo para el alma.

That's why I loved this book. Although it is not a child rearing book, it left me with new insights into the whys of my teenagers. It's very readable and yet you will still learn the difference between the hippocampus and the frontal lobe. Finally, it will leave you wanting to stimulate that growing brain that lives in your house, and maybe, push for some changes at your local high school."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish it","review":"This book was so relentlessly repetitive in stating the subject of discussion that I had to skip to the final chapter to search for conclusions.

The characters are so broadly drawn, it read more like an outline for a book or a manuscript , not a finished piece of work. It touches on so many themes and characters, the diva, the no-so struggling new stay at home dad, the playground mummys who hate, the work frenemies, and follows up on none of them. Not very funny and not very believable, especially the faded diva Mary Ford..and the PR guru Jack characters. This is one is a pass. The best thing about it is the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the point?","review":"This book was one sorry read. I regret having spent time on it.

Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"This book was really disappointing. It had such a great premise -- a stay-at-home mom is forced to return to her previous profession as a celebrity publicist when her husband loses his job, and she has to deal with the challenges of work re-entry, becoming the sole breadwinner, and babysitting a grumpy has-been.But the story soon peters out. None of the various storylines ever is fully fleshed out. The relationship with her husband -- who is doing a better job of being a stay-at-home mom than she ever did -- suffers little in the way of stress. The guilt she feels as a working mom is glossed over. And the testy has-been actress never gets the dressing-down she so richly deserves.All in all, this was a well-written, though lukewarm, book. I never felt empathy for Julia, instead I wanted to give her a swift kick for being such a doormat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't really care at all....","review":"I was hoping for an entertaining read.

This book started out nicely enough, caught my interest. But as I kept reading , I began to notice that the characters who promised to be round became very flat. The plot is so contrived that a twelve year old could have written the last three chapters. The husband, who is fired from his job in the first chapter, embraces being a stay at home dad to the point of creating gourmet meals, helping his wife's friends with organization, and creating vegetable costumes for the whole family. Puh-leeze! Cloying comes to mind. Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun and entertaining!","review":"Hey, this isn't a work of literature but it is a fun, original story.

In addition, for those who are thinking they would like a good orchestral base for their collections, Joy To The World by the Philadelphia Orchestra is a good companion. Yes, there is some overlap, but the CDs are reasonably priced, and it seems every time the Boston Pops disc is reissued, there is added material, so you really can't go wrong with this version. Good arrangements well recorded. A GREAT way to start your holiday music celebration.

Excellent background music for the dinner hour or opening the presents on Christmas morning. If your folks had this one on vinyl or cassette it will take you right back home for the holidays.

The first part \\"Against The Modern World\\" is excellent. Some of the songs \\"Long Live Death\\", \\"Summer's End\\", \\"A Ship Is Burning\\" and the \\"Raven Chorus\\" are classics. Interstingly they have that kind of post Joy Division-esque/post Death In June type sound and reveal a kind of bridge from Wakeford's DIJ days to the more folky/neo-classical sound of later Sol Invictus. Very cool, dark stuff.The second part is a live recording which quite frankly is of questionable quality. Yeah, some of the performances are good but the recording just isn't that great in my opinion. If the whole release were like this I would not give it many stars, however te first part is so good and so worth it, that I have to give it 4 stars. The first part is a must have and if the whole cd were like the first half I would have given it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent collection","review":"An excellent collection of almost all the Eurovision winners since 1956. From cheesy euro-pop (Ding a dong) to the anthemic \\"Insieme,\\" a wide range of styles is in evidence. Omitted here is the hauntingly beautiful \\"Si la vie est cadeau\\" -Luxembourg's 1983 winner. Perhaps the standouts are \\"Waterloo,\\" \\"Ne partez pas sans moi\\" and \\"Un jour, un enfant.\\" It was a nice touch to include \\"Congratulations,\\" which was vastly superior to \\"La la la.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Super!","review":"Of course,I'm not sure this is the \\"american sound\\" but it's a wonderful diorama of the european music of the late 50 years.

It is a board book with a great story on each page to read to your child. He/she can then open the flap on each page to reveal a picture of him or her doing what the story on the page is about as a baby (at the hospital, sleeping, bathtime, favorite toy, first walk, etc.) Not too long, not too short. I can't wait till my son is old enough for me to read to him his own story with pictures of him on each page.

This is a must have"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs for an all right movie","review":"Whether or not you have seen (or liked) \\"Queen of the Damned,\\" you can't deny that the soundtrack has been a success. With the songs co-composed by Jonathan Davis from KORN, and some of the most celebrated voices in metal today, including Wayne Static from Static-X, singing them, this soundtrack is heavy and dark, complimenting the movie perfectly. And other songs that weren't performed by the fictional band \\"The Vampire Lestat,\\" like \\"Change\\" from the acclaimed band Deftones, this is one of those albums that can be listened all the way through without hitting the skip button."},{"rating":"2","title":"What would movies be without great music","review":"All I have to say is wow... ...I was always a fan of Korn, Orgy, etc... but when you combine Jonathan Davis ...and all the major rock bands of right now, you definitely get a great mix. The music sent shivers through my spine at the theatre. When Lestat comes on stage- WOW. Just to hear Jonathan Davis... It's a truly great experience. ...Because it's great. I'd say it's the best compiled soundtrack I own, and perhaps the best ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Soundtrack, but Jonathan's vocals would be better...","review":"This CD is amazing! The five Lestat songs are the best songs I've ever heard period, if they were sung by Jonathan Davis as they were in the movie. Don't get me wrong, the songs are still good, but just not as good as the versions in the film, maybe one day a CD with Davis' vocals to these songs will be released.9.5/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the songs but....","review":"I love the songs on this cd. All these great bands all packed on one cd!!! But I much preffer the song Forsaken when Johnathan Davis sings it. Disturbed did a great job but it's not the same. They should have put both versions of the song on the cd. Do you know how hard it is to find the other version?? Try it for yourself! I'm still looking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great?...yep","review":"This cd is really great. The movie is ok too. I think that some of the people that gave this album a one-star should wake-up. I mean damn it's not the greatest ever but it sure as hell isn't the worst either. I love the atmosphere that is produced on this album. This is one of the best soundtracks that I own. \\"Slept So Long\\", by Jay Gordon of Orgy is one of the best songs on the album. Other standout tracks are \\"Down With the Sickness\\", \\"Penetrate\\", and \\"Before I'm Dead\\". The only track that I have a problem with is the Tricky song, \\"Excess\\", it doesn't really go that well with the other tracks, I skip that song most of the time. If you're looking for a dark, gothic influenced cd with a range of different artists this is great. If you don't like \\"dark and depressing\\" then stay away, it's that simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I went to 8 different stores in NYC to find this soundtrack and they were all sold out! Finally I got my hands on it and I wasn't dissapointed. This soundtrack is a must have for any rock fan.

I will be listening to this cd for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs worked better in the movie","review":"I enjoyed the movie \\"Queen Of The Damned\\" and thought the songs worked better in the movie. Listening to this CD on it's own didn't do it for me. Actually it gave me a headache. Kinda grungy and poorly produced. Reminds me of those garage band indie CD's they sell to mall goths at Hot Topic. I have to agree Lucan Wolf the Disco rock vampire dude probably would have been more entertaining on this soundtrack. At least it would have been funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"It kicks @$$","review":"I think it is the best kind of soundtrack to go with a movie like the \\"Queen of the Damned\\". And another reason I loved it was because the fact the Jonathan Davis of KoRn was the composer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful and boring!","review":"I think this \\"soundtrack\\" (if it can be called that) isjust AWFUL and boring! The songs are pretentious crap consisting mainly of Cookie Monster style vocals which are the worst I've ever heard. What is a fake shock rocker like Marylin Manson doingon this CD anyway? This is 100% corporate manufactured garbagefor angry teeny boppers stupid enough to buy it.I suggest you get a true Vampire-singer style CD and tryLucan Wolf instead. At least he can sing and would have beena better choice than ANY of the lame \\"artists\\" or bands on thisdisc. Avoid this hyped, out of date trendy garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lestat was NEVER this bad!","review":"Lestat was NEVER this bad! To be fair some of the music is good and atmospheric but the moment the \\"singing\\" starts (and I do use that word loosely) it's awful. Does everyone think vampire music has to be pissed off and mopey and screaming?It's bad enough a hack writer like Anne Rice rips off singers like The Vampire Lucan Wolf (who's been doing vampire music for years) but must we be subjected to manufactured crap like this?Only bitter angry self serving listeners will really enjoy this muck. Lestat was fun and devilish not mopey all the time and depressing. Really, enough of this angry crap already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad soundtrack for a bad movie based on a bad writer's work.","review":"So, you've decided to do a movie about a vampire who starts a goth band. Who do you get to provide the music? I imagine the board meeting went something like this:Chairman: We need someone to do the music for this movie about a goth band. Any suggestions?Executive 1: Peter Murphy? Nik Fiend?Executive 2: What about William Faith?Chairman's 12 year old retarded son: YO HOWZ 'BOUT KORN, THEY'RE DOPE.Chairman: You're a genius, my boy!In short, the entire thing is nu-metal, which is another word for CRAP. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"RE: Bogeyman","review":"This soundtrack stinks. Grunge is dead and so is the Anne Rice Lestat fad.Concerning \\"Bogeyman's\\" comment about The Vampire Lucan Wolf, Lucan Wolf has been performing since the mid 70's.He refused to sign a major record deal as a teen singer (YES doing vampire themed songs)BEFORE Anne Rice's first novel became popular. Just because many have not heard about Lucan Wolf untillately doesn't give some metal head the right to bad mouth him.Metal and the kind of so called \\"rock\\" music on this soundtrack I have heard makes people stupid.

It's a silly, childish goth-fest which sells, but doesn't produce. The tracks attempt to be dark and bloodlusty but fall just short of the intended effect and achieve only supreme depravity, except, perhaps, the Jay Gordon track. That one, too, was disappointingly weak, regardless of how catchy it might have been.Wayne Static had to put his two cent in with two equally dreadful tracks. His singing really is painfully bad, and \\"Cold, we're so cold...\\" always brings to mind an image of him sitting in front of a fire on top of a glacier, roasting a mastodon that he stole from his crippled grandmother.Oh, yes, and anything associated with Aliyah absolutely should follow suit with her and crash into the earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD sucks!","review":"I hated this CD!

The soundtrack is definetly one of the best I have EVER heard. The music makes a great deal of sense for the somewhat twisted story line of QOTD.Though I was dissapointed that John Davis's record label wouldn't allow him to sing on the CD I still think that the songs are great.Not Meant For Me, is absoulutley my favorite song, and coming in second is Slept So Long by Jay Gordon from Orgy, I'm a big Orgy fan, and when I first heard this song I got a big smile on my face when I heard Jay's distinct voice. My third fav song is either Body Crumbles or System, I'm not sure which, also I was lucky enough to download John Davis singing System so I get the best of two worlds, who cares what the record labels think? But I would definetly recommend this CD to anyone who likes the music portrayed on it. It's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Hot It Should Have A Warning!","review":"This Soundtrack is HOT!! It's packed with Sexy riffs and erotic beats to keep you grinding and thrashing for hours! If you like Disturbed, \\"Down With The Sickness\\" then you will love this cd.

It's a great cd, worth every penny!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is Jonathan Davis' voice?","review":"Jonathan Davis did a fantastic job on this cd!But where as Jonathan's voice was on the movie it wasn't on the soundtrack!I thought Davis did a much better job on the songs though."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Die For!!!","review":"This is the best CD I've purchased in awhile. It's amazing. This CD totally captures what it's like to be the lone, predator that is the vampire. My favorite song is \\"Forsaken\\". Usually I'm not a fan of explicit lyrics, but I think the lyrics are needed to understand the whole mood of the movie. BUY THIS CD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"INDUSTRIAL-GOTH SOUNDTRACK SUPREME!","review":"You may not like this movie, and you may not even like these bands.

I was kinda disappointed when I found out Jonathan Davis wasn't going to be the one singing his songs on the soundtrack...but the guest singers(Including Chester from Linkin Park and Jay Gordon from Orgy)are at their best on these tracks. The album also includes some stuff from the Deftones and Static-X. The highlights from this album are all 5 of the songs written by Jonathan Davis, as well as the rest of the album, the only low points are Tricky's track...not horrible...but...it don't really fit the rest of the album...otherwise I highly recomend this album to any metal/industrial/goth fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listening to it for two years, still not sick of it.","review":"One of the top five best CDs I own.

The theme song for the movie \\"The Queen Of The Damned\\" entitled \\"Forsaken\\" does the story justice, with David Draiman from Disturbed exercising his lungs to their full capabilities and also capturing the sense that Lestat attempts to convey in the books - that vampires should not be ashamed of what they are, to dress like everyone else and kill among them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sucky Movie - Best Soundtrack","review":"OK... no offense to those that loved it, but seriously - the movie kinda sucked. However the SOUNDTRACK - that, my friends, is a different story.Within days of release, this soundtrack quickly became one of my favourites for dark industrial metal. I personally have always loved a good movie soundtrack because of the variety of music presented.This one is up there in the ranks.The seriously gothic, heavy, dark, metal sound provided by Jonathan Davis' songs and the guest singers is something that hits your soul. That, combined with the perfect \\"real\\" songs, makes this soundtrack a definite buy.My only complaint is the Papa Roach song.... just doesn't seem to fit, but perhaps that is just me.I am a firm believer of paying for good music when it deserves it, and this is a CD that graces my collection to this day and will remain one of my favourites throughout time.Even crappy movies can produce fantastic soundtracks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If only Epic Records let Jon Davis sing....","review":"the cd would get 5 stars....but since Epic Records is full of greedy bastards who wouldnt let Davis sing on another label, it gets a 4. But of course, your getting this CD for the Head and Munky geeetar playing, and Davis writing 5 of the songs...All five of the songs he wrote are bad ass. System being the best song of em all. Look for the Davis version on your favorite file sharing program.I was kinda disappointed in the last 3 songs, since, in my opinion, they sucked.Its a pretty good CD, but, you can just as easily get the 5 davis songs somewhere else...if you wanna go that direction...Take this how u want, but its just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music for any Vampire","review":"The Queen Of The Damned soundtrack has alot of great artists on the CD,like Static-X,Disturbed,Linkin Park,Orgy,Marilyn Manson and Deftons.Five of the songs are writen by Jonathan Davis and Richard Gibbs,which I think are the best songs on the album.For me,the best song on the soundtrack is track number two called Forsaken by David Draiman of Disturbed and if you listen to the song closly,it's the ultimate vampire tune.So turn of the lights,light some candles(anykind),lie back and listen and enjoy the coolest soundtrack of 2002."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best album I have heard in a very long time!","review":"I am not usually a huge fan of heavy metal, but after seeing this movie, I had to get the soundtrack, and now I find myself listening to it endlessly in my car.

Trust me, you will regret it if you don't get this soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Soundtrack","review":"This is by far the best soundtrack I have heard in a long time if not the best I have ever heard.

The only good new song is David Draiman's \\"Forsaken\\". All the other good songs ([stinks] as Deftones' \\"Change (In the House of Flies\\" and Papa Roach's \\"Dead Cell\\") are already released, and another song that would've been good is Static-X's \\"Cold\\", but they redid it and now that [stinks], too. Wayne Static's song is OK, but that's the only other one. The problem is that they're all slow. Not melodic, SLOW. And I usaully like slow songs, too.Oh, yeah:Linkin Park is my all time FAVORITE band. I like every single song they have, even their demos and the DJ songs. But Chester Bennington's \\"System\\" song completly [stinks].

What a difference. I'm not saying there's no place for a Die Hard or Kung Fu Hustle or a movie like that.

The lack of extraneous entertainment and perfect presentation of the main story forces viewers to appreciate the building drama. I wonder if the constant visual distractions of some films aren't because the director knows he can't do what Bresson does.

No mere romance, Fanny Burney's Evelina gives us a surprisingly modern heroine--modern both in her proto-feminist awareness of the world and in her \\"mixed\\" character. Evelina is not a paragon, and Burney's writings are neither mere pleasant fantasies of romance, nor cumbersome stories of impossible virtue. Like Richardson, Fanny Burnery was creating something very new in the 18th century: a psychological novel. Unlike Richardson (whose best-loved novel, Clarissa, has been described--by fans of his, mind you!--as \\"That long, still book.\\") Fanny Burney's books withstand the time travel down to our day. Evelina is--thus far, at least!--my favorite of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evelina's Sister","review":"As a long time lover of Jane Austen, with a sister named Evelyn, I had to read this book.

The language is much the same as Jane Austen, though the plot and characters are slightly more lively. The details about London life at the time are fascinating. The introduction says the J.A. was a fan of Frances Burney, which is apparent. I highly recommend this book to J.A. fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evelina","review":"This is a Kindle book and consequently was cheap enough to read just for the curiosity of finding out how exactly Jane Austen was influenced by Fanny Burney. It really does have many of the plot lines Jane Austen has used, but with a very different style of writing. Fanny Burney puts her heroines in much more difficult positions than J. Austen ever did, and their predicaments have a very strong bent toward coercion by the people in the plot. Fanny has a tendency to put more people from different social stratas in the plot line and then puts them in conflict with each other. The book is well worth reading if you enjoy Jane Austen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Review of the Kindle Edition","review":"There are already some great reviews on this text, so I'll just focus on the Kindle version.

The Time Traveller,the host of the dinner, boggles the guests as he shows them the model of a time machine, and later the real one. The rest of the book revolves around the Time Traveller's account of his adventure when he actually travels into the year 803,701.

Sounds terribly depressing but at the same time it is a very liberating thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review","review":"In this book, the fact that the future that the The Time Traveler goes to is mostly like the world he actually lives in is fascinating. The Elois are very childish and ignorant, so the Morlocks are able to walk all over, and take advantage of them. Some places in the world today are like this. One specific group is inferior to another, simply because their kindness is mistaken for weakness. The future in the book is also different from the future that is reality, because there is some cannibalism in the story, and the Morlocks being big, hairy creatures who live under ground. The similarities and differences in this book are what make thhis book unique. It gives the reader many different interpritations, and ways they can look at the story. H.G.

This is definately not a character story. The Time Traveller doesn't even have a name, much less a personality. Never did I once care what happened to the guy. The plot, which Wells seemed to attempt to make interesting is rather bland. There were no motives other than scientific curiosity. Very unrealistic. The Time Traveller assumes that because the Morlocks are strange and ugly by his standards, that they're evil. He didn't even give them a chance. Looking at everyone as part of a stereotyped group, no one, not even the Time Traveller himself nor Weena, was an individual.What's worse is that this book had true *potential.* But potential left untapped is better off nonexistant.

A funny note - my edition was published in 1968, the cover showing the traveller materializing against a background of Eloi and Morlocks. The Eloi, as they should be, are represented as slight people covered with flowers, and the front & back covers as well as the intro page emphasize how this book predicted the coming of the \\"flower children\\" and how HGW foresaw the peace movement of the 60s.

Wells writes efficiently, never unnecessarily verbose, yet he still paints a fully developed story. While his classic style may be off-putting for those on the short end of the attention span range, I find Wells' style to be elegant and intriguing.

I'm glad he was there to get the ball rolling for science fiction, but I forced myself to read all his books on the hopes and say-so that these were classics. I'd rather have read Verne, Bester, Miller and Huxley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This book was one of the worst books I have ever read. The author make an attempt to sound as though he has an extremly high vocab. in the beginng of the book by using words that most average people don't know, but then stops as the book goes on almost like he ran out. The story itself wasn't bad but the way it was told was. From the start you know the ending, but then at the end the author make an attempt to change it in a way he did, but in away that it would not have mattered if he did or did not. I would like to finish by saying if you like sci-fi stuff you might like this book, but if you don't you'll probaly hate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"too good for 1895!!!","review":"the time traveller(or so it will be convenient to speak of him).

Wells was very interesting. He uses his creativity to imagine what it would be like in the future. The way Wells used his choice of words to tell about what was happening was \\"to the point.\\" He described each event with such detail, it seemed as if you could picture everything that was happeneing as you read. I thought it was an exciting book to read, it got me wondering about what would happen in the next chapter. I would suggest this book to anyone who likes to think about the future (maybe your opinion was close to this futuristic opinion), anyone who likes things about Sci-fi, or just wants something fictional to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Crystal Ball","review":"Was H.G.

G. Wells defining science fiction classic. A meek culture of future humans called the Eloi live in seeming paradise, comforted and dulled by the machines that continually provide for them - yet who runs these machines, and why are the Eloi afraid of the night? Superbly narrated by Scott Brick, H. G. Well's The Time Machine is a compelling listen and a very highly recommended addition to personal and community library audiobook collections. 4 CDS, 3 hours, 58 minutes. Also highly recommended are three other new unabridged CD audiobook titles from Trantor Media: Zane Grey's Riders Of The Purple Sage"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"\\"The Time Machine,\\" by H. G. Wells is a brilliant and entertaining novel about a scientist who invents a time machine and travels hundreds of thousands of years into the future. There he finds the Eloi, a group of people who live in peace and harmony. The Time Traveller is curious about the people who do not grow old or work, yet have everything they need. He wants to learn more about the Eloi, but someone has stolen his time machine.While searching for his time machine, the Time Traveller discovers a group of hideous underground creatures called the Morlocks. He learns the Morlocks have been providing everything for the Eloi who has lost all ambition and curiosity. The Eloi's passivity have made it possible for the Morlocks to take the adult Eloi underground and make them their slaves.I highly recommend this book of adventure and science fiction. H. G. Wells is a genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great tale--but this version is incomplete!","review":"I advise a high school sci-fi club, and I was thrilled when they asked to read H. G. Wells' The Time Machine. Excited to get them started with the book, I ordered a dozen copies (on a 4-for-3 promo since I was using personal funds to purchase the books) and distributed them as soon as I received the shipment. Imagine how upset I was to learn that these books do not contain the full text of the book; they stop in the middle of part V. I cannot return them for a refund, as I gave out all copies to students and they began annotating their copies as soon as they began to read.Wells' novel is wonderful! This edition is terrible..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Time Machine","review":"I did not like The Time Machine. I thought that it was sort of boring and I could barely keep reading it. The actual machine itself was ok but I did not like the diologue that H.G. Wells put into the book.When it got to the part where he first goes to the future I almost went to sleep right away. I was very bored and I almost picked up another book.Anyways the book is about a man that goes to the future and meets up with these small people that eat fruit all day. Then he meets the mongrels that eat the small people. Which I think is sort of stupid.In the book H.G. Wells doesn't, I think, portray the time traveler as he should be portrayed. I think it would also be nice if could have given everybody names instead of calling them their profession.Over all I give this book a 2 out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wry Epoch, Or Mood Piece? Still A Classic.","review":"A psychologist builds and uses a time machine to travel 800,000-30 million years into the future. It is made of Ivory, Crystal, and Nickel, with two levers for control. I found his turning the hypocritical Victorian society inside out to be refreshing and made the book a fast page turner. His not using overly technical language was another plus. The future society he described was intruiging and scary in its extremes. The gentle Eloi being taken care of by the slavish Morlocks makes the reader think of other historical eras where the few parasitically lived off the many. Feudalism and Communism come to mind. But, in this world the Eloi send their own on a regular basis to be fed to the canabalistic Morlocks. This book makes the reader think and encourages one to want to read more about both history and other fiction novels. For that alone, it deserves four and a half stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad","review":"well im writing this review for a physics project that i have to do. Well overall i thought the book was pretty exciting. Alot of details were given and the book kept u thinking even at the end when the traveler disapears and never returns. I thought the ending was pretty cook since i would never expect an ending like that. THe book has action, and lots of details. Some parts were hard to understand because of the wierd names that the travler gives but overall the book wasnt bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"And so it began.","review":"It is as if someone set out to invent a cold, sweet, smooth concoction and ended up with Ben and Jerry's Rocky Road Ice Cream. H.G. Wells wanted to write the first science fiction book of all time and ended up with a classic. There had never been a book like this before it appeared in 1895, and precious few as good or as imaginative since. A man of science invents a time machine and becomes a traveler to the year 8,002,701, to a terrifying land of tomorrow. While exploring this futuristic world, his machine is stolen and he must struggle to get home again or forever be trapped between the simplistic world above ground and the horrors below. It's a short book, barely 100 pages, but it will keep you mesmerized from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well's second best book","review":"Although I thoroughly enjoyed the book, it will never match my favorite of his 'The Island of Doctor Moreau.' 'The Time Machine' did seem to start off a little slow and a little to science fiction for my taste. However, it became more stimulating and full of action as the story progressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Time Machine","review":"The Time Machine is a book that would intrest many people. This book has an indepth plot and story-sine. When the time-traveller goes into the future his time machine gets stolen. The main conflict is shown when he tries to find and get his machine. The whole concept of this book intrest the kminds of the people who like to think. As the time-traveller explains his theory the reader will try to imagine the reality of it. The probabilaty of the world changing in the way it did should also push the readers mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Imaginative\\"","review":"H.G. Wells \\"Time Machine\\" is an enduring classic, which still has much to offer readers a hundred years after its first publication. The sheer depth of speculation and scientific theory throughout this work is impressive to say the least, and will invariably open new corridors of thought to eager readers. The vivid imagery and gripping narrative will excite and entertain all that read this impressive, concise, and compelling work. It is obvious, however, that H.G. Wells was deeply rooted in the Darwinist and Marxist milieu of the times; he seems to justify communism and totally acquiesce in the theory of evolution. While the apparent theme of this work may be a bit unappealing to fundamentalist Christians, it remains nevertheless, even to those who disagree with it, a remarkable achievement in English literature. This is certainly a work worth reading; it is a classic that will always be at the fore of science-fiction novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Read","review":"The book is much richer and more complex than the Hollywood movie versions of the story. The thoughts and emotions of the Time Traveler as he experiences the evolution of the human race over a vast time period are very thought provoking.

Surprisingly it is quite different. The pace certainly is much slower. The interactions with other charcters and the cause of future events makes it almost a entirely different book. The time traveler's observations and philosphy also makes it a stand alone book. I have always enjoyed the movie and its comination of adventure and peek into a possible future. This is more of a stroll where you have the time to see everything and think about what you saw. I would not say the movies were better...just different. I would say it was less Indiana Jones and more Sherlock Holmes."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Time Machine","review":"Well The Time Machine was an ok book. It could have been better. Wells does a great job at describing the future from his view point. High points in the book were chapters 4 through 9 thats where the Time Traveller goes to the year 802701 and meet carnivorous creatures called Morlocks. One thing I did like about the book is the epilouge after chapter 12 saying that the Time Traveller never came back, it was a great cliffhanger. All in all, The Time Machine is an ok book. I strongly recommend this book to H.G. wells fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is much better..............","review":"H. G. Wells in one of the great originators of sf. HIs novels have inspired writers from Asimov, Heinlein, and Clarke, to , most recently, Ronald Write.Wells is meticulous about the sentific background and this, together with his pithy, understated narration, makes his fantastic tales entirely convincing. Well's meachanis may have dated since he wrote \\"The Time Machine,\\" but the issue of time travel remains a central one for sf writer. And Wells's social analysis has been at least as influential as his scientific concepts.In the Time Machine his future world is divided into two classes, the subterranean workers, called morlocks, and the decadent Eloi. Here, as elsewhere, his critique of sexual relationships is also highly provocative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time machine review for Mr.Moshe- by michael munoz","review":"H.G. wells book the time machine is a very interesting book that always keeps you guessing about what will happen next.

Wells is a classic sci-fi novel that changes your perception of the future. Wells belives that instead of the world developing more and more intellectually, that it will come to a point where there's no need for intelligence. In this novel Wells pieces the vocabulary so well together to create compelling pictures as if you were actually there. The Time Machine leaves you guessing at the end of each chapter to make you want to read on everytime.

He travels very deep into the future only to be disgusted by its inhabitants and their culture. Even though he's still on Earth it's like he's on a different planet, and nothing is the same. While the Time Traveler is in the future his time machine is stolen by the evil Morlocks. The Time Traveler is faced with no help as he battles his newly found enemies to try to recover his machine. Does he recover the machine and return safely? Read the book to find out.I really enjoyed this book because it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat.

However, rereading it as an adult, I feel there is so much more to the story (as far as thematic import) that I didn't fully grasp back then. This is one of those books like Animal Farm; a child can read an enjoy it, and reread it years later and enjoy it on a whole new level. This book is a true classic with good reason; Wells' vision of society and the relationship he portrays between the Time Traveler and the people of the future provide much for the reader to think about."},{"rating":"2","title":"An oldy but goody","review":"Loved the story.

He finds this future has 2 very separate worlds. One made up of the fortunate upper class that is intelligent and small in size. The other a boorish lower class of workers, forced to live underground. This timeless piece outlines the possible consequences of a growingly divided world between the more and less fortunate. And the differences between the physically superior and the mentally superior. Wells paints a vivid picture of this future world with descriptions of the settings and characters appearances. However the one thing that is most vague is the chief character that is not even awarded a name but is called simply \\"the time traveler.\\" This book outlines the conflict involved with classism and is still relevant in today's society.

The working class has developed into the Morlocks, who have become physically repulsive creatures of the night yet retain some knowledge of technology. The aristocrats have become the Eloi, attractive yet utterly useless, living like sheep. Without the constraints of economics to protect the elite class, the Morlocks have begun to feed on them literally, just as the upper-class could have been said to feed on the workers figuratively during the Victorian Era. Besides such social commentary, Wells also treats us to a haunting glimpse of the Earth at the end of time, where great crab-like creatures scuttle beside a drying sea under a dying sun. Superior to the vast majority of the time travel sub-genre that this novel spawned."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Time Machine","review":"Would you ever want to travel in to the future? In this book a person who calls himself the timetraveler travels into the future. Where ape-like creatures called morlocks steal his time machine. The morlocks herd people like cattle and eat them. The morlocks hide his machine in the base of a bronze statue. He visits two other places. I will not tell you about those places. There are no animals in this story. But lots of bones (when you visualize)(they're probably from the helpless victims of the morlocks) I think this is a very good book because the author was trying to warn people that things might not be as we expected in the future.Near the end he travels in time to bring back proof of what he saw.

The darker side of human nature emerges from the outwardly benign residents, who are embroiled in a whole complex of deadly sins involving the victim.Was it the luscious and lubricious milkmaid? The shady character hanging around the docks? The victim's sister? widow? And what part did that hat play?Well, so sorry, I'm not going to spoil this one for you.

Also included is audio commentary by Donald Richie, and a very informative documentary titled \\"Kurosawa and the Censors\\" which describes the process of how the the film had rewrites because of the censorship Japanese cinema was put under by the American occupation.This is a great film and remains one of his best known films of the 1940's"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drunken boring","review":"A rather self-serving, cold hearted, alcoholic doctor gets bored with his dull life and decides to help a small time thief and hoodlum. Great acting and directing and yet a very boring film still came out of it. The premise is too obvious and uninteresting to be worthy for a Great Kurosawa film and this film suffers because of it.Mifune and Shimura are captivating but they play great characters in a very boring and predictable story with plot developments you can see coming a mile away, by the second hour the film was dragging, and became predictable and tedious. The story is non-existent and the characters are so undeveloped that one could care less about them.So unspeakably boring that I had to turn it off each twenty minutes to walk around, and I felt I had deserved a medal for that. And, by the way, I generally love Kurosawa films."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Scathing Commentary","review":"Unsentimental, gripping morality tale of Japanese society after WW2. This is a simple story with the sharpness and balance of a finely crafted sword! Mifune and Shimura play off each other beautifully. Who is the drunken angel? We are told it is Shimura. But..... as Donald Richie says in his book on Kurosawa, Mifune is also an angel, though of a darker breed. Vivid images remain with you long after the film is over and respect for all those involved increases with each viewing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak excuse for a karate book with \\"Art\\" in the title.","review":"This book has absolutely no substance, just pictures. One could learn just about as much about stretching from a comic book. This book should be titled \\"The Art Of Taking Blurry Pictures of Someone Who's Really Flexable\\". I hesitate rating this 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"the art of ????","review":"After reading this book I must admit that it is not designed for the beginner, so if you are an expert at stretching then you may want to purchase this book. AS for beginners it does not give detailed explanations as to the different types of exercises or the benefits. It simply shows some pictures and tells you \\"stretch\\" or \\"relax into the positions\\". I am therefore forced to conclude that the art of stretching and kicking was produced for martial arts experts.....but.....if you are an expert already then you would not need a book to help you. This raises another question, what is the real purpose of this book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am a kicking machine from this book!","review":"I enjoyed reading the book. I was kicking in 2 days.

The sound quality is ok..., it sounds like the tape is running a bit slow, and is a bit muddy. The song selection is cool though, with more uncommon songs like QUITE DISSAPOINTING, BRENT CROSS, TROUBLE, and BIGGEST PRIZE IN SPORT included. The best live 999 recording remains the vinyl ep \\"the biggest tour in sport,\\" but this disc is a most adequate picture of the band at one of thier creative and popular high points."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor sound quality","review":"the cd is not worth [the price]. the vocals break up and the tape drags. the cd was made from a 20 year old amateurish tape and sounds like the quality of a worn cassete but it is clear.

And no, you can't tell that from the sample. Amazon needs to apply some discipline to the descriptions and metadata on re-publications of old multivolume public domain works. We shouldn't have to buy a pig-in-a-poke. It happens much too frequently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gaming mouse","review":"I really have liked this mouse. It allows for three different settings in sensitivity as well as selection style. It has a pinpoint accurate laser sensor on the bottom that limits over movement and has a great feel for clicking and rolling of the wheel. My only negative is that if you are changing over from a stock mouse you might accidentally click too many times as the buttons are pretty sensitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for Black Ops on PC","review":"On the fly dpi and multiclick = PWNAGE on Black Ops for PC. Orignally bought this to work with an XFPS Sniper Pro for the Xbox 360, but it didn't work with that peripheral. I just wish that the thumb buttons were a bit lower and bigger like on the razer deathadder, but once you get used to the mouse it works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book for beginners","review":"The book covers many significant aspects of buddhism, its core teachings and development.

Also, seemed to \\"borrow\\" from a lot of other authors. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Good Not To Own!","review":"First point to make... this is the FIFTH full length album from Forrestville's own pop-punk legends, Bracket. And although 'Novelty Forever' was lacking a lot in old school Bracket style, 'When All Else Fails' makes up for it in spades. Retaining their edge but also taking their style to new heights this album lept up to being my favorite Bracket album of all time. Great production, greats content, and even better songs this album is a must for any Bracket-fan, fan of good music, or any old kook who feels that 'Green Day Has Lost Their Punk Identity, So Where Do I Get My Pop/Punk Fix?'Easy, from the band who has mastered it and had it all along... Bracket.Buy this album!(Fav. Songs: 'Cynically Depressed', 'All My Friends...', 'No Brainer'... um... and the rest of them they are all perfect.)BUY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fine release from Bracket.","review":"Here is another great one from Bracket. They sound like a mix of NOFX, the new Descendents, and MxPx, if those could be put together. I enjoy the happy sound, which follows in the goodly Fat tradition, yet the lyrics are heartfelt, both on the glad side and also the sad side. Buy this cd and spread the word. Bracket needs your support. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie!","review":"I was a little dissapointed that there wasn't more action, but this was a really good movie with solid acting by everyone and a good script. I loved the bar fight scene!! Kevin Sorbo was great, as always, and AJ Buckley did a good job as the main villian. I can't wait until Walking Tall 3 comes out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Walking Tall - Great Movie","review":"After a few hiccups with actually recieving my copy of Walking Tall The Payback, i really enjoyed this movie and thought that Kevin Sorbo and the supporting cast did a great job.Kevin Sorbo is great in any role he plays and this one was no exception. He played the role of Nick Prescott so well. I really loved his character.AJ Buckely was great bad guy, so much so that I wanted to hit him. He showed a little bit of compassion but not much in one part of the movie.Jennifer Sipes role was only small but a role that you wont' forget in a hurry, she portrayed Krystal really well and the emotion she showed without having to even say a word.Have watched this movie many times already and will watch it many times more.Bring on the next movie.Julia"},{"rating":"1","title":"could've been so much better","review":"I don't understand why they keep making these silly walking tall movies with little or no regard to Sheriff Buford Pusser, the real and only walking tall (HELLO)!!!!! Why can't someone just remake the REAL TRUE STORY of Sheriff Buford Pusser??????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kevin Sorbo is a Damn JOKE!!","review":"What is wrong with you people? Kevin Sorbo is good? Kevin Sorbo is the king of B-Movie garbage and lousy television. Give me a break. If I'm going to watch an awful sequel to a movie that was awful in the first place with an even lousier actor replacing the lead, I'll opt for The Substitute 2 and Treat Williams any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful hats, terrible charts","review":"The hat ideas are wonderful. Too bad there are so many errors in the charts. I contacted Lark books for a copy of their errata (a correction sheet for the errors in this book). What I received was a very poor photocopy of the corrected charts. The corrected charts were so small, and the photocopy was so many generations from the original, that I could absolutely not read it. I counted twenty charts from the book that have corrections! I am an experienced knitter, but I have a hard time getting into a new knitting project, knowing that the charts are wrong. I contacted Lark books repeatedly to get a cleaner, more legible copy of the errata. So far, I have received nothing. I'm very disappointed. Further, the gauge she suggests is too small. More specific instructions with regards to yarns and needle sizes would have been very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful patterns for the advanced knitter","review":"I love these designs...very creative and fun to knit. HOWEVER, this is definitely NOT a book for a beginning knitter, or for any knitter who likes to follow patterns exactly as written. In order to enjoy these clever designs, the knitter must take the time to think, and to chart out the next step...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Designs","review":"I have almost all of Anna's books. They are wonderful. However, this is not a new knitter's pattern book. You will have to know how to do stranded knitting and chart reading before you can use this book with ease.The designs are beautiful, her color sense is incomparable, and you'll want to make lots of these hats. However, if you are a novice knitter, you should have someone around to help you.Anna gives 3 different bands for you to start from. I loved the braided one, which can also be used on mittens and socks. The designs will keep you intrigued. Yes, some of the hats are a little far-fetched, but I promise that if you make them up, you'll get compliments.I have knit 3 hats from this book. One of them took me 4 days, but it is beautiful, warm, and so unique. Great for a snowy day. The other two were gifts, and much appreciated.I was lucky to get this book for a much better price than the current price."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'd better like fair isle knitting...","review":"I bought this book for its variety of hat shapes and was hoping to knit them in solid blocks of colour rather than in stranded fair isle. Zilboorg states that if you are going to knit these designs with one colour per row (rather than the two colours that are charted), you need to increase the number of rounds, however, she does not give the reader specific instructions or charts - not even a calculation - for how to do this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled \\"Ugly hats to make for a church bizarre\\"","review":"These hats are ugly, hands down. I didn't even get to the patterns or charts, because I had no interest in making such ugly hats. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"One out of Three","review":"First two chants are too schmaltzy and \\"Western\\" to assist in meditation. The third chant however is good, the least embellished and helpful for meditation."},{"rating":"1","title":"not at all tibetan","review":"This album is just an attempt to make a quick buck. It is not at all Tibetan. It is pure Han Chinese music. There's not much else to say, except that it's not very good Chinese music. Kind of like a sountrack to a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!","review":"I bought this CD with great expectations: I thought I would have some lovely mantra chanting to play throughout the day. NOT. All expectations were dashed - no, shattered. This CD is horribly New Age, with cloying instrumentals and silly chanting rhythms. It was a complete waste of money and a total embarrassment to play. I took a chance on this one, and lost. Bigtime. If you are interested in Tibetan Buddhist chanting, look elsewhere... preferably for something recorded by actual Tibetans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music that gets to you","review":"I'm not a fan of chanting of any kind but this music (the first two tracks) is truly beautiful. The fact that each track goes on for 20 minutes means that you can realy get into it, although I don't recommend listening to it too much as you will get sick of it!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all Tibetan","review":"This disc is more of a Japanese pseudo-disco version of some distorted version of Tibetan Chants. Not at all what I expected. The subtitle \\"The Meditative Sound Of Buddhist Chants\\" is extremely misleading. Rather sleazy money grab from people who are looking for Tibetan music. A waste of money... If I wanted this type of music I would have ordered KC and the Sunshine Band sing Buddha Rocks..... I think you need to add a zero stars to your rating system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"If you want traditional Tibetan music this is not the record. Unfortunately, when you buy the CD there is no indication something is amiss unless you read the tiny pin-size credits on the back that mention Taiwan. And the Chinese names of the performers is a give-away, but you cannot read them until you open the CD - by then, too late to return it. If you like Chinese popular music this is the CD for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calming Cantation","review":"My daughter brought a copy of Om Mani Padme Hum home from her trekking trip in Nepal, she said they played it every morning in every tea house she stayed in, along with the chiming of small handheld bells....it takes you right there,if its not authentic to some, its well loved by the Nepalese, it is so calming when my teenage son cant sleep because \\"he cant stop thinking\\" its what he listens to on his ipod....that says it all really. Oh yes and im just about to order my own copy :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meditational","review":"This is the only pure Chenrezig chant I have been able to find on the entire web. Others attempt to play music with the chant or add unrealistic echos to where it sounds like the chanter is in a massive cave. This CD allows one to hear a musical rendition of the chant in the beginning, but in the third piece, allows only a monk's small, wooden block and bell to be heard for a tempo. It is definately not Buddhist monks chanting, but the words themselves, the Sacred Mantra of Om Mani Peme Hung is heard in its purity."},{"rating":"1","title":"ELECTRONIC INSTRUMENTS !!!???!!!!???","review":"I found this CD in the World Music section under TIBET. All I had to go on is the front and back cover information and photos. I bought it. As soon as I opened it and started to play it, something seemed seriously wrong. Sounds like New Age music. I looked at the booklet and what jumped out was ELECTRONIC INSTRUMENTS. OH NO! There is a disturbing lack of information on the performers or musicians. Are they monks? Are they even Tibetian? Where WAS this recorded? There is a photo of a monk but he is not identified. This is absolutely NOT what I was looking for. I feel like I was suckered into buying this. If I had only listened to samples of the music FIRST!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tebetan Incantations","review":"The CD fully met my expectations , I enjoy it immensely and will for a long time to come, It arrived earlier that I thought from Amazon and was exact to what I ordered , no issues at all. The music itself is deeply spiritual and peaceful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Setting standards for Melody","review":"The three songs on this CD define melody. They are so melodious that, though, I don't understand all of it nor can remember the words, I keep humming the songs. The first and the third song are the same with an alternate rendition. The chant is repeated over and over and over again, but never did I get bored of it. In fact, it is so calming, bewitching and captivating, that I listen to it more than a few times a day. The second song - the mantra of Avalokiteshwara - is so beautiful, that it enlivens my heart like a baby's smile.This CD is that rare gem of melody, reflecting peace and relaxation. Perfect background for my yoga classes or during work."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is authentic","review":"I lived for several years in Nepal and frequently visited on the main buddhist stuppas for ceremonies at the full moon. This CD was constantly played in shops around the area and the melody used by area monasteries. One evening I sat with friends and listened for hours to child monks singing this chant on the rooftop of a nearby monastery. This melody is very popular, and although the music may sound new age to some, the instruments are sounds are those often found in traditional and folk music in Nepal and Tibet. I cannot think of the Om Mani Padme Hung chant without hearing the melody on this CD. If you dislike the instruments, the accoustic version is included as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The second song","review":"I did some research about the second song and the titleis the \\"Short Chenrezig Dharani\\", the words are:The Short Great Compassionate Heart DharaniNamo Ratna trayaya.

This CD does not have any of the famous multiphonic (producing more than note at a time) chanting but is greatly compensated for by a flawless mix of synthesisers, flutes, lutes, gongs and, vocals. If you are looking for chanting I reccomend \\"Freedom Chants From the Roof of the World\\" by Ryko. But you should own both items to get the best of both worlds. Track one of this CD is the most soothing piece of Asian music I have ever listened to in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mockery","review":"OK, so my mistake was going to a book/music store and buying this CD sound unheard. I should have thought to visit the website and test drive it first. For those of you who are interested in Tibetan chants as performed by Buddhist monks, give this one a miss. As I listened to it, the word \\"parody\\" came to mind and, instead of meditative contemplations, I found myself imagining a Chinese government plot to deface the beauty and depth of traditional Buddhist mantra chants."},{"rating":"2","title":"dozer blade rules","review":"I use this dozer blade for everything from clearing snow moving gravel and clearing over grown parts of my property.

After the 3 hour installation complete with missing bolts, we attempted to plow our driveway in the first major snow storm of the year. Well, just like the review above...we should have bought a snow blower! The tractor is just not powerful enough to push all the snow. The tires, even with the wheel weights and snow chains kept on slipping & sliding. We ended up having a brick wall of packed snow at the end of our driveway, that we had to shovel anyway. We will be returning this and sticking to lawn mowing with our tractor! Dissapointing!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yep! Parts Were Missing!","review":"I bought this snowplow because I had one like it many years back. That old one pushed a lot of snow! I sold my old tractor and blade. I decided to get another one for my newer garden tractor. I read the reviews and noticed a few people said that their plows arrived short some parts. I bet against the odds and figured it wouldn't happen to me. Yep! Sure enough, mine was short parts, too! The parts bag was intact with no tears or openings. I was missing the blade return spring, a handle bolt & hitch pin, and a number of other hitch pins. I had to go to the hardware store and pick the parts up there. Right now, I have purchased about $15.00 worth of necessary parts! How hard can it be to count out a small list of parts correctly?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly good thinking obscured by poor writing","review":"I don't like to speak ill of persons who have passed on, especially since the picture on the cover makes it appear that the author was a kindly individual, but this book was very disappointing. The author apparently intends to provide insights into the dynamics of human consciousness and relationships, but his writing is so convoluted that I have great difficultly understanding any of the points he is trying to make. His writing is possibly the most obscure I have ever encountered, and I have 3 post graduate degrees. My view is that he didn't put enough effort into expressing himself clearly. Perhaps he felt that the subject matter was so hard to understand that folks reading his books would expect to have difficulty. However, the more difficult the subject matter, the more it is incumbent upon a writer to put effort into expressing his thoughts clearly and succinctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"VB.Disappointed","review":"This books stinks.

Of course, after I have .NET working well with Access, then I would have a head start moving on to .NET with SQL Server and etc. This book covers Windows Forms and Web Forms in .NET. It covers XML.

He explain all the source code of the project and put it (source code) on the next page. It is very difficult to browse it steps, the book also less screen shot.

This book really helped to fill in a lot of blanks, and explained things in a very sensible, well-thought-out manner. Starting in pre-historic times, leading into the early Native American migrations and settlements in the Southwest, on to Spanish exploration and colonial days, followed by Mexican and then American ownership of this territory - all of this is well laid out, and well researched and explained.I would highly recommend this book for any resident of Arizona, anyone interested in early history, and especially for anyone with interest in how we ended up where we are today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twisted History","review":"I have just finished Sheridan's book of Arizona history; I was disappointed to say the least. While there were numerous factoids on events/names, many of them did not seem relevant to the current topic at all, they were just thrown in to \\"wow\\" the reader with his knowledge of Arizona.Most importantly, the history of Arizona itself, as presented in the book, was twisted and manipulated with Sheridan's overt liberal view on the subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first...","review":"A much better movie than its predecessor, Vampire Hunter D.The backgrounds are beautifully done and the character animation is more fluid.

The characters, I think, are very well voiced. I haven't heard the original japanese version, but I will. All in all, this is a terrific movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"HIGH PRICE - LOW QUALITY","review":"Always liked this movie - it's a classic. Simplistic? Maybe, but it's entertaining, and you have to consider when it was made. What I DON'T like is this DVD transfer (\\"Special Edition\\") - it's absolutely HORRIBLE! Half of the film is visually unreadable - and it's even more disappointing when you're waiting for great scenes that you remember and find that you can't even see them when they're on screen. No matter how I adjusted the picture, it was still a dismal mess. And the special features are anything but - doesn't come close to making up for the poor quality of the actual movie. In fact, clips of the movie that appear elsewhere on the DVD look better than the actual feature. This is one of the most expensive DVDs I've ever purchased and also one of the biggest wastes of money..... buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust","review":"When I first learned that this movie was coming out I was extremely happy. The trailer was cool, and I loved the original. But this movie was more cheese than I could hold down. I hated it. Spaceship Castle? Give me a break. If you loved the original VHD [though it is old, and a little cheesey it is all together more enjoyable for me] you my find yourself in horror as the plot to this unfolds. I suggest checking out something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved all but the end...","review":"I loved this movie, the intro, action sequences, story line, chareters etc. except for the end. I guess I'm the only one, but the end of this movie killed it for me. Granted, it did surprise me, and it was unexpected, but to me, it was INCREDIBLY weak. I mean, come on, why not waste Mier's a**? Letting him go?...please :-|. How non-dramatic could that get? I was just hoping the rocket would at least explode. Ohh well, sorry if you disagree, but the movie goes great right until the end. Also, the dvd does not include japanese dialogue, way to go numb-skulls. 2 stars for great action and animation, however the resolution, i just cant get over. P.S.- the original is way better, no comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neutral rating at best.","review":"Vampire Hunter D - Bloodlust will not win any awards. It is just another Japanese Anime that had its 3 seconds of glory and will fade away.Want to get your hands on some classy, collectible Japanese Anime? Get works by Miyazaki Hayao...This is truly for the kids. I have no clue why I bought this title on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst anime movie i've ever seen","review":"I was going to make this review really long and just tear this film apart but instead I'll say it's an extremely poor example of a really great genre. Everything about this film is bad. The art, the story, the action scenes, there is nothing in this film worthy of even a rental. If you're in the mood for anime save your money and see 'Ghost in the Shell', 'Akira', 'Perfect Blue', 'Princess Mononoke', or 'Ninja Scroll'. Please do not see this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vey bad in many complex ways","review":"Horrible, terrible and extrodinary crude and bad animation. It's also death boring and stupid plot, very stupid.TOO BAD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story.......That's all folks!!","review":"As the title of this review states \`Good Story' and that's exactly what this movie represents, story telling and nothing more. The fighting scenes are very dramatic but far too short (they only last mere seconds). Don't purchase this movie if you are really into animation for the action (I am) and this movie almost has no action at ALL!. Again I will like to stress that the fighting scenes are too dramatic, the movie does not give you an opportunity to get into the action. You will see two people about to battle and just when you sit up to take in the full effect of what's about to take place one person just dies!! Just like that !! The movie was good but I bought this movie because I thought it would have been action packed so I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep, thought-provoking, chilling, instant classic","review":"This was the first REAL anime I ever saw. Let's just say it was a great first impression. I loved the theme. (there are many of them) And it was a new twist on an old legend. It melded fantasy with things that can happen anywhere. Greed, courage, honor, heros, blood and what it's made out of. Not to mention, it proved a person (or vamplyle) can live without denying who they are, and remain their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring like hell - slow like a snail.","review":"I am a casual anime fan. I like cartoons in general, and I love sci-fi. I've bought into \`Vampire Hunter D' based on all those fantastic reviews. I was extremely disappointed. This is was the slowest anime I have ever watched. No thrills, no action, stupid dialogue, and no mystery at all. The story line was also very simple, and the heroes lacked dimensions. I bet the original comic book was much better than the movie. At least the graphics were true stills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampire Hunter D Re-release","review":"This movie was Jesus when it was released under Streamline pictures (bless their little out of business soul) So i was expecting no less than \\"de christos\\" for the rerelease version. They added a new cover which was about the only good thing of this movie, It just decided to blow wang this time for some reason. For all the queers out there who havent seen the original then this one will be alright but i still want you guys to know you are getting the blow wang version of a truly great japornimation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"give me a break people, this movie is weak. His hand talks to him. Wow. To all of you who rated this 5 stars, you probably like fist of the north star, too. Hell, you]re probably watching it right now. The only good thing about this movie is the cover. Please, people. Start with Akira. Well just keep this basic for you. That is a good anime example. There are others. Macross Plus. Ninja Scroll. Even Ghost in the Shell. You should be able to find these easily. Once you do, watch them and see how bad Vampire Hunter D is. Even if you love the company, get Darkside Blues instead. Now i'll write it in as big text as i can. VAMPIRE HUNTER D IS BAD ANIME. PLEASE, DISAGREE WITH ME. ESPECIALLY IF THE MOVIE IS ONE OF THE 5 ANIMES THAT YOU HAVE SEEN. Come talk with me when you people learn how to be a little more critical of what you watch. Until then, go watch Ishtar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Current DVD Version Looks AWFUL","review":"I had originally seen this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel years ago and thought it was great. I was really excited when the DVD came out. However, as is too often the case with DVD's, the movie was NOT \\"remastered\\"; visually it's too dark & grainy to be enjoyable. At least \\"Akira\\" was \\"spiffed up proper\\" for its DVD release. There IS a trailer for the REMAKE that looks comparable to today's standard of quality anime; wait for that version!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had High hopes but over rated","review":"After all of my friends telling me how great this was I finally picked it up and watched it. It feel really sluggish and (yes I realize it is old) the animation seemed poor. Overall it was very boring, and left me disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animation at its best","review":"Not only is this movie visually appeasing, but it develops a story that is simply awsome. The ending leaves viewers in just awe. This is an extremely underrated movie that did not get the exposure and recognition it deserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Anime Ruins an interesting idea.","review":"The premise was interesting, albeit far from original.In the far future, man has become disparate and are under the control of Vampires. It is a world of werewolves and other strange creatures.The local Baron is Count Magnus Lee and he has become enamored with a resident. He is bored and needs a little action. While having bitten the young woman, he sends her home, until the night he will marry her. Instead of accepting her fate, she hires a vampire hunter named D, who is a half vampire decendent of Count Dracula himself.The animation is weak, almost at the Ralph Bakshi level and the dubbing is poor. The characters are static and the action is fairly lame. It is gory but the movie is so weak that without the blood, the movie would have been a complete waste of time.If you like horror movies, try Devilman instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"VHD Bloodlust","review":"This movie makes major strides in soundtrack quality and sheer visual appeal over the first Vampire Hunter D movie. The characters are engaging and you find yourself \\"switching\\" sides as the plot unfolds. The symbiot is terrific, continuing his love-hate relationship with D. However, I found the Vampire Hunter D of \\"Bloodlust\\" to be colder and terser than the Vampire Hunter of the original movie. That was my only disappointment. However others may find this new interpretation of D acceptable.Any fan of beautiful anime will want to get this movie for their collection. A pleasure to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampire Hunter D","review":"I had never seen this movie before I bought it, but I must say, for when it was made, this is a pretty good movie. Good animation, excellent story line. The only part of the movie that confused me is, well, I don't want to give away any of the plot twists, but it seems like an important part of the movie was clipped out. Which surprises me because usually the companies put everything they took out and the kitchen sink into a DVD version."},{"rating":"2","title":"the simple facts of vampire hunter d-bloodlust","review":"vampire hunter d-bloodlust is a wonderful movie.it's got violence, true love, adventure, and an awesome mysterious main character.this movie will totally rock your world.it's different than most anime; there's no cutsie characters, and it's definitely not a comedy (that's for sure!).i would actually have given this movie 4 1/2 stars but it wouldn't let me!the only reason i wouldn't have given it five stars is because i wish that we could've gotten to know the main character a bit better (not that it's not great having him be a handsome mystery!).it was also a bit harsh on my sensitive sensibilities toward the end.so if you're as sensitive as i am BEWARE!i would definitely give this animation a ten.it's different but wonderfully dark.i do hope you get this!i know you'll enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"as good as you can expect","review":"let my start by saying that this is one of movies that everyone has to see, the movie was compared to ninja scroll more than once and with some justification. Again a fighter with unusual skills has to face evil in all of its forms.the story line is interesting and well made, there isn't a singel moment along the film in which one may feel bored and thats what makes this movie so good!the movie has some problems that cannot be ignored, the most disturbing one is that you don't really get to know the hero, how he thinks and all the interesting things relating to such unique character, he is always in distance.if you have any doubts about buying this movie, i say it as clear as i can: \\"it is worth the money\\".if you won't expect too much, you won't be disappointed.i hope this was useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great classic anime","review":"I first seen this movie on the sci-fi channel one saturday and it got me hooked on all sorts of anime.The plot is in the distant future vampire's and other creatures rule the night and now a young woman is bitten byt a powerful Vampire and to save her own \\"Soul\\" She finds a hunter of vampires she finds one that is half vampire and half human the one known as D.This story jumps rather quickly and moves fast but you still get absorbed but the dark nature and how scary this movie can actualy be.The voice acting and graphics are dated.Over all this is a great classic Horor anime movie and you will enjoy all the many diffrent parts of it.It dose have brief nudity, strong language and graphic violence so don't let the kids watch this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Old School anime","review":"I Love this DVD it has the long lost English subtitled version of the movie that is much better than the dubbed version of the film. So if you're looking for it jackpot. Second it has a whole bunch of other stuff that is pretty neat. If you like Vampire Hunter D then you are going to love this DVD I just backed it up to blu-ray and it looks great . Im so glad that I invested in this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks promising, but gives us little to nothing!","review":"Bad anime...What was good about this movie:1. Excellent animation!2. Characters with such potential!What i didn't like:1. The plot was mostly a big chase!2. The dialogue/dubbing was bad!3. The character's potential was wasted!4. D overcomes almost every obstacle with his sword!5. The movie's plot was too video game-like!6. Too many parts of the movie were slowed down to tell back-stories!7.

T. F>?Why on earth would they leave out so much? It's like making a DVD today without anything other than the movie! There's no point. If I wanted only the movie I would just get it from the net.If you're ok with just English audio and aren't trying to study Japanese or want to hear the original voices, this is for you.

The English Dub seems very distant and almost boring. Luckily it is \\"standard\\" for anime DVD's to have both dubs and subs.Unless you are a collector of VH-D stuff there isn't really any good reason to buy this. However, it is defiantly worth seeing. Especially since the sequel is so good. If I had rented this or seen it on tv I probably wouldn't have bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first movie","review":"The first movie was good, but this one was much better. Incredible art, wild action, and a great story. There's a little twist at the end that's great. I loved the evil countess in the castle. The English language dub doesn't detract from the story too much, except for the talking hand. It sounds a little bit like Michael Keaton from Beetleguise. Overall, this is a stunning movie, full of thrills and chills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible.","review":"This was easily the best anime I've ever seen. I'm a huge fan of the original, but this one was sooooo much better. Not only in the visuals, which were breathtaking (every frame should be hung in a museum), but in the story as well. The twisting plotline and character interactions suck you into the story, making this in my opinion not only the best animated film ever made from any country, but also one of the most memorable films in quite some time. Buy this movie now."},{"rating":"2","title":"freakout","review":"This is a great anime but I warn you, you have to see some fairly violent and wierd anime before you see this or youll hate it. The story is well thought out, the action is good, and the caracters are very beilivable, the animation is just what you would expect for the film. The movie is very intence its not one of those movies you go to sleep watching. D is very skilled and ruthless but he does have a soul and a personality. the only reson I gave it 4 stars is some things like the the person in d's hand are just too weird to get 5 stars. Still if you are tired of dumb happy Pokicrap animes this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anime classic","review":"Vampire Hunter D is a wonderful work even by today's standards. Viewers must remember that this was originally drawn in 1985. The animation isn't the best, but it is akin to watching, say, the original Ghostbusters or Back to the Future, and comparing the special effects to The Phantom Menace. The story is about a vampire hunter, D, who comes to a village to save a young woman from the clutches of the evil vampire lord. In the process D gets a chance to settle a few old scores. If you want graphically animated sex, and obscene amounts of killing try newer anime films. But if you want a piece of cult history, the Rocky Horror Picture Show of animation if you will, then you will enjoy Vampire Hunter D."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool","review":"I saw this movie years ago on T.V. and have been tring to find it since then. I am very happy that it is being re-released. If your are a fan of Japanese animation, vampires, or Gothic themes you will enjoy this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"i loved this amine, though i was sort of mad when i figured out that there is another one that comes before it. the way its animated, the story, the characters they are all nicely done. all i can say is that this is one of the best anime that you could add to your collection if you like anime enough to own them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect score","review":"Vampire Hunter D is an excellent anime movie! The artwork is beautiful and this sequel definitely surpasses the first. I will say that the story was good except for the ending..which could have been written better. Other than that...it is a must for any anime collecter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful dark anime about vampires","review":"This is a must have for anime collectors.The animation looks great even for an older film.This full length film is meant for the mid-teen to older crowd, for animated violence and gore."},{"rating":"1","title":"It BITES (Pun intended)","review":"I enjoy manga. I am spellbound by animation in general. But this movie nearly put me to sleep. Seemingly considered to be a classic, it is mearly old. The color is muddy to the point that I had to adjust my television just to see anything. The animation is simplistic with a lot of frozen shots \\"animated\\" with spraying blood. The main plot is predictable, but the side stories just make no sense. This is manga for fanboys trying to relive their youth. Anyone else should watch Ninja Scroll, my number one choice for sword slinging action. A bit more graphic than D, but MUCH more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fool's Gold","review":"Although brimming with ideas this movie is so badly dated it's not funny.... Although D's character is suitably dark and well-realized, the monsters in the castle make you laugh, not shudder. This is not gold. This is old.Don't waste time and money on this sub-par fare. Instead, wait for the new Vampire Hunter D flick directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri (Ninja Scroll). This version will not only prove to be an instant classic, as one can surmise from the awesome trailer, but will also readily condemn the original to the status of a cinematic has-been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but abysmal animation","review":"This was a very disappointing experience. Although the storyline is one that could have been turned into a great piece of anime, the simple fact is that you would be as well off quickly flipping through the pages of a comic book. The animation is unanimated, and dull looking beyond belief. The DVD presents a nice picture, but nothing that special, since the source material is not good to begin with. That the plot has so much potential, makes this an even more disappointing experience. Stick with the subtitles--the spoken English translation is not very good and the people doing the dubbing are a poor replacement for the original Japanese. I can only add that anime has come a long way since this was made, and anime shouldn't be judged on the basis of this very uninspiring visual experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE","review":"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The anime is very old and poor, story line is interesting, but it is done very poorly. I couldn't even finish watching this movie. I am so upset that I wasted my money on this piece of garbage. So if you are thinking of buying this film please DON'T! Please don't let my mistake be in vain. This film is CRAP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Heavens","review":"I received this DVD as an unexpected gift, and since I am a fan of anime and manga I was looking forward to watching the movie. I watched it with some friends, and I can tell you that it is the most pointless, rambling, and unenjoyable anime I have ever seen. I didn't mind the dated style of animation, nor the gratuitous blood and bouts of nudity, or even the American voice dub, but the story just keeps going on and on with no point whatsoever! Save your money for just about anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW? WHY?","review":"My only guess is that someone someone said it was a classic and everyone agreed as to prove they were \\"true\\" anime fans? I am a huge anime fan and all i can say is this is the WORST anime, hell, its the worst anything i have ever seen. I cannot put into words how bad this was. the animation- terrible, dialogue-my god....so stupid and cheesy. storyline- a joke. do yourself a favor, gauge out your eyes... and ear drums. before you put this one in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at Best","review":"Maybe I anticipated the release of Bloodlust too much or maybe I've just watched too many really good animations recently, which detracted from this movie. Most likely, it just wasn't that good. I was a big fan of the first VHD, but for a new movie that has had this much attention and praise I was quite disappointed. I'm not going to just give it a good score simply because of high hopes and respect for its predecessor. D didn't deliver the sword battles that can be found in Samurai X. The artwork wasn't sinister or gothic compared with Blood - The Last Vampire. The characters weren't nearly as well developed as those found in Ninja Scroll. After the dust settles and the hype moves on to a new movie, Bloodlust will be far removed from the status of \\"an anime classic\\" reserved for the likes of Akira and Ghost in the Shell. This move could've been much better than what's playing in movie theaters right now, but that's just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST ANIME EVER!!!","review":"D got me into anime and is still the best one yet!P.S.(if you know where I can get a copy e-mail me!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST!

You can get the original book from Books Nippon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Masterpiece? Hardly...","review":"This is one that, like Fist of the North Star, most anime beginners like until they see more. The animation is quite stiff, and the plot and characters are just dull.

Basically, I've always felt it was lots of wasted potential - the underlying ideas of the movie are far better than anything actually in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampire Hunter D","review":"Best movie I've seen in a long time.

It was a let down for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting...","review":"Definitely not what I expected.Bloodlust centers more around emotional conflict than the mindless slaughter of the undead (which I would have prefered). Bloodlust is by no means bad, however.The animation is exellent, the fight scenes are intense, and the storyline is compelling. The characters are drawn to seem more real than in the first VHD, and the women are therefore more mature looking (which for some people is not attractive). And although I will hold a grudge against a few select scenes in the movie, overall I enjoyed Bloodlust.Animation: A+Characters: AStoryline: B-Music: CVocal: BMy personal gripe factor: D--------Overall: B"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Premise, Worst Actual Story Ever","review":"Thought I would try an anime to see what I missing out on, wow was this horrible. I think I and everybody else should sample the best of a medium. I get that this isn't in that number, but again wow. The mentality of someone that could enjoy this boggles my mind. I'll try Ninja Scroll and if the story development is as offensive I'm checking out. This makes X-Men 3 seem reasonable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violence with little else beyond that!","review":"Now The movie definately was violent and for that I enjoyed it but otherwise I did not find anything origanal or likable about it. Not to mention so many things make zero sense. Why do they ride robotic horses when they could drive a car or something sense they obviously have the technology? Why do they use melee weapons save the appearance of 3 guns when houses are protected by laser defence grids? I addition they had to some how tie the storyline to count Dracuala which I found unoriginal. The western theme just did not work for me either. I guess if your really into violence and do not care for much else you would be a big fan of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"vampire hunter d bloodlust","review":"I've seen this movie in japan the story line mixes old and new traditons on the beliefs with vampires. A great revisal yet new twist for the Vampire Hunter D collections which actually features over 100 stories. great updated CG grafics a start for new breed anime movies.

I was amazed by the excellent animation, the beautiful anime artwork, and the totally interesting story that Bloodlust had to offer. VHD was the first anime I had ever seen, and that was nearly 8 years ago, but it is still one of my favorites . . . However, \\"Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust\\" is NOW my all time favorite anime . . . topping even \\"Akira\\" and \\"Ghost in the Shell\\".

The animation may seem primitive, but it is what I would call \\"classic\\" instead. This movie has a charm that I find lacking in many recent anime movies. The story itself may not be ingenius, but for it's time Vampire Hunter D was, and still is in my opinion, one of the top anime movies to date!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is THE #1 BEST!!","review":"This was the first anime I ever saw, and even then I only caught the last fifteen minutes of it on the Sci- Fi channel because I woke up around six fourty-five or seven a.m. and couldn't go back to sleep!

It's not your censored Sailor Moon or Dragon Ball Z stuff; the censored version is pretty bad any way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"... This movie is great, and there's a reason why D's facial expression never changes: it indicates his emotionless personality. The ending wasn't confusing, either; I understood what was going on well enough.

This special edition is I think a little less dark than Blood Lust, and D's demeanor seems a little more lighthearted than in the second. This special edition however uses sensual concepts and nudity more than its sequel. All around quite enjoyable if you like the premise or genre, not a bad addition to any film appreciator's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie.","review":"Its awesome! Not as great as everyone seems to think, at least story-wise, but still awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then the original","review":"A more complex and interesting plot, combined with a larger and more interesting cast, puts Bloodlust a level above the original Vampire Hunter D movie.Bloodlust is in English, but it isn't, as some reviewers seem to think, dubbed. The first Vampire Hunter D movie was much more popular in the USA then it was in Japan, and the sequal was written in English so that Americans (now the target audience) could understand it (it was later released in Japan with Japanese subtitles. I don't know whether it was ever dubbed).No matter what anyone else says, the animation and DVD quality were both fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very very very good","review":"Artwork an animation is excellent, and the dialog is surprisngly very well done for an anime. My only complaint is I felt the story wasn't developed enough, it seemed to move to fast, and that the movie was based around the fight scenes. But hey, with fight scenes like these, thats not too big of a complaint. If you want a stronger and more developed story, get the first Vampire Hunter D movie. If you want better art and animation, get Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust."},{"rating":"2","title":"COOL!","review":"One day I went down to the movie store and rented this movie. I was thinking OK a half-good movie to pass the weekend. I watched it and I was like WOW! The graphics were amazing! O_O Meier Link was one of the coolest characters in anime. And D was just awesome.

Not only incredibly dated, but BORING. No mystique to it at all. I honestly don't understand the rave reviews for it. If nothing else, rent it first (if you can find it), but unless you know the history of this and are into for that reason only, avoid it. For you Anime newbies, do NOT get this, there is much better stuff out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother","review":"I have no review of the version because I couldn't get past the fact that there is no Japanese audio. With all the things that can be done with DVDs today, it doesn't make any since that this one comes with 1 audio choice. Even for region 1 there isn't even a French audio selection. This seems like a shoddy product.A friend of mine even returned his copy because there is no Japanese selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"DUB ONLY?! YOU MEAN THEY *THREW AWAY* THE ORIGINAL AUDIO?!","review":"As an a long time anime fan, I was horrified to find out that Urban Vision decided that they would not only skip making subtitles for *ANY* release of this movie (both VHS and DVD versions) but they would also be THROWING AWAY the existing audio and dialogue of the movie. The translations used in the dubbed version are much worse than the subtitled translations because they try to match up the mouth movements. Even beyond the translation differences, the voice actors really take away from the movie.This was a horrible thing to do to one of the best anime movies of the year. The original Japanese movie is exceptional but such horrible voice acting makes it difficult to stomach many scenes, even for this die hard Vampire Hunter D fan. I will be boycotting all Urban Vision products after this appalling act of ignorance..."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is the japanese w/ subtitles version?!?!?!","review":"Ok, I saw this movie when it was out in theatres and it was amazing! Unfortunately for me, it was english dubbed (which I hate) so when the dvd finally was released I bought it, especially for the fact that I would be able to watch it in its original japanese language format! However, to my disappointment, IT HAS NONE ON THE DVD! They acctually released the dvd, with only the dubbed version in it!! The special features also are terrible...this \\"fan's favorite scenes\\" feature is completely useless and even dumb.Therefore, for the anime itself, I would give it 5 stars, its a great movie, but if you're like me and hate english dubbed versions and expect more from your dvds, I give this dvd a mere 2 stars and suggest that you rent it or borrow it from someone else (or if you can, find a japanese dvd with subtitles with your region encoding)."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Japanese","review":"It is disappointing to find that this DVD doesn't have Japanese dialogue setting.

Can't they afford much better voice actors?"},{"rating":"1","title":"awful in comparison to bloodlust","review":"If i could have given this zero star i would have. I saw VHD bloodlust and was amazed. I've watched many animated films that were reviewed as \\"you'll be amazed at the story\\" and i was thoroughly drilled with bullets of disapointment. This had potential and fell short...WAY SHORT. Bloodlust (the sequel) however amazed the life out of me and until its arrival i thought i would never find such amazement in an anime film since production IG's work. If your into any anime and it doesn't matter what it is you may enjoy this. If your looking for something that pushes the bar and really entertains try the sequel. Please don't waste your time on this, its not worth it. Animation, american voice-acting and general story sucked! I found myself fast-forwarding through bits and i haven't done that in a film other than Starship Troopers 2. The sequel excells, go for it. This film wastes money.

This is very pretty to look at, and that is where anything good ends. The dubbing is terribly done. We couldn't help cringing at many of the voice actors. Also, like too many DVDs, the backgrounds noises, sound effects and music drowned out the talking. We were constantly turning the TV to hear talking than quickly turning it down again during a loud action sequece."},{"rating":"1","title":"i gave it one star because none wasnt an option","review":"good lord this was bad, i dont know how anyone could possibly enjoy this. The animation is terrible, the story line substandard at best, i had the misfourtune to see the dubbed version, which may have contributed to the cheesy and stupid dialogue, but no dubbing no matter how horrible could cause a movie to be this bad. Don't waste your money, or time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Gothic Romance","review":"If you enjoy vampires, beautiful artwork and a rich and detailed plot line, this movie is the way to go. Vampire Hunter D is well written, directed and drawn and completely dissolves the mentality of what anime looks like and acts like.

It begins whith a introduction in which the girl is attacked by Count Magnus Lee a nearly 10,000 year old vampire. D is a a half human, half vampire whose father you most likely know.[Hint \\"D\\"] His sword is a work of art able to disassimilate demons in one cut. The sound track is amazing.

The art-work was fantastic and the scenes were pretty cool as far as action goes. But it is on no level like Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Ninja Scroll, or even the Dragon Ball Z movies. I guess it was story line. It was a good movie, but unless your a Vampire Hunter D fan, this is just a one-watch and done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampire Hunter D - Bloodlust","review":"A much improved story and the anime was far superior to it's predecessor \\"Vampire D\\".

Vampire Hunter D has to be one of the worst animes i have ever encountered. With such a poor plot, lifeless characters, and low budget animation, this movie is an insult to any viewer's intelligence. I dont claim to be a connossieur of anime, but even to the anime novice this movie is severely lacking. Not entertaining in the least bit. I thought it would never end. My strong disappoinment prompted me to write this, my first review ever.

I know it was done like 18 years ago, but the color scheme is aqua,pink,navy,black,white, etc very dull, the characters look like they have been drawn by a kindergarden class, and the story isn't that interesting, honestly i got through half of it, and turned it off. I couldnt even finish the movie!Watching this, all i could recomend is sticking to cheesy cartoons on tv, because they are highly more superiour to this. And not to mention the dialogue is beyond histerical.Rent if you must, then return it fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwrought melodramatic nonsense.","review":"If Vampire Hunter D is a classic of Anime, then it doesn't say much for Anime as a genre. It's overwrought, melodramatic, and vapid. It's storyline has all the coherence of a fever dream and its animation is homogenously styled with numerous lazy shortcuts to imply motion. Utter nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the WORST quality in Anime!!!!","review":"I only gave it 2 stars because of the girl! (SHE IS SO HOT!) and maybe the concept is COOL but the rest was HORRENDOUS.The graphics are smudgy, the animation is the WORST EVER, the action scenes were poorly choreographied, the sound is annoying and the camera shots were slow and poorly addapted!Better buy the sequel witch is everything opposite to what I said.Adios."},{"rating":"1","title":"This doesn't even deserve ONE star","review":"It has so much bloodshed in it that you'll be wanting to set fire to yourself just to escape this blodd-obssessed mistake.This movie has animation ripped off of \\"Gundam Wing\\" and the characters grate on your nerves with irritating voices that will give you a head-splitting migraine after 5 seconds.The musical score is god-awful and there is no plot.If you're expectinbg a plot in this dus,you'll be sadly mistaken-all you'll find is a movie that consists of nothing but ongoing violence and bloodshed.You'll be asking yourself\\"where's the plot?why isn't there a storyline in here?\\" over and over again as you try hard to keep focused to this flop.After 5 seconds,you'll be wanting to rip this DVD out of the player and smash the DVD into itty-bitty pieces with a sledge-hammer.That's how irritating and annoying this flop is."},{"rating":"1","title":"D looks like Boy George gone goth.","review":"(...) I don't care how much effort they put into drawing those vampire castles, because in the end it's a lot of static, 2 dimensional scrolled images. There was hardly anything 3D and cinematic about it at all, definitely nothing close to Akira or Ghost in the Shell. The first third of it was entertaining, but I expected a much darker, more advanced animation style, especially considering how they were supposed to be using state of the art computers for it. It appears they used the computers simply for speeding up the animation and layering the sprites. The biggest problem I had with the new D film was the lack of game rules on how the vampires can be killed. By the end, the same entities keep coming back to life, seemingly at the whim of the film's creators. Without rules, a film becomes a pointless exercise. I just wanted someone to die for good and the credits to start rolling."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the best","review":"(ha ha) example of bad animation that there is besides Fist of the north star. Suprisingly, they have the same director. This one had a great hook, but was executed very poorly, and never got off the ground. Besides, it is cheezy as all hell if you want the blunt opinion. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Japanese Language Track!","review":"Ignoring the film, I'm commenting on the DVD presentation. It's not available with any kind of subtitles, and the only language track is in English. Maybe I'm a bit of a snob, but I hate watching foreign films dubbed.

The CD features the drums of Terry Bozzio and the bass of Roscoe Beck on various track for a super tight rhythm section. Also featured on the disc is Papa Mali (\\"Thunder Chicken\\") who accompanies Omar on slide and sitar guitar. The CD showcases Omar's versatility and talent and successfully gives old time Delta musicians a nod while retaining originality.The only soft spot would be the inclusion of \\"Mississippi Queen\\" which, other than the title, seems to be out of place here. Otherwise, a fine release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loads of Fun","review":"There are plenty of adults who love Futurama and Bender. This wind-up robot toy is a blast.

There is something a little pandering about the approach the author takes. He seems to have an unusually obtuse opinion about bowing that really is a put off in the book. The descriptions of the techniques are okay and the pictures are so-so, even for a youth I would just recommend Best Judo rather than read this author's diatribe against Japanese traditions in a Japanese martial art. If he has this big of a problem with bowing and paying respect he should create another McDojo art style and get it to take off. Two of the other reviewers are clearly his students; he probably asked them to leave positive reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Formless\\" Hsing-I","review":"In kung-fu it is sometimes said that you must absorb form and then transcend form.

In motion, Taiki-Ken looks like a cross between Tai Chi Chuan and Hsing-I Chuan, though it is taught in a much more flexible way. (I don't see any Ba Gua in it.)

It is very interesting and it manages to keep the reader hooked. It has all the elements of drama, suspense, and comedy. It makes the reader laugh at times and it makes the reader sad. The book delivers some memorable lines. It's question is \\"Who is really insane?\\" The novel looks at human nature and shows the psychology of certain people. In McMurphy, We see a good man, A basic symbol of American entertainment. Someone who believes in having a good time. In Nurse Ratched, We see everything we don't want to be. She is a symbol of the negativity of human society. Someone who enjoys life by making others suffer. The book looks at human society and it really makes you think who is really bad"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest works in modern literature","review":"Yes, we know. Jack did an excellent job in the movie. But the book is an extraordinary and provocative look at how people can overcome their fears and shortcomings with just the right push in the right direction. Told through the character of Chief, we get a new perspective on life in Nurse Ratchet's ward. This incredible work should be required reading for all high schools (as it was in mine!), and anyone who loves the movie. True, the movie differs from the book but in glorious ways. Such as Jaws, The shining and others. They have their differences but each pleases=the book and the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful, Excellent Book","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is probably one of my favorite books, and it didn't take me long to read. I like the set-up of the characters and the way the Indian changes at the end. It was a very wonderful book that I recommend for everyone. I gave it 4 stars because there were some long, breezy parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychopharmacology Nightmare","review":"The book had some disturbing images and portrayed accurately the primitive psychological treatments available at that time. I got the impression, however, that Kesey underestimated the horrors of mental illness. His point is you have to be able to laugh at the world but mental illness is not that funny and at times the jokes were in bad taste. Medicine today is improving treatment for people with schizophrenia but we must always remember to not pigeon hole people into categories and treat them as human beings. Thats the beauty of Kesey's story: we are all human beings no more no less."},{"rating":"2","title":"An anti-authoritarian masterpiece","review":"Written in the 1960's, Cuckoo's Nest takes us into the dark halls of a mental hospital dominated by an imperative matron referred to as the Big Nurse. One day, a new inmate arrives at the asylum and soon wreaks havoc upon the suppressed lifestyle issued by the nurse.The mere tumultuous arrival of Randle McMurphy spurts a global animation among the docile patients. Using his charismatic talents, McMurphy incites them to active demonstration against the Big Nurse, who finds herself at a loss for resources to curb her patients' unexpected commotion.Himself being convicted for drug possession, Ken Kesey has managed to capture both the gloomy asylum-atmosphere and the mental patients' demented attitudes in his surrealistic lifework. A contemporary classic, Cuckoo's Nest stands as a tongue-in-cheek symbol of uprising against opression."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have ever read","review":"It's your typical drug induced, anti-establishment 1960's paranoid novel. I had to read it for my English AP class and was disgusted and disturbed by the imagery. Kesey blames women for the failings of men. If you're sensitive, don't read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"Seeing this book on the shelf for many years, I had a preconceived idea of what it may be like. I thought it was going to be detailed, dry reading about those living in a mental institution. I couldn't be more wrong. This story was told as a first person narrative and gave the reader the opportunity to drop any stereotypes he or she may have concerning mental illness. The characterization was fantastic. The ending, for me, was quite a surprise. The characters and story will stay with me for quite some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Flew East, One Flew West","review":"If you like to laugh and enjoy stories of rebellion, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the book for you. A rowdy gambler and brawler fakes his insanity to escape the toil of a work farm. He arrives at the state hospital to find himself, along with everyone else in the ward, under the control of the Big Nurse. Immediately, he makes friends with the other patients there and conceives a plot to overthrow her. Ken Kesey does a great job of painting an interesting picture of humanity and teaching you lessons about individualism in this masterpiece. Full of suspense, humor, and emotion, this book will keep any reader excited about the next page. As a high school student, I recommend this classic to anyone. Understanding the vulnerability of those who are mentally handicapped and the inhumanity that caretakers are capable of is something we all need to be aware of. Even if you are not an avid reader, I assure you that you'll love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredible Book!","review":"\\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" was a truly emotional book. It will make you laugh. It will make you cry. It will make you feel confused. It will make you feel smart. It will do whatever it is a book has to do to keep the reader's fullest attention. Not only will you enjoy reading this book it will move you emotionally.In this book I believe Kesey is trying to make two points:The first one is that being a leader not only allows yourself to be great but also brings out the best in others. Secondily, never try too hard to beat or defeat something or someone who has a higher power of authority than you do. You may win some battles but never will win the war.Kesey demonstrates these points in an enjoyable way in an incredible book. That you must read to believe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TYPOS EVERYWHERE in an otherwise amazing book","review":"I found this Kindle version to be unreadable due to very frequent typos. Amazon needs to pay someone a few to proofread this if they're going to charge thousands of people $15.00 for it. For example page 93 \\"I Ic\\" is written instead of \\"He\\". Page 96 \\"1\\" is written instead of \\"I\\". Page 102 \\"I low\\" is written instead of \\"How\\". Page 104 \\"1\\" for \\"I\\". Page 104 \\"I le's\\" for He's\\". That is a small sample of the typos throughout the whole book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favourite Novel of All-Time","review":"Rarely do you find a book, maybe only once in a lifetime you find a book this good. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is so good that I have never seen the movie, because although I'm sure Nicholson did a great job, the crazy red-headed Scottsman and the giant Indian are forever engraved in my head. It's amazing that a book can be so good, it's like you actually new the characters at some point in your life. That's what Kesey was able to accomplish, and I thank him for this rare piece of a literary masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very entertaining and funny novel!","review":"Julie GuerreroThe novel \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" by Ken Kessey, was one of the best books I have read ever since my high school years. It was the only novel that kept me interested in what was going to happen next and I couldn't put it down for second. What I enjoyed the most is the way the main character, McMurphy, performed his role and the way the author set up the story. The novel is about a man named McMurphy who goes into the world of the mental hospital and objects and refuse to obey the rules. He then takes over the Big Nurse who had the power of authority and McMurphy leads the other patients around him to experience fun and happiness. McMurphy does this by promoting gambling and he sneaks in women in the ward. His only goal in this novel is to reduce the other patien't fears toward the Big Nurse and to forget about the rules for once and have fun. Overall, this is a very interesting, enjuyable and a funny novel, and I defintely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ending made me cry.","review":"When it comes right down to it, it's not that the book was sad, but what it had to say about our society. All along I knew that McMurphy wasn't going to win, but I wanted him to. I rooted for him to get to the nurse; I wanted to see her crack. But it didn't. Instead we spent the whole book watching these people break out of their shells, to revolt against authority, and they don't. After McMurphy disappeares, they all give up and go home. I wanted them to stay and fight."},{"rating":"2","title":"My opinion of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"This book was very well-written. It was interesting for a story to be narrated from a Bromden, a patient in a mental hospital. I have always been captivated by the workings of the human mind. I also enjoyed the struggle between Nurse Ratched and McMurphy. I did not like the Nurse's oppressiveness. It was comforting to see someone oppose her rule over the hospital."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME BOOK!","review":"I chose to read this book for my summer assignment in my english class. The title is what was appealing for the list I had to choose from. I begin reading the book, and struggled to put it down. I would recommend this book to everyone! It is very easy reading, and a great book. Ken Kesey did a great job! He has this uncanny way of pulling the reader into the story. I usually struggle when I have to read books for this class, and I have to force myself to read it. I read this one with no problem. AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but i [prefer the movie","review":"This is a good read, and its fun to see everything through the eyes of the chief, but Cucoo's nest is one of my favorite movies, and i prefer watching this then reading it.

To me labeling something as \\"sane\\" is a waste of breath. The entire world and every being in it has same crazy truth hidden by layers of \\"normalcy.\\" We judge those who are insane because we do not want to see the human spirit unmasked. Nurse Ratchet has worked tersely to recover those who have removed society's bindings of normal. I really liked this novel but it was more the ideas that it questioned that I enjoyed than the actual writing.I envy Mac Murphy for his bravery and confidence to challenge authority. I wish I had the audacity to do the same, to pull back my veil and reveal my true insanity. Overall I think this novel deserves praise for its own audacity and ability to challenge literary normalcy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This was one of those books u read every 5 years or so .

My fingers smeared the ink while I was trying to hold the little book open. Better to find this at a used book sale or yard sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST by Ken Kesey","review":"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is the story of the residents and staff of a mental ward, centered around the power struggle between McMurphy, the new, sane patient, and the dictatorial Big Nurse.The novel is written in the present tense, which is often problematic, but here it works well enough. The use of Chief Bromden as the narrator is problematic at times, and the reader may find himself repeatedly skimming or skipping entire pages of mentally-unbalanced monologues. The end of the novel seems rushed, and as a result the impacts of many of the novel's climactic events are diminished.All in all, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is an interesting read. But maybe, just maybe, the movie is better.RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You","review":"This book was quite an interesting read. It kept me interested from start to finish.

From now on I will not start reading any book that was wrote by an auther on drugs. The beginning of the book was very hard to understand and it couldn't keep my attention. I started liking the book when McMurphy was trying to get the nurse to let them watch the world series and she wouldn't, so then he punched a window out. Its really hard to understand why some of the patients are actually in the institution, because they don't have to be. Like Harding he has succeded on the outside life, because he has a good looking wife, even though she might have been the reason he is in there. I just mean that he can live out there by himself, and not be in the institution. I don't recommed this book because it is hard to follow, and wasnt that interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not the best book I've ever read!","review":"I found that I could not really ever get into this book.

I would like to have a book burning."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't read.","review":"This wasn't a very easy book to read. It was kind of difficult to understand. Although, I was able to manage with reading about half of the book. It's hard to understand because the story is being told from the view of a mental patient. Bromden is often hallucinating and it's hard to know at times whether he's talking about the real world or if he's in his own world. Then there's McMurphy. Sometimes I wonder about him. He doesn't seem as though he has any mental issues. He just seems like a normal guy, always trying to get what he wants, when he wants. He often messes around with the other patients and takes advantage of their disabilities. Not only does he mess with the patients, though, he also tries to play games with Nurse Ratched as well. All I know is that if the book was a little easier to understand, and things were a little more clear I would have finished reading it because I did think the plot was rather interesting, but it just wasn't easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, amazing book","review":"I first read One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest during my senior year of high school, while I was playing Nurse Ratched in the play. The book, the play, and the movie are all amazing facets of the same story. It really took over my life at that point and I'm glad it did. I visited mental hospitals and talked with the Head Nurses in my area, and it was really quite interesting that they often did not find the character of the Big Nurse out of line at all, that her actions were completly justifiable and McMurphy was, indeed, nothing but a trouble-maker. The book is disturbing in the finest of ways. It's one of my favorites"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've ever read","review":"I first read this book when I was 14, and I've reread it five times since. It is, quite simply, the best book I've ever read.This is a story about rules -- who makes them, who enforces them, and why. Randall P. McMurphy is a boisterous, bawdy gambler/conman who's faked his way into a mental institution. Nurse Ratchett is the dictatorial head nurse who *does not like* any disturbances on her ward. These are two high-ego and passionate characters who lock horns.Ken Kesey's writing is exceptional. The characters are believable and the dialogue spurs you through the book. The book is even better than the Oscar-winning movie with Jack Nicholson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Item","review":"The item was listed as the Spanish edition, but the book is in English.

Its sturdy and has an inside flap to tell you the book summary. The font is great as is the set up of the different parts. If you want a book full of symbols and meaning but set in something mundane and frightening as a crazy house --this book is great. The only problem I had with this book is the pages. The edges are not uniform. I had great difficulty turning the rough, unven edges of these thick pages.

Then i found the book at an airport - i thought i should read it. The book, (I dread to comment in this way) was as good as the film. It was well written, the characters well formed, the narrative well balanced, in fact as good a book as any. HOWEVER my opinion i think was jilted because i had the images of the actors in the film in my head as i read the book. How could anyone forget the contorted face of Nurse Ratched and the idiot smile of b b b b b billy from the film? I hope everyone will pay their respect to the writer and read the book first. It is a great book and should be enjoyed for itself. That the film was just as good, may mean that One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest will never reach outside a generation of readers, in the same way that Catch 22 will (although that made a great film as well).

I approached it excitedly... yet, I thought, perhaps I would be disappointed, perhaps I wouldn't find it such a good book as everyone else?Guess what, I did.Even though it was written some while ago, it's still pretty modern.

Now about the book.The book contained deeper aspects, such as the Combine and the Fog and vivid descriptions of hallucinations that let the reader into the psychotic mind--if anyone would want to...I think the benefit of the book lies in helping shed light on mental illness, how mentally ill people can be harmed by opressive institutions and on the theraputic value of uplifting the human spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Very intense, well written novel depicting the type of care used in the treatment of mental illnesses.At this date, it seems almost implausible that such a cold, calculated and cruel approach was considered therapeutic.But if one looks over the history of treatment of mental illness through many years, it was just another step towards a more humane approach, even though what is being used at the present day is still far from perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book by Ken Kesey is themost enjoyableread ive ever had","review":"first off if u want to email me about this timeless novel do it Unlike any other novel this is a book that keep you laughing and intrigued the whole way through.

I think the theme of this book is men create their own prisons. The main character of this novel is Randle McMurphy, who ends up to be a hero in the patients' eyes. Nurse Ratched is the conflict in this story. Nurse Ratched controls everything the patients think and do. At the end of this novel one of the characters overcomes her. I hope this review persuades you to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad book","review":"I would not recommend this book to anyone. It was just so boring and I could not concentrate on it at all. Most of the time it was hard to tell if Chief was going through one of his halluciations or it was what he really felt. In this book there were way to many people. I could not keep track of who was who and if they were a chronic or an acute. This book was the worst book I have ever had to read in my high school career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated","review":"I actually did begin to read, \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" and I must say I was very uninterested, to say the least. I know that many people say, \\"Don't judge a book by it's cover\\"... but maybe if the cover was more interesting, I could at least study the cover. The book itself did not draw me in. Personally, I don't care about Chief Bromden's \\"psychotic\\" episodes where he hallucinates into some fog. I was surprised because usually these kind of books interest me. I like to learn about how the human mind works, but McMurphy's constant perversion with the nurse annoyed me a bit. There was sexual tension between them that needed to be released, and wasn't. I didn't finish the book so my judgement calls might be wrong, but so far from what I read this book is nothing too interesting or too great. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOWZA!!!!!","review":"This book is ok. I am not a fan of reading so it is pretty easy to bore me with a book. I am alot more into books with a lot of action. In this book, Mcmurphy is the leader of a group of wierdos in an insane asylum. Mcmurphy inspires a character named Chief Bromden to come out of his shell and become a more assertive person. The asylum is also broken down into two groups, Acutes and Chronics. Chronics are the hopeless and Acutes are the people that actually think. In this whole asylum there is one person in charge, Nurse Ratchet. She is a prude and has many confrontations with Mcmurphy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is Cuckoo-Cuckoo!","review":"If there was ever a more apparent need for a 0 stars rating, this is the time. The time I took to read this book could have been used for much better things. I could have been reading the newspaper, watching tv, or playing some video games. Anything would have been better then reading this P.O.S.. The narrorator, Bromden, is gay and is constantly talking about how he wants to touch other men, I don't know about you but a book with that crap in it isn't for me. Also, the fact that all these people are just staying in this mental hospital when they don't have to is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard of.

I found it to be extremely boring with multiple ideas leading off in all different directions. Keesey should most likely be condemned for writing such a pointless novel. I think we now know why LSD is illegal.

Once in high school 20 years ago and again last year. It stills has the insightfullness of the King of Hearts and all the depth. It is too bad that this book is so well written.

It is an incredible tale of a man who single-handedly brings life back to the inmates of an Oregon mental hospital. It is a tale of hope, desire, and of living life to the fullest. Hope is represented by the freewheeling Randle McMurphy who makes it his mission to save his fellow inmates from the terrible rule of Nurse Ratched. The battle of wits between the nurse and McMurphy becomes the essence of this story. It symbolizes something much bigger than the petty poer struggle it appears to be; this is the power-hungry versus the oppressed. Author Ken Kesey has managed to maintain a humorous tone in the gloomiest of settings with a cast of some of the most animated characters I have ever come across. From the POV of a hospital inmate, the story puts the reader right inside the walls of this loony psych ward. Read it and find your way out."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought that the book was hilarious!!","review":"The book was great at but also got kind of slow at times. i loved the part when McMurphy broke the glass in the nurses station.

Our society is against anything different. I liked seeing the world through Big Chief's eyes and knowing what he thought of his own society in which he lives. For me, the whole book was about Big Chief's building himself up enough to make a breakthrough, and then finding the courage to break out of the combine and begin his life once again. I enjoyed the book and would encourage anyone who likes books out of the ordinary to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, my new favorite...","review":"Let me start off by saying this book is absolutely incredible. I had to read it for a college English course and, upon finishing, I was left wondering why the hell I had waited so long to read it. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this book. I also saw the movie that, while it was good, can never compare to the book. I've kept the book so that I can reread it in the future. I can honestly say I had moments where I was laughing so hard my face turned red but I also had moments where I was crying so much I could no longer read the print on the pages.Do yourself a favor and read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites","review":"I'd could write for days about all the reasons that this is one of the greatest books I have ever read, about how it flips your perception of others, makes you re-evaluate your life, abolishes all previous assumptions about \\"insanity\\".

He quite overwhelmingly lost any claim to authenticity or originality with the publication of \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\\" It reads like the jottings and musings of an orderly with an eighth-grade education. Nurse Ratched's paper thin representation of the \\"Man\\" is so entirely hackneyed as to make the reader wish he or she were born absent the gift of sight and not have to read another single book.This is a non-redemptive novel, and deservingly so, given the author's/protagonist's trip through the hollow's of the mind where superficiality reigns supreme.Chris Roberts"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Flew Over the Cockkoo's Nest","review":"I read this book for a class in school and found it to be incredibly entertaining.

McMurphy is by far one of the best characters in the book. He reminds me of myself at home. At home I try to take over the TV, gamble, and rebel against everything my parents say. When I say McMurphy rebels, he's all against nurse Ratchad. He does everything in his power not to do what he's supposed to do just like walking around in his underwear.If this book was alot more clear in the beginning it would be a very noble book and I think a lot more people could enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I am currently reading this book for my H English 10 class, and i find it to be extremely dull. Yes, I understand, it takes everyone a step deeper into the lives of the mentally challenged people of our time. However, it is a difficult book to follow. There is a constant changing of characters, which lead me into great confusion of the importance each one displayed within the text. I was very disappointed when I began reading this book. I always heard great things about it, but i guess, it's just not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vivid Prose, Juvenile Ideas","review":"Two stars for the occasional vividness of Keysey's writing--and no more for the tiresome use to which it's been put. Stanley Kauffmann, mentioning this book in his review of the film version, referred to it was one of those books he \\"needn't read--simply outlive.\\" And perhaps the time will come that this story of a psychopath looking for a cushy ride in a mental hospital and locking horns with the tough nurse in charge is seen as the whinings of a perpetual adolescent and not some epic struggle between freedom and conformity. All Randall MacMurphy wants to be free to do is steal and cheat and toy with women sexually. Subtract the hero-worshipping tone, and we have a denizen of a true-crime magazine story, the sort of lowlife the cops pick up after a string of violent rape-murders or robberies. In the end, you don't have to like Nurse Ratched to wonder if she might have done the world a favor . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Rant","review":"I did not enjoy reading this book. I had to force myself to finish it and at the same time avoid ripping out my hair due to boredom. The only character I liked was McMurphy. It was interesting to see the way he was able to impact each character in the book with his antics and ideas. Admittedly at some parts of the book I was uncomfortable reading about what went on in the asylum, and I think this was kind of the point, so the book was successful there. To me, the most important aspect of the book was, as Medgar Evers once said, \\"You can kill a man but you can't kill an idea.\\" One Flew over the Cuckoos Nest demonstrates the power an idea can have over people, and how even if you cannot see the idea in action, once it has been introduced it will survive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely confusing","review":"I could not concentrate whenever I started to read this book. It is hard to differenciate between what is really happenening and Chief Bromden's hallucinations. The book has yet to capture my interest. There are too many different characters to keep track of.

The head nurse, Nurse Racthed is maybe the most hanious villion in all of American literature.

The first 50 pages consisted of Doris Pilkington describing the history of Western Australia in the late 1800's/early 1900's. It was slightly confusing since she skipped between different tribes and places, all of which are in a completely different language- sometimes full sentences would be in an aboriginal dialect. She then followed a couple of young girls. It finally started to get interesting and worthwhile. But then, instead of the book reaching the climax and enthralling you, it loses it. I got completely bored for the last 75 pages; it seemed as though it was the same thing happening over and over. The ending also seemed quite rushed, as though she had to fit it in a certain number of pages.

While the premise of the book is amazing, the actually book is poorly written, at times grammatically incorrect, and a huge disappointment. There is a little insight from the girls' perspective and the first fifty pages or so is a disorganized retelling of european colonization. The first half of the book jumps around all over the place with little to no transition between completely new subjects.Sure, its a \\"quick read,\\" but there is a reason: the writing is elementary and often rushed. Where the heck was this woman's editor?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless and Horribly Written","review":"I do not understand why I just read this book. The first 40 pages were jumbled and confused, focusing on the history of Australia and the settlement by the Europeans. After the pointlessly long and tiring introduction, you are quickly 'introduced' to the three main characters, who are quickly picked up by a white police officer to take them to a school for children of mixed race. The author gives long, uninteresting descriptions of the landscape and the people that they meet on their brief trip. The three girls spend about five or six pages at the school once they arrive, before they decide to escape. And the next 100 or so pages are more long, uninteresting descriptions of the landscape as they travel back home. This book seems to have literally NO plot development, NO character development, and just poor writing overall. Absolutely nothing about this book was memorable, besides perhaps how painful it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rabbit Proof Fence.","review":"True story from Australia.

It is helpful in determining the root of inflected forms, especially for words that are quite \\"mutated.\\" I find it helpful for researching possible readings for alleged corrupt texts in the Massoretic Text, for example, the supposed corruption in Hos 8:13.

The CD-Rom version, however, has been very disappointing. It's just a massive PDF with the entire dictionary scanned in. I guess that helps if you need to zoom in on the type to see what's going on, but the fact that they didn't even bother to put in a search option really bugs me. Really, aside from the zooming (and physical space issues, I guess), there's no reason to buy this on CD-Rom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea if it worked","review":"It took forever to \\"enroll\\" a fingerprint.

The ending I won't give away, but it is a twist no one expected.

I am a avid reader and do enjoy the O'Shaughnessy's books, but this one left me behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part of the book was 5 stars, but other parts only 3 stars","review":"There are various plot/story lines in this book. Some were very interesting, others only so-so. There was a lot of information about very high level math involving prime numbers. I admit that I skipped over some of the technical details, but I also did learn a few things. Most of the story kept my interest, but there was a big let down in the plot.Not to give anything away, but one person's 'reason' for committing a particular crime was just ludicrous. It made no sense at all and really detracted from the overall story. If the O'Shaughnessys could have made the motive more understandable and realistic, it would have helped the story in general. I am glad that Nina returned to Tahoe, but she needs to stay put for a while. There has been too much moving, changing of partners and jobs, etc. Settle down, girl.This was an OK book, but I know the O'Shaughnessy girls can do much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaky plot and premise","review":"I am a big fan of the Nina Reilly series; however, this one was not up to par. Overkill(pun intended) on both the math theory and the number of witnesses killed with our heroine standing right next to them. Dialogue and character development also not as stellar as we've grown to expect with this author(s)----some of it unfortunately sounded like a romance novel (albeit one of the better ones). Hopefully, next one will be up to the standard---haven't given up, but was disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly boring mystery","review":"I am a big mystery fan - mostly of the English variety. American mysteries are too action oriented , English mysteries are more interior. This book to my mind did not hang together, was improbable and really quite uninteresting except for increasing my understanding of prime numbers. I actually wound up skimming the last 4/5ths of it. I kept asking myself why I was bothering at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Plot & Reader","review":"I was terribly disappointed with this Audio book because of the plot and the reader. Laurel Merlington was a bad choice to read the book she can only do young American women accents. She butchered most of the male voices, the other older woman lawyer and all the foreign accents. It's clear she has never heard a German speak. The German girl's accent was annoyingly wrong.As for the plot, from the pointless foray into mathematics to the unlikely happenings; e.g. where did this unsophisticated, rather stupid shooter get money from to go to Germany and find the witnesses? Why wasn't Nina Reilly shot at the masseuse's parlor? Why would the shooter hang around a Lake Tahoe?Much of the book does not make sense. I am sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far, not one of the best in the series","review":"The longer this series runs, the less interesting it becomes. Nina seems to be increasingly reactive rather than pro-active. I guess I never quite understood why she pushed Paul out of her life and that action doesn't seem to have improved either her outlook on life or her ability to choose cases/clients in her own best interest. I finished this only out of respect to the time I've spent reading the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best book EVER","review":"this is the best book in the world! it is my absolute favorite book! sequal?? its just so awesome! great job! <3"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stay in the loop -- Always","review":"I do a fair bit of traveling for business, can receive requests from clients at all hours, and like to have a lot of information at my fingertips.

The screen is great, emails come through fast and I have no problem typing a quick email or text message with the keys. However, the microphone is super sensitive and picks up every bit of background noise. Plus, you have to keep the phone well away from your mouth or people will not be able to hear you. Many times people tell me it sounds like you are in a tunnel. In the car, the sound is worse. I am going to look at that new blackberry 8700 that Cingular now offers as a replacement.

The keyboard is a nice compromise between a full QWERTY and the basic cell phone number keypad. The predictive typing works well. The speakerphone is actually functional. However, there is one absolute show-stopper-- the screen is a piece of junk. Within one month, there were so many scratches on the cheap acrylic that i couldn't read my emails. I realized too late that you must keep it in the holster at all times or the screen WILL BE UNREADABLE. What was BlackBerry thinking???? FIND A NEW SUPPLIER FOR THESE SCREENS, RIM!!!!

It started acting up a week before warranty ran out--unfortunately, I didn't click to that, and I waited to see if it would work itself out. It just got worse.I had run down T-Mobile in this review previously, as they were not much help in this situation, but I am not sure that's fair. If the phone's out of warranty, it's out of warranty, you know? I was just frustrated. I've been content w/T-Mobile overall, though this instance wasn't resolved satisfactorily.Pretty good software, OK phone service, subpar keypad design. I see they've changed the keys on the 7105--maybe they changed some things for the better.

The phone is definitely weaker than standard T-mobile phones. I can be standing next to someone with a T-mobile phone and they have 4 bars and can place calls. At the same time and place, my 7100t gets one bar and cannot call or receive calls. This is the 4th 7100t that they have sent me and all have the same or worse problems. I have this problem in an area that T-mobile says is a great reception area, and have similar problems in the middle of big airports and cities.PDA limited but works. Only complaint is that several times each week the PDA does a hard reset in the middle of a call, which takes about 6 minutes to complete before I can use the phone again."},{"rating":"1","title":"as biased a book as a Christian could wish for.","review":"If you want to live in a sealed Christian world this book will leave you soothed and intact. Your views will not be challenged and you can bask in the reassurance that the only opinions worth having are Christian ones. This is a deeply biased and intellectually impoverished book. His pronouncements on the scientific world view were cringe-making. It was laughable to find him cribbing from other \\"introduction to philosophy\\" books like Will Durant's work, as the foundation for his own introductory book. Such is the shallowness of Sproul's scholarship... a first year undergraduate could have done better research.This book willl be of no use to any one serious about studying philosophy. At best it might serve as an intro reader in conservative Christian high schools."},{"rating":"1","title":"Using Philosophy to defend Christianity","review":"This is a good book for a Christian Fundamentalist that is looking to use Philosphy to support their beliefs rather than challenge. My take is that the Consequences of Ideas for Sproul is how ideas potentially lead you away from fundamentalist beliefs. For example, his simplistic refutation of Darwin represents a cliche of Christian thought of the 20th Century.I don't recommend this book one based on its method and also based on its constant errored summaries. For example, page 163, on his treatment of Nietzche: \\"The will to power may be link to modern paradignms such as people's attempt to rise to the top of the pyramid, an adult version of \\"King of the Hill\\"\\". That is not what is Nietzche was saying at all and is completely inaccurate.Philosophy is so much more than what Sproul has given. We can actually learn from the critiques of the history and use them to open our mind rather than close it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For school but very easy to read","review":"I don't know if you'll use it for school or not but it's an easy read, very informational and definitely a good book (i'm using it for class)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, Challenging, and Informative","review":"This book has really helped me understand how philosophy and great philosophers from the past have shaped the world. I know that philosophy is usually a very hard thing to grasp and is usually way over my head, but R.C. Sproul is VERY THOROUGH in his writings. I understand the abstract concepts he is discussing and he makes the connections between different ideas and very clear and logical. I have never understood philosophy as well as I do after reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories and musings of Yellowstone","review":"Before becoming the most prolific of Yellowstone's historians, Paul Schullery was a seasonal interpretive ranger in the park. This charming memory of these days has somehow managed to escape being outdated in the 25 years since its original appearance.Schullery combines reminiscences with musings about Yellowstone and its people. He ponders the tourist experience, life as a ranger, the meaning of wilderness, and much else besides. Even when admitting a bit of criticism into his musings, Schullery remains too good natured not to see the best side of Yellowstone and its visitors. Indeed, he can be criticized for thinking too well of the park service, tourists, campgrounds, RVs, and much else besides. (Though he doesn't like RVs either.)This would be a great book to have in your suitcase when visiting Yellowstone. Read it in a rocking chair at Roosevelt."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I'm going to embalm you.\\"","review":"Not what I had hoped for, this film barely classifies as a slasher film; you can count the number of victims on one hand, with a digit leftover! The plot plods along in no hurry to get anywhere. There's little in the way of suspense, no fright. The pacing is way off; most scenes feel as if they're skipping a beat, trying to be something they're not. There's no great secret who is doing what and why. The villain is standard fare, employing the usual affectations: wild eyes and a crazy grin. Even the ending is lazy. For me, this was a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible learning guide!!","review":"This book is layed out perfectly.

The thing that strikes me now --after having gone through a big spiritual inner migration, including becoming a Born-Again Christian, myself-- is Watts falling away from the Episcopal Church. Wonder what his sentiments would be today? Also, his account of increased awareness in metaphysics and burgeoning use of psychedelic drugs in the early to mid 1960s makes me wistful. Still a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Perry still has the touch!","review":"Angels in the Gloom continues the saga of the Reavley family and the deaths of their parents, the mystery of a treaty that could have changed the course of history, and graphic scenes of WWI front lines. This book centers on Joseph Reavley, a chaplain, who is wounded and is sent home to recover. We see the homelife in WWI England, and the horror of attacks in London. Mrs. Perry is an expert in the history of the Victorian Era and the era of WWI. Everything is succinct and not a word frivolously wasted.This new series is as satisfying as her other works.Makes me think of Wilfred Owens' poetry about England at war -touches the heart and puts you in the trenches with the poor soldiers and the staff.One hopes Mrs. Perry doesn't forget Monk and Pitt series - while developing this excellent series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality of plot and writing continue their downward trend","review":"I found this book, and the other 2 in the series, to be poorly written. I have enjoyed her both her Pitt and Monk novels, but this series seems almost to be by a different author. I find the style in which she 'hides' the identity of the Peacekeeper and his associates to be particularly annoying. The action seems to consist of people driving back and forth, and thinking, and changing their minds, and thinking more. There does not seem to be much investigating- just suspecting someone for a while, then suspecing someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long but very good","review":"Robert Young gives a great performance as a rich young man who has a difficult time escaping his upbringing. Hedy Lamarr is very good in a rare role that plays down her beauty as the city girl who doesn't want to give up what she had to fight to get as a woman in business. There is a great supporting cast with Charles Coburn as Robert Young's father. There are some very profound observations on life and what you expect of your children when they age. It is a long film but keeps your interest along the way. Similar in design to Citizen Kane as a retrosective of one's life but not nearly as cynical. If you are a fan of Robert Young or Hedy Lamarr it is a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought two - Both have blemishes ;/","review":"They work well, really well.. you can even cook in them.. but both of mine have noticeable blemishes! ..And one is a gift for my mother-in-law.. yikes!

And as with anything the neo cons try to sell you (see the Weekly Standard, Commentary magazine or anything written by Richard Perle or Robert Kagan), this is more propaganda than it is fact. This book was clearly written to promote a war that this small, but influential political faction have been pushing for since the early 90s.If you want a CONSERVATIVE perspective on all this, pick up Pat Buchanan's \\"Where the Right Went Wrong\\" or the recently released book from Scott Ritter.

One example is provided on an approach to converting images to black and white but no mention of the literally dozens of ways to do this and the many after-market action sets by Kubota and others to make this easy and efficient.Strongly suggest anyone getting into wedding photography or making the transition to digital from film purchase first the excellent book \\"Digital Wedding Photography\\" by Glen Johnson. Then fill in the gaps with books such as Bambi's - though I believe her 2000 book was better than this latest one which is largely a cosmetic makeover."},{"rating":"1","title":"First book much better","review":"I returned this book after the first read. As a new wedding photographer I admire Cantrell's style and her first book was excellent, thus I had high expections for her second book which covered digital wedding photography.

The explanations regarding equipment, dealing with the wedding couple, pricing, are vague and the explanations tired and repetetive, and many of the photos are out of focus and grainy. Definitely not of the quality and caliber of her first writing endeavor.

Alot of the pictures look amature at best, and the use of Nik filters on alot of them just does not look right.The print is a so so job, alot of the pictures look like blobs, but then again that might be from the original photo.I can only recommend this book if you find it on sale for under $9."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I have her other book, the Art of Wedding Photography and it is simply amazing.As far as the previous idiot reviewer - it's obvious you're not a pro or a photographer of any sort to even talk about Bambi's work.

Many of the photo examples in the book show technical problems (out of focus probably the most common one), along with a lot of hokey post-processing like colored flowers on a desaturated background. Lots of filter use, lots of infrared, lots of (maybe even excessive) camera tilt, cross processing - all of these \\"techniques\\" were already in use before digital, so there's nothing new here, really. The main problem, however, is that this book doesn't go into much detail of how to actually do most of these effects digitally. It just shows you what a certain piece of commercial software can do. In short, this book is really just a thinly veiled sales brochure for certain brands of gear and software, and not an impressive one at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best wedding photography book","review":"Great advise on both technical and artistic aspects of wedding photography as well as planning and logistics.

If your'e interested in other ActiveX technologies (compund documents, clipboard etc)- go elsewhere. Anyone serious about DCOM programming should gain some theoretical knowledge about 'how things work under the hood' and this book is excellent at that.

Most of the tricks work pretty well and aren't complicated to perform. I would recommend this set with 2 caveats:1st - Despite its rating for ages 4+, I would not recommend this to any child under the age of 6. The materials are made of thin cardboard and are a tad delicate, and just the concept of \\"performing a magic trick\\" takes a bit of developmental maturity that would not be typical of any 4 year old that I know. My 7 year old loved this set and in my opinion, was of the correct age to handle this set autonomously.2nd caveat - The makers are really \\"pushing it\\" by saying there are 10 tricks. I would say there are 8 tricks at best - unless you count \\"blowing on your magic wand to make it roll\\" a real trick. Plus they count making something disappear, and re-appear as 2 different tricks with the same magic drawer. It's really just 1 trick. In sum, its a nice intro to magic - with 8 (not 10) tricks, for 6 yrs and older."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a 5 year old","review":"My grandson who is almost 5 loves his first magic set.

Some of the changes discussed include decision-making which involves teachers, restructuring time in the schools, organizing staff into teams, creating smaller schools, using authentic assessments, providing opportunities for continuing professional development, and creating standards for student learning.

The book caught my eye because of its topic of baseball, a topic in which I am highly interested in because I also play baseball. The book is about a baseball player named Roy Hobbs. He is The best there ever was but he did not get to play in the majors until he was in his thirtys in a time when people died at the age of 50. He was a baseball player who was a natural at the game of baseball. He used a bat that he made himself called wonderboy, and he would not use any other. As a baseball player he is plagued by many slumps that hje cant get out of until he snaps out of it. I personnaly have not seen the mvie but i hear that it is a good watch.

If you want to read a good story, skip it. The author toys with the reader (or allows the reader to fool themselves) by making you think this is going to be a boy is good, bad thing happens, boy turns bad, man redeams himself story.

When you finish the last five pages you will be thinking the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"considering the fame of this novel, I had the right to expect something more instead of a silly plot (very predictable and full of cliché) and a not particularly interesting style.

It seemed a sports fans pornography. It described women's bodies in such an obscene way that it could make anyone blush. The use of sex to rush out of real life for Roy Hobbs was revolting and extremely dissatisfying. Bernard Malamud made it seem as if a baseball players life is all sex and money. I find this book unsatisfying and an utterly gross picture of the way Malamud describes life. The fantsies of these women were shown as carefree and a perfectly good thing. If one likes to read about sex then, this book would be a wonderful piece of disgusting and defiling literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic...but a very sad classic...","review":"Wow...was I wrong! Having seen the movie years ago and (I know I am in the minority) not loving it, but at least feeling happy with the end, I assumed that the book was somewhat similar. The book is so very sad, but if you read (and you should), you will see that it stays true to Malamud's viewpoint all along. The ending fits. There is much symbolism and good vs. evil and all that good stuff. In the end, it is an American tragedy, I think. A nicely written and very sad look at sport. And one that is still relevant today."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book!","review":"This is a book that every fan of baseball should read. The movie made from this book was wonderful too but the director changed many things from the original story to give it a happier ending. Malamud's classic tale of Roy Hobbs is about good vs. evil and desire vs. temptation. Sure, the book may be dark, intense and even tragic but one must remember that it wasn't written with Robert Redford and Glenn Close in mind! I believe the book was written in the 50's which, along with The Mick, Joltin' Joe and our other baseball heroes, also brought us corruption, McCarthyism and a strict social and moral order. The book is the great \\"American Tragedy\\" and should be a must-read for everyone who truly loves baseball fiction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"say it ain't true","review":"Do not come to this book wanting to read it if you are a big fan of the movie.

The Natural, which is about a baseball player, named Roy Hobbs who was a nobody that turns into a bona fide star, is a novel that's suitable anywhere from a pre-teen to an adult. The novel has rivalries, women, slumps, losing streaks, and corruption, just to name a few. It has a shocking ending that doesn't end well for Roy Hobbs. Most importantly, The Natural has a great flow and the novel keeps the reader's attention. For the people that aren't into sports or into baseball in particular, you will still find this book easy to read and enjoyable. It's one of the better sports novels written in the 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply one of the best I have ever heard!","review":"Simply smashing! A number one success!

Having seen the movie before reading the book, I am amazed at the contrast. I was unable to care about the book Roy Hobbs because of his apparent incurable stupidity, inabiltiy to learn from his mistakes, and ultimatly his failure. His unfailing self-centeredness is annoying, and the use of dream imagery is boring and distracting.

It lacked the mythic and Arturian aspects of the film. Roy Hobbs is a coarse, unpleasant and not too bright character whose downfall is painful to follow. After finishing the book I felt the urge to take a shower, there was a feeling of being defiled, and certainly saddened by this account of a unfulfilled and wasted life. For once, a film adaption was better than the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother, watch the movie instead","review":"this is one of those rare instances in literary history when a film adaptation of a book is far more complex and inspiring than the book ever hoped to be. The addition of the Glenn Close character as having been a childhood sweetheart tied the film together with respect to Roy and her relationship much better than Malamud did. Roy's character is a shallow and selfish man who doesn't know a good thing when he sees it. The film's Roy at least has a sense of what is right and wrong(in some areas of his life). My advice to anyone is to enjoy one of the best movies ever made and forget about the The Natural by Bernard Malamud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Baseball Book Ever!","review":"This is absolutely the worst baseball book I ever read.

However, it has been a disappointment from day one. Even three sheets taxes it and slows it down. It jams easily, and the reverse function only clears about half the jams. To clear the rest, you must unplug the shredder, lift off the _very_ heavy lid, and meticulously dislodge every tiny piece of shredded paper, which can take 10-15 minutes. It is difficult to place the shredder lid back on the canister.

Sure, it's a bit idealized, but it doesn't fall into the trap of cliche. Literature and films about psychologists or psychiatrists usually fall into one of two overworked tropes: the therapist turns out to be crazy, or the therapist ends up seducing the patient �?and even when these are avoided, the whole notion of patient-therapist boundary is ignored. Rossner's interweaving of the back story of the therapist with the story of the therapy is nicely done, with both characters shown to be human and fallible, and the therapist for once is actually competent and insightful. As a psychiatrist myself, I find it refreshing to read something about my field that is not just soap opera clearly written by someone who has no idea of the subject. It's very rare. Rossner nailed it better than anyone else I can think of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting topic, poor writing","review":"This is an easy and pleasant read for those who are interested in fictional presentations of psychoanalysis. But a deep novel it is not, nor is the psychoanalytic process presented in a realistic way.

Dawn the 'patient' has got to be the most aggravatingly uninteresting character...you as the reader cant care about her dreams, her lithographs, her childhood, her aunt, her boyfriends...in fact I even started resenting her appearance on the pages ... and skipped whole chapters devoted to to damnably boring Dawn.The only redemming feature of the book is the superb characterisation of Dr. Lulu Shinefield...especially when she is shown to be vulnerable in love...the insecurities of an ageing woman...but thats IT.

This is a wonderful book for anyone who wants to deepen their knowledge of Mary on a personal, familiar level.

This deliriously catchy album has funk written all over it, with killer grooves & beats, and very cool singing & rapping from Rob. The head-bobbing hits \\"Connected\\" and \\"Step It Up\\" alone are worth the price of admission, but MAN, there are so many fly tracks on this album: \\"Ground Level,\\" \\"All Night Long,\\" \\"Playing With Fire,\\" \\"Creation,\\" and \\"The End,\\" just to name some. When it comes to dance pop, there's nobody that comes close to the Stereo MC's in catchiness, intelligence and studio expertise. \\"Connected\\" will definitely fit the bill if you need music to cruise down the highway to, or to get down with your bad self at a mixer or in private. Party on, Stereo MC's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just slightly ahead of their time","review":"Where are they now? This album was outstanding; probably their best! I guess I'll have to settle with Black Grape as the best party band from the UK until the MC's come back (which, I've heard, they will). Jamiraquai and Big Audio Dynamite are very good.

But it's all the same. Soft hiphop, slightly electronized, and with the interesting, kinda deep and electronic-sounding, lead vocals. All through the album. Buy a single instead, that's enough by far.When Stereo MC's do their best, they try to sound like LL Cool J, or like Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five, as on 'The End'.

After all, with more and more people 'living' online, it doesn't seem far fetched that the distinctions between online and offline communities (and their resultant challenges) would become increasingly blurred.However, this book utterly failed to deliver. While I kept expecting some inventive plot twist or thoughtful character development, what I got instead was embarrassingly adolescent writing and complete predictability.I can't even label this book as a guilty pleasure, since there was no pleasure in reading it, and the only guilt I feel is that I didn't recycle it after the 2nd or 3rd chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Clancy's name is used to sell this book, but it's not written as well as other books he's been involved with.

However, when I bought the book I failed to read the small print and assumed the book was written by Tom Clancy.

Even though I finished the book, I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read that encourages independent thought","review":"Cybernation does a good job of anticipating future questions that may arise with the growth of technology, specifically problems with the Internet & intellectual/corporate rights. They don't answer the questions for you though; which encourages the reader to think a bit.This book is interesting and an easy read. It has good character development. Cybernation deals with both the character's work lives and their personal lives which allows the reader to better understand them. Action scenes are primarily centered on the martial arts and are strewn throughout to keep your attention. I did not read the first five books of the series, but was able to understand and enjoy this book thoroughly.I'd highly advise this book to anyone just getting into cyberpunk or anyone interested in computers and possibilities of the Internet who doesn't have a lot of technical knowledge to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Premise","review":"Tom Clancy offers an interesting premise in this book, and a pretty good read.

Please note that the author of this book is Steve Perry, not Tom Clancy, and it is not up to par with the works Clancy is known for.The story line is very simplistic and they characters are very one dimensional. About 50 pages from the end you could predict the ending with a good degree of accuracy.If you haven't read any of Clancy's books (the ones HE wrote), then pick one of those up. This one isn't worth the time or the money. Too bad 0 stars isn't an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cashing in on a name","review":"I won't spend too much time on this since this book was so bad. Clearly the Net Force series (and presumably OpCenter and the other Clancy franchises) is meant to be a cash cow. My guess is that Clancy probably pays a flat fee to some writer trying to break in, puts his name at the top with an apostrophe S and then pockets all the royalties. The result? A book that suffers from all Clancy's shortcomings without any of the redeeming qualities. The characters are not believable and not well-developed. The dialogue is cliche ridden and hackneyed. And the plotting lacks any of Clancy's gift for intricacy and technical detail.I only picked this up in Kuwait or Kandahar or somewhere because I ran out of books to read (Amazon came to the rescue a few days ago).

Whenever they watch it, I make sure to leave the room!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur effort with redeeming qualities","review":"The idea is good, but the charm is missing. Mediocre animation, decent plot but poorly carried out, actors that sound like they're reading the script (a badly written script...). For most people involved in its making, their movie experience is extremely limited--in several cases (especially with the actors), this is the only film in their experience at all. In short, not a true sequel to the original. But they get an E for effort, with a few highlights with creative ideas of what happens to little fairies when they get mesmerized by the world of a human carnival and forget about their true mission in life: to protect living creatures. It is a clean film which promotes good values and has nothing inappropriate for young viewers. Songs are so-so, even if they might be a bit catchy in tune.

Maybe that's not a big deal for someone who is 2 or 3 years old, but anyone older will roll their eyes at this film.I'll list a few of these below:Spoilers.........The poacher keeps the baby animals in sacks overnight when he has cages available.Batty has hands sometimes and one claw other timesBatty is strong enough to carry and lift a human being with his wingsThe fairies can only cause small sprouts to grow in some parts of the movie but in other parts can cause huge plants to grow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"My entire family loves FernGully, but not a single one of us cares for FernGully 2.

If you are like me and try to hold the phone on your shoulder while you work and talk, it will just slide out from under your ear. Third, charging this thing is next to impossible.

In fact, this was one of the best Fidelma mysteries. As always, Fidelma is positively Holmesian in her deductive abilities, and she is a much more multi-faceted character than the illustrious Mr. H. Also, Tremayne always creates memorable characters, both the foils and the criminals, and, for the most part(certainly here), cracking good mysteries.

Function is put as an emergent quality, a something more than a mere sum of its parts. The ideas expressed in this book had great influence on the research methods and expositions in biology and medicine and have since extended to all systems studies.

Harold Shea and his friends are pure delight, if a tad naive by today's standards. These characters do what we all do in our imaginations and insert themselves into the myths and stories of history. Sure, these are reprints -- the originals were serials in pulp magazines. I own several editions and reread them every few years.

It's a one of a kind masterpiece that all movie goers as myself will appreciate of it's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good film, terrible DVD","review":"Most of the reviews posted here unfortunately review the film, not the product for sale. Little else can be said about Battleship Potemkin, Eisenstein's masterpiece and one of the crown jewels of cinematic history. With all this positive karma, one would think that such a film would get a decent DVD release.Unfortunately, Battleship Potemkin does not. Granted, the film itself is wonderful, and one of my all time favorites, but this DVD transfer does not do it justice. The famous musical score, banned in many countries at the time of its release, is absent, replaced with a tinny, bombastic score composed thirty years after the fact. The Odessa Steps sequence has also been severly mangled, omitting many of the shots which stuck in my mind the first time I viewed this film so long ago.Do yourself a favor and buy a good VHS copy of this film until a good DVD comes along, hopefully from a big-name group like Kino Video or Criterion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Think About It...","review":"If this film would never have been made there would not have been Citizen Kane, Casablanca, or The Godfather.The answer is in the \\"language\\".Sergei Eisenstein created modern film language as we know of it today. That language was the daring juxtaposition of images as a series of montages to create narrative flow. Furthermore, for first time in the history of film, it created a feeling of intimacy for us the viewer to the characters and story on the screen. This intimacy was heightened for dramatic effect by Eisenstein's creation of closeups and varying camera angles on the subject matter.We owe modern filmmaking to Sergei Eisenstein, who's ideas have stood the test of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very low quality DVD","review":"An extremely low quality DVD.

Now that it's available on dvd, I have that version too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Empire 5 Star 500 - #47","review":"What is your favorite revolution? Everyone should favor at least one. Look into history there have been so many. The Mexican Revolution,Boer Revolt,Pitchfork Uprising, or perhaps The Days of Rage? Take your pick. They are all good including all events leading up to the Russian Revolution. For director Sergei Eisenstein it was specifically an uprising that took place in Russia in 1905. Battleship Potemkin is a film based on the revolution that happened on the boat of the same name in 1905. Einstein documented the uprising in brutal and bloody detail in the film Battleship Potemkin setting the standard for many films, if not all, to come. This film came out in 1925 and is more interesting than most movies in the theater today. If you are interested in watching a classic silent film this is the one to check out. Another film directed by Sergei Eisenstein is Alexander Nevsky. Check that one out as well. Both of these films mean serious business."},{"rating":"2","title":".............","review":"If you are a lover classic films, or just films in general, and you don't have this movie on your list of favorites,well I seriously suggest you do some reavaluating. Lets put it this way, unless your favorite film was made before 1925, without Bronenosets Potyomkin it probably would not be around today, period. No other film next to Citizen Kane have ever influenced the medium so greatly. In retrospect, viewing the film today might leave you wondering what all the fuss is about. Today much of the impact is lost due to our peace of time and development of technique. In fact many of the films scenes may seem, if nothing else, cheesy (the preacher waving his cross in all his stereotypical glory). But there are still just enough moments of sheer power (the Odessa steps, maggots in the meat) to lift it to a new level of intesity. But regardless of wether it is one of the \\"best,\\" Potemkin will always be one of the greatest, and thats based on impact alone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh air","review":"In a day and age when all seems dim and confusing, this book sets out a clear path back to solid ground and fresh insight."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this syrup !!","review":"This is by far the best caramel sauce for making carmel lattes.

We would listen to this CD together on long car rides or late into summer evenings on a veranda overlooking the city of Chicago, smoking cigars and taking in the pulse of the night. What is so special about this particular CD is that the balance of the variety of the songs mirror the ups and downs of a relationship when you share the CD with a partner. While enjoying this aspect of the CD the listner is also exposed to a wide spectrum of quality artists and songs - A great introduction into jazz that can serve as a platform for further development and exploration.

If you haven't seen it, by all means buy it. However, for those who have this or have seen it, be aware it's a fullscreen, crappy transfer. If you already got this prior to this release, save your money. You tape or dvd-r is probably better than or at least equal to the pic quality of this release. Same washed out colors, but now also \\"blocky\\" due to el cheapo dvd transfer. If you've never seen this movie before, this is an ok first way to see it, but it's no improvement on what has been floating out there for years on vhs and dvd-r. I'd say Cheezy Flicks puts out sub-par stuff based on this and the handful of previews of their other releases on this disk, many of which are fake widescreen. Meaning they're fullscreen with black bars across the top and bottom covering up the picture to try to fool idiots that it's widescreen.

I also watched it on a B&W televison set (yes, i'm THAT old). After years of trying to find it, I finally did on Amazon.com. It's all here, just as I remembered it. To my surprise, it was in color. This is ne of those movies that points out just what type of trouble people can get themselves into for being curious. A alien ship at the bottom of the sea is something to avoid, not go poking around in. Well, that what a few people did in this classic film, and they walked way (or should I say, swam away) with an unpleasent surprise. All hell breaks lose when a violent aliens starts ripping apart an undersea base and dead bodies are left in the creatures wake. No blood, no gore. But, alot of classic Sci-Fi fun.

Purchasing an alarm as an alternative to medication was highly recommended by our pediatrician. Prior to this point we have tried no liquids several hours before bedtime, waking him up in the middle of the night, etc. Needless to say, we were cautiously hopefull. Unfortunately, the alarm has been very inconsistent. Some nights the alarm sounds, and I am able to assist my son to the bathroom, other nights he wakes up with a wet pull-up and the alarm hasn't made a peep all night. This has been frustrating primarily because my son began to make progress in response to the alarm and started getting up on his own when the alarm sounded. At one point, he was even dry for a period of five days. The inconsistency of the alarm has really hampered progress and we are looking into a more reliable product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dri-Sleeper - Poor Quality!","review":"I purchased the Dri-sleeper for my son hoping it would help him. We told him how much this would help him and it barely worked for 3 days. He was unbelievably upset at how it failed over and over. I realized the main unit had an intermittent connection and tried to explain it to the help line. They kept insisting the main unit was fine and only the sensor needed replacement. In fact they repeated the line from the on-line documentation stating \\"the sensor is a wearable item and should be replaced from time to time\\". Are you kidding!! How ridiculous is that! I repeated that the main unit had a specific fault condition but the help line would NOT replace it. At this point we do not have a functioning bed wetting alarm for my son.

We got the Dri Sleeper Excel and the first night that he wore it to bed, he got up at night to use the bathroom before the alarm even sounded.

His bedwetting problem was literally cured overnight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roman Britain and the English Settlements","review":"Although this is an old edition (1936!), this book on Roman Britain and the early English kingdoms, is, as they say, an oldy but a goody.Very well written and researched, and with abundant detail from leading Roman and Anglo-Saxon scholars of the day, this text is still a great read for those interested in the subject of the collapse of Roman Britain and the early development of the \\"English\\".However, much of the information contained here has been (but only recently)superceded by modern scientific research on what happened in Britain after the Roman administration left Britannia in 410AD.

The implication of this book is that if you are not using a Hasselblad you are out of tune. I would suggest instead that the writer join the modern world.Secondly, I was disappointed by the rambling style of the discussion. I know it is likely my professional bias, but I wanted a comprehensive table of contents with a thorough discussion of each point.

The character actors take over this film because it is a film and not just a \\"movie\\".

It is an interesting character study and it is the story of a family and how outside influences can bring a family to disperse over time when their world begins to fall apart around them.The story is told in retrospect by the youngest son and child, and is viewed through his eyes as his family changes and his hometown and surrounding valley in Wales is irrevocably changed by the coal mine that dominates the life of the village and the valley in which both exist.The end of the movie is heart-wrenching, showing the love of a father to his youngest son, who at this point represents his entire family.

John Ford directs from the Richard Llewelyn book and there's fine acting from Donald Crisp (the father) and Walter Pidgeon (the local minister). Perhaps young Roddy McDowell's performance is a bit too sympathetic, but this is a coming of age film.The story is set in Cywm Rhonda, the famed Welsh coal mining valley. Despite the gorgeous cinematography and a soundtrack just full of fabulous Welsh men's choral singing, \\"How Green Was My Valley\\" is a real tear jerker, almost infinitely sad. No good milestone in young Huw's life is untouched by grief. You'll smile in places, as when Ty Bando gives the ghastly schoolmaster a boxing lesson, but mostly you'll cry, starting about 15 seconds in, and lasting until the last moment.

I must have been distracted. What a disappointment! I thought I was ordering a theatrical version - a play as I had seen it in 1978. Instead, it's an orchestral version with narration. If I want the music, I'll just order an audio. I can't see that this version does any justice either to the music or to the play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts well but goes flat","review":"I read this book some time ago and very much enjoyed the first chapter.

It's hard for me to review this book without succumbing to the familiar cliches of \\"inspiring,\\" \\"moving,\\" \\"breath taking,\\" etc., because, well, that is exactly what this book is.Many of the photographs have corresponding text to describe what is happening; though such text is informative, it is also often incidental. These pictures are so crisp and so clear that they really don't need much description. My own personal favorite photo is the one of about a dozen monks sitting at a table in full ceremonial attire and performing a solemn ritual blessing on the food they are about to eat. What is so endearing about the picture is that each monk has a can of Coke sitting next to his plate. So exotic and other worldly . . . and yet so down-to-earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not entirely as expected, but still has some use.","review":"Our first newborn is about to arrive so I bought this based on the previous reviews.

The manufacture was not willing to work with us about a discounted replacement etc. The spa, when working, is fantastic. the jets are strong, the heater worked well.

The author paints an objective picture, but also manages to add emotional poignancy to a very thorough historical account.

An excellent work."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS THE WRONG PICTURE!","review":"This item has the wrong picture. The picture is of rerailer with terminal.

Those speakers do produce high frequency sound, but the mid range somehow got weaker, so it lacks in warmth which FPS1800 had. The bass is pretty good, though it's not as puchy as home audio sytem. Overall, the sound is very powerful (who needs more than 100watts for computer speakers?), and 7 point sourcing in gmaes works very good especially considering its price.

The diagrams on the box are misleading if one assumes that one can build any of the track layouts without any previous 18\\" radius track layout. Generally, I really like Bachmann products. The nickel-silver E-Z track concept is unequalled. The ad should clearly indicate that this is an add-on if the prospective buyer already has a compatible 18\\" radius set up. I understand what \\"expander\\" implies. It is not readily apparent, however, that one needs to have already purchased a few hundred dollars in 18* radius track."},{"rating":"2","title":"As a Professional And A Mom I highly recomend this tape!!!!","review":"I am A registered Nurse and justhad my second Child. We recently bought Smart Baby and our 3 monthold was absolutely delighted. She was \\"gooing\\" through out the video and it really did soothe her. As a labor and delivery nurse I know first hand that the way this video was designed with contrasting color like red, white and black it was designed specifically for my infant. I know that infants can only see contrast not color so this video was perfect. It is very unique becuase it is the only video I have seen so specificall designed for the senses of an infant ( and believe me I have a huge stock of infant and children's video's)I give thisvideo and A+++.

While I'm sure a number of people are fond of percussion, I feel the composer and artists take the concept of \\"beat\\" to unacceptable extremes. The constant and overbearing drumming, pounding and thumping drown any melody which, from time to time, pops up in the amazingly clone-like selections. And it progresses from the merely annoying (to my ear) to the oppressive. My personal thought is that any connection between the music on this album and anything that might be considered anciently or eternally Egyptian is in the imagination of the creators: a more apt title might be \\"King Tut's Tomtoms.\\" Sorry to be so negative about this album, but I found the music boring and monotonously predictable and, after nearly 51 minutes, was immensely relieved to hear its last dying throb diminish into blessed silence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited duration","review":"This pen refill sadly runs out of ink all too quickly--especially given its price.

Most (all but one) of the group spoke only English while most of the children speak only Spanish or a few words in English. We used this book to put on a puppet show. The English part allowed our church members to understand the book so as to make the puppet show match the words. The Spanish speaker in the group read the book aloud to the children and the rest of the team acted it out with a few cute twists. The show went over well both times it was performed. Having a simple, bilingual story to follow helped greatly.

The stories contain nothing of any value. The characters are carefully crafted to destroy your child's ability to think, empathise, and imagine a world outside of their own.

Here's a clue: he who controls the media, controls the world. And he who controls CHILDREN's media really controls the world.

It doesn't -- in fact it works the opposite: I'm much more sleepy and less horny. It also made it harder to work out at the gym. I think it did have a relaxing effect, and my heart rate and blood pressure went down a bit, which would be good for some people, but is not the effect it is usually promoted for. I also think my dreams were a bit more vivid.Anyway, if you already are a high energy person, this is only going to slow you down, make it hard to get out of bed, and actually subdue your sex life.

I am not a fast reader, but this story and the characters in it were so engaging, I couldn't put it down until it was finished.So much happens in the novel. It is quick paced and consistently interesting. The novel has incorporated within it many unexpected literary treats such as a lewd saloon song contest, sappy poetry, ethnic jokes and excerpts from a western dime novel. You never know where the story is going to go.The characters and what happens to them resonated with me for days afterward. It is a gritty book, unflinching in its examination of how we handle aging, fading beauty, death and personal failure. The \\"American Dream\\" goes horribly wrong for many of us.Brenna examines interesting questions through four vividly imagined rather sleazy characters. There is much to like and dislike in all of them.A cleverly written, enjoyable and disturbing novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best field guide for North American seashells","review":"This little book was written long ago, back in the 60s, but it is still the best field guide you can buy for North American seashells of the East Coast, the Gulf of Mexico and the West Coast. It is also fairly useful for the Caribbean. I would go so far as to say it is one of the best, if not the best, shell guides ever written.The colored drawings are positioned opposite the relevant text, making it very easy to flip through. Every family included has an image of the live animals and a short description of where they live and how they live. Most of the colored drawings are really quite good in terms of how well they illustrate the species.The introductory sections of the book are interesting, although some parts are a little out of date. However you won't find better value than this anywhere: it is a complete education on shells in a small and convenient package."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Starter Book...","review":"I got this book along with the Golden Guide on Birds of North America (to replace my parents well-worn 1966 edition that literally fell apart from use.) I was looking for a book to help me identify my many seashells collected in Hawaii, Florida, & the Northeast. The book is great for teaching the beginner about shell structure & formation, as well as how to start cataloging your shells, & where to look for new ones. It's a great overall book but I find now with the many various guides I purchase, I am finding it easier to deal with books that contain photographs instead of drawings so I take off one star for that but this is a great little comprehensive guide for the beginner shell enthusiast."},{"rating":"2","title":"great basic book","review":"I gave this to my resident shell collector who loves it! The drawings are very realistic and detailed, which will make it much easier to identify shells. I like the compact size which will be great for the beach. It is a more advanced Golden Field Guide- something a bit more adult like in scope, but very usable for a child too. This was a great investment and I expect we will enjoy it for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"The guide to have","review":"This is, simply and easily, the best guide book for Ethiopia, and not just because the competition is weak.

It is truly encyclopedic, well researched, and written in an enjoyable style - one of the best guidebooks I ever used. This is certainly the most authoritative guide to Ethiopia on the market and I used it extensively during my visit to that country in October 2009. The wealth of information is impressive, down to extensive lists of accommodation, including many budget options, dining, nightlife and public transportation. The guidebook includes a comprehensive description of attractions across the country that are not even mentioned in similar guidebooks. A true gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensable Guide to Ethiopia","review":"I am planning my third trip to Ethiopia, and Philip Briggs' 4th edition of Ethiopia: The Bradt Travel Guide has proved to be indispensable. I have used his previous guidebook editions on my trips, and his information and tips are always exactly right.

The flip side is why not make a movie about being terrorized in an ATM booth/building with 2 young,strong men (to use the term so loosely) (?) and a pretty lady (who had brain and courage potential, but movie/director did not allow it). So they borrowed the fur trim hoodie dark winter coat from the terrorizer/serial killer from the film, URBAN LEGENDS, and added a senseless man who lives out of a storage garage to map out his next ATM victims. What got to me the worst is why did they park so far from the ATM in the first place in the dead of night on a below freezing evening??? This is just a bad horror movie with good young actors (I love Alice Eve) but the characters were non-logical and ready to be victimized.

Why didn't the bad guy try the front door? Why didn't they just run? They two-timed a good guy, so why not 3-time the bad guy?

First, all the songs sound great and as I expected but \\"One Tin Soldier\\" is the only one I question as to whether it's the original recording. It sounds close but I am not familiar enough with it to be sure. All the other songs sound to be true and original.

But when Owen Wilson is the best part of a movie... something's wrong.)I'm a fan of the entire cast - Reese, Paul Rudd, Jack, obviously - but their characters' huge flaws made them totally unbelievable.It's not funny.

These are terrible, hard to relate to characters who aren't likeable at all.

I saw the plot and it seemed like it would work... only 2 hours later by the time the credits were rolling, for me, it didn't work. I found myself struggling to even finish the movie. I even stopped a few times to do other things and came back to it. The script and lines, just didnt seem to flow and weren't genuine. Even a couple of unecessary F bombs, which was surprising for a PG-13 movie. The chemistry between, actually both on screen couples, Owen & Paul just didnt seem to be there.. Just a disappointment because with some tweeking to the script and other things, this movie could have had good potential at being really good. Sorry, can only give this romantic comedy 2 stars, thats for effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Opinion","review":"Disappointing, considering the acting talent. I'd say the plot was the stinker. Of the greatest value was Mr. Nicholson's performance. The hardest thing to account for was why would an athlete with so much going for her (played by Witherspoon) connect with anyone as shallow (and stupid) as the male athlete lead. Too implausible. And we should think the other male has a chance? He's such a weird looser. Looser gets some backbone with his father, but that doesn't seem to have much of any impact on his relationship with Withersppon. Seems like it's a movie of how to choose between losers."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Do You Know","review":"I enjoyed watching this movie. I like the actors that were gathered for the movie. They are all very good actors and each become the movie character, thus making the movie believable.

So why the one star? Simply put, because it was an awful film from start to finish. I felt like I had been dropped into the film after missing the first hour. Nothing was likable or explained clearly. How long has Reese been seeing Wilson? What did Rudd do at his fathers company? 2 of many questions I found myself asking. The story borders on tedious and almost ridiculous dialogue. Just wasn't very well thought out or put together. Even the actors chemistry felt strained for the most part. I dislike writing negative reviews, but having bought my mother this Blu Ray for Christmas (she did enjoy it), I felt like at least commenting that this film was no picnic to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars for the Plant, 1 for the Movie","review":"The only reason I'm giving this movie 2 stars instead of 1 was because of one scene. When the two characters, George and Lisa, are coming out of the hospital, my wife pointed out how there was a potted plant just randomly sitting on the floor of the revolving door. Somehow, just seeing this one lone plant go around and around in a circle struck us both very funny and we laughed, about the only time in that whole movie that we did laugh. The movie left so many things unfinished, and by the time it was over neither of us cared who ended up with who."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some characters great, some not so much","review":"Although the reviews here and the online rental place mostly bad reviews, I put the movie in my queue because I like all the actors. I don't mind at all that a movie slowly builds on it's characters but for me, I felt that George (Paul Rudd) really wasn't all that interesting or endearing enough to draw me in or to get the girl. The end is pretty obvious but still I was hoping for more to like about George."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really not worth it","review":"I was prepared to like this movie despite the tepid reviews; I like Reese Witherspoon quite a lot, and Paul Rudd is watchable even though he seems to play the same character in every movie (he seems capable, so someone should write a better part for him). But this movie was downright boring; even the actors seemed bored and listless in each scene. Owen Wilson may have had a bit of fun, but he was the only one. And Jack Nicholson was plain awful in his role as Rudd's father.I'm sorry, but this review is as boring and pointless as the movie so I'll stop here. I do blame the director and scriptwriter more than the actors, though.

I generally have a high tolerance for movies, even when they're bad. This was just insanely boring, if not painful to watch. Seriously, some of the dialogue made me wince. And character development is really lacking... you couldn't care less about what happens to them. I actually got up during the movie and made a 15 minute phone call in the hallway because it seemed a better use of my time.

If you want to view a movie that has a completely pointless screenplay, in-the-box acting to the point where everyone forgot their acting lessons, this movie is for you. If you want to literally waste 1.5 hours of your time when you could be watching dust particles float by, you have found the right movie. If this is a comedy-drama, I failed to see the comedy and the drama was misdirected. The whole time my wife and I looked at one another and asked, \\"Do I laugh now?\\" Sadly, Nicholson wasted his true talent and time on this tripe and stupid movie. Boring, inane -- instead of ripping off another studio's idea for a movie, Hollywood is now employing middle school teen girls to write screenplays.

I was disappointed in every aspect of it. From the lack of chemistry between Reesce and Josh, that at many times felt simply awkward, even in the final scenes. Reesce's character seems unbelievable and too hard edged for her. The funny parts were in the preview, and even some of those only seemed funny in the context of the preview, but in the movie....not so much.I expected it to atleast be somewhat funny, or heart warming or whatever it is I seem to get from my beloved array of cheesy chick flicks, but this one was a waste of time and money I hate to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame","review":"As said by another review on here,long boring movie about nothing.

Very Dissapointing. I have seen Cry Blood Apache, which is a great movie, but is also on almost every single Mill Creek Western collection out there. Do yourself a favor, and get theGunslinger Western Collection. This has two Sartana films, and is a much better collection, IMO. I almost forced myself to watch The Gunfighters, but I got sick of it within the first five minutes, maybe I can give it another shot, but the thought that i speant $4 on movies I already own is not appetizing. I watched Django Kill instead, and it was amazing! Look for it on theSpaghetti Western Collection.

Lippman carefully maps out a city every bit as complex as any of the human characters. If you like Peretsky's Chicago or Grafton's Santa Theresa, then you'll love the Tess Monaghan mysteries. While the ending is just a bit too pat, Tess and her city are very convincingly portrayed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberal Bias","review":"The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is predicatable as soon as the author reveals her liberal bias."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down in Little Rock","review":"After reading over half of this book I was wondering why keep going.

With only her adopted greyhound Esskay for company, she interviews her first client, an elderly black man, who has just been released from prison for the supposed accidental shooting of a boy, years before. He wants her to locate the children who were present when the shooting took place, in order to make financial restitution, but as Tess locates them, some of them die, under varied circumstances. The local press and the police are convinced that the former prisoner is responsible for the deaths, but Tess believes the man's story. Another side issue to this story is the appearance of a young, black woman who wants Tess to find her child who was given up for adoption many years before, and, in pursuing this case, Tess finds members of her own family involved. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and can't wait to get number 4 in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, great series...","review":"If you like your mysteries to be more than the cozy, sicky sweet variety, this series is for you.

While many of the solutions are simple, they are still beautiful. Great book if you love two and three move checkmate puzzles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book so far.","review":"As a thirteen-year old, I bought this book at Borders as part of my birthday money. It's a wonderful book on checkmating (maybe one of the bests). Although I'm only up to chapter two, the rest of the book will probably be good too.However, if I could have looked at every checkmating book on Earth, I probably wouldn't have bought this. For example, Fred Reinfeld's \\"1001 Brilliant Ways to checkmate\\", probably beats this book by a mile. It's slightly cheaper, I think, and has 698 more diagrams! (I haven't bought this book, but look at the reveiws for it, and you'll know why I'm saying this.)Even though this probably isn't the greatest checkmating book you can get, it's good enough, and will keep you busy. One more thing: I suggest that you get a used one, because if you want to use about $12.00 or so on a book, don't use it on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Puzzles -- But Are They Practical?","review":"This book appears to be a sequel to \\"202 Surprising Checkmates\\" by the same authors, and both books appear to be indebted to the much older \\"1001 Brilliant Ways to Checkmates\\" for their title. \\"1001 Checkmates,\\" by Fred Reinfeld, gives hundreds of positions which are apparently drawn from actual game situations, and the student who applies himself to the book can take away practical knowledge that will help in actual play. The positions in \\"202 Checkmates\\" and \\"303 Checkmates\\" could never be mistaken for actual game situations, and the mating patterns are not normally seen in actual play. Although the book appears to have little practical value, the problems were both challenging and entertaining. If the authors ever write \\"404 Amazing Checkmates,\\" I'll be sure to add it to my library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"If you like reading the same story over and over again than this is the book for you.

That is as far as I'm going to go with the praise because I thought this book was incredibly boring.Carin Goldburg it seems was captivated by the sepia illustrations in a fifties mail-order catalog and this book shows these images vastly enlarged, one to a page.

The first time I was talking and someone picked up another extension, the sound started chopping out and it and was almost un-intelligible. The phone does not use an AC charger or batteries, but is powered from the phone line.When another phone on the same line is picked up, the available power drops and the phone tries to shut off. It is a basic design feature. If you have any other telephones or devices plugged in to the same phone line, this phone will stop working while the other phone is off hook. That makes it unusable.Also, the Caller ID phone number is displayed without hyphens separating the groups of 3 and 4 numbers.

After receiveing a call the Message waiting light comes on and no other function works. You have to tap the receiver switch several times to clear the light and that is hit or miss to get the phone to work. Also the ringer is the same, after you receive a call the ringer no longer operates until the Message light is cleared.

One of them stopped working within five minutes.The sounds aren't really changed much and it really just makes a bunch of annoying noise.

($5 to send back, $7.99 to purchase). I love to shop on Amazon and typically look at reviews, but a product testing system and return policy like Costco has would make for a better experience for everyone.If manufacturers have faith in their products, they should always include a return shipping tag for easy returns.This product is crappy and not worth more of my time to package and ship - the result would still be me tossing $3 in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken out of box","review":"Not sure if just my bad luck but this was broken out of the box.

I thought it would be a lot of fun for the whole family. At the time it was $20 and I thought it would be well worth it. When it arrived it seemed cheaply made. When my kids and I tried to talk in it you could not understands the words we were saying. We tried talking with it several inches from our mouths and you could mainly hear our regular voices. When we put our mouths closer all the words were muffled. Luckily I was able to return it which cost me $5. I did see the Elf microphone by Hallmark the other day and it seemed to work better.

To me, it tasted like warm black licorice. I used only 1 bag for 24 oz water and by the time I got about 8 oz of it down, my belly started to bubble so I poured the rest out for fear I would see it again and I threw the rest of the box in the can.It is a 100 % natural herbal tea, just not for me.

Loved it at first....","review":"Bought this for a foster child, so she'd have athletic toys in the yard, and other kids would want to come play. It worked for those, and she loves to twirl and spin on it. I'd say it's great for building upper body strength, takes up a small area, and amuses children for 1-20 minutes at a whack (pretty good for today's child!).PROBLEM: the plastic handle is joined together by screw/bolts. These do not sit prettily together after some use and yesterday 2 neighbor kids got blood blisters using it when it pinched their fingers. Granted, one of them I will be happy not to have return, but I do not like toys that hurt children! I would return it, but the time just expired. Anyone know how to make contact with the company?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to install","review":"We have only had this for a few days. My six year old who has needed occupational therapy for fine motor skills and has been diaognosed as hyperactive loves it. I feel that it is good for building up the strength in his hands. I installed it in just a few minutes -- most of that time was spent looking for a limb of the right thickness and height in my yard. The first limb I selected was way too thick and put the Twizzler too high. Purchasers may want to take into account the thickness of the limbs they want to use as well as the height. Overall, this is a really a fun activity for my son."},{"rating":"1","title":"whoopdee do","review":"Oh my gosh ... I can't believe I wasted money on this.

He says it's totally awesome - what better review can a kid give than that? Yeah, the rope could have been longer, we did have to improvise by tying on an extra rope, but that wasn't that big of a deal. He twizzles, swings, does tricks, has a great time on it and it's gotten a lot of use. I don't see it as something he'll get bored with anytime soon.

It makes no sense why it could not come assembled. It is rubber banded together. We could never get the two pieces together tight with the screws. The two pieces slide just enough that it would pinch a hand that was holding it. We took out the screws and tried 3 different times to get it tighter. I am going to return it. It is a great idea though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, solid, needs more rope","review":"This is built good and solid and works well if you have the right size tree or balcony to hang it from.

It occupys her for hours on end. The handle is easy to grip for small hands and feels very sturdy. It has weathered well, even with our nasty rainy weather. My only gripe is that the rope seemed a skosh short. We weren't surprised by the length or anything, its very clear how much rope it comes with, just would have liked a couple feet more if it were available. It was just barley long enough to fit on the lowest branch of our tree. That aside, this stick on a rope is surprisingly entertaining!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite book","review":"My 3 year old grandson loves this book.

Richard Sharpe is sent into the storm to hunt down a britter English officer who has joined the forces of the Confederation.

More important, I learned so much about the behind the scenes wrangling that I didn't know. One dimensional? No way. She peered into people's souls. Did she streamline? Yes. And as a reader, I thank her. The point was the essence of a city in chaos, and she painted that portrait in gritty and riveting detail. It wasn't her job to make sure everyone in town got their name in her book. As for Hollywood, I don't think they'll have the guts to make this movie. There are no pat happy endings here and no easy answers. Just a story that I couldn't put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many Dangers I did Not Realize","review":"This is a big 400 page book that covers every possible way a child can become seriously injured. It is very easy to read with checklists and report cards and the end of each chapter. The author describes the specific hazards, how often the injuries occur, the fact that there are very little government regulations to prevent these things from happening. Although I've raised two sons and have one at home, I never realized the hidden dangers in toys, playgrounds, the neighborhood, schools. It was a real eye opener, and frightening, but the saving grace of the book are the things to look for and most importantly how we parents can prevent these hazards from injuring or worse, killing our children.

The scents are just luscious and you only need to burn the candle for a short period of time for your whole house to smell just lovely! I have been a loyal Trapp burner for many years now and cannot say enough about them. My favorite scents are Mediterranean Fig, Water, Orange Vanilla and Sweet Honeysuckle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm not sure what to do with this candle now. I let it burn for maybe five minutes but couldn't tolerate the smell. The fragrance is very sweet. It reminds me of pre-teen perfume/body lotion from the drug store: powdery, artificial, candy like and floral. For some comparison, I'm fond of the Pacifica candles. They're pretty straight forward, very fragrant, and effective. I was just looking for something along those lines: relatively inexpensive and pleasantly effective. I will say that it seemed to burn very cleanly and seemed to be a nice candle. I wish I could smell other fragrances in person, perhaps their lavender scent just isn't for me (I picked lavender because I thought it was a pretty safe route to go)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisinart is clearly coasting on their brand reputation","review":"When I first bought this toaster a couple years ago, I remember reading that if it requires warranty service, not only do you have to pay return postage but you also have to pay a \\"handling fee\\". I thought that was outrageous and set the instructions aside, intending to write a letter to Cuisinart to protest this. Never got around to it, not that they would probably care.It didn't fail under warranty, but less than 2 years afer purchase it's practically dead and I'll never buy another Cuisinart product again.

I noticed the reviews for this toaster and had to put in my two cents. I bought this toaster over a year ago at Bed, Bath, and Beyond. It has toasted unevenly (one side of the toast darker, while the other side hardly done) from the beginning. Since I do not use it every day, I have put up with this ever since. However, it has now progressed to not toasting the same on the identical setting. This requires adjusting it each time I toast the same bread type, as well as having to flip the bread around to get an even toast. Although, there were several negative reviews about it when I purchased it, I wrote them off as negligible (big mistake) because they were in the minority. However, it now appears from recent reviews that I should have abided by them. Cuisinart has not corrected the problems with this toaster. Given the price for this baby, it is a bad investment. It looks cool, but functions badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bread Burner","review":"Should have sent this back when I had the chance. Looks pretty,lots of controls, BUT toasts very unevenly in all slots. You can even see the difference in the redness of the heating elements.

It is only in the newly printed version, of course - not in the original. :-)As an amateur astronomer - a lunar observer in particular - I can heartily suggest this as not only a fun and interesting book to read but one where you learn of life in the past in the United States - a slower time but a time of great discovery and accomplishments, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best book on amateur astronomy","review":"There are many books out there on how to engage in amateur astronomy.

I mean, I'm taking an American Lit class and there are certain guidelines to poetry, right? Maybe if you said that was 'Art' then he could get by with stacking 'stars' and ending with a 'steer', but one wonders how long it took him to come up with that. A second? Did he get paid for that? If so, then I'm sending in some poetic art and should get paid as well. Also, I don't think we should stretch to find meaning in what we see. The examples you gave as to what the poem could mean were 'out there' to say the least.

I wore these in the day and in the night, and they didn't keep me or my clothing dry at all--and I'm not a heavy producer. They're bulky and uncomfortable under any bra. Another con is that you've got to wash them pretty much immediately to avoid that spoiled breast milk smell staining them for good.I wouldn't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too small","review":"I was unhappy with disposable nursing pads so I gave these a whirl. They are WAY too small, so any shifting at all renders them completely useless. I am a 38DD while nursing, so maybe these would work fine for smaller breasted women. I used them a few times at home then threw them in a drawer and haven't taken them out since. Too bad, because they absorbed pretty well the 10% of the time they stayed in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"I used these pads for a few months. I have barely any leakage, and they contain minimal amount of breast milk well. I wouldn't recommend for moderate or heavy milk flow though. The major problem with these is no curvature. They are flat and get dislodged constantly exposing the nipples. I leaked few times on cloths on the street as well at nighttime frequently. Lace on the back doesn't do anything to hold them in place. They are also visible under clothing. After several months of use the surface became rough, so they are becoming very uncomfortable. I wouldn't recommend these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Would be helpful for slight leaking but anything substantial ran over. Also the pads are visible even under a padded bra. Get something that contours to your breast instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not contoured and they stick to you...","review":"I bought these because I hate using disposables and adding to the waste problem. I'm sure there are better washable pads out there. These are completely flat and don't bend much to contour to your breast or nipple. They are super obvious under a thin bra or tank top. Plus, they stick to you--not horribly but still undesirable. I like the bag that comes with them but overall, I wouldn't buy this product again or recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I hate these nursing pads! They stick to your nipples and they don't absorb ANYTHING! The first time I actually used them I had to take a shower immediately after because I was a total mess. Do not buy this product!

These Avent washable pads are the BEST I've found. They are very absorbent and waterproof. They stay in place due to the lace cover. They do not show with the nursing bra I use - they just need to be placed high enough in the bra. Other washables I've tried either have no outer waterproof barrier or don't have enough absorbancy and therefore leak. I've just bought more Avent pads because they work so well for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I bought these thinking they'd be more cost effective than throwing away disposables AND the box says that they have a leakproof back. WRONG!!!! I put them in and nursed my son and BAM, in front of our guests, I leaked through the pad, bra, my shirt AND the blanket. I contacted Avent to discuss the fact that the box is VERY misleading and they never got back with me. Go ahead and buy the cheap disposables, they don't leak!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy!!","review":"I bought these thinking they would save me money instead of buying the disposable breast pads- they do not hold any leakage! I was constantly leaking all over myself, and my baby boy!! I highly recommend the Lansinoh brand disposable pads instead.

I'll have several let downs and not a drop will get anywhere but on the nursing pad. So if your let downs only produce a drop or two, I'd definitely get these washable ones...but keep the lanolin close by cause if you don't put some on you'll stick to the pad and pulling it off after you've had let down and it's dried is pretty painful.

They're so bulky that you can see them through clothing very easily. Because they are so small and don't stay in place well, they always seem to be just off to the side of the nipple whenever my milk lets down, so I end up leaking.

I bought them because they seemed like such a good deal. A friend had given me the Dr. Brown's washable nursing pads and I loved them and wanted to get more. The packages looked similar and you got two extra pads for less money than the Dr. Brown's. The catch--these pads were much too small! I wear medium-support style nursing bras with stretchy spandex cups so it matters what the pads look like underneath my bra and clothing. These pads made me look too weird so I could not wear them in public.

I tried Medela pads and they didn't absorb ANYTHING! The Avent pads absorb well and I didn't have leakage problems that other reviewers have had. My pads would get soaked and I wouldn't have wet spots on my shirt. They do move around within my bra, though.

I never planned that the pads should last all day/night, I tended to change pads at every feeding so I never ended up leaking through these. For \\"sticking\\", I had the same problem with some disposables; it happens when you leak and don't change the pad (and it dries, thus the sticking).

I wanted to avoid using disposable pads and purchased these pads based on the positive reviews of this product. I was totally disappointed. The pads are thick. They are so thick that they are so indiscrete when wearing them under shirts that aren't totally baggy. They're not that absorbant either. I would wake up at night soaked and be fearful all day long that I was leaking through my shirt. After a few weeks, I gave up and switched to disposable pads and I am much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Worth The Sale Price","review":"These pads are terrible. I used the Avent disposables which are the absolute best, so I thought their washables would be good as well. Well that was a big mistake. They curve outward instead of following the natural curve of the breast, making them visible under any type of shirt or sweater. I figured I could use them when I was home. Then I got tired of changing clothes from all the leaks I experienced. These pads don't absorb much at all. What I was saving on disposables, I was wasting on detergent and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"they stick :-(","review":"after a little leakage, they stick.The type of pad with a lining is much better.the laundry bag is a nice feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"The breast pads are soft and they absorb well. I still leak through the pads when my breasts are VERY engorged (but I think that would occur with any similar product)."},{"rating":"1","title":"They leak like crazy!","review":"I like the look of these, the lace on the outer layer is cute, but they don't hold moisture well at all. It's about as absorbent as a flannel burp cloth - if you leak more than a tiny bit, it'll go right through the pad. I used these at night occasionally because they're soft and they would keep the milk from running down my shirt, but my shirt would be damp after every feeding. They're also very thick, which makes them very noticeable under a shirt. If you want a great cloth nursing pad, get Bamboobies - they're way more absorbent, thinner, less noticeable, and cuter. Don't waste your money on these."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"These pads don't do the job at all. They barely absorb any milk. I even washed them several times thinking that maybe it would soften up the fabric and increase their absorbency. Milk seems to run off the pad and into my nursing bra getting me wet and leaving the pad dry. I would be satisfied if there were any sign that the pad was actually soaking up any milk, but there's not. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"they are horrible! they are bulky and don't stay in place. they leaked right through my bra, shirts and my baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"not absorbent, not contoured at all","review":"I bought these because they are more environmentally friendly than disposables however they do not absorb much so I always end up changing my shirt because it leaks through. I don't consider myself a heavy-let-downer at all (ie. the disposables never got saturated) so I was very disappointed. They are also very flat. A little contour would be nice, and make more sense because really, who's breasts are totally flat? The only thing I like about these is that they seem to wash well and come with a mesh bag, which is convenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Effective","review":"I guess these are for between feedings. While my son is nursing one side ,the other side is completely soaked and it looks as if i have no pad at all. These really did not help me and are a waste of money and time. buy the disposable kind or even better , use sanitary napkins with leak guard. At least they have sticky backs to keep them in place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best first set of washable nursing pads","review":"I wear these every day. They're thick and absorbent, and soft on my skin. I much prefer them over theNUK Reusable Nursing Pads, 6 Packwhich I bought at a local store to get me through until these came in. The NUK pads were too thin to be useful.If you care if they show and you wear form-fitting shirts these might show.Apparently I'm a \\"heavy leaker.\\" At night these pads are too small to stay in place as I toss and turn, though they are the standard size (a little over 3 inches in diameter). I ended up making myself some 5-inch x 5-inch square nursing pads to use at night.Nursing Pads Ekstra Style, Smalllook like they might be large enough, and LANAcare also has larger sizes. I can't use wool though.I ended up buying 3 sets of these, so I can wear a clean set partway through the day if necessary, a clean set at night, and not end up doing the wash every single day."},{"rating":"1","title":"decent","review":"The good...they're inexpensive and washable. They even come with their own bag to wash them in.The bad...These pads bunch up some when washed, are conspicuous when worn, move around in the bra and leak when worn overnight (I'm not sure if the milk is running past them or going through them). Also, if you put the pad back in your bra immediately after nursing without drying the nipple off or applying lanolin or something similar, the pad glues itself to the nipple which is very uncomfortable to peel off (you'll need to wet the pad to get it off comfortably)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money","review":"I bought several types of reusable nursing pads and these were, by far, the worst. They are not absorbent, not comfortable, move all over and just generally poorly made. The bag only held up for a couple washings.

They don't leak from the center but from around the edges of the pad. Every other pad has worked great for me but these. Also they are really thick, so they show under your shirt more than other brands. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"not absorbent enough","review":"I still leak with these. They aren't as absorbent as ones I bought on Etsy. Basically I only use them when I'm desperate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Options Available","review":"Wasn't impressed with the avent washable nursing pads for the following reasons:- material is non-absorbant- material is not as soft as other options available- pads stick to nipples- lace on the outside can be seen through bra/nursing tank- small circle creates a strange raised bump seen from outside"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse product I've ever purchased.","review":"I'm normally not one to write reviews, but this product was AWFUL. It arrived today and I put them on immediately. Within one hour the front of my shirt was soaked beneath each breast. My baby is only 5 days old, so it's not like I'm producing large amounts of milk. The pads did not absorb anything. Even when I poured some milk on them to test them, the milk just ran off the pad. I will stick with the disposable by Lansinoh from now on--they can hold milk for hours without leaking--even overnight."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess!!!","review":"These pads are too thick to use for any top that isn't baggy or a sweater. Additionally, they still manage to leak even as thick as they are! The Gerber disposable pads with liners (they come in boxes of 60) are much more effective. I hate adding to landfills, but I hate worrying about wet spots on my shirts for everyone to see even more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Medela pads are better","review":"I have a Bravado nursing bra, and the Avent pads are too thick and too small in diameter. They don't stay in place, they're bulky and they don't absorb as much as the Medela pads. I also don't like that they stick to my nipples, and that they have lace on one side so you can't flip them over if they get a little damp and you're not able to change them. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money to get the Medela reusables. I should also mention (as I wish that someone had told me as a new mom) that you tend to leak a ton at first, so the Lansinoh disposables are the way to go, then you can switch to reusables after a few weeks when you don't leak as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"better off buying something else","review":"These reusable nursing pads aren't worth getting at all. They don't absorb quickly enough and they don't hold anything hardly at all. My baby is 3 months old, and so it's not like there is any type of engorgement (except morning), and they can't keep up with normal nursing. Honestly your better off stuffing a burp cloth down your shirt than using one of these. I think I'd rather use disposables, because at least they work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"This is a total waste of money. It does not absolve any milk. I definitely would return it if I had not thrown the package away."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are nice!","review":"They feel great, better than the paper/disposable ones and I love the washing bag it gives you as well. The only con is that they look kinda lumpy at first in your bra, but I noticed once I have a shirt on it seems to form to it just fine. Very comfortable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Supposed to save money but are worthless!!!","review":"I purchased these pads thinking I would save money over the disposable. How wrong was I. I was fully aware of the bulkiness (visable through clothing) prior to purchase, so that wasn't the issue with me. I planned to wear them indoors only.These things don't even stop a minimal leak. They do not contour properly around the breast & slide especially when lying down. They also soak through onto my clothing. Maybe my minimal leaks are as someone else's moderate leaks. In either case, they don't suit me.The disposable avent, though as bulky at least absorb. I shouldn't have to change pads 6 times a day.For outside use, the Lansinoh brand disposable pads are MUCH better. They have greater surface area & can withstand actual leaks.If anyone can recommend a re-usable pad that acts like the disposable Lansinoh brand, please post."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"These do a good job keeping me dry during the day, but constantly move around at night, which is when I really need them."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy it","review":"very bad to usevery small nor cover the nipples at allnot comfortable it's too late i already used it and i don't theycan let me returned itdon't buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"better than disposables","review":"I have tried Gerber disposables, lansinoh disposables & avent disposables, as well as avent reusables & tommy tippee reusables.

It paints a beautiful and dark picture of a fantasy London a hundred years ago. Such interesting figures as Aleister Crowley, WB Yeats and the Golden Dawn figure into this darkly fantastic romp, and the execution is flawless. It concerns the advantures of a tattoo artist and an invisible woman from another world who enlists his aid in bringing about the downfall of the Dreadful Eye. Honestly, I've no idea why this book is out of print. It's a classic.

Get inside the heart of a great American high school as students prepare for their futures agonizing over test grades, college admissions and course loads that often lead them to all-nighters and caffeine addictions.This is a compelling look at educational excellence and the benefits and stresses associated with putting a priority on a future HYP (Harvard, Yale, Princeton) education.

It reads like a novel, with nuggets of wisdom and insightful observations on what truly goes into achieving an exceptional public high school. This is not an uncritical look. The pushy parents and students who would rather cheat than risk a grade below \\"A\\" are rampant. But the message of success is clear -- excellent teachers, a supportive environment where all students are known, high expectations planted before puberty kicks in, and focus on an indepth, academmically challenging curriculum, rather than test scores, is the ticket. Most refreshing is the total absence of educational & bureaucratic jargon. School of Dreams is a must-read for anyone who cares about what is going on in public education today. Kudos to Edward Humes for this breakthrough book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"I found the information in this book disturbing, about students who did nothing but study, who rationalized away craming for tests only to forget mere moments after. Do you know what the most disturbing part was? That the information in this book is not true. I go to this high school, and this book glosses over everything that truly makes the school what it is. The author does not understand the essence of this high school and presents a highly skewed and flawed viewpoint.I might even go as far as to call it a muckraking book, but one with none of a muckrakers helpfulness. This book is naught but a twisted pack of lies and no one should buy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk","review":"This book was a chore to get through. There were some spots that were entertaining, but for the most part I found to be boring.And maybe because I went to a public school that was doing this kind of AP type stuff 30 years ago, and managed to do it without excluding anyone or needing entrance exams.. and still found time for those kids who maybe did not wish to go to college (and believe me, they did everything to try to talk you into going to college).. I was just not that impressed. Back then many of my teachers saw alot of this college prep stuff as a memorization game rather than true learning and said so. Anyone blessed with a good memory could play the system. This whole book to me had a pompous tone, and many of the students seem like little elites. But to be fair the author does point all this out, which is why two stars.

No it's not because as the reader you don't know what's important to the story, because even trivial things are described for pages and pages. I think the author wrote this story more for himself than an intended audience. It's an old man's last sentimental extrapolation. Oh, and the main protagonist, Nostromo---he's missing in action.

My critiques of the book would be some subtle gender bias and some unsubstantiated claims. For example, she says near the beginning of the book that Christians don't talk about the Spirit enough and that our theology is \\"insufficiently Trinitarian,\\" but so is hers, because she never once mentions \\"Father\\" in the book.

Although after I dried and styled my hair it appeared somewhat shiny, I was not altogether impressed with the result. However the next time I washed my hair there was a noticeable diffrence in the texture and condition of my dry hair. I later used it when colouring my hair (directions come with product), and it dramatically improved the result of the colour. My hair was really really shiny and looked so much healthier, the just coloured look has also lasted much longer than usual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth 1 red cent","review":"DO NOT BUY .

We have a C-141 as an AWACS plane (not done, basic research would have shown this), and this plane, after being shot down, has the crew picked up by unknown helicopters that somehow manage to beat out F-16s to the scene of the shootdown. There are implausabilities in the actions of carrier groups (one that will take two weeks to transit a couple thousand miles), and it is just an exercise in what the author could throw onto paper.

For me, this remains the high point of the Nice; I did go on to follow ELP for awhile and saw them once in Atlanta in 1971. It struck me at one moment that the Nice were better rehearsed than the orchestra! Naturally, rehearsing an orchestra is a far more complicated and expensive proposition. And no doubt Emerson and Eger would make some changes or corrections in that process, which would hinder polishing things. That said, the orchestra plays quite well.

Still looking for a staged performance with great staging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash!","review":"Minghella's trash has no place in opera. Every scene is performed in front of meaningless panels, which also serve as doors. There is exactly zero background scenery, or atmosphere, throughout the whole opera. The passion and the drama of the singing are ruined by moving dark shadows in the background. Puppetry has no place in this opera. The hideous puppetry destroys the \\"Oh eh! Oh eh!\\" chorus in the introduction of the Third Act. It is grossly unfair that the singing in this beautiful opera has to compete with cheap theatrics, which is what Minghella's trash is all about.The best DVD on Madama Butterfly is the 1956 version by Anna Moffo, available on Amazon. It is B&W.; The sound is solid, but the visual is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shoddy film, excellent duel","review":"Ralph Macchio has little or no talent in this movie, not very convincing as a classical or blues musician. With his aspirations of playing with the best blues man in the world, it makes for some zany times with this film. The story line was decent, but the dialouge and the overall execution was not that good. The only really reason that makes this film worth watching is the amazing duel between Ry Cooder and guitar prodgiy Steve Vai, where Vai does some amazing tapping, a classical peice, and a riff that would later structure his song 'Bad Horsie' from album 'Alien Love Secrets'. But then again, I am a Vai fan, so it may not be for casual viewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"crossroads starring ralph machio","review":"This is an older movie but a good one.It shows the basic struggle between good and evil with some modern touches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I remembered!","review":"This movie came out when I was 13 years old, and I remember watching it like it was last week. I recall my favorite scene involving Steve Via tearing it up on stage. Now I'm 35 years old, and over the past year or two, I've been taking guitar classes focusing on the Blues Guitar, it's American history, and some of the masters that created and played this wonderful music. I just purchased and watched this movie for the first time in over 20 years, and now, having a little knowledge of the history of the Blues, this movie is even more enjoyable than ever! Now my favorite scene involves Ralph Macchio tearing it up on stage. I'm not going to go into the details of the movie - but if you're a fan of the Blues Guitar, Blues Harp, or any of it's history - this is a must see! Plus, it's always entertaining to watch a movie made in the 80's once in a while, isn't it? I highly recommend this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie","review":"Quick Shipment, arrived in great condition. Excellent product for the price. Good movies. See a young Steve Via tearing up the guitar. Most people don't know the fast classical piece that won the battle was actually play by Via not Cooder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"Hey..it's a movie and it's fun. Music is good and the storyline is there to enjoy. A good easy Saturday afternoon flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"An over-looked gem!!","review":"Crossroads is one of those movies that at the time wasn't a hit but over time, people have rediscovered it and it's become sort of a cult classic. When you think of Ralph Macchio as a blues guitar slinger it seems like a blatant miss-cast but how he plays the main character is actually what gives the movie its charm. Not to mention the fact that the devil's main guitar slinger is played by a young and relatively unknown guitar player by the name of Steve Vai!! And the swagger was there back in the day. Anyways, the soundtrack is great and Ry Cooder really captures the feeling of the movie overall and there's some great slide work. The picture quality is good and the sound quality is clean. Keep in mind that this was made in the 80's but it's a definite improvement over VHS. Crossroads is definitely one to add to your collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing movie for guitar enthusiasts","review":"I very much enjoyed this movie. I love anything about the guitar. I wouldn't call this movie a cinematic triumph, but I would say that guitar fans and blues fans would find it it enjoyable. The scenes with Steve Vai I amazing. I think regardless of the genre you play on the guitar, Steve Vai is an icon to any guitarist. My only complaint was that we didn't get to see as much classical guitar. I myself am a classical guitar admirer and was a bit dissappointed that we didn't get to hear as much of William Kanengiser's beautiful playing. Bill Kanengiser is the guitarist who played the classical guitar for Ralph Macchio. I consider him to be one of the best classical guitarists today. Ry Cooder's slide playing is brilliant also. This movie may not impress those apathetic to the guitar or music in general, but guitarists and admirers of the guitar will find this movie to be worth while"},{"rating":"2","title":"it was great, i love it","review":"The move was great. I love it and the quality of the dvd was great. I was totally satisfied with everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crossroads","review":"We purchased Crossroads to replace our VHS version.

Steve Vai is an incredible guitarist. Starts off a little slow but gains your interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent movie, great guitar work!","review":"The plot of this movie is interesting, if not a bit shallow and clichéd. The acting is mediocre as well. Like \\"The Blues Brothers\\", what makes this movie great is the soundtrack. Ry Cooder plays some excelent guitar, and I must admit that Ralph Macchio does a very convincing job mimicing the guitar parts on screen (perhaps that's why he got the part?). This is a great movie for blues fans in general and especially those interested in Robert Johnson and the Delta blues. Even if your not a blues fan, the guitar parts in this movie (especially the famous \\"Duel Scene\\") are worth the price of the movie. I watched the duel over and over again and it made my jaw drop every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crossroads","review":"This was an excellent portrayal of how desparate people make foolish decisions and how good always conquers evil. Macchio's performance in this movie was uncanny. The guitar duel in the end was incredible.

Two great movies with no redeeming value except that they make you feel good. In both movies the music rules; but both are feel good also. If you get hung up on the actors you are missing the point.Music rules and both the sound and quest for sound is what it is about. Both these movies should be released on DVD.

We love the 80's!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Technically Correct","review":"I really love this video and the best part of course is the end. For the record, Steve Vai played all the guitar parts in the duel at the end. Ralph Macchio did not play any guitar (for the recorded sound in the movie) although he did learn quickly and presented a great performance that fooled many a guitar player. I think that I still have the old Guitar Player magazine where Ry Cooder talked about the making of the movie and who played what parts. A great movie for any real guitar player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Movie","review":"I absoulutely love this movie! The music is great and Stevie Vai is incredible(as usual)! Ralph Macchio does a wonderful job. I have this on vhs, cd, and NEED THIS ON DVD!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Important Correction","review":"Unfortunately, in this excellent movie the main character states that it was Eric Clapton who revitalized the song entitled Crossroads. Crossroads was covered by the band Cream in their great 1967 album Wheels of Fire. Eric Clapton was the gifted lead guitarist of Cream. But it was Jack Bruce, singer, songwriter and bass player who was the leader and driving force behind the band. Jack Bruce is the one who should have been mentioned in the movie, not Eric Clapton. Cream was a great band that also featured Ginger Baker, another rock legend on drums. Another supergroup of the same era, Led Zeppelin used Robert Johnson's lyrics in their track entitled The Lemon Song but they did not give Johnson credit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crossroads","review":"I've watched this movie since I was a kid but didn't get a chance to purchase it.

Can't see how I can edit the language so I'm guessing this is a link problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve Vai is f-ing awesome","review":"Hiya there. This is the first review I have written, ever, for anything. I think this was an unbelieveable movie. My dad showed it to me because when i started playing his guitars, I started getting into Joe Satriani. So he said, \\"You like Satch? You'll never believe this guy.\\" So we watched the movie, and I am still in awe. I think that Steve Vai is sooo talented and gifted and I just wish that someday I could be that good! Oh yeah, and on a different note, it was actually Stevie Ray Vaughan that played Ralph Macchio's parts, not Steve Vai. I read that Barry guy's review and I was like \\"DUDE! no no no, Honestly...\\" So in reality, it was actually Stevie Ray Vaughan who played Ralph's guitar parts in the duel at the end. But either way, the music was jaw-dropping and I absolutely love it. Four out of five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony ignores influence","review":"Crossroads is a great movie, but the long awaited DVD release leave a lot to be desired. As a DVD release, this movie only gets one star.This movie inspired many, many people to pick up at learn guitar, including myself. Sony ignores the influence this movie had on guitar players.For Sony not to include a single bonus extra, interview, or even backstory on the ledgend of Robert Johnson it a complete and utter shame.It's awfully high priced not to include anything extra.It does have Japanese subtitles though. Big frigging deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice music, mediocre acting","review":"I love classical music especially played on the guitar. I love blues especially 12-bar slide blues. I don't really agree that Steve Vai is a \\"guitar god\\" simply because he's a technique player with lack of creativity. Kurt Cobain was totally opposite, mass creativity with little technique. But then you have an actual \\"Guitar God\\" like Jimi Hendrix. Steve Vai couldn't play \\"Little Wing\\" with the heart and emotion like Hendrix did. But I still think Vai is a good guitar player. They should've given him at least one line in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Vai, less devil","review":"Aside from an inspired performance by the late Joe Seneca, this film is a throwaway. Joe's character, Willie Brown, is the only one we care about. Ralph Macchio is every bit as annoying as he'd been in the Karate Kid and the story...well, Joe wants to break a contract with the devil. Need I say more? The final showdown with the dark lord won't put any of your neck hairs on end, and the outcome will be predicted by your 12-year old. But also in that scene late in the movie, there's some pretty flashy guitar picking going on, thanks to uncredited virtuoso Steve Vai. Hallelujuh for that part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crossroads (1986)","review":"Fun little ghost story. Great sound track. A little pedestrian for the 21st century, but I remember it new in '86.

I've owned it on laser disk for many years. The movie was good once you get past gulibility of ralph macchio. I'm not a blues kind of person but enjoyed the soundtrack a lot and the steve vai scene at the end is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"How long do we have wait?","review":"This is one of the great music based movies. Anyone who is into the Blues has it on their best list. It is also a great introduction to people who don't quite understand the Blues.BUTwhen are we going to get it on DVD? There is plenty of garbage that has been released on DVD, yet this movie continues to languish in VHS. I spoke to a stallholder at the Sydney markets today who said he had had it in store as a dvd.

Video and Audio are THE BEST for a laptop though. Even Toshiba admits that there is a problem now (they wouldn't before). Mine was a newer model, purchased about a month ago.... Better Processor, and included an external USB 1.44 floppy too. If you can stand buying a fan to blow on it all the time, good machine, but I give it 1 STAR because a laptop/notebook should be able to be used as one, not have to be on a desk with extra fans.

This notebook as a Pentium III, DESKTOP CPU, no no NOT a MOBILE, a DESKTOP, so of course, it heats up and causes problems. It also eats battery like there is no tomorrow. At first I was amazed, but after time, it began to have more and more problems. Check out the toshiba support forum before you buy it. I am going to get the 5105-s607 to replace it. No one has reported problems with it yet.. Good Luck"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Than Paper and Pencil","review":"Whatever you do... do not purchase this machine. You are spending [money] on a doorstop that gets less work done than paper and pencil. I have to say that this is absolutely the worst purchase I have ever made. The computer has a desktop processor which overheats and thus causes it to shut down unexpectedly. Even better is the fact that Toshiba released a patch which throttles the cpu to lower than 50%. So basically you are paying for a laptop that runs at 500 mhz and shuts down on you periodically. Toshiba will not refund your money and will only tell you to send it into their service depot for which they do not have a fix."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice notebook but...","review":"3 months ago I bought one this.

And a big surprise:The new Bios down the CPU speed about 25% when CPU become HOT.I bought this notebook as a Pentium 1.1mhz not as 800mhz, but this is the speed that you can reach when you most need, because Toshiba put a desktop CPU. The 3005 S304/S307 have mobile CPU.If you want a serios notebook don't buy 5005 S507 or any other notebook with desktop CPU...At final analysis this is a good notebook but if you want a notebook to play, this is not the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Desktop CPU in a Notebook Computer; Is Toshiba Nuts!","review":"Some of the clone manufacturers do this, but Toshiba??!!Toshiba has done a good job of hiding the fact that this notebook computer does not use a Mobile Pentium processor.

Red Mecca isn't art; rather, it's the absence of any pretension to artistry. Red Mecca isn't culturally significant; rather, it's the abnegation of culture itself.

I have loaded a few special vehicles for the navigation screen as well as some custom POI databases of national businesses that i frequent, even though most of the locations are already loaded right out of the box. I would strongly suggest the Nuvi 200 to anyone looking for a simple and effective gps unit. It does what it is supposed to do and it does it well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little portable GPS","review":"First let me say if you are used to an installed satellite system, you may be a little disappointed with the size of the screen. There is no getting around the fact that this screen seems tiny compared to factory installed systems. However, the small size helps to make it very portable, and easy to fit in a shirt pocket or even mount on your bike (which is what I plan to do using the optional handlebar mount.) So far the maps and directions have been spot on for me. This is an excellent entry-level system and a great portable GPS."},{"rating":"2","title":"good model if you're on a budget","review":"If you're not looking to spend a lot of money on a GPS unit and you just want the basics this will perform well for you.My first trip with this unit was a 550 mile drive from the Carolinas to Pennsylvania. I jumped in the car in the morning plugged in the address and away I went. It calculated the route within a reasonable amount of time and only lost the satellite signal when going through tunnels. There was one point in the trip when the unit went crazy \\"recalculating\\" over and over. Apparently, this unit ships with some out-of-date maps.Overall though, it's a solid buy for the money providing basic GPS functionality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for price!","review":"My wife and I used this GPS during our trip to Grand Canyon and Las Vegas. Nuvi helped us a lot to find routes and of course very helpful to find \\"point of interest\\" such as gas station, restaurants etc. (some addresses are little outdated though; probably we need update our GPS). Nuvi 200 gives accurate routes and re-calculates routes pretty fast.In summary, this a great GPS at affordable price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Took me in the wrong direction!","review":"After reading all the postive reviews, I purchased this model since I just wanted a basic GPS. I recently moved to Florida and needed one to help me get around a new area. After using it a few times down here the GPS has sent me in the wrong direction every time! For example, it will tell me to take a left for .6 miles and then it will tell me to make a u-turn and go back in the same direction I came from for .6 miles. Then it took me North on the FL Turnpike only to tell me to take the next exit and head South. It made me late for my first day of work. I don't know if I just have bad luck and got a unit with old maps, but I'm definitely returning this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really love it and NUVI is the answer!","review":"I bought it about a month ago and it works just perfect!With the price I paid for this, I am more than satisfied.Thanks NUVI 200!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old maps in new device","review":"I'm very disappointed to find that the maps in my newly purchased Garmin nuvi are over a year old.

The interest points helped me find the stores i like, and you can just search the shop name.

Because its easy to use and doesn't require I re-read the manual each time I want to use it. The lack of bluetooth, text-to-speech, mpg, etc. just get in the way to what a GPS unit main function is. The lack of the congested traffic receiver option doesn't worry me. It won't help if you don't live in a major metro city or are unwilling to pay the extra subscription fee. The only negative comment is that Garmin offers several extras (i.e. downloadable extra car icons, POI mgr, etc.) but don't tell you about them on the website or the manual, so need to Google the web to find out how to download them on their website."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin nuvi 200","review":"The product is easy to use and has worked well since we got it.

I had very little previous experience with GPS systems before purchasing the Garmin. It is easy to use, small enough to keep in a pocket or purse, and reasonably accurate. The first use was to find a wedding in another state. Nuvi took us right to the door or the church. She \\"recalculates\\" rather quickly if you take a wrong turn. We have found a few times where the map may look a little inaccurate but we ultimately get to where we need to be.

I've owned the unit for 1 day and I've tossed my city map and am just getting by on the Nuvi 200. I'm boggled by the technology. This is just one of those areas that I'd been ignoring while I learned other technologies. I can't say anything about the instruction book; I just started using it as soon as I purchased it. It's dead-on and I've been getting around in this city like a champ. I only give it 4 stars because I'm not sure that the maps can be upgraded and that would be a nice thing considering that new places (and streets) appear from time-to-time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work as advertised - returning unit","review":"I just returned my Garmin nuvi 200 after trying to drive to The Bronx from Manhattan and it many errors (almost sent me to NJ on the GWB coming back!). These days most digital products just work so I thought going with low-end model should be fine - I don't need fancy features, just a basic GPS that works. Within half an hour out of the box the unit sent me the wrong way several times including telling me to stay in the left lane of a four-lane highway - then later saying get in the right lane to exit. It also kept saying \\"recalculating route\\" even when I was following the route that it had me on. It might work fine for country roads but in NY this GPS did not meet my (basic) expectations.

It is a very nice gadget, but of little help. Locally, it invariably wants me to follow a longer, convoluted route to my destination. On trips to distant locations, it offers no advantage over a printed map. And it is not that the local map is deficient. Once I turn onto the direct route to my destination, the program accepts my decision and reveals all of the streets correctly. But to enter a local address is entirely too difficult and time consuming, without being directed on an indirect, inefficient route to that address."},{"rating":"1","title":"PREPARE to PAY $69 more any time","review":"Just talked to their customer service, they DON'T give free map upgrade to any previous purchase even within 1 day old. They just guarantee new maps when purchased, so be prepared to pay $69 for a map upgrade anytime. It should be zero star for that reason.

Wouldn't normally be a big deal, but new roads get built over time, so they direct you to update the maps (free!). That is where the problem begins.The update software is not intended for the 200. It is designed for units with more horsepower. And it doesn't work. It completely screwed up my unit, and judging from the complaints on Google, everyone elses too.Their C/S queue is about 200 calls waiting at any one time, so plan on spending a half hour waiting on hold.

It was easy to learn how it worked and the suction cup grip fits nicely on the windshield. It took us a way to Florida that we had not been before using some state highway roads.

It is great for novices like ourselves. There is a vast selection of locators in the area for restaurants, gas stations, ATMs, entertainment, etc. The Garmin map is pre-loaded. The map self-corrects itself if you vear off course from Garmins directions. The GPS is easy to use and setup. My wife set it up in a few minutes.

There is another model that is wider, and I can't think why I would need something bigger, unless people need it because of their vision.Also the unit is not bulky so it's easy to travel with.The other good thing is that is rechargable, the other units were not.Because it's a touch screen, it does get a lot of finger prints, but nothing that will block the visibility of the unit when it's on, it just looks anoying when the unit is off.Other than that, I love this unit and I will recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nyuvi 200 Great basic GPS system","review":"The Garmin Nuvi 200 is a great basic unit.

It only tells you to turn in point x miles which is not at all helpful when you are driving in an area you are not familiar with. The 370 warns you ahead of time the name of the street to turn at and repeats the name at the point of turning. Just listen and drive.

You can pay [...] per unit per year, [...] for lifetime updates. What is lifetime, for the life of the unit. Is that two years, three years? Is it transferable to a new Garmin unit you purchase? NO! So what's with the word lifetime? Sounds like it should be FLIMFLAM!Everyone has a multi-unit discount plan for software, but not Garmin. TomTom on the other hand allows you to correct maps and routes that are in error. From what I have read they also have the most up to date maps.I will give the TomTom a try, I originally chose Garmin because of the stellar reviews but the back end costs for correct map data seems to me to put TomTom ahead in that respect.Bottom line, I would have to pay more for maps then I paid for the units and that's just not happening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luv My Nuvi","review":"Nuvi has saved me a wealth of time.

To be more precise, if you're going to 123 Main St., you'll be okay if you don't mind alot of extra turns and stops. If you're going to 123 Hwy6 or loop410, then you better check a map. Be prepared for the Garman to get you lost or tired of making u-turns. I have set it to avoid u-turns, take the quickest route or shortest route but it dosn't matter: it loves taking the route with the most traffic lights [forget freeways]!Screen size seems ample but don't expect a user guide or book to come with it. You'll have to 'guess' at how best to set it up and or how to use it.I gave it 2 stars just because of the price [<$165] and it seems consistant with what I've heard of other type devices. I've used a built in model on an Acura, it was very nice and seemed alot smarter than my Garman.Garmin nüvi 200 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator"},{"rating":"2","title":"garmin nuvi","review":"This GPS has been a great help.

I loved it so much I bought one for two of my good friends as a treat (since they are such great people). Both of them are not gadget people and wondered why I had given them this gadget. After one week, they both told me how much they loved it and how it had become a useful part of their day to day activities (plus, their kids thought they were so cool!!).

We still took printed directions and maps with us in case, since we had never used a GPS before. When we got home I purchased one for my husband for our anniversary. Wouldn't leave home without it.

Despite your best efforts to angle the plug just right and secure it with duct or gaffer tape, it will not stay powered on. Why these GPS companies designed their units this way I haven't a clue.

It goes on forever, but once you've beaten the challenges, what's the point? The challenges take awhile, but only because the villagers take forever to get anything done. It's a real time game so you get no instant gratification. Just set them to a task and go away. Check back the next day to see how they're doing. It's like an electronic ant farm. Except that they kind of do what you tell them. Sometimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Entertaining","review":"I read the other reviews before puchasing this game. I actually found it to be quite entertaining. As stated by others this game is not full of thrills and high energy, however, it is fun for those of us who aren't interested in violence and guns, etc.And it isn't as easy as it might appear on the surface. The puzzles can be quite challenging to figure out and there were quite unexpected solutions.You can pause it if you are going to be away for a while, or you have the choice to select a \\"time\\" speed. Turning off the computer will still allow these villagers to go about their business. It is often a suprise when you turn it back on to see what is new.You can't just start up the game and let it do it's own thing. The Villagers need to be trained in their tasks. It is your choice as to what they learn.All in all, I have played this for quite a while, and found it to be quite relaxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've been playing this game for days!","review":"In this game you will spend most of your playing time assigning jobs to villagers and having them breed. It is a slow game and best for spending a few minutes here and there watching over your growing village. And you can have up to 5 different games going at a time. You need to use the tech points the scientist villagers earn to buy skill upgrades so your village will thrive. (The final farming upgrade is very important to keeping your food supply up.) There are also 'puzzles' that you solve as your village advances and you help them explore. And occasionally an event will pop up and you will have to choose how your villager reacts and the result can either be very good or even deadly.I found this game to be very fun. I let my game run all day checking it every couple hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work with my xbox 360","review":"This may be partly my fault, but I was lead on to believe that this game would work for my xbox 360, which it does not."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of Louis L'Amour's western books","review":"I read several times all the books writtent by Louis L'Amour of French-Irish descent.

The Messages in the Water guy, Masaru Emoto, says the most healthy living water has evaporated, precipitated through clean air, filtered through clean earth and percolated back up through mineral rich earth's crust; yet this book claims only distilled water is naturally healthy. My common sense balks at the claim that steam distilled water is 'natural', for a start. This book is more sensational than informative. Not for the serious student of water, IMO.

I personally adore the treatment of feedback in amplifiers: Explaining the difficult subject, often still not well understood by many, is worth any effort.

My sentiments along these lines were obviously what the label was counting on when they had the gall to put this thing out.Avoid this, that's my best advice......the sound quality is terrible, worse than the worst bootleg I have ever heard (it's in MONO, for chrissake!), and the performances terribly lacking.I'm surprised Mayall, et al, would ever agree to its release, although perhaps they had nothing to say about it.This constitutes an obscene legacy of a hallmark of recorded music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome debut from another awesome so-cal band","review":"I've been a hoobastank fan ever since i bought this album from best buy and was blown away from listening to every single track on this cd that also almost got worn out when i was a freshman in high school. i know alot of people called hoobastank \\"incubus wannabes\\" and what not, but to me, hoobastank and incubus are two totally different sounding bands and both groups take me back to my middle and high school days and my father took me to see hoobastank in concert almost a month after i bought their debut. btw, each track on this album is awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best DRIVING Albums of Recent","review":"4 stars here was WAY overrated say 3-4 months agobut as soon as I put it on in my car on a long road trip I got into the musicit is actually a really good album but listen to it while driving on a long trip or something similar 'cause at least I really couldn't stand it much while listening to it back home on my stereo"},{"rating":"2","title":"We All Scream For Hoobastank","review":"If I had to say one thing about this CD, it would be amazing!!

I have to change my review because after listening a little more I realized these guys really [need help].

Their new stuff doesn't impress me much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"Considering the fact that there are those who call Hoobastank Incubus rip-offs, let me just start off by saying that neither band started any kind of alternative rock movement or can hold a candle to those bands that did. Hoobastank's self-titled debut album sounds like rehash material from a Backstreet Boys/Incubus colaboration and is nothing more and nothing less. Typical, predictable, and just plain lame lyrics play on to the sound of downtuned nu-metal guitars; this is nothing new at all. You want to listen to real alternative rock or hard rock? Go check out Corrosion of Conformity, Soundgarden, or Faith No More and you'll see how it's really done. This is best used as a drink coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly addictive refreshing rock and roll","review":"After purchasing and loving 'The Reason', I went out and tracked down this debut album from Hoobastank. I imediately fell in love with it after one listen and found myself listening to it many times again. While not quite as good as the follow up, this CD still gets good rotation in my CD collection. Standout tracks are 'Crawling In The Dark', 'Running Away', 'Pieces' and my fave Hoobastank song 'To Be With You'.The songs are short, but the new brand of refreshing punk/rock is addictive and while so many bands of the same mould come and go, I get the feeling Hoobastank may hang around for awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoobastank sucks","review":"Hoobastank is really not my cup of tea. I recently bought their self-titled record but found it sheer waste of money as it contains only a few songs that are worth listening to at all times. Like all other rock bands, they too failed to ring the bells of my heart. The songs that are worth mentioning are \\"Crawling in the dark\\", Running Away\\" and probably \\"To be with you\\". The remainder of this album follows more or less prosaic note. It's a dissapointing effort from a band that stayed \\"THE CHOOSEN ONE\\" on Channel V. But they have a lot more years to spent in the music world so one can only hope that they come up with some better stuff next time. For the time being keep away from Hoobastank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incubus Jr.","review":"In case you believed that Incubus had breached all heretofore known barriers of self-absorbed pity and misplaced angst, think again. Although Hoobastank aspires to the same nu-metal fusion that began with a gangsta-rap edge in Limp Bizkit and softened to introspective self-doubt in Incubus, this self-titled album reaches unbearable levels of syrupy whining. Hoobastank fans, please do us all a favor and stop mistaking this wretched lack of perspective for meaningful sensitivity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sounding, but. . .","review":"The CD sounds great! I took it into work and forced my co-workers to listen to it. Then about a month after buying it I actually thought about what the lyrics meant! Horrible, horrible!

If you have no morals buy this CD, sounds great, but I don't like bands that have content like this one does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worth it","review":"this cd really wasnt all that good. Ill admit, i bought it because i had heard crawling in the dark on the radio and thought it was really good and was expecting more of the same on the cd. what i got was a half-rate incubus clone. i like incubus, but this cd wasnt good. i give it two stars only because crawling in the dark was a good song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yada Yada... repetitive cliche' \\"rock\\" music.","review":"The only song I really liked was \\"Running Away\\". And yes, I listened to the whole album.People, this is as repetitive as music can get.

Hoobastank does what they do BAD.If you want to listen to repetitive radio-friendly music than I suggest you go buy this CD. Otherwise, go pick up something worth your time like Incubus' Morning View."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 1 good song on the CD","review":"Like many others I bought this CD after hearing \\"Crawling in the Dark\\". It is the first song on the CD, and the quality definitely goes downhill quickly after that single song. \\"Crawling in the Dark\\" is the only really good song on the CD. There are 2 more decent songs and the rest are just crap. If you really like \\"Crawling\\" I recommend that you buy the CD single and hold off on paying full price for this CD unless you get to listen to it entirely somewhere. I know I am disappointed that I paid full price for what amounts to a 1-song CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"So, it's generic \\"nu-metal\\"...","review":"Only this time from a band with the dumbest name ever.

It's pretty sickening."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Person Who Reviewed This Should Be Fired","review":"It's not that I'm angry that he doesn't like Hoobastank, it's that he lacks professionalism. You don't rip an album to shreads -- you list good and both bad things and let the reader decide whether or not it's worth the purchase -- especially for a debut CD, you moron. Get a new job. This album is a colossal major debut with strong vocals and simple music to back it up -- simplicity can be good -- why should you have to go all out and technical when you can produce something just as great [if not greater] by keeping it minimal? Hoobastank is one of those bands that proves it. See them live when you can, they will make you respect them even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"An impressive debut.","review":"I originally didn't give Hoobastank a chance, until I heard them in concert opening for Incubus. They put on a hell of a show and I bought the CD, which turns out to be almost as good.The album has some really great songs, and some decent songs. Things sort of lose momentum about halfway through, but the album is short, so you can listen to the first few songs again, which are worth a second listen anyway.This is energy-driven music, and best listened to with the Bass turned up. The vocals are melodic, and the contrast is good against the rest of the band.Sometimes, the lyrics become a little too Woe-is-me, like the world is working against poor Hoobastank. The pace of the music more than makes up for this fallback though. Overall, it is definately a disc worth having."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Crawling in the Dark\\" is the only good song","review":"This CD I listened to recently is similar to other bands, like Incubis. The songs all sound similar and all have the same rythm and beat to them. The only reason to get this CD is for \\"Crawling in the Dark\\". And perhaps \\"Runnung Away\\" This is a CD I would not buy. NU METAL ...!!! this cd gets worse and worse every time i listened to it, so...i used the CD for a nice frisbyif your still into this music get a clue and listen to good stuff.look at my listamanias"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incubus With a New Name","review":"Don't get me wrong I like Incubus to a certain extent, but I was hoping Hoobastank would be different. When I first heard \\"Crawling in the Dark\\" I instantly liked Hoobastank, with their nu-metal approach. When I bought the CD though I found out the rest of the songs sound like they are done by a different artist. But to make myself clear, they are still another band then Incubus, so if you don't hate them to a great extent then Hoobastank is a good CD for you. Also it seems to me that if you like the Lost Prophets you will like Hoobastank and the other way around. My advice is if you are looking to buy the Hoobastank CD, don't. Find a friend who has a CD burner and a internet connection. But don't tell the record companies."},{"rating":"2","title":"(money) well spent","review":"This album is very good. I'm listening to it at the moment. I hate to reiterate what's already been said, but Incubus fans will definitely like this one. The songs are catchy and melodic. The lyrics aren't terribly complicated but don't need to be in order for the music to be effective and rockin'. For something a little harder also of the \\"non-mainstream (as of yet) good modern rock\\" genre check out From Zero. I also recommend the aggro-melodic band Boy Hits Car if you want to try something a little different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoobastank rocks!!","review":"I had heard of Hoobastank on MTV when it was one of Carson's picks and I totally loved it. I first heard 'crawling in the dark' and it was so original and the guys were hot that I had to buy the cd. The self-titled cd is amazing. I love it and i can't wait for Hoobastank to put out another one just like it! I recommend it to anyone who is into alternative music like Linkin Park, or Puddle of Mudd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irony","review":"man o man, theres some irony in the hoobastank - incubus mix-up.First of all, i am a Die Hard Hard Core INCUBUS fan.Hoobastank sounds pretty similar to INCUBUS.No, Doug Is not Brandon Boyds ( lead singer of Incubus)brother.Now, when i first heard hoobastank on the radio, i immidiately knew this band tried to Rip off incubus, but i forced mysef to listen to there cd. I realized Its a good cd. I own all 6 incubus cds, dvd, tshirts, hats, and other paraphanielia, and for me to not know about thse guys, tying to rip off incubus, it would be pretty sad.One thing that scared me though, was when i learned that Hoobastank is Going on tour with incubus in europe. Man, thats wierd.all in all, hoobastank is a good band, but will NEVER, and i reapeat NEVER match up to Incubus."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd give it 4.5 stars if that was allowed","review":"Many people compare this band to Incubus, probably because of singer Doug Robb's voice. I don't really think that is a valid comparison...Incubus is much slower and less heavier than Hoobastank, but both bands are very good. This CD is an amazing buy (I got it at Best Buy for about 7.50) and my only complaint is that it is much too short (the 12 songs only come out to 40 minutes). The guitars on this album are catchy and melodic; the bassist is also good. I don't much like the drumming on this album, it doesn't add much on most of the songs, however, I'm guessing that it will improve with the next album. The vocals on this disc are amazing, Doug has one of the best voices in the industry. Also an emphasis on the guitar, it is one of the best parts of the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"This album is nothing special, nobody will remember it in 10 years.

The vocals on the cd are really good and have a different feel and sound then you usually hear these days. The members of the band play really well together like I said they also bring great energy.

Yes...i admit they have talent in the musical area, and its a pretty good cd, in fact its almost excellent ( sumtimes its a little hard to remember that I'm not listening to Incubus)...but not their own style. Just a little advice to the group... \\" GET YOU'RE OWN STYLE< DON'T COPY SOME ONE ELSES' !!!!!\\" The cd is ok....that is if you can stand to listen to some one rip of style off one of the greatest bands to ever hit the recording booth.

There is no proof of good musicanship on this album. Can someone please tell me why someone said that this sounds good with the bass turned up? I dont even hear the bass player, and when I do its just basic filler work that any musican with a little experience could pick up in a few days. The drummer sucks, the guitar player sucks, and the vocalist is the only think that really carries the band as his voice isnt terrible, but that is what seems to stand out the most. If you want a good rock band with some pop flair check out the Foo Fighters, Staind, or Disturbed. These guys really have nothing going for them, and maybe thats why they have only given us two albums in a six year period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind-numbingly boring and predictable","review":"There is absolutely no talent here.

This is a good opening effort by a band that tries way too hard, and comes off sounding like the Incubus knockoff that they are. With [cruddy] lyrics that occupy even [cruddier] songs (\\"You act like I owe you something/I don't owe anyone anything but me\\"), this CD finds itself at the bottom of my CD pile. The few good songs on this album are the ones that are keeping the rating to two stars rather than zero.

I saw Hoobastank for the first time live playing with Incubus a few months back and they don't just sound amazing on CD,but live too!

Well if by rarity you mean the bands name I guess I'll agree, but you really don't have to dig very deep to understand that this sad excuse for an album is just a rehash of all the other mainstram nu-metal robots already playing. Incubus, Deftones, Linkin Park are all bands that I, an intellegent muic fan would never be able to tell apart, and now Hoobastink have joined the ranks. The lyrics are trite (just look at the song names) and all pretty much about the same thing- pain of some sort; well guess what, your rock stars on a major record label who don't know what it is like to struggle on a club scene, cheer up.

Well, this album is a keeper, everyone has heard the single¡s¡Kbut I think what really makes the album is the rest of the tracks. They actually go really well with each other, this is truly a good album overall. The thing about Hoobastanks music is that it doesn¡t grow old..at least it takes a while.

And yes, the lead singer does sound a bit like Brandon Boyd of Incubus, but who says that's a bad thing? I think the main reason I like this album so much is that I love Incubus' SCIENCE sound (harder than Make Yourself or Morning View). And this album combines SCIENCE with a bit of Make Yourself. So if you enjoy Incubus, especially S.C.I.E.N.C.E. or Make Yourself, you will definitely enjoy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great savings on Pick up Truck repair parts","review":"This is thee best place to buy your replacement parts.I saved 40% buying it here opposed to going to the auto part store.Great quality part.

However, most students learn about it only in passing, as the history curriculum in schools still tends to end just after WWII. Even treating this through picture books is better than that.This book, featuring a young girl whose socially active brother and sister participated in the sit-ins, signed people up to vote, and got arrested for their troubles, takes a good look at the Greensboro sit-ins. I like how the main character acts like a real child - she's proud of her siblings, yes, but she also wants them to stop protesting and stay home and be safe. She's eight years old, and, given the wordiness of the book, that's probably about the right age for the reader.The artwork is pretty enough, but it would have been better on a larger book.

Using the provided introductory book as a guide with one of the suggested spreads, one can get a general idea of transpiring events by relating the cards (keywords) to the situation.

LBM is in fine form as always, and with the ensemble tracks, you can tell these old pros played together a lot - and dug it!If you love LBM, you need this album - IMHO the wonderful \\"Prescription For The Blues\\" alone is worth the price of entry.

You can hear the songs which could be on White Light (Mr Rain, Guess I'm Falling in love) and other ones for the later albums. Guess I'm Falling in love is better than the live versions !!!! It's just a pure and raw instrumental.THere are some other beatifull instrumentals too on the album: ride into the sun, ... By the way, don't miss 'Mr. Rain VERSION 2', cause it's way better than the first version (on peel slowly and see). Dont' know why they didn't put this version on the box. But, well a true Velvet fan needs both."},{"rating":"1","title":"For completists, barely.....","review":"Though their are intermittent flashes of what the post-John Cale Velvets could do on this scanty LP, the climb is barely worth the view, in a sense. The other post-breakup unreleased album 'VU', far outstrips this one, and were it not for the legal red-tape, they would have made a formidable double."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another View (that is, mine.)","review":"This was actually my second Velvet Album (I stood repeated listenings of the 'banana' album, and the stooges first, MC 5's Kick Out the Jams...) But, anyway. With limited exposure to this band I thoroughly ejoyed Another View! At the time, I just assumed Ride Into the Sun was meant to be that wistful instrumental! Ferryboat Bill is, in the context of the Velvets, a much weirder tune than The Gift. Rock and Roll does seem a much crisper version than on Loaded (which was frequently on the radio.) Maybe I have a preference for some of these simply through bias toward the way I discovered them. I would like to believe, because I play music, that there is true merit to these versions. And I actualy prefer version one of Mr Rain think of it as one of those murderous mid-Atlantic states Augusts.

A few early outtakes have some Cale on them, but the songs are so lame, who cares? Annoying version one of \\"Hey Mr. Rain\\" ruins the marginally better version two, \\"Real Good Time Together\\" isn't any better here than it is on Reed's solo album, and you can do without the original \\"Rock and Roll\\" that's here too. \\"Ferryboat Bill\\" is of some amusement, but one nugget out of nine? If you have to have unreleased Velvets, \\"VU\\" is the album to buy, in fact its a must have.

It takes place in the foothills country of western Canada in the late 1890s, a country not unlike that in Colorado, Wyoming and Montana just east of the Rocky Mountains. The four chapters about Gwenn in the middle of the book are truly beautiful and were made into a tabletop book which, like The Sky Pilot, sold over a million copies in the early 1900s.

I was very encouraged to read the ups and downs of Marjorie's adoption. Someday, when I am married, I plan on coming back to China to adopt a child. Even though this book shows a single woman's quest for children, I want to wait until I have support from a husband. Though, I applaud her determination. I encourage anyone who is even interested in adoption, single or married, to read this book. It shows two very different girls raised on one very loving home. I would love to hear how Leh Heh and Holly are doing now. All in all, a very inspiring story."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!!!!!!!!!","review":"The Brother 1820C has some nice features BUT it cleans the ink cartridges automatically and often. This uses up all the ink every few months, whether you print anything or not. I don't do any color faxing or printing, but I have to replace the color cartridges every 3-4 months, so that in a year I spend more on ink that I don't even use than the cost of a new 1820C machine. This is an ink guzzler. It will break your pocketbook unless you are wealthy and money does not matter to you. In addition, there seems to be no way to use the black ink option when the color ink is depleted by the constant automatic cleaning.

A lot of the songs started out with the same intro just changed around a tiny bit and none of the songs besides love sucks stood out. It was totally different than songs of praise, in a bad way. Way less english, it seems like monkey is losing his accent. lost thier goofy upbeat punk style. Almost all of the songs are too repetitive, saying the same lyrics overrr and overrr. \\"Rockers in Rags\\" and \\"Love Sucks\\" are the most decent songs relating to thier roots.

It has become one of my favorite heavy metal albums, there's not a bad tune on here, Dora's voice is simply amazing and can be put up there with best. But I'd say its the perfect timed guitar work that hooks me.

Warlock became one of my favorite bands very quickly and this disc is one that I never tire of hearing. The music is perfect for the genre and Doro's voice is what sets this band apart from all others.

I bought this before seeing that review.

If the images were high res or visually compelling, I might be willing to fool with it, but they're not.

The compositions are powerful and expansive, yet retain subleties in the music that keeps things quite interesting and involving. Typical and highly musical ELP, of course. This music is made to transport and mesmerize. I have the original CD released in the 80's, and I hope a remastered version hits the marketplace soon. Play this on a quality full-range system and TURN IT UP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A New Age Album of War Songs by John Phillip Sousa on Steroids!","review":"Before you start bashing and gnashing your teeth and cursing, I will state for the record there are several albums of ELP that I enjoy and with the desire to discover something new I purchased this overly loud, one dimensional piece of martial music dreck. I read the rapturous reviews and think these must be the same sort of people who would applaud with standing ovations and rave about half hour drum solo's back in the 60's. Anything is wonderful if it's extremely loud and done pretentiously. . .I'm not faulting their musicianship, only their lack of ideas and subtlety. In fairness, there were several songs that were almost listenable and enjoyable but I don't want to go back and listen to this bombastic album again to determine precisely which songs they were. It's simply not worth the effort. If this is a sterling example of art rock no wonder art rock, notwithstanding the continued survival of Yes, is deceased."},{"rating":"1","title":"elplease help me","review":"i remember seeing this tour back in the fall of 86 and there is a live disc that came out of it, i would seek that out before getting this one. even for hardmanticore completists its a tough listen. there is only one track that has any real merit, of the rest some are tepid and the others are just plain nightmares. uninispired. plus the eighties style production kills the little soul it has........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like silk","review":"I played my first copy of this album so much it wore out. I bought another copy and wore that one out, too. Each track is better than the next, and \\"Lay Down Your Guns\\" gets me every single time. It is so haunting I used to hear it in my sleep. Greg Lake's vocals are soul-wrenching (he is probably the most underrated singer of the latter half of the 20th century). I was lucky enough to see ELPowell at Madison Square Garden in 1986. I won't forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Palmer who?","review":"When this album first came out, I couldn't wait to buy it. I knew and liked Cozy Powell from his work with Rainbow and other hard rock bands, and couldn't wait to hear what he'd sound like in Carl Palmer's seat. I always thought that Palmer was tremendously over-rated (he can't keep time), and this record demonstrates how powerful ELP could be with a fundamentally sound drummer. The music is mature, not as overblown as Works, less raw than classic ELP (Tarkus, Brain Salad Surgery), and has little hammond organ, (Emerson opted more for synths and piano), but it all works, and is tight as hell. \\"Touch and Go\\" is a good rock fanfare, \\"Lay down your Guns\\" is an excellent ballad, Love Blind is a great pop tune.I saw this line-up on tour twice, and hearing Cozy Powell play earlier ELP classics was amazing - far more explosive and powerful. Too bad it only lasted for one album."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRINGER OF GREAT MUSIC","review":"ELPOWELL WAS A GREAT PROGRESSIVE ALBUM RIGHT SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DARK 80S WHEN THERE WAS LITTLE THAT COULD BE CALLED PROG.

If you like Mech game's then there are better Mech game's out there. I played this game for about 30 minute's and that's all I could take from this piece of crap. SAVE YOU'RE MONEY!!!!

As one of the console's launch titles, it must be kept far far away from any demonstration booths..."},{"rating":"1","title":"HARDCORE TRASH!","review":"You have not played trash until you play this. This is TRASH AT IT'S BEST! I kid you not, this could've passed for a PS1 game due to the terrible, sorry graphics. Controls sucked,and the camera angles are a joke. I'm still amazed how bad everything was, especially the graphics. I had to look at the disc to make sure I was playing a PS3 game and not a PS1 game. It doesn't even look like a PS2 game at least. That's sad. It's almost like someone copied and pasted a PS1 game to a PS3 disc. The backgrounds are also ridiculous. The water doesn't even move when you touch it. As for all the other reviewers on here who say this game is okay, maybe they got a different copy from the one I purchased. There's no way in Hell we could've been playing the same game. This game should not be on sell anymore. They just need to give this away the minute you walk into the store.

I wouldn't have given it two stars overall.","review":"This game was whack, I like the gundam series but this was total utter disappointment. The price of 54 dollars for this game right now is outrageous. You could suck it up and buy the Gundam Senki game which looks like a full version of what this game was supposed to be for 70 dollars. Yes its in japanese but at least you will have 10x the fun playing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money...","review":"Put it this way, if Amazon had the option for zero stars, this game would get it. Graphics are sub-par, gameplay is just plain bad. I rented this from Blockbuster, played it for a few hours, then returned it that night. Of the all of the titles released or due for release for the PS3, this one gets my vote for being the worst. You'd think the developers at Namco would've realized this before they released it. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Despite my hopes, it's crap","review":"Just to clarify I really like Journey to Jaburo on the Playstation 2. And by the looks of this game I thought that Gundam Crossfire was a HD version, but boy was I wrong.I really like how the game utilizes dozens of mobile suit models, everything from the ubiquitous Zaku II to Norris Packards Gouf Custom. Everything is here, GM's, Doms, Hygoggs, Zoks, if you can think of a mobile suit that made an appearance during the UC period it's pretty much included.But unfortunately game play design decisions basically ruined this game. My biggest complaint is that your weapon arm can be shot off very easily, on more than one occasion I found my mobile suit literally shin kicking its way through a level because I had lost the weapon arm within the first 30 seconds of a level.Even if you're a diehard Gundam fan you'll be (shin) kicking yourself for buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is pretty bad","review":"I bought the game on sale figuring it would be hard to go wrong for the price I was wrong about that. In the game you pilot a Mech much like the Mech Warrior franchise but the controls are extremely annoying and difficult to get used to. The layout of the controls isn't very intuitive at all and even after you struggle to adapt to it the game itself is still pretty blah. Dynasty Warriors: Gundam (made by a different publisher) is a much better game than crossfire if you are really looking for a Gundam game."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst gundam game ever","review":"I have never seen a gundam game as bad as this one.

A real insiders view of the Beatles. The details from all the wives was terrific. The book is equally divided among the four guys, and each of them gets their shoes scuffed. What is so unusual about this book is that for the first time it gives the inside reasons why things panned out the way they did. The writing is moving in places, but I don't imagine the Beatles were very happy with Peter Brown for spillingh the beans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tough, but important, Beatles book from an insider","review":"This book came out in the early 1980's and, to my knowledge, appeared to be the first major Beatles biography to truly remove the sheen off of the Beatles collective public image. I first read it ten years ago and it made a lasting impression. Although most of us Beatlemaniacs probably knew that the boys lived less than choirboy lifestyles, Peter Brown confirms every suspicion that we may have had with regards to the sex, drugs and hedonism that may have surrounded the band. For this reason, this is a tough read. Contrary to some other reviews, it didn't come across to me that Peter Brown had an axe to grind; I just feel he wanted to set the record straight as he remembered it. As a result, this is an engrossing book for all who appreciated the Beatles - not an easy one, but a worthwhile one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah","review":"Probably one of the best rock biographies ever written. I read it (couple of years ago) in almost one go."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Inside Scoop","review":"I've just finished reading this book for the fourth time in 20 years. It is an excellent, thorough, accurate, and sometimes painful look at the rising star and setting sun that was the Beatles. Brown and Gaines cover it all, including the pathos and pain that were woven into the Beatles' lives and, inevitably, the lives of those closest to them. This book is a biography, not a detailed account of the music they made together. For that I would suggest \\"A Day In The Life\\" by Hertsgaard, which is a meticulously documented discography of their music.The Love You Make may not make you happy in the end, but it will give you an insider's view that, up until its release, was unheard of for die-hard fans like me. Only now, with the advent of the volumnious \\"Anthology\\" do we have the Beatles' perspective. And that is not truly complete without John Lennon, is it? I highly recommend Brown and Gaines' book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fictionalized account","review":"I would give this O stars if I could. Peter Brown describes events he did not actually witness and recounts exact conversations that he did not hear. Lies, distortions, exaggerations. And not a shred of insight into the music. Some people like to waste their money on garbage, though. But I don't. Glad I checked this out of the library first before buying it. It's not worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another round of pissed-off envy --","review":"Peter Brown is one of those Lennon named as pissed at The Beatles because their breakup meant the end of the gravy train for such as Brown, who was a late-comer as it was.This was originally rushed into print shortly after Lennon was murdered (as were so many others intending to capitalize) -- and, \\"coincidentally,\\" no longer able to respond to the dirt Brown peddles against him. (How did Peter Brown manage to be in the room with John and Yoko when they were doing drugs, eh?) Brown was one of the \\"suits\\" who, as Peter McCabe points out (\\"Apple to the Core\\"), mostly took two-hour martini lunches."},{"rating":"1","title":"A loveless take.","review":"This book is thick with opinion.the author clearly has a very negative perspective, the book is full of obvious misinformation.bitter and two dimensional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Translation by Martin.

No one in this band is talented at all. I guess the turntable guy might be good at what he does but turntables are horrible so it doesn't matter. The music, which they claim to be metal HA!, is watered-down, easy, repetitive garbage. Especially in the guitars. The vocals are horrible. Chester can't sing. Every live show they have show his true horrible voice. It probably took every voice distorter in the studio to make it sound tolerable as it does on here. The other guy is a rapper and that just pretty much speaks for itself. The only reason they have even one star is because you can't give them any less. The whole generation of nu-metal and rap/metal makes me sick. Record companies will sign ANYONE and here is the proof."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good I must say","review":"Well personally I thought the CD was pretty good. I mean it wasn't a whole lot of the typical music you usually here. I mean I like rock music, but it has a lot of rapping which isn't the greatest. It has awesome beats though. Whenever I am angry the songs help me deal with my feelings and they give those songs where they relate to your feelings. Overall the CD is definitely a must have for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD with only a few good tracks","review":"First off I'd like to say that Linkin Park is not metal, not nu-metal not thrash metal, definatly not heavy metal. Not that I'm putting Linkin Park down, but they aren't metal, They're just more of the offspring from that Rap/Rock hybrid music that has become so popular.Now to the CD; Hybrid Theory is a decent start to a band that will either make it big or fall flat on their faces. My favorite tracks are Papercut, One Step Closer, Crawlin, Runaway and In the End. The thing about these songs is that they aren't just good but they are great, they won't play out too fast, meaning that you can listen to them over and over before you get sick of it.The downside is that the other tracks aren't good, but the CD is worth buying just becasue of those 5 songs mentioned above."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT MORE CAN I SAY OTHER THAN LINKIN PARK ROCKS?","review":"Hybrid Theory is an awesome cd! ... the only song I could bear to listen to was In The End because it's the only smooth and easy listening song. Then after awhile I gradually started listening to the first couple of tracks and then well I fell in love with it. The members of Linkin Park seem to mix emotions and love in their songs and they come out with some funky ... song which is great to listen to. When I'm really mad it's real soothing to listen to them belch out their guitars, the pounding drums, and awesome little techno whatever sound effects. The lead singers Chester (the vocal like normal singing guy) and Mike (the rapper dawg) come together to make awesome songs. Ok this review is getting long. My favorite song is Runaway, One Step Closer, and of course the Classic- In The End. ....OK well YOU MUST BUY LINKIN PARK HYBRID THEORY!!!! and if you like it, buy Reanimation..but make sure u buy Hybrid Theory before you buy Reanimation..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheer Musical Genius!","review":"I just recently bought this CD after a recommendation from a friend and I can't explain how incredible this album is!

I am a huge fan of rap/metal but this is nothing like Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, and Papa Roach. It was terrible. Their way of blending rap and rock was stupid. Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit combine them so well you almost can't tell when they've converted their singing. BUt Linkin Park starts singing rock then coverts so quickly it's annoying (especcially in the song IN THE END) I hated it and if I could have given it 0 stars I would.

The first couple listenings to this cd left me sorely disappointed, I was expecting a lot more rock and a whole lot less rap. After a while it grew on me and I began to like the mixture of gritty guitars, beautiful, but sometimes harsh singing, and the rap. My favorites songs by far included \\"Papercut\\", \\"Crawling\\" which is now a big hit in it's own right, and \\"In the End\\". Each were sung and lyrically better than the rest of the tracks. Other songs that I liked include \\"With You\\", and \\"A Place for My Head.\\" Two songs I just could not get into were \\"Cure for the Itch\\" and \\"Points of Authority\\".It is amazing this band is making all this happen without a bassist.

Nu-Metal that is good-KoRn, Distrubed, System of a Down, Slipknot, and Mudvayne to name a few. BUT Linkin Park should not even be classified as nu-metal! It is an insult to people that actually know what metal is! How you know this isnt metal is because teen girls enjoy it. They like it because Chester Bennington is \\"hot\\" and he sound like Nsync.

Although the first song, Papercut, isn't all that bad, everything that follows is well and truly terrible. Linkin Park have absolutely nothing up their sleeves, this is nu-metal rock at its worst. The bottom of the barrel is the single \\"Crawling\\", where Linkin Park's dreadful singer (one of Linkin Park's singers I assume) makes your ears bleed with pointless screaming.

All you have here are a bunch of homos whining about how much their lives suck. \\"Oh BOO HOO, I have money, but not enough to fill my tub! WHAAAAAAAAAAA!!!\\". What a horrible excuse of a band, and while Hybrid thermous isn't as bad as the ghastly Meteora, it still deserves 1 star. I cant wait until this pathetic excuse of a band is forgotten and is wiped off the face of the earth.Yep, I know, not helpful..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Stinker!","review":"Are you stupid?

Bang your head and twirl your hair, you mindless twits."},{"rating":"1","title":"People....Just Say No","review":"Linkin Park is horrible. I have seen that some people call them nu-metal. I literally fell out of my seat laughing. Linkin Park is barely any rock, mainly rap. Linkin Park's music sounds like it's coming out of something dying. Linkin Park had many hits with this record such as \\"Closer\\" and stuff like that. But, there are so many horrible songs I don't know where to begin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trendy ear-catcher of the year","review":"Should we marvel or scoff at them ? You decide, but how these guys managed to fill their music with the gist of the trendiest stuff around is nothing short from amazing. Although it's easy to pinpoint the lack of inspiration of such composite material, to make fun of the derivative korn-ish guitar work, vocal eminem-isms and nirvanesque song structures, the result is strangely addictive. It must nevertheless be noted that the initial effect of these tunes wears off very fast. I lent the record a couple months ago, and never thought about it again... The question remains : are these guys able to survive ? Trouble is that the bunch of remixes which stood for their follow-up lends credibility to the fact that these guys have basically got nothing to tell us. So my advice to them would be : take the money and run !&#65533; OR WRITE DECENT TUNES !"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"this cd is one of the best i have ever heard. linkin park's music is very good i like how they mix rock and rap. they mix the music very well, they are genius. if you like different kind of music you should defenetly buy this cd!!!! it's very good"},{"rating":"2","title":"LP","review":"I have had this CD for about two months after its realese and I absolutely love it. I can listen to this CD over and over again for hours on end. Chester's voice helped by Mike's awesome rapping are the best thing to happen to the music scene since I don't even know what. Nothing can compare to these six guys talents, or their skill in portraying their message without having to use the \\"F\\" word every other time.

As soon as I began listening, I knew I had wasted my money. With whining vocals and laughable rapping, this sounds like Eminem if he took up \\"heavy metal\\" or whatever this is supposed to be. Each song made me wince in a new way. The lyrics try to be deep just for the heck of it, and up sounding contrived and meaningless. I can't understand how this CD sold so well. It's basicacally a repackaging of the same old N'Sync boy band formula. But I guess N'Sync sells well, too, and we all know about their musical talents.Pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok pop music","review":"first off, i have seen, heard, and read alot about this band. and the first thing i want to say is Linkin Park is not metal, rap-core, nu-metal, or anything like that. they are a pop band thru and thru. i saw these guys when they were just starting out and they were trying to promote \\"One step closer\\". back then they were trying to do the nu-metal thing, although they were never very good at it. then one day i hear one of these songs at the doctors office on a pop/mix station. in my opinion thats where they sould stay, with the likes of Creed, and Matchbox 20. if you want to here hard core music with good melodies you should check out Diecast or Stuck Mojo, you'll see the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop whining","review":"I honestly can't understand why people are entertained by these rich and whiny people.

I first heard of them months ago on that \\"evil tool\\" that begins with an N. I've been waiting for their debut ever since.Their debut CD \\"Hybrid Theory\\" is one of those rare instances where I can listen to every song without skipping any. All of the songs are that good. By now most people have heard their first single \\"One Step Closer\\" somewhere. If you were worried about that being the only good song on the CD, don't. In fact thats not even the best song (that honor goes to either Pushing Me Away or With You). So do yourself a favor and buy this CD now because once everyone hears of this band (and MTV gets their hooks in them and makes them trendy) the price is definitely gonna go up."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a Great fan of LinkinPark and there are reasons","review":"I Simply have to say that they have the words to get to me... You must have felt this way because I did lots of times, you know when you are so angry and that there is so much hate in you, about something or especially someone, and there is simply NO WAY you can put it in words to get it all out, well THEY put it in these words. I don't know how they do it but anywas it's the greatest CD you'll ever found. It's not a simple CD to me but it's some kind of memento about lots of things, anyways ... write me back if u feel like it, cya later guys,,Dark-Slash22"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Much Garbage","review":"Well, see, the thing that gets me, is people that like to call this music \\"metal\\" and \\"rock.\\" What this is, is a joke! It's overplayed MTV [stuff]...I mean, seriously, the music sounds like a lot of other stuff that's floating around and overall, it is just plain bad. The reason I gave it two stars is because there is one song that I somewhat care for, and that is \\"Pushing Me Away,\\" mainly because this song was different from the rest on the CD. If you want to listen to REAL rock and metal, check out some stuff by Slayer, Slipknot, Mudvayne, or In Flames."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good...","review":"I love rap music, rock music and electronica; however this is a pathetic attempt at blending the three. The singing is weak, rapping embarrassingly bad and the musicianship incredibly average. only thing that saves this album is the production and even that can't hide lack of talent. I have heard people saying that linkin park are first 'manufactured' metal band; really wouldn't be surprising if that was true. This is quite simply shallow pop music: if you want metal listen to bands like tool, pantera etc if you want rap listen to the Roots or Wu Tang or something if you want kinda ambient electronica that LP so desperately try to recreate, listen to Aphex Twin or Boards of Canada. You'll then see how redundant this ... is. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Metal.....WHAT'S WITH THE RAP?","review":"This was really annoying. I know that these guys are good musiciansbut they're such wannabes. None of them are black which would be a good excuse and furthermore they suck at rapping. People like Kid Rock and Fred Durst out-white-rapped these guys. The metal parts are the only parts i could stand. hopefully their other cds are better but after this i don't think i could take it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hybrid Theory is my kind of theory!","review":"When I checked this C.D. out of the library, I was mainly looking forward to track number 8 (In The End) which I had heard on the radio before, but I was pleased to find that I also liked many more of the songs on Hybrid Theory. Linkin Park clearly has a gift with sampling, since the rhythms they select for the background always mix perfectly with the lyrics and guitars. It is also positive that their lyrics are fairly meaningful, they always have an interesting message to convey; and that the flow of the vocals is good and helps you get into the music (the guitar helps to do that job too). Overall, I would give Hybrid Theory a huge thumbs up and would recommend it to all hard rock fans.I recommend:PapercutOne Step CloserPoints of AuthorityBy MyselfIn The EndForgottenPushing Me Away"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I mostly bought this cd for the song \\"Crawling\\", and it is basically the only good one on here.

What gets so tiring is metal fans putting Linkin Park down, calling it \\"poser metal\\", and that any one who listens to is just a metal-head wannabe. Music is music. If someone likes it, they'll listen to it. Don't complain about being discriminated, or brag about being better because you listen to other Metal bands.Hybrid Theory is great, not as hard or aggressive as thrash metal or other metal genres, but it's still worth the time to listen to. All the songs are great, not one worse then the other, which is rare in any album. Despite some criticism from long-time metal fans, Linkin Park lives up to Metal's standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOD THIS BAND SUCKS!","review":"LinkinPark is the worst excuse for a band in history, they are just as bad as ICP.

May I add, the song writing is issues that have already been written about.(this over said \\"breaking\\" and \\"falling apart\\", I'd really like to send this band a Synonym book) I'd say, that's the main weakness in the nu-metal scene, Linkin Park is just adding on to the mellon collie tradegy of Nu-Metal...Even a lot of the beats, I hate to say this but, it sounds rather, repetitive.

And everyone knows that when a song gets in your head thats annoying but if it doesnt annoying you thats fantastic.

It seems like the other acts lacked the intensity or style that rage did. Then, a few months later, I hear Linkin Park's One Step Closer. For the life of me, I couldn't get the song out of my head. The band was talented, fast, angry and forceful. After listening through their album, I was suprised that there could be another group of positions that could combine rap and metal in a really interesting way that I hadn't heard before. What makes the album interesting is that it has two lead singers who play off each other. In addition, Linkin Park bring has more of the instrumental side of rap present style present with the help of turntable and synthisizers.Hopefully this band will go on to great things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limp bizkit suck or is the other crap band","review":"linkin Park are the 2nd worst band in history only beaten by the great crap bizkit.

This sound is unlike anything I have previous heard from today's somewhat template for rock music. The nu-metal bands, including the lackluster bizkit bands, have no originality. The rap vocals with heavy riffs seemed to have been overplayed, but this album is suprisingly a fresh beat to the ear. The amazing guitar work of axman Brad Delson, completments the catchy lyricist Mike Shinoda on many occasions and the music blends almost seemlesly.

The vocals live have alot of emotion live bit on the cd it loses its rawness and becomes weak. Another thing I dislike about this album is the fact the lyrics seem to be the same in every song. The songs all seem to have the same theme about pain and hurt but never get into to much gritty detail like real problems in the world because then the radios wont like that and there songs wont reach the top 10 spot.

Linkin Park's sound is more raw...The singer is good and the rapper is average, at least both r better than Fred Durst (But I thin Limp Bizkit it's great).

The blend of rap lyrics with vocals by the lead singer give Linkin Park a different sound from so many other bands that blend the rock/rap genres. I found Linkin Park to be rather refreshing. The content of their songs may not be about socially relevant topics, but with skillful song writing they are emotionally relevant. One of the greatest aspects of music is that people can relate to it; it touches our hearts and exercises (not exorcises) our souls. Like master artists, the band has released an emotionally charged album that expresses human existence. If you're a fan of the rap/rock genre, this album shouldn't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!!!!!!!!","review":"I believe the lead singer (Chester) has the most amazing voice I have ever heard.

These guys are definitely on my favorite list. I read about them and found that they will literally stay after a concert until everyone has a chance to meet them. Wow!!! I'm an instant fan!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS ALBUM IS SO AWESOME!! YOUV GOT TO BUY IT!","review":"Being a 14 year out girl im not the expert on music, but this album is INSANE! The way this amazing band combines the sounds of rock and rap make this album ... well ITS THE BEST! Yeah many people compare the sounds of Likin Park to the sounds of Limp Bizkit but im tellin ya... NEVER COMPARE THE TWO BANDS! EVER! Listen to Limp Bizkits song Rollin and then listen to Linkin Parks song By Myself. By listening to the two jams im sure you would understand what i mean. Linkin Park seems to express their true feelings through their emotional lyrics and LB... say no more. I don't even wan't to talk about them. All in all LP is a totally an original band and no matter what music you listen to im sure you will absolutly love them! I know I do and i just can't wait until their new album come out! AHH I LOVE THEM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great debut album","review":"Linkin Park has a very interesting sound to them. they are a little mixed in Rap and Scratched tunes...It works sometimes and doesn't on others...Although, you might have heard them already..you should still consider purchasing this album on the grounds that it is different and there are better tracks than the singles you've heard >i.e. in the end and crawling< so if you don't buy it, i think it is still worth one playthrough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linkin Park never gets old!!!","review":"I have had this cd 4 a year and i'm still not sick of it. It has great songs like \\"Papercut\\", \\"One Step Closer\\", \\"Points of Authority\\", \\"Crawling\\", \\"In the End\\", and \\"Place for my Head\\". All the other song rock too. \\"Cure for the itch\\" is all Mr Hand scratching alot. This cd is always on in my house. It never gets old and uh... go bye it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst rock albums I've ever listened to","review":"Over the past few years, Linkin Park's songs have had constant radio play. I never liked the way they sounded, plus I couldn't really tell the difference between one of their songs and another. My friend said that if you just listen to the radio you're going to think that but the albums are very diverse. So he lent me Hybrid Theory. Surprise surprise when it was more of the same. I wasn't able to tell when one song ended and the other began. With the Screaming, Rapping, DJ Scratches and a singer that sounded like he was straight out of a boy band it got me wondering what happened to Mainstream hard rock. Bands like AC/DC, Guns 'n Roses, The Motley Crue and Led Zeppelin. Without the accompaniment of advanced recording methods and by being fun instead of having angst-ridden lyrics they made beautiful music. Unless you liked the manufactured angst-ridden sound of modern hard rock, I suggest you start looking into the classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"how did i ever like this cd......","review":"YES I ADMIT IT I USED TO LISTEN TO LINKIN PARK!!!!! I used to call this stuff....great. Then I found some good music and slowly started to see what this actually is...and that is crap! For me the cd that changed my tastes for the better was Laterlus by Tool. After that I went in search of cds that were actually good. Through this search I came up with great stuff like Ozzy, Nothingface...etc. After you begin to branch out alittle you will realize just how stupid and repatative this movie really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Tracks","review":"Pusey is one. This a great CD/DL and even if they are rich kids they crank out deep and serious jams..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable Stuff","review":"I don't know why, but they sound like little boys making some noise. In a good way though. I really like \\"Papercut\\" (like a whirlwind inside of my head), \\"Points of Authority\\" (I can rap the rap now...sort of), and \\"With You\\" (chorus feels so good to shout out in the bathroom). \\"Runaway\\" -- well, who doesn't feel like that sometimes? I really like the title \\"A Place for My Head\\". LOL. \\"Cure for the Itch\\" is a cute little thing. They sound so sweet when singing together in the chorus of \\"Forgotten\\". Good clean fun, snappy, sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hybrid Theory by Megan Leckie","review":"Hybrid Thoery is FANTATIC, Linkin Park are a truely Talented band and deserve all the success they get, I love Meteora also, and all there other CD's. I also HIGHLY recomend there Live in Texas CD, they sound fantastic, they know how to please a crowd, and can actually sing and play there instruments unlike alot of bands. Hybrid Theory is 1 of the best albums ever (the others are also Linkin Park albums), they have made a great album and hopefully will continue to do so for many more years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dont listen to all the other stupid people-this rules!","review":"I was a little skeptical, but I figured I would just buy it. This is the best cd I have ever listened to and I would recommend it to anyone! You might read some of the other reviews, but they dont have their head on straight! (no offense) This is the greatest and these boys have so much potential and so much talent! I am telling you all, buy this cd. They are awesome! You wont regret it!!!! I am so serious, this is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hybrid Theory - A great CD","review":"This CD is great overall. You don't have to skip a stupid song because they are all good. It comines the heading-banging and sound of rock with rap. Not terribly hard screaming metal rock... the perfect mix. The band members of Linkin Park are extremely talented... they can sing unlike some other rock groups, could be the next backstreet boys if they wanted but they chose rock. This CD is worth the buy. And.. for the parents out there whose kids like rock and you don't like content this is a rock CD you can let your kids listen to without guilt. The subject matter is clean and you may have noticed that the cover doesn't say explict lyrics on the cover... thats because there are no explict lyrics maybe a couple not so friendly words but you can't really hear them. In conlusion- great quality cd and kid \\"safe\\"!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can truly relate","review":"I heard this cd just days after breaking up with my girlfriend. I could truly relate to many of these songs and they have helped me deal with this because they are so true. I would have to say that \\"In the end\\" is my favorite song because it is actually what i went through. Every song on this cd has real emotion. A must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An epic album, Linkin Park = my new favorite band","review":"This is the best album I've picked up in a long long time. It's rare to find a cd where every single song rocks. I can listen to their songs over and over. Intense sound, good melodies, and a better mix of rock/rap fusion than stuff that's out there now. as a bonus, the lyrics aren't pointless. I love Linkin Park! You can get your angst out by listening to this band. Can't wait for their next release!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, but too short","review":"Awesome disc. I bought it with knowledge of only One Step Closer, a foolish proposition with this genre. But I am thoroughly impressed start to finish. My only complaint is that I paid $13 for a 37 minute disc. C'mon guys, lets load the cd full next time... at least 60 minutes. Maybe write a song longer than 3 and half minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hybrid Theory is a SPECIAL album","review":"Well, I'll be short. Guys, I'm not gonna waste your time, so...just a few words. The first Linkin Park's LP is something special. Hybrid Theory is one of the CDs that's supposed to be in your collection. Believe it or not - I find it one of the most great albums for last 10 years or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST CD EVER MADE!!!!!!!","review":"i happen to be a huge fan of linkin park's \\"In The End\\" and so i checked out what people thought of it on amazon and once i got their cd it blew me away! i mean, my god, they're sooo good! this is the best cd ever made like i said in the title, so if you happen to have heard them on mtv and you wanted to just see what people thought of this cd, i will alwayz say, GET IT! itz worth your money!!!!this is a KICK [REAR] cd!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Mistake Me","review":"Don't mistake me. Linkin Park rules. While all the additional songs are great, is it really worth [the money]? What the hell?!?! I bought it for [less](okay, I bought it in Asia). 5 extra tracks (Papercut live, Points of Authority live, A Place for My Head Live, My December, and High Voltage) may be worth an additional [amount] for the rich hard-core Linkin Park fan, but downloading it off the net would be a lot cheaper.My December is somewhat like a very slow In the End, but gets tedious if you listen to it everyday. High Voltage is the black sheep of the album, totally unrock like, but very catchy and fast pace. The live tracks are basiclly distorted versions of the original that is either annoying or else refreashing. Overall, this is an excellent album that is way over-priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"too bad","review":"A badass CD. Seriously felt it. The only thing that sucks is that the song \\"My December\\" isn't on it and you have to buy the ... import C.D. to get it.. Oh well that's why we have mp3s!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd","review":"This is a good cd in which most of the songs are good.1.Papercut- Fast-paced song and really catchy. one of my favorite songs on the cd.2.One Step Closer- alright song good the first couple times i heard it now sort of annoying3.With You- Pretty good song.4.Points of Authority- alright song don't listen to this one too much.5. Crawling- Great song you'll have it in your head after you listen a couple times.6. Runaway- Another great song one of my favorites7.By Myself- Don't listen to this one much. its not that bad of a song though8.In the End- Great song my favorite song on the cd.9.A Place for my Head- another good song nother one of my favorites.10.Forgotten- good song11.Cure For the Itch- probably the only bad song on the cd12.Pushing me away-good songOverall this is a good cd and you should get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"my ears hurt","review":"I'm the type of person who would buy a CD if there's just one song on it I really like. For me, that song is \\"Crawling\\"...I love the screaming and the distorted guitars. Usually I prefer alternative rock and generally hate any rap-metal, past or present. But linkin park do a great job of mixing in the rap...not overpowering or trying to make it the focal point. I know nothing about the band really and haven't seen any videos either. I'm just going by the music and think there's not a bad song on the CD. I really like the first song too...cool intro."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should you buy this? Of course!","review":"This is a great cd. Its has a good rythym and beat. The words are true and make sense. It is a good tune to listen while ur on the road or in ur house, thats if you like rock. The group is great, its like a mix of Staind and Nirvana. Only better. \\"Cure for the Itch\\" doesn't really have words but a mix of beats. Then Crawlin, Papercut, One Step Closer and Etc. are fabulous. This is a must have. Listen to the samples and know what i mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great debut spinning up a whole new musical style...","review":"A great debut spinning up a whole new musical style by dragging korn to the edge of nirvana and shoving it in nine inch nails which is one of the many best combinations possible. I'm not saying everyone is like this cause everyone's a bit different and I myself am into really freaky psycho cool crazy music so I'm into nine inch nails and all that other stuff. And though I'm a true rocker, I'm only nine so linkin park is good because they take my favorite bands which all by the way are parental advisory and shoves them into a clean cd that truly rocks. So just relax and do the funnest thing in the world, jammin or moshin and just take it all of your mind and jam to something besidesw thirty second samples. Now how are you gonna do that without buying the cd?Figure that one out for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linkin Park is amazing","review":"I can listen to this entire cd straight through.

I could play every song over and over and still feel the same. Each song has some personal experience related to it, and that's what I love about it. I can relate to it. Supposedly, Linkin Park has just released Reanimation, now I have a problem with a band just redoing their last album in two or three years, and re-releasing it. Come up with something new, please! But otherwise, this band kicks, and I love their music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A breath of fresh air","review":"It is hard to find a band out there that can resist mindless screaming and growling. Linkin Park manages to put out, what I think, the most innovative, and enjoyable albums since Incubus released Make Yourself. Park fused many different sounds to creat one outstanding album. I just can't say enough of how good it is. One of the very rare albums you can actually listen to all the way through. That just does not exist anymore now that all anyone wants is to have that ONE hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linkin Park is Awesome","review":"Linkin Park is a hot new band who combines techno and metal wonderfully in their debut album hybrid theory. Their first hit single \\"One Step Closer\\" is a great example of their unique blend. The song \\"Papercut\\" even has a hip hop sound to it. If you like Papa Roach then you will definitely like Linkin Park."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff!","review":"After I heard One Step Closer on the radio I knew this band had something, and after listening to their whole album, I'd say Linkin Park is my new fav band. The best song on the CD has to be Points of Authority. Other good songs are Papercut, One Step Closer, A Place for My Head,among others. Buy this CD, rock fans, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"one word 'WOW'","review":"I heard this cd at least 5 years ago and even still, no other music can even come close to competing with LP. Best cd I own actually. Worth every dime."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Linkin Park Album","review":"Hybrid Theory is loaded with Linkin Park's best songs. \\"Papercut,\\" \\"One Step Closer,\\" \\"Crawling,\\" and \\"In the End\\" lead the way in the album. \\"In the End\\" is my personal favorite, and it is a favorite of the radio, as this song is the most played song on the radio by Linkin Park. Chester Bennington has great vocals and Mike Shinoda does a good job rapping; and I am not a fan of rap at all. Linkin Park's music is fantastic; they are loaded with talent and know how to use it, and because of that have raised the bar of rock by one level. It is hard to combine rap and rock together, but they somehow do it and do it well. Rock on Linkin Park, you have done well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good starter Album","review":"When I first got \\"Hybrid Theory\\", I was really disappointed. There were only two songs on there that I really liked. As I listened to it more, I started to like it more and more. The Album is a great fusion of Hard Rock, Hip-Hop, Techno and Rap, combining all these music styles into one great album.Now I'm a big fan of Classic Rock, bands like Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Who, The Beatles, etc. but I really enjoyed this album. It was unique: It had lyrics that reached out to you; Hard Rock Riffs that made you shake your head back and forth; a catchy electronic/hip hop based rhythm.I recommend this album to anyone who likes Alternative Rock and Metal/Rap music. However, I'm sure even if you don't like alternative metal or rap you might still like this album since it has any different styles in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hybrid theory","review":"Amazing album that endures the test of time!!!!

Meteora is a great album, but this one beats it just by a little. Memorable songs like \\"Crawling\\" and legendary songs like \\"One Step Closer\\" and \\"In The End\\" make this CD the best. All the songs rock and Linkin Park's style is so full of talent and exraordinary rythym. This album is dark and I like that about it. I got tired of that happy, teeny-bopper, preppy sh*t that the pop scene has come out with. I didn't even start liking rock music until this CD came out. All the other bands just weren't good enough.

I just think that this new generation has really missed out on good authentic hard rock music. To me, I know its just my opinion, Guns N Roses was a true hard rock band. (May they rest in peace) Nobody could match their energy or intensity ,certaintly not this lame band.

Not only do they have much better turntablists, but their lyrics ACTUALLY F*CKING MEAN SOMETHING, it's not just about how painful it is to have millions of record sales and 20 cars in their driveway but their mummy and daddy don't love them.

The rapper is bad even for a rapper. Chester can't scream and is a pussy. How did I ever like this pour excuse for music. Don't buy this!!! Want good music? I suggest The Beatles or Pink Floyd. Want good rock? Go for Led Zeppelin, Jimmy Hendrix, or AC DC, want metal? Go for Metallica they rock? Want Punk? Go for Rise against, NOFX, Pennywise, or Bad Religion. Want stuff that's on MTV? Get Blink-182, Sum 41, Green Day and Yellowcard. Want rap? Get better tastes in music! I can't believe I spent almost $30 on this CD and meeotra.

Okay, in a way, they do perhaps. They have good taste in indie hip-hop (Kut Masta Kurt, Aceyalone, etc.), and they have a better grasp on melody than, say, Limp Bizkit. But still, weak lyrics, tired sub-Faith No More riffing, and a pretty absent reliance on hip-hop does not a good album make. Linkin Park seem like nice enough guys, and their intentions seem better than (...)Fred Durst and Scott Stapp. Their music, however, just doesn't move me in any way and ends up passing itself off as a Korn imitation only much less vulgar. Nice try, guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak...","review":"Linkin Park is pretty much pop music. Have a catchy riff, depressing lyrics that relate to troubled teens and add a bit of rap then you have yourself a hit.I admit that the tunes are very catchy and have a nice beat. But that's about it. The mindless screaming and uninspired lyrics really leave something to be desired from this album.I really wish people would come up with something new. Instead of constantly singing about how bad they have it. You think Linkin Park is having problems? Hell, they are rolling in dough because you bought their album! Listen to something with substance and character, instead of mindless ranting about how someones girlfriend broke up with them or how the establishment is bringing them down.I'm not saying people should listen to obscure music or get into artistic rock.

You have already heard almost every song on this over hyped load of tripe, so there is no point pulling every song apart....If you like your music sqeaky clean, with electronic drum tracks, loops and digitally fixed vocal (yes kids! the lead singer cant sing! and the sound live is awful) then go ahead and buy this album....This band sucks, and rates up there with hoobastank as the worst thing to happen to music since true \\"metal\\" was killed by Korn and Deftones...Go and buy a Strapping Young Lad album instead....shut up! shut up! shut up when im talking to you!!

The lead singer's screaming voice is enough to annoy anyone after a few songs, the sound of the band is nothing special, and it was just... boring. Every song sounded just about the same - if you flip through the tracks, you'll see what I mean. The lyrics are extremely unoriginal and dull, and frankly, I don't really care about hearing all their problems (that's all they sing about). Linkin Park is just another of those mass-produced group made to make money. Don't even bother buying their CDs. If you have to listen to something of theirs, download Points of Authority or something that's bearable... and if you've already bought the CD, I suggest chucking it into your swimming pool."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"This is horrible the biggest piece of rubbish I have ever heard it is record industry ... all hyped up ...

Unfortunately it seems to have become an industry standard to include songs of angst and depression on every album then release them as a single. Linkin Park play too much on the rock-rap movement that is so big right now. This scene seems to have exploded and other bands seem to jump right on the band wagon. It happened in Seattle and it's happening now. Whilst bands like Korn, Limp Bizkit, RATM and the Deftones paid thier dues and became stalwarts of the rap nu-metal sound, what you have is other bands like Linkin Park, Taproot and Crazy Town riding on and disturbingly cashing in on their success. Like I said, underneath all of these crappy gimmicks like 2 singers and a turntablist lies a decent band I'm sure. Let's hope Linkin Park can find their own orginality and step away from the try-hard Limp sound....sell out anyone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too early","review":"Linkin Park have plenty of potential. However, by some freak occurance this album has made a huge impact on the music industry. This is a shame as their sound is not mature enough yet. They are still finding their feet and this really comes across in the dreadfull and samey songs such as \\"Paper cut\\" and the over-rated crawling. Still, if you like mindless sloppy guitars with a small rat man screaching and some guy trying to be black then this is for you. Let's hope this dreadfull debut doesn't put any serious music fans (Not small 14 year old Offspring junkies who think their hardcore) off buying their next album which might just be good. Linkin Park are not worthy of their \\"Nu Metal\\" label. Or as they put it \\"Death Metal.\\" Please. If you were to put all the songs on a straight cycle with no pause between you wouldn't notice them changing. Just too samey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This sound has been done to death time to move on. It would be great if a metal band learned to write a song that didn't mumble some whining about \\"my reality\\". These guys are a little lamer than most. \\"I'm crawling in this skin/and the wounds won't heal.\\" What the hell are they talking about. The heavy metal crowd does more whining than acoustic folkies these days. Pompous, empty and limited musical ability. Some music."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's official...I hate Linkin park","review":"For a time there, I loved them. Then I liked them. Then I sold the CD and was like \\"they're kind of good, but not for me\\". But now I hate them. This is not rock, nor rap. Where's the originality in today's music? Where are the guitar solos, or inventive lyrics? And why do they make awful videos? Crawling is like the worst song ever. Techno/rock/rap? God, no. It needs more substance, more thought, more energy. It comes off as boring and there are a million better bands. And when a genre-bending band like Lostprophets can efficiently make good music, why bother with Linkin Park? Please...stay away from this."},{"rating":"2","title":"LINKIN PARK IS DA BOOOOOOOOMB","review":"I really gotta say that linkin park is better than any other music i've listened to..

I say if you ever liked Rock and Roll, rather it be Led Zepplin in the 70's or Van Halen in the 80's, then I can't see anyone suddenly not liking today's Rock. It is all Rock and Roll.

Not a bad song in the bunch and every song a potential hit (excepting for \\"Cure for the Itch\\"). Fun, energizing aggro elements and some decent lyrical ideas. Not to mention those great videos that came out with their hits. I can't really pick highlights for this CD because they're all so good. LP never sounded or got better IMO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quit saying anything on cd is bad","review":"Does anybody here really understand just how good this cd is? I don't care if it's been done before. I don't care if you think some of the songs are redundant. I don't care what kind of music you like. If you do not like this cd, then what in the world do you listen to? This may be the only cd I have that I can listen to straight through and enjoy every song.

We don't want, \\"Linkin Park's the best band ever!!!\\" and no details. And we don't want, \\"If you want real rock, go get... and if you want real rap, go get...\\" All bands sound alike if you use that philosophy. Hybrid Theory is the first and best by Linkin Park, with hits like Crawling, One Step Closer, In The End, Papercut, and Place For My Head. Yes, most of the songs take a rap approach. However, if you REALLY search for \\"good music\\" you would listen to all the songs and not say that Linkin Park is crap with no talent. Linkin Park introduced a new variation of rock... many other bands have a lot of rap too, and I don't hear you talking about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't sing, they yell!!","review":"I trhink this cd was not such a great one [like all the other ones] the only song I kinda like is In The End, but that's pretty much oit! as I said earlier, they don't sing, they yell!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most OVERRATED band today","review":"I agree with Pete. Linkin Park is just MTV rubbish. They get way too much radio play and they're on MTV way too much, and they're not really heavy at all. Same beats, same riffs, same lyrics repeated all over and over again. Chester Bennington is the most whiniest vocalist I ever heard, his screaming is so weak, and of course Mike Shinoda is a pathetic excuse for a rap vocalist as well. Phil Anselmo whips both their sorry asses anytime, and of course his screaming is way more stronger and agressive than Chester's. For REAL metal, listen to old Metallica, Pantera, Killswitch Engage, Superjoint Ritual, Down, Chimaira, Slayer, Shadows Fall, Arch Enemy, Deicide, Mastodon, Cannibal Corpse, Dimmu Borgir, Cradle Of Filth, Cattle Decapitation, Sepultura, Carcass, and Morbid Angel. Spare yourself from this, it's nothin but overrated mainstream crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many more of these bands can we take?","review":"Linkin Park is just another rap-metal band in a scene flooded with bands that are no different from themselves. Apparantely they think that, since they have not one, but TWO singers and they didn't have a bass player as a full time member on the cd, then they are \\"different\\" and therefore don't fit in with all the copycats. Well, sorry to say, but they do. It's so sad to see how watered down and commercialized rap-metal has become because of bands like this. It actually used to be a respected and interesting style of music, but now only Rage Against the Machine can claim to be any of those things. I can't wait until the day this whole thing dies out and all these bands are gone so we can get some REAL music back on MTV and radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique","review":"First, most people hating this are the one that probably listened to just a song or two. Thought the album contains a nice blend of music! I don't know why people compare this band to others, they're so different, It's not limp bizkit, these aren't \\"empty tunes\\" and you get the feeling the singers actually sing and not talk to you. Some don't like the DJs work, just listen to \\"A place for my head\\", It can't be better than this, prefectly fits. Best ones : By myself, in the end, one step closer, paper cut. All the others rock too. Defenitly one of the few album I found without a track I dont like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Respect the theory.","review":"This funked up nu metal rap sound is unstoppable. Chester and the guys satisfies with focused lyric-intensive tunes. Something that various bands of this genre seem to lack. Hmmm...bizkit anyone? There is no fillers on this twelve tune disk. All the songs are incredible with solid guitars and perfect drum layering. This sound is now and is designed to appeal to the youth of today. It's here to stay. If Papa Roach freeks your bean then Linkin Park will most definitely be in your bag.Salute the hybrid theory!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the 0 star button","review":"Oh no! yet another trendy \\"nu-metal\\" band, as some reviewer said this is \\"disposable music\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overrated album in the history of music","review":"Since it's release, I've probably heard this album all the way through well over 75 times -- involutarily. Never in my life did I ever think that an album could be this infectious.The album essentially has only one song. That's it. That's how original this band really is. It's terrible. There is absolutely no variation at all between any of the 12 tracks (notice I didn't say \\"song\\"). You can skip around all you want and you'll hear the same stupid crap -- whiny lyrics, pathetic side rapping, some really crappy programming, dropped-\\"D\\" tuning with guitar that sounds like it was played with only one finger. No soloing, no variation, no key changes (not even between songs), no time changes -- nothing at all. It's about as monotonous as Ben Stien's normal speaking voice from \\"The Wonder Years.\\"Oh, well -- whatever sells 7+ million records.

Another great thing about linkin park is that they dont swear at all so i dont get any greif from my parents. theyre comparable to bands like korn and limp bizkit, if you like those bands, get hybrid theory, you wont regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD Ever!!","review":"If your looking for a new alternative, funk, punk, rock, and metal band, look no further!Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory is one of the best CDs I have ever heard. Almost every song on the CD is awesome. Any one of these songs can make the band big. They are already big with \\"One Step Closer,\\" and will continue to grow in popularity when, song tracks, 1-6, and 8,9,10, & 12 are possible new releases. The next best song on the CD would have to be \\"In the End.\\" This is an incredible song, and will probably be the band's next big hit.If you want a CD that you can listen through the whole thing without having to skip a track, this is the CD for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linkin Park Hybrid Theory","review":"This is one of the best cds I own. Every song on this cd is awesome except for Cure for the Itch, which is a cheesy dj sample. If you have ever heard the song One Step Closer and you liked it, you should buy this cd. When I got this cd I had only heard the song One Step Closer, and I figured that would be the only good song on this cd. I was dead wrong. Linkin Park seem to have combined the style of Limp Bizkit and Korn beautifully, and if you don't like either of those two band don't be so quick to judge this cd. It is great, and anyone who likes any kind of popular music will like this cd. You can find traces of rap, rock, even the crappy boy band sound (and if you don't go for boy bands, which I don't, don't worry there isn't a whole lot of that crap on this cd). I would recommend this cd to anyone except my grandparents. The only cd that would get a higher rating from me would be Smash by The Offspring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Band At The Moment","review":"I had no idea who linkin park were when I got it, but when I heard the cd, it was like something I never heard of before. I used to like limp bizkit but somehow I couldn't get this cd out of my cd player and instantly linkin park became my favorite band. Chester has this amazing voice throught the cd that he show. He can sing really really low or really really high.When Chester and Mike sing at the same time, it's unbelievable!I love every single song on the cd but if I had to say which song was my favorite, I would say \\"Crawling\\".It is a great rock song.If nobody liked linkin park, they wouldn't have sold over 6 million copies. That means 6 million people like linkin park and you should too because they are the best rock band at the time.Get this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD ALBUM","review":"THESE GUYS ARE TRUE RAP/METAL ARTIST.

Thank God. One Step Closer is a good radio hit, played out really quick. But the rest of the CD is absolutely wonderful. They are nothing like Limp Bizkit (once again, thank God). But has anyone actually listened to the lyrics? They are the most refreshing thing I have heard in a long time. They are a hard-er rock band that isn't singing about the same played out stuff. You all know what I'm talking about. \\"I hate the world, I hate you, I hope you die, I'm so much better than you, I'll kick your (....)\\" It's a great band, with lots of lyrical talent, and no one seems to give them credit for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST CD'S THIS YEAR","review":"WOW!!!!! When I bought this I surely wasn't expecting to hear what I paid for. But this awesome disc proved me wrong!!! There are alot of other good songs on here rather than One Step Closer, there are others like \\"Crawling,\\" \\"In the End,\\" and \\"Forgotten,\\" still One Step Closer is a good song it just gets tiring after awhile. Overall for a new band this is a great CD and I highly encourage you to get it. A great CD for some of the kids who are not aloud to get the Explicit Lyrics CD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all for a rap/rock band","review":"I am typically a punk/ska fan and when I heard Linkin Park's first single \\"One Step Closer\\", I didn't think much of it. When I heard the song more, I began appreciating it more. Yea, I know it may sound weird but my fav songs of this album are all the singles: \\"Crawling\\" \\"One Step Closer\\" \\"In The End'\\" and \\"Papercut\\" is their best song out of those singles. In this review, I just proved to you that you don't have to be a Papa Roach, Limp Bizkit, or Korn fan to like LP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd but cool.","review":"I don't mind some of the alternate music out there, but have never been a great fan of rap. But this album is very interesting. The blending of the two styles compliment each other perfectly.In an industry where so many clones and bands start to sound the same it is refreshing to find a group that is doing their own thing.If you want something different then buy this cd and play it LOUD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A cross between nsync and a lousey hardcoreband","review":"First let me say I don't own this album but my friend does and she plays it constantley.I don't know the titles and the band members' names but I do know I hate this album.It's another rap,metal,industrial,pop blend that misses the mark.I think they're going for a \\"sick and twisted\\"sound but instead they got winey and sugarcoated.The rapping on this album is lame and sounds similar to the cringe-worthy stylings of 311.They spent way too much time on production and style and not enough time on honesty and good song writing.Don't get me wrong these guys have talent but musical ability can't carry an album alone.Basically it sounds like a cross between nsync and a bad hardcore band which is fine for a joke but these guys are serious."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME HYBRID THEORY","review":"This is probably the best album I've heard for a while. All the songs are great. With a blend of rock and hip hop it's just perfect. I'm not really a big fan of rock, but I give props to this album and this new band Linkin Park. All the songs in this album can be released as singles. Hope to hear more from them in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST CD OF ALL TIME!","review":"This is a really good cd, I don't necisarily like rap music, but i love this cd. It really relates to real life and all the songs are good. Some people thinks some of the lyrics are angry, but there is no cussing so i don't see how they can say that! well all i can tell you is to buy this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best CD's I've Ever Heard","review":"This CD is great. Linkin Park is one of my new favorite bands. Lots of people think that they are like Limp Bizkit, but that is not true. Their style has a cleaner, stronger, clearer sound than any Limp Bizkit song. Their style of music is so diverse it's hard to put them in a category. I thought the best song on here would be \\"One Step Closer\\" but it definently isn't. If you want to buy this CD for that song that's fine, but that's not all the good stuff you'll be getting out of this album. I think it's great how Linkin Park has shown that you can make great rap rock, better than Limp Bizkit in my oppinion, but not have to cuss to do it. Definently buy this album. It's worth every penny and it will never get old."},{"rating":"1","title":"N'Sync-core genre invented for LP and Adema","review":"This band and Adema sound like a hardcore Backstreet Boys conversion, thus the birth of the horrid new genre N'Sync-Core. This band is mainly popular with the same crowd that just graduated primary school, as anyone that has been into hard music before that time would see the sickness of this type of sound. No band should ever have a singer...takes no talent..this band has 2 and 98 degrees has 4, like I said about half Boy Band and half \\"x-treme.\\" Anyone that has been playing this type of music for anywhere over 2 or 3 years I'm sure is disappointed that nu-hardcore is mutating into Boy Band with guitars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative corporate sludge","review":"Originality. Innovation. Creativity. Three things utterly lacking from this album. Linkin Park sounds like Staind which sounds like Kid Rock which sounds like Distubed which sounds like Limp Bizkit which sounds like ... well, you get the idea. And yes, I HAVE listened to Hybrid Theory. Rap-Metal is corporate mass-produced noise, a very pale and childish imitation of the inventors of the genre over a decade ago: Faith No More and Red Hot Chili Peppers. If you want some quality rap-metal, check those two out. To be blunt, if you like Linkin Park, it is only because you haven't heard good hard rock music. And that's a shame, because there is so much great music out there that once you heard it, you would never waste your time with Linkin Park or the other corporate clones ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manufactured Commercial Boy Band","review":"As Pop is dying, it looks like the world need a band to replace the Backstreet Boys.Rap/Metal, the new thing. The stuff the kids like...so let's make a rap/metal album. It's a simple verse chorus verse, a part in order to make the song less boring, verse, verse, verse. It's not like these guys would have done much for their success, it's music made for the kids out there who are unable to listen to anything that's even a little more comlicated.MTV's new favorites, Linkin Park.Yes, no swear word, ain't that great? Now the moms are satisfied too!Linkin' park provides music for people who music don't have lots of time to focus on it. It's mainstream music for the masses. So highly recommended for people who prefer house and pop music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah Man, Soo Hardcore!!!","review":"This album is absolutely one of the most ridiculous musical efforts I have ever listened to. This is nothing more than a product manufactured for angry children who don't want to listen to music that is actually challenging. The subject matter is trite, all the scratching is silly, the entire thing is overproduced, it sound like it was sung by a robot. There is not a single shred of rawness on this entire album. It's a joke. Even posers know this is stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"come on!","review":"you actually listen to this? ha! it is just terrible teenage metal! there's too many bands playing that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best CD I've bought other than Staind's Break the Cycle","review":"Linkin Park's \\"Hybrid Theory\\" is the best Cd I've bought other than Staind's \\"Break the Cycle\\". I love every song on their debut album. I am so glad that this album is doing so great on the billboard charts. They make good music. It's unlike anything I've ever heard before. Every song on their album is great and none of them sound the same unlike other artists every song that they make is different from the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linkin Park debuts with a bang","review":"Dude, Linkin Park just totally blew me away with this album. I though that they would just be loud and obnoxious at first, but when I heard them sing \\"In The End\\" for the first time, I was amazed. The lead singers have awesome voices! They can rock hard and then come to such a mellow kind of song like In the End and rock in a different way. Three words, Off The Hook!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Denfinate Buy","review":"Linkin Park has got to be one of the best new bands to come out recently. They have taken the whole rap-metal genre and redefined it. This cd is must buy but for fans of this genre. Their music crawls around you and will suck you into their world. \\"Papercut\\" is a great song about paranoia and guilt, and \\"In the end\\" is about past misktakes. See, this is what makes Linkin Park different, all their songs have a meaning to them, unlike Limp Bizkit or Kid Rock. I don't know why people don't care for \\"Runaway\\" I thought it was a great song and could relate to it, I bet you could too. Anyway, this cd is a must for anyone who appreciates the fine art of rap-metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably deserves the fifth star","review":"This cd had napster to thank for the fact that it joined my collection. One by one as I downloaded songs from napster, I couldn't find one that I didn't like. After buying the cd I was pleasantly surprised. It is great from start to finish. Radio will no doubt kill this band by playing the same 2 songs over and over, but just about every song on the cd is a potontial \\"single\\". The rap part almost bothered me until I sat down and paid attention to the lyrics, but I was hooked on the melodic chorus's immediately. Put together it makes for catchy tunes with alot to say in each."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"classic Linkin Park. only one or two songs on the album that weren't my style. I love the opening to \\"Papercut\\" especially. sick beats!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Debut Album","review":"Hybrid Theory the debut album for Linkin Park, my favorite band. H.T is a great album the songs on the album are just awesome.I would recommend buying this album and every other album mad by LP"},{"rating":"2","title":"cures the itch","review":"A superb album that hits the spot when you're in the mood for accessible pop rock. Linkin Park appear to be berated by some for being 'manufactured'. I believe these guys enjoyed making (and touring with) this album and intended to convey exactly that, irrespective of the professional help they may have received along the way. It tickles me that some can be so arrogant as to imply that that the millions who bought and enjoy this album are morons. Agreed Hybrid theory's form is straightforward, and like all music it borrows from its peers, but I fail to see how these points exclusively constitute an argument for rubbishing it. Listen and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Without a doubt, one of the best albums of the year","review":"There is not one word that can describe now good this album and Linkin Park are. If you like One Step Closer and Crawling, then you will LOVE the rest of the album. Filled with Chester Benningtons powerful melodic voice and Mike Shinodas clever rapping skills, this is one album which you MUST buy. Comparing it to the likes if Limp Bizkit is an insult, can you ever imagine Fred Durst writing an album which DOESNT contain swear words??i think not. Linkin Park have been able to show different emotions without swearing very successfully. Songs such as Papercut and By Myself make you want to mosh like crazy where as With You and In The End, are calmer but just as good, if not better. HYBRID THEORY is one of my favourite albums in my CD collection, it should be in yours too."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great cd","review":"good lyrics, tight beats, its good, get it. f**k the guy in the red hat, he should have his a$$ beaten. listen to linkin park, toss the bizkit, its limp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, but needs to be longer.","review":"I believe this CD is excellent because the songs are a great mix of rap, rock, and even techno. Linkin Park shows in this CD that they can make great songs using beats from the rock genre and lyrics from the rap genre. Also, \\"Hybrid Theory\\" offers more than just bland, repetative songs in which someone would lose interest. The songs in \\"Hybrid Theory\\" have an effect on the listener by making him/her let a lot of closed in emotions out. If you enjoy rap/rock bands such as Limp Bizkit, then this CD is for you.There's no doubt that this CD has a lot to offer, but I feel that only 40 minutes for any CD wouldn't be long enough to be perfect. But Other than that, this CD is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linkin Park-TRUSTcompany","review":"A great cd. If you like this at all, get TRUSTcompany. Their cd is just as great as this cd. they are very undderated. Get TRUSTcompany and LInkin Park today."},{"rating":"1","title":"gets old","review":"This Album was pretty good when it came out but then just got overplayed. please don't get this unless you reallylike this kind of music. I don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linkin Park ROCKS!!!!","review":"Linkin Park is one of the best cds I have ever bought next to Limp Bizkits new album and everclears american movie pt 2. Linkin Park is a mix of rap and rock. I realy enjoyed It."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS CD","review":"This cd is simply wonderful. At first i thought linkin park was just some typical mainstream rap/rock band that had no core. I was definitely wrong. I heard \\"one step closer\\" on the radio and absolutely loved it. I bought the cd just for that song but found that i loved every song. Every song encompassed a unique intensity and emotional climax that i found irresistable. Linkin Park has a lot to say and what their saying has a complex crux. I love hard rock and metal and this cd just captured everything i love about rock. Get this cd!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too overplayed and won't last very long","review":"This album shows what can happen when several radio stations and mtv gets a hold of your music. This was just an ok cd a while back. This cd is a poor bland of music. The whining screams and rapping do not go well together. On top of that, three of their songs were played almost nonstop on the radio. Yes, it does get very annoying. And that is what happened to this cd. This band most reminds me of Limb Bizkit. The new style of music attracts listeners and then they get overplayed and eventually just turn to rap. Or are never even thought of in 10 years. If you are a big fan of rap/ nu metal you might like this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank-you Suzanne!!!!","review":"For telling it like it is. I would just add that this band's whining makes me want to strangle them. All this a-tonal sing-songy nurshry-rhyme style frat-punk ruling alt-radio these days has got to go.Some little interesting electronica patter comes on and then the next moment that painfully familiar Linkin Log guitar drone comes in again and I wanna puke. I feel sorry for kids coming up today who think this is music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible music","review":"This album was by far one of the worst purchases I've ever made. I had high hopes, then when I couldn't even listen through the full CD without needing a break, I knew it was poor quality music. It sounds like Linkin Park tried to blend hip hop, rap, metal, rock, and electronics together in a style similar to that of Limp Bizkit. The high-pitched male vocals (when they're actually SUNG) grate on my ears, and the clashing music genres drag down the album the whole way through. This music seems to appeal mostly to angst-ridden teenagers who believe they've been through pain, when it's actually just what everyone goes through in their adolescence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musical Ignorance","review":"Just another attempt by a band to embrace anger and pain, and yet again the result is irrelevent whining. Angst has become something of a money-making machine these days. Those bands who do have lyrical content that implies they have read a book or two get buried. From beginning to end this cd may actually cause one two bury there head into the ground and suffocate. Presently I am looking into cryogenics to wait for a few bands to come out with something to say. Eight years ago youth were yelling against injustice, and plight. Now they seem to be yelling because there car only has aluminum alloy wheels instead of Chrome. Im not one to waist my time reviewing new bands that are so incredibly bad. But Linkin Park just had fallen further into the hole caused by musical audacities."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've heard this before, and heard it better","review":"Can you say Faith No More? Or Biohazard? They were two of the bands who pioneered combining rap music with heavy metal, while they mixed it with a meaningful message (in Biohazard's case, it was a political agenda). Now enter Linkin Park, one of the more recent bands that it seems everyone is jumping on. First off, nearly every song sounds the exact same, not to mention it sounds like there is virtually no thought process to writing music; the same old downtuned guitars on every track. Not to mention repetitive choruses, contradictory lyrics, and the same harmonies on every song as well. Chester Bennington has an interesting voice however, and he could do a lot better than with this band or this music. This is nothing more than Faith No More for the new generation with downtuned guitars, inconsistent drumming, and annoying rapping. Do yourself a favor, check out Faith No More or Biohazard, they're the real deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly reccomended.","review":"I bought this CD knowing one or two singles a long time ago, not expecting to be what i thought it was. Five years later, it remains my most played CD. This isn't one of those CDs that has two listenable songs and then the rest is filler, for every song is just as good as the others. It's not really metal, and it has bits and pieces of electronica and hip hop to mix it up so it doesn't get old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Awesome!","review":"... \\"Hybrid Theory\\" is amazing. I usually don't by CD's, but this one was worth every cent. I can totally see how they managed to out-sell all of the already reputed groups [recently]. They have an outstanding sound. Granted, there are a couple of songs in the album that I don't care about, but over all, this CD is amazing.Fans of this type of music won't be disappointed! I can't wait to see/hear what Linkin Park comes out with next!They're absolutely amazing!By the way, if you haven't heard these yet, I strongly suggest listening to the following:\\"In the End\\"\\"Crawling\\"\\"Runaway\\"\\"A Place for my Head\\"I immensely enjoyed those songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD like no other","review":"Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory is like no other CD out there. You couldn't copy their style if you tried. I had the pleasure of seeing them live last night and it was incredible. I even got to go to a meet & greet afterwards and the guys were really friendly. If you don't own this CD, you are a minority, go buy it now. No matter what genre you listen to, rap, rock, punk, you'll like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAIL.","review":"Decent rapcore/nu metal (I use those terms VERY loosely here) began and died at the genre's roots: Bands like RATM and Faith No More.

First off, I'd like to say that they do have good voices. But, what are their songs about? Absolutely nothing. Lets think about deep lyrics such as \\"Everything you say to me/takes me one step closer to the edge/I'm about to break.\\" these aren't \\"feelings\\" They're just ... words. They're very un-original songs, I have to say. But, we have all the other unoriginal artists such as, nsync, briteny spears, metallica, etc etc. Yes, they do have good voices and they're getting big on money but what about lyrics? If you want a CD with impacting lyrics and meaningful songs, I suggest you continue to search elsewhere and not waste your time here...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Imitations!","review":"When I heard the song \\"One Step Closer\\" I immediately thought of how pathetic this band really was. They are trying to copy the sound of Limp Bizkit and doing it very poorly. The lead singer tries to pull off the high-pitched screaming/rapping that is signature Fred Durst, and fails miserably. Limp gets in verses around the middles of their sings that have some sort of screaming (\\"Get the f*** up! DJ Lethal, bring it on!) in the middle with heavy metal in the background and the sounds of DJ Lethal. Linkin Park attempt to do the same with \\"Shut up when I'm talkin to you\\". This could be the most pathetic rock rap attempt I have heard since Vanilla Ice's \\"Hard To Swallow\\" in '98."},{"rating":"1","title":"The end of Nu-Metal","review":"This is the crap that killed Nu-Metal & opened the flood gates for other limp wristed \\"Nu Metal\\" (im 15 & did poo poo in my diaper) bands to flood our airwaves with their lets get weally weally angry and scream in the verse, then sing in the chorus & over expose our music!

After awhile, however, the novelty began to wear off. Just recently I listened to it again, and I realized why I first loved it. It's still a great CD, I just listned to it to much. I really don't know why it's good. I'm certainly not a \\"nu-metal\\" fan, but I can honestly enjoy Linkin Park. It's a good CD to have around."},{"rating":"1","title":"What IS this?!","review":"Wow... Linkin Park sucks so much, I can't stand it. Anybody who listens to this should be beaten and analed with a blackjack. Linkin Park is NOT metal you handi-tards, it's POP music.

I wish I could give it a zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lets Face The Facts Kiddies","review":"Ok lets all admit that \\"Nu-Metal\\" Has become a joke of itself, just like grunge became in the 90's.

Unlike others, they did not stick to one style of music. Some people criticize them negatively for their latest albums but I rather listen to something new than hearing songs with the same music but different lyrics. You gotta give them credit for experimenting with different stuff than sticking to what makes them the most money."},{"rating":"2","title":"12 years later and still a classic","review":"Although many thought that rap-rock would fade in 2000, this band brought it to life. This CD has sold more than 10 million copies in the United States alone and over 28 million worldwide. Everyone who was in their teenage years at that time grew up listening to this band. There's not a single track that I could skip over (even the songs they took out that were originally supposed to be in there like High Voltage and maybe My December?). This band was more melodic than other rap-rock acts at the time and had two frontmen who can both sing/scream and rap. Chester's vocals in Crawling are probably what won them a Grammy for that song. I don't think the band can ever live up to this album due to the timing and emotional history they had to make this record, but all this talk about fans wanting Hybrid Theory again makes this album a true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd, one of my first","review":"linkin park was one of the the first bands i really got into. this cd is their best by far. its loud and pretty heavy (compared to meteora at least) there isnt any songs that i would skip. i really really hate rap but the rapping they do in this cd really didnt bug me much, probably because i knew that i would be followed up by an awesome riff and chester screaming his lungs out. i bought this cd a long time ago, around the time when it first came out and i still give a listen now and then."},{"rating":"2","title":"fully sick man","review":"this has to be one of the best albums ever released. i can pick this cd up when ever i want and listen to it all the way through every time!!! ya gotta love their music and how different they r to everything else"},{"rating":"2","title":"I recommend that everyone at least listen to this album...","review":"When I first heard \\"One Step Closer\\" on Q101, my first reaction was 'Who is this band?' the very next day when I went to the mall with my friends, I was upset to find that Best Buy was sold out of Linkin Park. When I went back the next day, and saw that they had it, I was ecstatic. I went home and listened to the entire album. My personal fave song on this album is \\"With You\\", but \\"In the End\\" and \\"Pushing Me Away\\" are close seconds. There isn't a song on here that I don't like. \\"Papercut\\" and \\"Runaway\\" are also very good. All in all I give this album a 5 star review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding CD now available","review":"This is what I have been looking for. Having an impressive collection of rap-metal (Korn, Limp Bizkit, etc.) they all begin to grind the same after awhile and therefore have a short listening life.

My favorite songs are crawling, cure for the itch, papercut, one step closer. Its a good cd to rock out to. The way they overdub guitars is very cool.

I've been waiting for this CD to grow on me, like all good CD's do, but it just hasn't. Now when I ask my friends if its good, they all say \\"its ok, but it gets old after a few listens.\\" And I agree whole heartedly with them. Its ok, but it gets old after a little while.

And the bands aren't totally to blame; it's also the greedy record execs or whoever $ign$ them to the label, knowing full well they stand to make TONS of money.

Then in February, I found out that Linkin Park started out as a rap group (i don't like rap at all), which made me reconsider my thoughts about this band. Then I heard \\"Crawling\\" on the radio and fainted. That is by far the worst on the disc even though none of it is good. When I liked them, I thought it couldn't get much heavier than that.

I don't consider these guys metal or even hard rock for that matter. They're just a bunch of metal posers that only little 12 year old girls consider to be heavy. If you want metal, listen to bands like Hatebreed, Slipknot, Pantera, Otep, and the list goes on. When you compare Linkin Park to these bands, they don't even go in the same category.

Not only to powerful lyrics that anyone can easily relate too but also to great music. A lot of people catergorize them under the rapcore genre and while that may be true, they take it to great lengths.

This CD does it from beginning to end. Rap'n'rock with killer riffing, lyrics with real depth, a fantastically rich, full sound, and vocals that can recall the Queensryche stratosphere.

But since Ive gotten into the ultra heavy and talent filled genre of Melodic Death Metal, and only now do I realise the simplicity of bands like Linkin Park. Power chords fill up each song, with a constant use of scratching. The singer even pulls out boy band vocals on a few songs. Song structure is all too simple and the guitar work is 4 million miles from anything resembling something technical or difficult. Bass is hardly audible on any song.

I am not, nor will ever be a fan of the rap/metal fusion that is popular right now. That beeing said, Hybrid Theory is a remarkable album. The music behind the band's raging lyrics is impressive, catchy, and well played. Songs like \\"Pushing Me Away\\" and \\"In the End\\" are extremely well written and performed.The most amazing thing about Linkin Park is something that is lacking. After I heard \\"Hybrid Theory\\" for the first time, I didn't think that I had really heard the lyrics. You see, ther is not one piece of foul language on the entire cd. Not one. I would be comfortable playing the cd with my grandmoth around (not like she'd listen but...)\\"Hybrid Theory,\\" to me, stands above other fusion cds.

After I listened to more and more bands from the 70s,80s, and 90s, I found that bands like this don't measure up in musical quality. This band became too popular because its songs have hooks that an inexperienced ear from this generation will at first think is the best thing that ever came out.

After realizing that the underground metal scence was full of greedy untalented crap like Morbid Angel, Testament, Iron Maiden, Amon Amarth, Nile, Suffocation, Death, Judas Priest, 3 Inches of Blood, Children of Bodom, and Cryptopsy. This Linkin Park band shows you that melody and heaviness can be combined in a brutal way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry Boy Band","review":"Its astonishing to witness how many overtly anti-boyband teens can be vacuumed into the genre by sneaky music producers. Of course these boy bands are given coarse voices, bleached hair, and angry lyrics, but the idea is the same. Linkin Park is the packaged product of producers who are trying to be like Limp Bizkit(A heinous crime in itself, superseded only the crime of allowing such an untalented and asinine singer as Durst to make it big). Not convinced, \\"take in the end\\" and get it to the part where they have the \\"put my trust\\" solo. Then have a girl listen to just that cut and listen to her response.

It has strong lyrics backed by hidden parts such as bass. While some may feel that Linkin Park is not a real band, they have obviously not listened to the other tracks on the CD besides the much over-played (It's still on pop music radio stations, which is sad) \\"In the End\\", which still is a good track, despite being the track of 2002. Hybrid Theory should be an essential to any good CD collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's what you make of it...","review":"People either love it or hate it. The one's who do love it, say its sounds like a mixture of korn/limp bizkit/godsmack. Personally, when I heard runaway on the radio and a friend a day before suggested it the album, I thought what the hell and bought it. Much to my surprise, there are only so few albums that I can listen to without skipping to the next track, and this is one of them in my own opinion. I love it! First time I heard the whole album though, it reminded me of Korn (follow the leader), NIN (pretty hate machine-believe it or not), and 311 (transistor). Some of you might think I'm on crack from thinking this...anyhow, it's not bad at all.

I have bought this CD on two occassions. (I lost it once LOL) This album is perfect for a person who has lots of drama in their life, cuz they can relate to the lyrics. Let me tell ya, I can understand where LP is coming from. My favorite tracks are Crawling, Pushing Me Away and With You. This CD only leaves my CD player when I am taking it somewhere else to play, wheter its a discman, a friend's house or the car. I can't leave home without this CD, except for whe I got basketball.

They most certainly are not into this kind of music--probably country and western! I cannot think of any song on this CD that isn't a work of art!! They are truly geniuses and they really make a great band together. My brother gave me this CD and I was mesmerized by it. I listen to it over and over again. My 4 year old even loves it and I have even caught her singing to the songs!Those who don't like this CD are just way out of their league. This is truly great music.

An excellent addition to any music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good beginning, needs some work","review":"I've been waiting a long time for the true synthesis of rap and metal to emerge (since Run DMC and Aerosmith did their little gig with \\"Walk This Way\\".) This album has an excellent driving sound and does a good job of mixing the rap dialog and its associated elements (scratching and big beat) with the raspy metal sound of the lead singer and guitar. Yes, the music is not always too complex and the lyrics are still a little juvenile, but compared to their contemporaries (Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock) it can seem at times like Shakespeare. Really the only thing that is glaringly in need of change are the times when the lead singer, Chester Bennington, goes into his Sam Kinison like, hyper-accelerated yelling, which are few and far between.Overall, this is a good album, but their second album ought to show whether they will choose to extend their talents into the unknown and make a new sound, or follow the dark path and become the glam band of the new millenium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD.......... Ever!!!","review":"This CD is by far my favourite. When I bought it I couldn't take it out of my CD player! I like their blend metal and rap. Chester and Mike have amazing voices!My favourite songs are A Place For My Head, In The End, and Crawling. Out of those I would say In The End is the best because of its softer sound and lots of rap.This is way better than any of those bands out there. They don't copy people (coughlimpbizkitcough), they have their own unique sound.1 thing for next album. MAKE IT LONGER!!!It doesn't matter what type of music you like, this CD is for everyone!!!

After my friend hooked me up the CD and the over-repititious playing of \\"In the End\\", I found out Linkin Park is pretty cool. Besides their sweet music, another good thing about the band is their 100% clean lyrics, so everyone can listen to it, unlike their counterparts, Limp Bizkit.Unfortunatly, I have to bring it up... why is \\"In the End\\" so popular? I think it is a \\"Good\\" song, (3/5 Stars) but I also think it is overrated and it is a FACT that the song is waaaay overplayed. I'll even go as far as to say that that song is the worst song on the album. Perhaps it is just because I like upbeat music, but I can and do like slow songs. I just don't get \\"In the End\\" We made a cool nickname for the song, it's \\"The Funeral Song\\". Get it?

I'd recommend it to anyone as an occasional backup incase of a dead battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't work at all","review":"Unfortuanely this product is a complete waste. I have a 2010 Subaru Forester that dies regularly if the lights are left on...I tried using this on a completely unresponsive car, (lights left on all night) no go. I tried this on a car that had only had the lights left on for 20 minutes. Still it did not offer enough juice to start my car. I tried it with both clamps on both post on the battery as a reviewer suggested that, and it did not work then either. I followed all directs for charging and even tips left by reviewers. I would recommend trying a different brand, from a local auto parts store where you may be able to return it if it does not work...this one will have to go to the hazardous waste dump, I guess. Bummer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MoPower2Ya","review":"...guys and gals, the trick to using this gem of a tool is to use it as a trickle charger for the \\"dead\\" battery. Clamp this little guy on, and allow 10-15 minutes for it to do its duty (the wait time is trivial-how long would you wait for AAA?). REMOVE the clamps and clear the Clore unit safely from the vehicle, and turn the key in the dead vehicle. This way is safest to recover a disabled vehicle (no sparks, no explosions or fire, no melted or shorted wires or cables, no injuries...), be it a car or a 1-ton pickup-with ANY size battery.JUST keep it charged; that's all it asks of its owner...The 12V outlet is nifty (its cover, disguised as a utility light, is a clever idea-use it for small-space illumination); I use it to power my netbook and my tire inflator...I look forward to sharing many years with this clever tool..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the compact car in your family!","review":"With my wife driving long distances and at odd hours I wanted her to never have to worry about a dead battery.

First, the clamps are so thick that they won't fit on my car (2003 BMW e46) or my friends car (99 Subaru).

I had it plugged in so it would be fully charged. When I tried to jump my car, that's when I found the label that I had to connect it to my battery for at least 30 minutes to charge it. That was the first problem I ran into. How do I leave my hood up when it's parked on a street. I managed to work around that. After 30 minutes of \\"charging,\\" there was still no power in the battery. I did see that the light on it get dimmer, a sign that power is going to the car. I decided to leave it charging a bit longer. After a couple hours, all I had was a car that wouldn't start, and a dead jump starter that didn't jump start. Oh, in case you are wondering, the car's alarm was off, no lights were on, even dome light. The battery was 11 months old.This is NOT a jump starter. It will not charge your battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I bought it to run 12 devices from the lighter socket, not to jump cars.I own a big blue Clore thing that works fine for that, but I wanted a smaller one to carry. The size of this is plenty to run the electronic devices I need to run.It turns out that the 12V socket is not deep enough to handle most 12V plugs. They pop right out since the socket is only about an inch deep, which is fine for the tiny light that comes with it.Every plug on every electronic 12V thing I have is much bigger, and the springs on the sides barely go into the socket, just enough to force the plug back out.Last time I buy something made by Clore.

They aren't boring at all in the hands of Prof. Alan Tyson. Through painstaking analysis of the kinds of paper Mozart used, Tyson is able to do some fascinating detective work--including the redating of several works, and the finding that Mozart's Horn Concerto in D (K. 412) was not even completed by him, but was finished after his death by his pupil Suessmayr! Tyson also recovers some \\"lost\\" music from Mozart's opera \\"Cosi fan tutte\\" and the ending of the Rondo for Piano and Orchestra, K. 386.These wonders are presented in writing that is sober enough to be credible, but is never dull.

Younger or less experienced electronic music fans might not take to this kind of thing, seeing as how it utterly lacks anything even remotely approaching a break, cut, or a drum machine. But for electronic music classicists, it doesn't get much better. As is typical for most Vangelis, old or new, the artist applies a classical composer's skills to the electronic medium, with unique and savory effect. Track 7 is especially beautiful, with its extended length and delicate harp. Vangelis is (in my opinion) an oft-overlooked musical genius of the late 20th century, rivaling more traditional composers like John Williams in terms of ability and style. Get this album and experience his gift, prior to the world spotlight that shown down on the man with \\"Chariots of Fire\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok.","review":"after \\"Bladerunner\\" and \\"The City\\", I've been reviewing more of Vangelis' work.

Mom sends him off with a backpack and tells him to help our heroine. Do you think mom might have planted some sort of locator on son and is using him (without his knowledge) to track our girl?

However, if you are good at tests, this is the book you need. I studied for 4 hours (read the material and did the first practice test. Then did a the practice test in the Offical CLEP Study Guide 17th Edition) and then took the test. I scored a 62 without using any other source for studying.

The format of the book and the accompanying CD-ROM isvery usable...but the problem is that the information in it has little tonothing to do with the real exam that was taken yesterday. The actual exam results were 20 points less than I scored on each of the 3 practice exams in the book. These practice exams and explanations gave a falsesense of readiness. I wish I would have used the actual study materials from the College-Level Examination Program (CLEP). When I called REA about the difference between the study guide's practice exams and the actual exam....they said I should write a review online? So, I am alerting people to use other study materials than this REA study guide (published in 2006). It resulted in wasted time and money for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile","review":"Purchasing this particular album was a bit of a gamble for me since Michael Brecker's Sax is not there, as on previous Steps Ahead albums. Surprisingly, Brecker's absence allows more of a statement from Mike Mainieri's Vibraharp, Synclavier, etc. The result is very cool and rhythmic with more of a melodic presence. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I have been using exercise videos for twenty years. I have nearly 100. That includes Insanity, Billy Blanks, Supreme 90, lots of Cathe Friedrich, and many more. I was very surprised that I was so sore after doing the Week 1 dvd for the first time. I chose to back off and spend two weeks working up to completing that disk because I don't like being sore, and there is no shame in taking your time. After that, I was able to work to my maximum on each disk without being sore following it. After completing Week 4, I tried a Cathe routine that had always given me trouble. I blew right through it.On the surface, this does not seem so cardio-based as most of the videos on the market. Insanity is rush-rush, hurry-hurry. Weider x-factor st is more strength-based, but you will be blowing at the end of each routine. On the off-days, you can pop in your old favorites that you used to think were doing you good.No equipment needed -- no step, no dumbbells, no ball. This is my all-time favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the beginning collector","review":"Don't expect a Heinlein collection, he's the editor.

Donna has 6 (1-6) the rest of the album is good also but not AS good. Some of the highlights for me are; \\"Why\\", Who's You Who's Me\\" & \\"Star Ferry II\\".

It has good background information and the stories of both sides of this conflict prior to the incident. It seems that it focuses more on the criminals, and what drove them to do it, but it lacks many of the officer safety innovations that the CHP developed after this incident. Everything from basic PMA to felony stops were revised because of this. While I was at the explorer academy, they stressed this incident to us over and over, and why we needed to be alert, in shape, and knowledgeable in out tactics as an individual, and as a team. Now I know why, after reading about the darkest day in the history of the California Highway Patrol. But the book is lacking, and could have been a bit better.

Her opinions are valid though. This is all based on the filters of her perception, her experiences and beliefs, mostly misguided beliefs.

It is poorly put together and falls into pieces with even the slightest bump. For example, if you bump it with your foot the wings (both body and tail) will fall off. The main door to the plane will not stay closed as it should. The numerous tiny parts are a mess and litter the play area. This is extra annoying when you have a younger sibbling crawling around looking for things to stick in their mouth. It's also a pretty big toy. Even so, Barbie and Friends barely fit into the cabin.

I believe the other reviewer cleared up this matter. It's the fact they were on the scene at a bad time. But don't let this stop you from getting this awesome album!!!The lead singer seriously sounds like a cross between Bono of U2 and the lead singer of The Cult. The songs at times are poppy, happy, dark, and just straight rock. My favorite has to be \\"Vanessa\\". It's a crying shame this band didn't go further. I am giving it four stars because there are a few songs that aren't up to par with the others on the album, but overall this is a band that needs revival in music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"Im sorry but this album is really bland with no real songs.

I bought it when I returned to Philadelphia for my grandfather's funeral, so I guess I really didn't give it a good listen to the first time around. Now from sampling it I am disappointed. I only heard one song from these guys on the radio down here in Florida, and that was \\"Believe\\". It still has the edge after 16 years, but the rest of the album was a washout. I don't know if an acid trip would've made a difference, or not as I listened to this stone cold sober. \\"I'll Stay High\\" was pretty good, and there were a couple of others, but it just didn't have the right stuff to be a hit album. I guess with one of the songs being called \\"F**K You\\" they didn't care."},{"rating":"2","title":"really good","review":"Not as good as LOVE POWER PEACE, but still very nice for quiet mornings.

The two books have entirely different titles,the author of one is not listed on the cover of the other,the publishers seem to be different and the dates of publication are different. Any reasonably intelligent ,trusting person would assume they were different books! Caveat emptor. I purchased both books,paid twice and about the only difference between them was one was hardcover and one was paperback...oh,and though the content inside was almost exactly the same,the covers were very different for some odd reason. I would search the library next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Gone in 60 Seconds","review":"This is honestly a better film than Gone in 60 Seconds. Toby clearly had more time, money, and experience on this picture. Gone has some nice car crashes, but they're stuck in an unwatchably amateurish film you'd be embarassed to make your friends sit through. This film isn't Oscar material, but the plot is about on par with most silly action films of today. There's lots of humor, and plenty of cars flying through the air, crashing and burning in slow motion.Also worth mentioning is that Amazon's special feature list is incomplete. The dvd also contains interviews with a few people from the production and a commentary with the production manager (Jack Vacek) and the director of photography (Tony Syslo)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guiness World Record 150 Cars Destroyed","review":"With a Titile like that how can you go wrong this was the second film for legandary director,producer,actor and true car guy H.B Toby Haliki his most famous film being the cult classic Gone in 60 Seconds this film while the crashes are incredible and the acting is notisably better I found it lacked something the story was a little had to follow and it laged a little at times but for anybody into cars,action and an all around classic GET THIS MOVIE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He's back again! but something is missing...","review":"I've always been a fan of Halick's films and to have them on DVD is almost too good to be true. This DVD is no exception. Junkman is another high-action, high-speed movie with lots of crashes. Some of the crashes are rather lame and were probably only added to make the \\"150 cars wrecked\\" tagline. There is one major disappointment in the soundtrack: all the original '80s music has been replaced with generic music loops."},{"rating":"1","title":"An auto 'Plan 9 from Outer Space'","review":"One star (hey, I'm being generous) for acting, direction, cinematography, editing, art direction, sound recording, writing, costumes, makeup and all those other creative areas that contribute to the magic of the movies. You'll be hard put to find a single redeeming feature in this nonsense. Halicki's other car caper special, 'Gone in 60 Seconds', was pretty dreadful in all the above departments but at least it had a cool forty minute car chase, which, thanks to film editor Warner Leighton, turned out rather well but even he could not do much with 'The Junkman'.There is plenty of chase action but most of it takes place in the safety of the Californian countryside and so loses the visual impact of a city chase with plenty of other vehicles and obstructions. Cars at speed on rural routes just look feeble.If you want chases stick to 60 Seconds and forget 'The Junkman'. BTW, it was originally titled 'Gone in 60 Seconds 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrecking Mania !","review":"If you what romance,go see a chick flic!You what to see stuff get trashed,this is the movie for you!This movie is about wrecking cars,planes,and a house.Is a great low cost 80's car film a was worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Suck.

The color was great,they fit my deep mattress,the price was great. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star was because the sheets were a little stiff. I washed them twice both times adding fabric softener and they still are a little stiff and they \\"sounded a little crunchy\\" when getting into bed. Hope they soften up after a few more washings. I thought with a 440 thread count they would have been more soft to the touch. Would I buy them again? Yes !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardboard Would Be Better","review":"Yes, the color is beautiful and rich. And yes, they wash well. But these are going into the trash because they are about as soft as cardboard. Some say they feel crisp -- I'd say stiff and scratchy. It's hard to believe that these have such a high thread count. I've tried everything: Softening sheets, liquid softener, plastic softener balls in the dryer. Forget it. I'm buying something else. This product may look good, but you won't, after a sleepless night on these terrible sheets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"I read all the reviews of these sheets before I decided to purchase. Now that I've purchased them, I'm utterly mystified by all the people who said they were \\"scratchy.\\" All I can say is: Huh? When they arrived I immediately washed them (who uses sheets without washing them, right?). They're absolutely fine. I can't stand the idea of paying $$$$ for sheets, so I always get mine at a deep discount store like Tuesday Morning or Home Goods -- or I used to buy them at Costco, before they stopped carrying full sheets. These are certainly comparable to anything I've purchased, and they're a very good value. (And you can get them in unusual colors!) I'd buy them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elastic in Fitted bottom fails completely in 5 months","review":"The sheet fabric is very nice, though I would have paid $10 for an extra 4 inches of length on the top sheet. The fatal flaw is the elastic banding in the bottom fitted sheet. It slowly \\"relaxed\\" with each weekly washing (warm water, newish washer). In less than 6 months there was no elasticity at all. The sheet, as a result, won't stay on the bed. It is a fatal flaw, with no apparent recourse from Amazon. These are premium sheets, they should last for years, not 4 or 5 months. I'd rate zero stars if possible. Don't buy them, buy something else. Pay a little more or less but these will fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Pictured product looked soft and silky. Quite the opposite. Very stiff for over 400 thread count.

My better half thinks flannel sheets are wonderful because he is obsessed with \\"soft\\" linens. Even he admits that these are good. No they are not going to be velvetly. If that is your definition of soft, then you may not like these.My set does not have the cardboard feel that some others reported. They are soft enough to touch and roll around on.

Between the two sheet sets, I prefer the feel and color of the Damask Sateen. The color was a perfect match for my Nautica comforter and shams. I'm not an expert in fabric or even sheets for that matter, but I do know is what comfortable feels like. Not only do they feel great, the subtle stripes look sharp and are very classy. The construction and stitching are also top quality. They have held up nicely after two wash cycles. A solid buy for under-$50."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordered King, received Cal King","review":"I ordered King size sheets and received a package with a King size sticker on top of a Cal King sticker.

If I were trying to exfoliate, they would be wonderful! But I was trying to sleep and for that they were a pain. I had to wear pajamas and sleep on a pillow that was not covered with a pillowcase from this set to make it work for me.Perhaps I am spoiled but I like good, soft sheets.

Sophie was the one who sang 'In Time' and 'Destiny' among others. These are two of my favourite songs by Zero 7.However, I am extremely disappointed by Sophie's solo CD. It's not the same style or sound, it has no songs that I would pick out as a really good piece of music, and her voice doesn't sound nearly half as impressive as it did in the Zero 7 songs.Overall I regret buying this CD and would tell people to forget Sophie and stick to Tina Dico and Sia - both their individual albums are good, and show that they work well both alone and in a group.Earthbound is a good title only because that's what the music is like, very earthy and almost like she's been living in the woods all her life trying to be like a fairy or something.Yeah...

Their old manager got them to sign a very bad contract giving him ownership of all their music up through 1970 (plus two songs from the 1971 album Sticky Fingers). Needless to say he and the Stones don't get along too well, so all compilation albums are either pre-1971 or post-1970, except in 2002 they mended fences a bit and released 40 licks, which has their hits from both eras.Update: There is now another, better, album with old and new Stones songs:Grrr!,GRRR!

Basically, he hopes Ireland will abandon its cultural past and join the grim narcissistic future that is in store for the rest of the modern world. Traditions are to be gladly abandoned. After reading three of Ardagh's series now, I am sure he is not a good man. His future world is a vulgar, crass, materialistic one in which a New Class and theuraputic state takes care of the citizen's needs and desires.

As a father of two young gamers and interested in what they're playing this one is my new favorite. Square Soft fans will find similarities in the story and battle system with the Final Fantasy series in Chrono Cross. But, CC I find is even better. The travel between map areas and access to items, while not radically different, is easier and more intuitive. Coupled with great graphics, characters and story this one is worthy successor to Soft's line and has us looking forward to FF IX. Parents who watch what their children play in video games should be encouraged to take part in this one with its intriguing storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it, one of my favorites!","review":"I'll start off by saying this probably my second or thrid favorite RPG ever, behind the flawless FFVII. I love the elments of this RPG, it mixes the puzzle menu thing FFII has, how you see and run into your enemies like in SNES' FF Mystic Quest, and probably more that I haven't seen yet. The graphics and art look beautiful and music is good also. The story is good and not very difficult to understand, yet it's hard to keep up the characters there's so many! It's pretty long, it took me a few months to beat the game and I find myself still playing it sometimes since I got it last year. I've never played the prequel to this game, because I'm cheap and wasn't into RPGs too much back in the SNES days, but I liked FFMQ. I've heard Chrono Trigger is amazing and sometimes referred to as the best RPG ever. So, buy this or FF Chronicles to see a good series with a Chrono Trigger!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chrono Cross may not have had the largest budget, but it has the largest heart.","review":"Graphically, Chrono Cross is nothing short of stunning. While Square's Final Fantasy is glossy and polished, Chrono Cross has an organic feel lacking in the former's \\"perfect\\" environments. Vibrant color, creative design, and just the right amount of ambient effects bring the settings to life. Again, while Final Fantasy drops your characters into a small subsection of a large, epic environment, Chrono Cross lets you explore every nook and cranny of scandalously detailed towns, buildings, and dungeons. While we don't intend to slight Final Fantasy's excellent graphics and design, many gamers will prefer the more down-to-earth, personal, and \\"gritty\\" feel of Chrono Cross. The environments are well worn and lived in, not just-constructed movie sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"chrono cross","review":"This game is one of my all time favorites, so to get it at the price I bought it was excellent. The game was in perfect condition and was delivered in great time. I would recommend buying from this company to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game, but I wish Amazon represented this product correctly.","review":"I ordered this item based on the main picture (shows the black box version), but they sent me the greatest hits version, which I don't want.What a waste of time.Otherwise, this is a great game. It was just a misrepresentation of the product sold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old School Goodness","review":"Definitely an awesome game. RPG fans will love it. Chrono Trigger fans will love it. And people who love super awesome story lines? Oh they are in for a treat!! It may be seven years old, but Chrono Cross still sets the bar for role playing games everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"I severely think this game is under rated. Its the sequel to Chrono Trigger but has almost a completely new engine. Personally, I think this game is great and deserves better ratings."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the classics","review":"In a world where RPGs are seeming to lose their originality, Chrono Cross brings a storyline that is original and different than anything else seen before (except Chrono Trigger in some ways). While most RPGs usually only let you have about 8 members in your team, there are 40 different characters to employ in your quest to find the Frozen Flame. The only catch to this is that you have to play a New Game + to get all 40. There are certain points in the game where you have to make a decision that will dramatically affect the way the storyline moves along. It all depends on what you want to do. The only bad part about this game is that it is just a little too short, but immersive anyway. The cutscenes are beautiful, the storyline is original, and the battle system is fun (even if just a little easy). You'll have trouble trying to find anything wrong with this game. If you haven't played it yet, go and buy it you sucker!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Don't Have This Game, You're Missing Out!!","review":"Wow, what can you say about such an adictive game? RPG fans, this game's for you! With highly detailed movies, deeply involved plots, and a fighting system like no other, this game will surely blow you away!The characters are detailed, full of personailty, and able to make you laugh, cry, or simply hate them! (^.^') With the recruiting system, you can't find all the characters playing the game through once. You have to beat it, and play again! Replaying value is great, because after you beat the game around the first time, you can beat it again for totally new endings! Now, how can you be unhappy with one game with several endings? Believe me, you'll want to play this game over and over.If you like Final Fantasy, Legend of Dragoon, or any of these type games, I recommend this for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEED to play chrono trigger first","review":"If you haven't beaten Chrono Trigger, OR haven't gotten to the VERY end of this game, this game's rating is probably a 2.5 out of 5. If you HAVE beaten Chrono Trigger, and HAVE gotten all the way to the end of this game, then the rating is a 5 out of 5.The graphics are pretty good, the soundtrack is maybe the best in game history (see Xenogears), but the characters and story range from awful to mediocre. If not for the context of Chrono Trigger, this is at BEST a mediocre RPG (and for typical Square fans, probably pretty below average). But again, the fact that Chrono Trigger exists makes this game, depending on your progress through it, jump to be being near perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A game you DO NOT want to miss!","review":"Chrono Cross isnt like Chrono Trigger, however, it does take after the game and formed itself into one brilliant RPG masterpeice. I have had it for 2 years now and i STILL love playing it over and over again, getting different endings, and re-living the storyline. You do not want to miss out on this game. Plus, i think some of the songs on it are pretty good for the game itself. A true must have game, BUY IT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say boring?","review":"This game had decent graphics and sound. It had an okay battle system. So it would be a decent game if it actually had a PLOT. What story there was in this game was incredibly hard to follow partially due to the fact that there were about a zillion playable charcters none of whom had personalities. This is one of the most boring RPG's that I have ever played!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Good Game But One Problem","review":"I love this game and think it is one of the greatest games of all time. That is why I recently purchased it from Amazon (or Hitgaming, but through Amazon). The game is great, but there is just one problem: the game freezes! At this one cutscene the game freezes and you cannot play it anymore. So, I called the customer support people at Square Enix and he said (God's honest truth) that there is a problem with the Chrono Cross games that Amazon sells. Also, for some reason the game freezes on a Playstation One and Two, but not a Playstation Three. Anyways, I mailed the game to Square Enix and they are gonna replace it with a working copy. So in conclusion, be warned! Do not buy this game from Amazon or you will have to pay for shipping and handling both to and from for a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"This Game is way better than all the final fantasy games put together. Unlike the Final fantasy games It has an original battle system, no exp or annoying Mp,instead you build up for your elements by attacking. You also have three different strengths of attacks. 1(low) 2(medium) and 3(OOOhhh thats gonna leave a mark) plus you can combine attacks with elements, like you could do a 1,2,3 then element or a 3,3, element tons of different combos. with 44 charecters you can mix and match(as long is serge is involved) into a party of 3.the only real downsides of this game is, Your have to forge your weapons/armour/accesories with stuff you find(kinda like a synthesis shop on FF9)and you can't change serges name to chrono."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game rocks","review":"Chrono Cross is one of the best games I have ever played it has great graphics, great movies, and excellent game play this is definitely a game to buy. I don't think it should be called a sequel it is nothing like a sequel it is way different than Chrono Trigger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Without any question, one of the top 5 Greatest Games Of All Time","review":"This is up there with Ocarina of Time, FFVII, and a few other such gods of the gaming world as those beautiful games that are the greatest ever made. They don't make 'em like this anymore. All I can say is, play this game. The story will change you forever, the experience will sweep you away. Playing Chrono Cross, hearing that melody of the opening cutscene and seeing and starting playing through that first area....the beach, the little seaside town....is as transcendental an experience today as it was a decade ago. If you never have experienced it, you need to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Chrono Cross is without a doubt one of the classic RPG's of my younger years. A sequil to Crono Trigger in theam only, nearly none of the original characters make an appearance, however, the idea of changing tragic events after they have happened remains current.The combat system takes a little bit to get used to, as it surely isnt conventnal, however, once you get the hang of it, you find the battles are very diverse and rewarding.This game has more characters than you can shake a stick at as well, which is fitting as the story is epic in scope. I wont get into the story as i dont want to ruin anything for anyone, however there are many plot twists, large scale events, and deep character development.While this game isnt (in my own opinion) as good as the first in the series it does have the great feel that squaresoft had before the buyout, as such i highly recomend this game to RPG fans.OEE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its okay but where is the story?","review":"When i first played this my first reaction was crystal clear. These are the best fluid graphics for a rpg in a long time. The cinemas are great and run at a great pace. For a person that didn't play chrono trigger i enjoy this game. The people in towns talk great and have more complex sentences then other games. The battle system is easy and you will have no trouble. But once i entered the first town of arni i thought it was cool. But when the people suddenly didn't know my name i got confused. I know the basis of the time line saga. But i didn't like when that occured. That is my problem with this game. Other than that i think this game is the man. This is a must buy game. The cinemas are on top, the characters are stacked up so you wouldn't have any problems choosing any characters. A hint is to have one main healer in your pary, and a really strong character also. I did this in Legend of Dragoon, it worked to perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Woah","review":"If you've played Chrono Trigger, then you know what to expect...however, this game has a more complex storyline, 44 characters, and amazing graphics...even though, it's somewhat easy if you've played through CT and the Final Fantasy series, it's worth buying...enjoy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great game with great characters!","review":"This game is awesome especially with 45 characters! My favorite guy would have to be...Harle! I don't know why I like her its just I really like Jesters and medieval stuff like that. I've beaten the game already and the Time Devourer was pretty hard before the final fight with him. I think the hardest guys were the Hi-Ho Darves the first round. I also started a new game plus. Glenn is a must have character. They are making a Chrono Break for PS2 I think. Pierre sucks at first but he gets better. I've never tried out Nikki though. Guile rocks! Well see you all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well.....","review":"Well heres my opinion on this game, i personally didnt think it was all that great. NO exp NO leveling up NO Magic Points (MP) WORSE story than the origanal. Sorry im getting ahead of myself. this is what happened i went to the video store and saw that they had chrono cross in i was so excited! i thought this game would be better than the origanal Chrono Trigger was but i was highly dissapointed. the story is EXTREAMLY slow and dull. and im not a novice RPG player so i know a bad story when i see one and THIS was a bbbbbaaaaaadddddd story. I really dont see why they had to dump Chrono and all the other charactors for the new 40+ Charactors! why the heck do we need 40 characters when you can only use 3 at a time? anyway thats my opinion. if you really wanna see how much this game stinks buy chrono Trigger or one of the classic Final Fantasys that game is the best RPG ever made!"},{"rating":"1","title":"its ok but....","review":"I was disappointed in this game.

Great f.m.v. good story with some nice twists"},{"rating":"2","title":"By FAR the best game I've ever played!","review":"This game is so amazingly wonderful! I totally thought I was going to hate it when I first turned it on. It looked too complicated and I assumed the learning curve would be high. However, within minutes I was hooked. And I played it for several months. This game is a two disc game and the first disc lasts FOREVER! The second disc is a bit disappointing, length-wise, but the game overall is phenomenal. Now I have got to get my hands on the original Super Nintendo game. The story line in Chrono Cross is so intricate and well thought out, I assume a great deal of it connects to Chrono Trigger as well. I am so blown away by this game there are not even enough words to describe it. I am sure every game I play from here on out will pale in comparison. I wish I could play this game forever! If you are an RPG lover, you have got to play this game. It can not be missed! And you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good luck going back to other RPGs","review":"Chrono Cross is a great game. With no random battles, no magic points, and almost no items, the game is incredibly easy to play. The ability to heal automatically after a battle eliminates most of the tedious work of healing outside of battle and the Stamina system is one of the most flexible and easy to use systems out there. Chrono Trigger vets will be amazed at the references in CC, and the story stands on it's own. One little problem: El Nido, even with two worlds, is just too small. A must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best game i own","review":"this game is the best game i own . fun from start to finish. the graphics are the best i have ever seen. you are switching from 2 diffrent world alot but thats the best part. i do suggest that you get the guide when you buy this game. its needed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Square does it again!","review":"Crono Trigger for the SNES had, in my opinion, the best and most memorable music out of just about all SNES RPGs I've played. It is VERY gratifying to see that in the sequel, Squaresoft paid attention to little things like that that made the first game so great. In addition to the sound, everything, and I do mean EVERYTHING about this game is great! It ties into the Crono Trigger timeline perfectly (once you get far enough into it anyway), the gameplay is great, and there's over 40 playable characters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chrono Cross","review":"This is one of the best games you will ever play.

No one could truely say why this game is so cool you have to experience it for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Impressive but Chrono Trigger is better","review":"The reason why I gave it 4 star is cuz the main character Serge is ugly, Crono in Chrono Trigger is better looking than him, anyways, the girls are cute so it's alright, the storyline have alot of ideas stolen from other RPG games, some ideas are from FF7, if you think for a moment you will know what I'm talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best only from Squaresoft","review":"This game gives you everything.

If you played and liked Chrono Trigger then you have to get Chrono Cross."},{"rating":"2","title":"another world of SQUARE's fantasy","review":"Chrono Cross was released in Japan as the last game of the last century by SQUARE and it is definetely a piece of art that is somehow different from FF series. For those who have played Chrono Tigger would enjoy this game even more since there is a connection between two of them.The battle scene looks remarkably like Final Fantasy, however it uses a totally different system.The game lets you choose from over 40 characters and their levels (?) DO go up regardless of if they have participated in any battles or not. The only negative to it is there are too many characters to choose from and only three characters can attend battles and the main character needs to be included unless....Overall, this is a game anyone can enjoy, it is similar to FF, contains fancy movies and good story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool!!I love it!!","review":"Okay,my friend played this game so I decided to try it out.I bought the game and all I can say is WOW!The graphics are beautiful and I like the poem in the begining.I love the idea of magic points thrown out and using elements by equiping them.There are alot of characters I gotta admit,but its refreshing to have variety.I like the story alot too,I haven't finished the game yet though,but I am on disc 2.So far I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest game ever!","review":"This is the greatest game of all time I loved it from beginning to end. The storyline was deep and immersive, the characters were well thought out and creative. If you've played Chrono Trigger and havent yet played this game then you are missing out big time.

All role playing fans out there this is a game you do not want to pass up."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Love RPG's, Then You'll Love Chrono Cross","review":"All I have to say is that this game was so well put together that every one should like it in SOME way. There are TONS of characters(almost too much) each with his or her own story. The storyline is so amazing that I can't wait to see what happens next. The graphics are so real when they show the seens that I have played the same part of the game so many times I have lost count, just so I can see the amazing graphics of the one part. The battle system is great and I always hate games where there are just random fights. In this game you can see the enemy and you can avoid most of them( not including the boss fights of course). One last thing. The music is so moving that it shouldn't be on a video game.

All of the reviews gave it the best scores. But when I finally picked it up, I was perplexed. I seriously had to wonder if Square was bribing the reviewers.The game is simple. The story is easily forgettable. The game is easy and the action is boring. With a ridiculous number of playable characters, you aren't given any motivation to really care about any of them. The only reason to get the characters is for a Pokemon-type collector's fix.I don't write reviews often, but this game is so overrated that I felt compelled to speakout. On the other hand, I guess if 95% of people loved it, chances are you will too. I just reserve the right to say \\"I told you so.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but...","review":"Chrono Cross is a good game. The Graphics and the story are better than those of the last two Final Fantasies. But, the problem is that there is no challenge. RPG newbies this is a game for you. You can't lose this game. No matter what, your characters will all be the same level and they can take down the boss with the right magic. The endings are great. The graphics are incredible and worthy of the Chrono title, but hte game itself lacks challenge.

But the gameplay, graphics, FMV's and battle system are great. Although it's an excellent game, I still think Chrono Trigger is better. I replayed chrono cross twice with the option New Game + and it wasn't as good as replaying Chrono Trigger with the same option, I cleaned up my dusty SNES, and I played CT.I also have to say there are some plot holes between CT and CC, I'm aware of the SatellaView game, \\"Radical Dreamers\\", but I still don't know what happened in that game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, but cannot get past disc 1!","review":"Chrono Cross starts off much like its predecessor, with the protagonist Serge living a carefree life in his home village. However, adventure comes his way, and Serge is whisked off into a tale of adventure. The game takes a while to pick up, but when it does, you will be engrossed in it. The music is brilliantly coordinated with the story of the game, and the presentation assures this as a worthy sequel to Chrono Trigger.There is one problem...The game freezes!The disc freezes during a cutscene towards the end of disc 1. Apparently, it's a widespread problem with Greatest Hits copies of Chrono Cross. This doesn't come up until well past 30 hours in the game, so it is hard to test for it. Keep this in mind when buying Chrono Cross."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Reasons Not To Buy This Game","review":"I don't know what basement the people writing the positive reviews about this game come from,but in my perspective it was not worth the $10 dollars I payed to buy it off Playstation Network.Storyline: The plot was slow to develop and even after beating the game I found it lacking.Leveling: Your level is based off a \\"Growth\\" system meaning you will have nearlyidentical stats at identical spots throughout the game on multiple playthroughs (which i didn't bother doing).Graphics: Just your average playstation visuals.Music: I must admit the music was well done, that's what gives the game it's 1 star.Characters: At first the idea of 44 or 45 characters sounded fun, until you realize that as a result of the vastamount of characters, the \\"character development\\" suffers.My Recommendation is that people wanting to buy an old school RPG instead buyLEGEND OF DRAGOON (which hit Playstation Network May 1, 2012 for the low price of $5.99)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not NIB","review":"I just wanted to put a review up here for all of you collectors to see.

Then I went out and got this game and couldn't believe how bad it was. For one thing, there are a ton of characters, which only Serge and two others can battle at once. The battles are absolute torture. I hate the sysytem of percentage points for each type of hit. Even if your over 90% you miss half the time. The only game that I have ever played that successfully pulled that type of battle system off was Xenogears. The element system is a waste because you can only use a specific one once per battle, and they last a long time. They don't do a very good job of character development (except fo the main chracters). The story is just as boring as the gameplay. The only redeeming thing about this game is the graphics. Save your money for something that you can actually enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should in no way be related to Chrono Trigger","review":"Chrono Trigger was a great game.

You wont like this game unless your under the age of five, even then you'll think the story was writting for someone even younger than that. SquareSoft needs to make another sequal having Crono (from the orignal, and the greatest charecter of all time) wakes up from a horrible night mare and be like \\"heh like that ever gonna happen.\\" I would give this a 0 or negeative stars if I could and is not even worth 5 dollars in my oppion but that is mine you have your own to make, I strongly sugest you dont purchase this game"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest Dissapointment.......","review":"Okay.

There are 5 suits and you must follow suit if you can. Points are generally face value. But the turn-around is that when you win a trick, you get all of the cards EXCEPT the card you won with--the card with the highest point value. That card is given to the player who played the lowest card that round. All cards won must be displayed on the table. At the end of the game, there's a scoring twist, in that you score the face value of the card ONLY when you have won one or two cards in that suit. If you have won more than two cards per suit, each card is worth only one point. That means in the final rounds, strategy can involve letting someone else win a trick that puts her over the two-card limit per suit and deprives her of points. David and Goliath is different, and fun, and plays quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good yarn for juvenile readers","review":"Children of all ages who love yarns about the French Foreign Legion ought to try the granddaddy of all such books, UNDER TWO FLAGS, a classic 1867 adventure novel by \\"Ouida\\", pseudonym of the English novelist Marie-Louise de la Ram&#65533;e, 1839-1908.ISBN: 0192823280"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Tale of the Missing Chapters","review":"This is the second copy of Beau Geste that I have received from you.

Like someone who didn't have word processor skills tried to format the book and then printed it in their basement. I loved this book when I first read it and was excited to find a copy. I said I was going to keep it in the review just to have the story but I think I would almost rather not have it. Very disappointing. Sorry for the abrupt ending in the video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeper than you'd think...","review":"Only superficially a book about the French Foreign Legion, this 80+ year old book still holds interest today. A combination romance and discourse on loyalty and devotion, the book starts slowly and drags a bit at the end but the middle 90% is terrific. It is one of those special books that you will think about well after you have finished it. It is surprisingly contemporary in many of its devices. Sgt. Lejaune could have easily been a one dimensional \\"bad guy\\" or martinet but instead is clearly shown to have redeeming (albeit martial) qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Font is Unbelievably Small","review":"I'm sure the story is good; most of the reviewers have endorsed it enthusiastically.

So who is guilty?All three brothers flee in an attempt to take the blame for a crime which he did not commit and they all end up joining the French Foreign Legion.Forget the three or four feeble attempts that were made to turn this into a movie -- READ THE BOOK!While Beau Geste is a classic in and of itself, one does not get the whole picture until they read the other two books in the trilogy:Beau SabreurandBeau IdealI am still reading and re-reading my copies which were published in the 1920s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Beau Geste","review":"Beau Geste is a thrilling adventure tale about the French Foreign Legion, which puts the reader in the middle of the desert, feeling the heat, wind and discomfiture. The author writes with authority about the conditions the legionnaires endured, including one long row of mattresses, not individual beds.Also, the book is a mystery, tantalizing the reader about what happened and why at Fort Zinderneuf. Additionally, the reader sees how the upper class English lived at that time.The book is a mirror into another time, a journey worth taking. I give it five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geneology, not Civil War history","review":"It was quite a disappointment to find that almost 300 pages of this 400 page book were dedicated to a roster. The roster appears to come directly from the National Archives compiled service records. Only 39 pages are dedicated to telling the history of the regiment. The roster is just the basic information from the Natl. Archives and there is no indepth statistical analysis of the regiment. This book is very basic and would rank near the bottom of regimental histories that I have read over the past decade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geneology, not Civil War history","review":"If you are interested in Civil War history I would recommend that you leave this book on the shelf. However if you have a family member who served in the regiment then it might be a nice keepsake.

Most of the pages are filled with the names of roster of the regiment.There is very little to grab hold of in this book. Even the roster seems to be limited to what was found on the National Archives Compiled Service Records.

(They are used to electric toothbrushes so we know the toothpaste is the problem.)The tube is very small so it only lasted about 3 weeks for 2 dogs with nightly brushing.

As an avid collector of Hi, Stax, Atco, etc, there's a reason I didn't recognize these songs. It wasn't their rarity, it was the fact that these songs didn't hail from the classic sessions that one thinks of when you think of soulful grooves. There are exceptions. The Erma Franklin rendition of \\"Light My Fire\\" is bananas!! That alone got this cd the two stars. But all in all, if you're into the funk, go for Funky 16 corners or Keb Darge, and if you're lookin for real soul grooves, think Dave Godin or the new comps from Kent.

He jacked BIG's entire style from rap to clothes to video's, and that beat he jacked for his \\"hit\\" single compton is from a classic dancehall song from over 10 years ago.

This is the whackest CD I've heard in a long time, the only reason I put one star is because I can't put ZERO. It took me 10 minutes to listen to the whole thing because it hurt too much to listen to it all. As soon as he said \\"JESUS!!\\" like biggie used to I was done with it. The Sister Nancy \\"Bam Bam\\" sample is hot for the track \\"Compton\\" but that is the only thing I like about this CD. The lyrics are weaker than macaroni and cheese commercials, and it is all stupid stuff that has been said before, beyond cliche. Don't waste your money with this one, if anything buy the single \\"Compton\\" and ignore the lyrics, that's the only way you'll be satisfied.

Because he has none."},{"rating":"1","title":"He doesn't really sound that way....","review":"I listend to this album on the internet for a little while and i compared it to some Biggie songs and was not surprised to see the sound match. So i then messed around with a DJ thingy i have only to find the voice was edited to sound like B.I.G. he doesn't really sound that way at all. I am sad to see someone would studio change his voice to sound like Biggie. For the album its horrible. Lyrics don't even sound right when you listen to them. Not one song is NOT about women at some point in the song. Overall i give him something for having the balls to put this out using voice changers to make it sound like B.I.G. and for using Biggie Type lyrics on some of his songs but that can't even save the album from being horrible.

I purchased this LP soon after it was originally released. Trapeze was a very interesting band and I always felt it was a shame that Glenn Hughes jumped ship to Deep Purple. His best work really was with Trapeze after all. I did see this band in '75 or so without Glenn and they still did a great job, but he was missed.If you're a Trapeze fan I would first buy Medusa, then this."},{"rating":"2","title":"WE'RE JUST THE BAND","review":"As far as three guys go, this is definitely great rock n roll! Galley, Hughes, and Holland, unite again for a barn burning set of intense music. Their careers were way too short, at least as Trapeze, but their influence on the music scene was immense. The vocals of Glenn Hughes are undeniably great, as is his deep bass sound. Galley and Holland are no slouches on their instuments either. This disc starts out on fire with \\"Keeping Time\\" and burns through til the title track, \\"You Are the Music, We're Just the Band. Another couple of my favorite tracks are \\"Coast to Coast\\" and \\"Loser\\". This CD is a great dose of unforgettable 70's rock that is still as vital today as it was then.

Fortunately, I did not buy this monstrosity, I merely borrowed if from the library (and couldn't get it back there quickly enough). What's wrong with this recording of \\"In Spite Of Reason\\", you may ask. Well the music is bad, the lyrics are bad, and the singing is bad. And I'm not talking ordinary, run-of-the-mill bad -- I'm talking REALLY BAD. Other than that, no problems whatsoever. What a waste of resources to have this garbage recorded.If you've lost your gag reflex, and would like to have it back, just listen to a track or two from \\"In Spite of Reason\\".

This blow up globe was perfect for the long, rough trip. I used it to show the people I was visiting where I live, and where their village is, because they had never seen a map before. The globe was useful for showing where the typhoons that hit their village come from, how close the Philippines is to other countries, and whatnot.I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the individual US states are not shown on the map of the US, so I had to draw in California with a ball point pen.

It comes with a hanging cord and a patch repair kit. It is a beautiful globe. I wish it came in 16 inch size.When inflated, all the other globes are \\"squat' and irregular in appearance, not round.

The only problem I faced, and that being a major one, is as I soon realised that the air globe would deflate every 15 minutes. I am sure I received it that way because there has been no mis-handling since I laid my hands on it unless something went wrong while filling it up. I do see a puncture kit in the package though. I need to get this thing drowned in some water and see if I can \\"nail that puncture\\".But yes, my low rating is purely for the punctured globe I received. It might just have been one bad piece in the stock. It had to be mine!01/22/2011: The hole is along one of the folds and the puncture kit does not help in sealing it.

I loved both of them. I was quite frankly disappointed with this purchase for the following reasons:1) The art in the US version isn't as clear as it should be. The picture is kind of grainy and in some scenes, the lines in the characters aren't as crisp as they should be. Considering what can be done with computers and special effects these days, Unearthed Films could have done a better job retouching the appearance of the film.2) The Devil and Daniel Mouse has scenes missing from it. At first I thought I had a defective disk until I read another reviewer who noticed the same thing. If Unearthed Films was going to take the time to put Daniel Mouse on DVD, they should have made sure it was complete.Bottom line, if you have to have this in your collection, get the one disk package. Only get the Collector's Edition if you have to see the CBC version for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charles Solomon is an idiot","review":"Don't believe the \\"it's not a memorable film\\" garbage from Charles Solomon.

There are some interesting morality issues brought up as well. Obviously not one for the kiddies. Though the music (of that era) plays a heavy role, it's not JUST about music...there's alot more going on.If you want an intelligent movie that doesn't treat it's viewers as morons, with a great rock theme/score, you can't go wrong.Long time fans have been rabbidly screaming for this movie, and now it's finally here.

The storyline was good. The characters are likable (even the bad guys). The music is great. Twenty years on, snippets of the songs still surface from the murky depths of my poor mind.

I feel very comfortable with this mount keeping my TV safe.It is a bit stiff however, moving it around takes a little TLC to make sure you don't push or pull too hard and smack the backside of the TV's edges against the brick walls.

From the first 5 minutes I knew I had wasted my money and was wasting my time watching this train wreck of a movie. Tracy Morgan and Katt Williams are some of the funniest comedians out there and Ice Cube showed off his comedic acting with the excellent Friday. The whole premise of the movie is brought on in the first 5 minutes and from there on is bad acting at its finest.

So much more could have been described with the budgies and the artwork. The mute character was not developed to be dark until the end of the book. I was not suspicious of him in the least.

In this film, they make a party school and pretend it is real until they are discovered and have to prove to the authorities that it is a school worth saving. This same plot was done in a movie just a few years ago called Old School. The only difference is that they were trying to save a party Sorority house instead of a school, and had to prove it worth keeping. That movie was way better.

It felt like it was missing something. This movie reminded me of what was missing in Ricky Bobby and a lot of other comedies. Accepted was not only a fun comedy movie with delightful young actors, especially Justin Long; but it also had a nice little message about everyone having their place in life. Most comedies strive to grab you with dirty humor or little sight gags. I really enjoyed Accepted for the fun film that it was. The movie did not try to be more than it was, a nice little 90 minute film with some great scenes and memorable characters. Well deserving of its PG-13 rating. A surprising 4 star movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Histerical","review":"I just saw this movie yesterday on my friends iPod and i couldnt stop laughing for the rest of the day. It is definitely in my top 5 favorite comedies of all time. One of my favorite lines in the movie is when Schtrader tells Ambrose that he thinks about Monica when he mastu.... You gotta see it for it to be funny. Theres about a million more great lines. Also just the idea of the movie is genius, a college reject makes a school so he isnt looked down on by his family, and eventually becomes a school of rejects.

And what is up with the one guy who dresses like Jack Osbourne (or alternatively has the '70s John McEnroe headband and hair)?There are some classic moments that just fall flat. Plus there are plenty of headscratcher scenes. In one the dean from a rival college reveals on Parents Day at the \\"Accepted\\" campus that the school is a fake. So why don't the parents all throw a fit demanding their kids' tuition back? I have no idea.

This last installment of Richard Bolitho's life deserved far better. Set around Napoleon's escape from Elba, the novel never really gives Sir Richard anything to do, except remember those he has known and act as though he is ready to die. The series, which already went about 8 books too long, is left to trickle off, instead of a spectacular finish and transition to Adam becoming the main character.

Kale (Shia LaBeouf) is a young man who runs off the rails after his father's tragic death, and while under house arrest he starts spying on his neighbors, including the beautiful Ashley (Sarah Roemer) next door. Ashley and Kale's attention is soon drawn to the mysterious Mr. Turner, who mows his lawn incessantly but doesn't seem to do much else, and they become convinced he's a killer. The plot nods in the direction of \\"Rear Window,\\" but the resemblance ends as the violence escalates and bodies start appearing. The genius of \\"Rear Window\\" was the very ordinariness of the characters--Grace Kelly excepted, of course--creating the sense that behind every shaded window tragedy can occur. Here the outlandish plot and blood and gore quickly veer in the thriller/horror direction. Teenagers will love it, but anyone who's seen the real thing won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"I still prefer \\"Rear Window\\"","review":"Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Rear Window\\" is an absolute classic. It ranks with \\"The Birds,\\" \\"Psycho,\\" and \\"North by Northwest\\" as one of his finest films. \\"Disturbia\\" on the other hand . . . well I will honestly say that I still think \\"Rear Window\\" is far superior to this fairly horrible re-imagining. And I mean \\"fairly\\" horrible, because Shia LeBeouf, Carrie-Ann Moss, and David Morse give very good performances. But aside from that, \\"Disturbia\\" is pretty much a weak thriller. It involves cheap scares, lame humor, and a really mediocre script. It did have some decent moments, but other than that, I consider this as bad as other thrillers that have been released in this certain decade that we're living in right now. I still choose \\"Rear Window.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"I thought this was a great performance by Shia. Excellent movie.

There are some elements that parents will want to check into if they are concerned about their kids seeing Disturbia, but it's not a teen gross out movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbia","review":"This movie is one of those you just can't look away from when watching.

This movie (in my book) is a must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedestrian.","review":"hitchcock comparisons are ludicrous. I thought the movie was a farce comedy, not a suspense thriller. I am still quite perplexed at the amazing reviews people are giving this. It was a dark comedy almost, to the point of it being juvenile, filled with adolescent angst and cakewalks through suburbia. I found the suspense sophmoric and the teenagers roles mundane and unremarkable. The accolades that people give Shia are unwarranted.

Now you had two choices. One, you could run straight to the murderer's house where you thought your mom was held hostage to rescue her. Two, you could run to your neighbor's house to call police for help. What do you think a \\"normal\\" kid will do? The main character in this film selected choice number one.

I watched the film with a handful of friends and the collective opinion was that lead actor Shia LaBouef must be related to SOMEONE important involved with the film because there is no other reason to have cast him as the lead. Fine talent such as David Morse is absolutely wasted here and the characters of LaBeouf's Mother, law enforcement officials, and all other adults are contrived from cardboard.

What I liked about this film is that it was not a ridiculous, juvenile effort from the director. I do not know much about D.J. Caruso but what I did like about this style of film is that it took time in letting me get to know the main character well before anything sinister began happening. Disturbia also features David Morse as a suspicious neighbor to a boy who thinks he starts seeing things that are implicating to the neighbor being a psychopathic serial killer. The boy who is suspicious is Kale, who is played by Shia Lebeouf. Carrie-Anne Moss also stars as the boy's mother and is of course, one of the first people to denounce Kale's suspicions. Disturbia is a good thriller that has a lot of anticipation with the buildup for the final scenes of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I KNOW Hitchcock.......THIS is no Hitchcock!","review":"It is amazing how any of the previous reviewers can compare this competent, OK movie to the classic REAR WINDOW. I would call this mindless comparison just blasphemous.The only similarity in both of these movies is a house-bound man observing all his neighbors with his binoculars.This movie begins nicely and with a strong bang, with the flashback of the father dying in a car crash that almost seems intentional, (the future killer?). It continues to move at a nice pace, but it soon moves to the ridiculous stage, and later, to the all-too-predictable ending.Save your money, save your time, make some pop corn and watch REAR WINDOW once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't punch your Spanish teacher","review":"For me, the first 90% of this film is very enjoyable. The last 10%, with the secret room, the dungeon, the body-pool seemed like they belonged in a slasher-type film, not this one. A bad detour on what had been so far a good Hitchcockian ride. Sad when such a well made, acted and shot film goes the way of a cheapo teenage film at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real nail-biter!","review":"If you don't enjoy being nervous, don't watch this movie!The feeling of suspense and urgency was almost too much at times (in a good way!) as a teenager under house arrest begins to suspect that his neighbor is a serial killer.He proceeds to investigate in ways that make you yell at the television, shamelessy spying on his neighbor with binoculars and the use of his friends.I loved the tense moments throughout, and I also like the fact that I found myself unsure of what the real story was.Is his neighbor a serial killer?

Before I bought this book I didn't know much about the comical side of a Catholic education -- I do now.

It's a shame that these guys never hit it really big, despite being cited as an influence by such great rockers as ZZ Top. Lead singer Glenn Hughes is easily as great a vocalist as Robert Plant, Paul Rodgers, Steve Marriott, and Montrose-era Sammy Hagar. He shares the belief of the former two and Hagar that Indonesia's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist was unjust, thus making this album's centerpiece, \\"Your Love Is Alright\\", seem to imply that, no, a Bali honeymoon is not what true love should mean, that its more important to show you care about each other by giving of yourselves back and forth.

Calorie intake gives you weight gain and working your muscles give you muscle mass growth. Amino Acid supplements are primarily for people on vegetarian diets who don't get enough protien because they don't eat meat. If someone is on a diet and trying to burn fat, the fat is used and broken down into glucose (carbs). The body cannot manufacture the 8 essential amino acids produced by breaking the peptide bond in proteins. Thus, people who don't eat food rich in protein, need protein supplements. After the body recieves an adequate supply of amino acids, more amino acids won't help any. The body cannot store excess amino acids - thus the daily intake.

Let me first explain that the book was a gift and I only read it out of desperation on a long plane flight. First off, the sheer length can only be a testament to the apparent vanity of the author applauding his own cleverness, as he rambles on incessantly through pages of incorrect grammar, spelling errors, and contrived story line. Although this is \\"true crime\\" and the plot is based in fact, the book manages to lose any of the real life suspense or drama of the case and turns it into a narrative more predictable and less interesting than those concocted in a 6th grade creative writing class. Even the title reeks from maudlin undertones! That should have clued me in, it was my mistake when I brought this book with me on my flight."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Bad Read.","review":"The typographical errors and mispellings in this book are so bad that I stopped reading it halfway through.

He says it's great because you can play as three different gundams and you get stronger the more you play as that character. Each character has his own style of attacks so you can choose which one you like. He says the controls are not that easy, but they are learnable.

So they went onto the porch. I wanted the nicest cover possible. This one is not as heavy as I expected for the price, and it has no securing strap or method to keep it tight to the bike (I am using one on my wife's 52 cm and another on my 58 cm bike). So they come off in any windy rainy storm - just when you want it to cover the bike from the elements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"Cheap! Don't waste your money.

Better one at Walmart for less than half the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive, doesn't provide enough protection from the elements.","review":"Bought two covers to cover two bikes we have to keep on our high-rise balcony. One cover blew off and was lost to the wind, so I replaced it and this time punched grommet holes in the bottom of the cover so I could secure it underneath the bike with carabiners. A few days later it rained - I took the covers off the day after to check on how dry the bikes were. The bikes' seat and handlebars were wet. Not soaking wet, but with enough beads of water to make me realize that these covers are not waterproof. I don't recommend for anyone looking to keep their bikes outdoors and exposed to the elements. The material is very thin and flimsy. If you are looking to keep dust off your bike while keeping it in the garage, this would probably do the trick. It does look nicer than most bike covers, but I wish I went with a tarp for my situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zips up great but doesn't fit the whole bike","review":"Material is good, the folding capability works well too.

The material is a little flimsy and it is hard to fold the cover into the bag. However it fits well and appears to be the best available cover of its kind on the market. It would help if the manufacturer included some eyelets and ties so that the wind does not blow the cover off a rear hitch rack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bicycle Cover","review":"Good cover that easy to get on the bike. Works well with bikes with fenders and a rear rack.Cover is sewed into the zippable case so you don't have to keep track of two items.Getting it back into the case is very difficult. I find it's a little bit easier to fold/roll the top and bottom to the level of the zippable cover and then roll from each side toward the center. Then fight the zipper without letting of the rolling to get it fully in the case.Also the cover leaves a silvery sheen on the bike where it rubs off a little bit, but that's pretty minimal.I haven't been able to use it yet in the rain, so i can't yet speak to its ability to keep water off of the bicycle."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent bike cover","review":"I found this cover to be inexpensive but effective.

I would love to see a tri-bike version made available!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Topeak Bike Cover","review":"We have a large high end bike collection. We keep them in the garage, covered and on racks. These covers were one of two solutions for keeping our bikes in perfect shape. (the other was to put large sheds inside our garage -- that did not work because of space). The covers fit the bikes well and are good quality. The bikes are a little difficult to put onto the racks with the covers on them but overall we are satisfied with these covers. We bought 8 covers and we use them all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehh. choose something else","review":"If you plan to keep your bike covered while in the garage to keep the dust off, then this is fine. If you want this as an outdoor covering for more than a few months, then just buy a tarp. This thing covers the bike well enough, (although the wheels keep popping out) it can't hold up to frequent use. Mine has already ripped in many spots, and the sun has weakened it alot. Not so good for an outside cover. If the sun is going to destroy it anyway, save a bunch of money and just get a tarp. May not look as nice, but this doesnt either after a few months outside. Final word...Boooooo!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small","review":"I wish I'd listened to the reviewer who said the bike cover was too small. I have a women's ten-speed touring bike, and the cover is almost impossible to get over both wheels. It's a long struggle and when it's finally covering most of the bike, it's so tight that the stitching pulls away from the fabric. Even so, it's an attractive cover and it seems well made, so I'd buy another if they added a couple of inches to the length.

It seems like every time they get a handle on the situation, something else goes wrong, but they always seem to manage to pull their behinds out of the fire at the last minute. The best character is \\"Digger\\". He's a treacherous double-dealing guy who manipulates everything without telling anyone what he's doing. There are some hilarious scenes in this book, like when the \\"sanguivor\\" is mistakenly taken to a morgue, and when a different \\"sanguivor\\" surfs across the desert on the trunk of a Rolls Royce.

A terrific story -- if you're a horse lover, you will really enjoy this book. Janet Dailey really did her research on the Arabian horse business of that time (the boom of the early and mid 80's) and only made a couple of errors, which only Arabian horse insiders would figure out anyway.

You can always meet new freinds no matter what happens to you, almost always anyway.Read this book!!

The description was tiresome and slow and the characters didn't add to any of the already boring set-up. I have not read any of the previous books (with absolutely NO intention) so i'm not very familiar with any of the characters.Just the book as a whole was just so.....slow. It got so annoying. The back of the book says Polly gets stuck in past, as if that's the first thing to happen. It takes 3/4th's of the book for this to occur. The ending with her best friend made no sense. This was my first fantasy book and it's a wonder i didn't stop reading books right there. Don't waste your time on this sorry excuse for a decent fantasy novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book","review":"This is my all absolute favorite L'Engle book so far, and I've read about 20 of her books. The writing, amazing, the fantasy, very real. For anyone who loved the Time Quartet (A Wrinkle in Time, A Wind in the Door, A Swiftly Tilting Planet, and Many Waters), this goes back to the old Murray home and brings in familiar characters and memories. It felt like a family reunion of sorts, a coming home, because A Wrinkle in Time was my first L'Engle book, as I'm sure it is many others. It's about time travel, but she makes it so real. For me, it was much more \\"real\\" even than it was in Wrinkle, more like A Swiftly Tilting Planet. It has a more mature feel to it as well. Very VERY good book. I definetly would recommend it very strongly to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Acceptable Time","review":"Utterly unlike the early books in the quintet. Badly and clumsily written. It is permeated with evangelical religion and biblical references."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fantasy...but lacks luster","review":"This is a very good, exciting fantasy, although it tends to jump about. The plot develops TOO slowly. The story is very interesting, though, and very exciting. Mrs. L'Engles fantasy terms, like \\"time circles\\" aren't as convincing as tesseracts (A WRINKLE IN TIME) or farandolae (A WIND IN THE DOOR). By which I mean just sounds weird, instead of almost feeling like fact during the course of the story as in her other books. It is exciting, though, and combines a lot of fantasy, family life, teen issues, friendship issues, and, interestingly enough, archaeology. When you go back 3000, you'll be transformed.Highly reccomended, although first-time L'Engle readers may be turned off. (p.s. fix the adult form cause I'm 15)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!!","review":"I loved this book. It started out on the right foot when I ran into Zachary Gray, whom I was already familiar with from A Ring Of Endless Light, thus sparing me the trouble of meeting another new character.

Possibly a bit fantastic, but overall, this is a good book, well worth your $3.99."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthwhile read for all ages","review":"Madeline L'Engle is one of the most engrossing and thought provoking writers alive today. I have enjoyed her books since I was a child, and continue enjoying them today. What I love about all of her books is that the stories she tells are accessable to all ages, and so is the depth of content. I find a different story every time I re-read one of her books. An Acceptable Time is no exception. Some have said that the plot is unrealistic. In response to this, I must say that none of her stories are meant in any way to be strictly realistic. They are modern fairy stories, filled with characters that the reader can identify with. An Aceeptable Time resolves and sheds light on many issues brought up in previous L'Engle books that dealt with the O'Keefe family. It is a wonderful study of familial relationships and coming of age. I would reccommend this book to anyone of any age."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like baseball cards...","review":"Ok, so I'm the party pooper here, but I'm not enjoying this book (still reading). What bother me about it is it's tunnel-vision focus on DJs (names, dates, station IDs etc.) while zilch on the music (how tunes were selected, politics, label preferences, payola, etc.). I'm personally curious why Top 40 has changed from period to period and how decisions were made behind the scenes out of hearing range of the listening audience. Telling us things like \\"Bill Balance, who had been at KFWB for three years when Blore blasted in to install the Top 40 format in late 1957\\" doesn't even pretend to discuss the kind of details I'm interested in. The publishers would have been more truthful if they'd named the book something like \\"The People Who Played the Hits.\\" Also disappointing to me because I've read many Fong-Torres articles over the years that I've thoroughly enjoyed.

Someone has mentioned that the service intervals to be followed closely, and I fully agree. These are not iridium or platinum plugs that will last 100K miles comfortably. These are good ol' copper, and their life is pretty much limited to 30-40K miles. Don't forget that worn out plugs will eventually destroy your high voltage coils. $3-4 per replacement plug vs. $30-40 for a replacement coil is a no-brainer to me.

That should have had all kinds of angsty possibilities. But I struggled to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm...just okay.","review":"I think that there were too many plot lines going through this book to make it a really great one: a one-night stand, the attraction to her fiance's brother, the supernatural plot line, the tension with her father & the reason behind it, her friend/boss's hidden attraction to one of the main characters, the reason behind the hero's reluctance to return home & the reason there's tension between him and his family. The author attempted to wrap up the loose edges of all the plot lines with her epilogue but I felt like a lot of it fell through the cracks. There was no mention to her fiance about the one night stand with his brother 5 years ago, the attraction of her friend/boss would have made a greater secondary story, and I feel that the main character didn't resolve anything with her father.

A better album to get is the BTO greatest hits Cd which also contains hey you as well as You aint seen nothin yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"adorable","review":"I love the little house. I didn't realize it was almost completely built, but that's fine.

Great songs. The band is very tight. Good tempo and feel. A must for any Haggard collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haggard at his best","review":"This is probably the best Merle Haggard release ever. If there were two country albums I would recommend it would be this one and Haggard's \\"Serving 190 Proof.\\" They are Haggard at his finest.There is not an average cut on this album. They are all superb. For the price, you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"One great album by Merle H.","review":"I am not a dedicated country western fan, but this album by Haggart is one of the best I have ever heard. His voice was in top-notch form when he cut this one. Well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Merle at his best","review":"I purchased this along with Serving 190 Proof. Both are quintessential Merle Haggard at his best. Released back to back in 79 and 80 with this being the stronger of the two but solid songwriting and exceptional singing on both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serves it purpose","review":"The bucket arrived on time. The quality was not what I expected. It looks like a thin tin can. It serves its purpose but I expected better quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice for the price","review":"I've been wanting a nice champagne bucket for a while now and this one had:a.) great reviewsb.) a very reasonable priceThe bucket is okay, but not the highest quality (particularly noticeable in the loop detailing on each side). That being said I am still satisfied with the purchase because of the price paid. It will serve its purpose and last a very long time I'm sure.I would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant and convenient","review":"A very nice and elegant ice-bucket, looks sturdy enough, right size to contain one bottle, and is reasonable priced. An ideal bargain. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading description","review":"I purchased this wine bucket solely because the description showed its shipping weight as 5.7 pounds. When it arrived the package seemed very light and turned out to be 1 pound 12 ounces. This wine bucket is very light and thin stainless steel, nowhere near the weight advertised. Nevertheless the design is satisfactory and I assume it will fulfill its function. The price is right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This bucket is very good.The cost is low, in my country (Brazil) it would cost 10x.It seems it will rest for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Great price, really beautiful in person.

They worked great, and the price was excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!","review":"this book was amazing. i laughed, cried, and felt every other emotion possible. i was never able to put it down. i've never liked thrillers or mistery's but this one totaly changed my mind. i was so enthralled i missed more than one dinner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick read because you can't put it down.","review":"This is a marvelous and fast-paced novel. A well drawn youthful protagonist gets our sympathy immediately. As a writer myself, I appreciate how Gilstrap has weaved characterization with plot so that we never sense that he has stopped writing the book in order to tell us some information."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning debut","review":"Rarely does one find a book in the thriller category that banishes time and forecloses thoughts of other duties or tasks. Nathan's Run falls into this area.The characters are finely formed, realistically intriguing and carefully thought out. Nathan's travails and those who influence his actions are sure to please. This novel is a page turner which will preoccupy you."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an Intense Trip!","review":"First off I want to say that John Gilstrap has some of the best characterization I have read in awhile. Nathan's Run takes place over a two-day span of time. Mr. Gilstrap does not waste any of this time on fluff. The author uses his pages wisely to develop realist characters and plot. The villains are especially nasty and the heroes are flawed but very likable, good solid heroes. Mr. Gilstrap does a great job in weaving these characters into a very believable and real plot. There are only two things that I'm sad about, one that I didn't read this book sooner and that it ended. I really wanted it to continue for a few more chapters, but the book is called \\"Nathan's Run\\". So if you are looking for a good chase book with good characterization and plot, you won't go wrong with \\"Nathan's Run\\". This is a wonderful book; I look forward to reading more of John Gilstrap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edge of Seat Enjoyable","review":"Nathan's Run had a fast pace with great action and suspense. I was caught up in the story, rooting for the main character (Nathan). I am already considering other books by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow but sure","review":"I was looking at the book reviews on all books and this one had some really good reviews. I found the book slow, very heavy handed and the character development quite poor. The last 3 pages were really good but otherwise the book was terribly slow. I just can't understand all the good reviews for such a slow book...sorry !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but empty","review":"Okay, the book has one thing going for itself: Nathan thugs at your heart. He's your favorite burglar. He's innocent, he's small and defenseless and the whole world seems to want him dead. You can't but hope he'll outsmart everybody. But let's be honest: Gilstrap took the cheap way out. The book might be a page-turner, but he acomplishes it on the expense of his main character, Nathan. There is nothing real about the character. Nathan is the result of a simple question: How can I make a character that everybody likes and roots for immediately? So Gilstrap may win our sympathy, but he sells out the story. There's nothing behind it. It is what the title suggests - it is Nathans run, and nothing more. Which is fine, I guess, if you read it only for the thrill, or the entertainment, but I believe it could have been more."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.","review":"Nathan's Run begins when a boy is put into Juvenile Hall for nothing. He escapes and run from the police while avoiding a hit man who targets him. In this book, you'll find suspense, drama, and action all in one as a SWAT team almost blows a building searching for one kid! I give this book 5 stars easily! John Giltrap has become a first rate novelist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Action Thriller-Couldn't put it down!","review":"I was stunned when I found out after reading the book that it was an old book that was recently republished and was Gilstrap's first book. I love his Jonathan Grave series and have read all of the books in that series. So when Nathan's Run came up on my recommended list, I thought I would give it a try. I read the whole thing in one day because I just couldn't put it down. It's a great plot and you can't wait to see what happens in the next chapter. For being written in 1994, it doesn't lose anything due to the passage of time. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable","review":"When this thriller was translated into German, it was a very different kind of book. The first of it's kind (or one of the first) that had a 12 year old hero.Of course some scenes are a bit disturbing, but we watch similar scenes in most movies or on TV and accept it, so why not in a book? Times are changing.I re-read this book several times and recently gave it to my husband on his birthday and can't wait to hear his opinion about it.Wish they would make a movie about \\"Nathan's Run\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nathan's Run","review":"Excellent story, narrated by George Guidall, who does an excellent job of narration. One of the best recorded books and even though I first heard it when it came out in the 1990's, I just listened to it again and was enthralled, making a long road trip feel much shorter. This is a must listen selection. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking thriller","review":"This was a grab your handle and hold on thriller that was hard to put down. Marvelous! I want more from this author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Plot, Bad Ramble","review":"Gilstrap happens to be one of my favorite authors, and Nathan's Run was a great story. The plot of a young 12 year old boy who murders a Juvinille Detention Supervisor and becomes a fugitive of the law is gripping and thrilling. Gilstarp does a have a problem getting off a subject though. If you want a great book in the same genre, by the same author try At All Costs (Read my review on it). Overall this was a great book, if you have the time to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. I loved the character Nathan. The only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because I would have liked an epilogue at the end of the story telling what ultimately happens to Nathan. Other than that I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing but not satisfying","review":"This is one of those books that totally engrosses you and leaves you feeling completely manipulated when you are done. I have to confess that I couldn't put it down and finished it off on one commute to and from work, but when I was done, with a slight wetness in my eyes, I was totally annoyed. The characters are either SOOOO good or SOOOO bad. The protagonist is wrongly imprisoned and when on the lam, changes the sheets of houses he breaks into and hides in. The hit man is a total scum bag and takes delight in breaking fingers and crushing delicate body parts. All the same, it was a good read. A perfect book for a sunny day on a white sand beach in the Yucatan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I waited for this book to come out for several months. I was disappointed in it, thinking it was going to be a great thriller. I found it to be predictable and a little dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"The going-no-where running","review":"A 4th grade kid talking to a 12 years old kid about the 'NIGHTLINE', an adult program after 11:PM? The running of the 12 years old involved 2 stolen cars, 2 break-ins, 1 inexplanatory hitman and his questionable employer, 1 remote detective, 1 radio show hostess, several dead cops and an ending without a result. The way the 12 years old talked was no different from those adults in this book. I've tried very hard to figure out what's going on in this book, but simply could not get a clear picture. All I could remember after finished it was that the 12-year adult did two laundries during his break-ins and left gentleman's notes. The scenario is so hollow and unplausible, and the blabblings were zigzagging to nowhere. I regretted to waste couple of nights to figure it out but failed"},{"rating":"1","title":"I left this one on the park bench","review":"I couldn't get past Gilstrap's shallow characterizations. All he seemed to use to describe anybody were four-letter words. I wonder how large his vocabulary really is. I think I'll go find the Readers Digest version, the F- word omitted, and the plot condensed. That ought to be a nice afternoon read, then instead of leaving it on the park bench, maybe I'd pass it along to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"... aimed at young people","review":"My sixth grader came home with this book. It was found in his school library with a Reading Level of 6.7. He told me the book contained a lot of inappropriate words. I immediately looked at the book and in 10 minutes found a huge array of offensive, sexually explicit, and morally offensive words. There was no warning of the mature nature of this book on the cover or the reviews inside. THIS IS NO CHILDREN'S BOOK. I have currently asked the middle school to review the book and send it on to an audience where it would not influence such young children. Not my kid, not my school, NO WAY! (By the way, he did not finish the book.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST read this year","review":"\\"Nathan's Run\\" is an action-packed suspense story of a 12 year old on the run written so believably that the plot & characters seem totally real.So suspenseful I couldn't stop reading but hated to leave the characters, Nathan & Michaels, at the books end. Will definitely buy Gilstrap's next book and would love to see a movie of \\"Nathan's Run\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am still reading and loving it, but...","review":"So far I am really enjoying this book. But the things that ticks me off the most is how he just keeps entering all these new characters. I can't keep track of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Test - 8yr old Grandson","review":"I gave this book to my 8yr old Grandson on an outing with Grandma this past week. I handed it to him as we began our 35 min trip by car. He leafed slowly through the pages and for the next 20 mins. we discussed each image.The author chose to color the images which makes it easier to identify each object relative to the text. And makes it fun to look at. However, one or two actual grayscale photos with arrows would have been nice. I kept wanting to explain to him that the carpet beetle wasn't really day-glo colors, etc. Hopefully, the next book out in hardcover will show a few real images. For the adults, I'll add that my engineer at home enjoyed the photos as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dicass thomas the train toy","review":"Great toy. Does not fit on wooden tracks.

Short segments about some of the more important ships in American History. Columbus's ships, La Salle's Griffin, Drake, Blackbeard, Mayflower, Bonhomme Richard, Constitution, Salem Merchant Ships, Packet Ships, Nantucket Whaling Ships, Clipper Ships, Early Steamers, Mississippi Steam Ships, Ironclads, Ocean Going Steamers, The Maine. The book doesn't cover the 20th century. A short book for short attention spans. Can be read in a sitting or two"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mayflower, Clipper Ships, and More","review":"Ships have played an important role in American history. Famous American Ships, From the Discovery of the New World to the Battle of Manila Bay is an overview of notable ships in American history including the Santa Maria, Mayflower, Bonhomme Richard, Constitution, Monitor, Merrimac (C.S.S. Virginia), Clermont, and Maine. We also learn about whaling ships, clipper ships, steamboats, pirates, and privateers. The many illustrations and easy-to-read narrative make this book ideal for readers in the upper elementary grades or middle school. Despite its age, Famous American Ships is still an informative and useful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balls to the Wall !","review":"If you liked the first film, then you need to see the sequel.The budget is obviously higher, the script is more developed, the characters are a bit more over the top and the jokes and gags come at a much faster pace. This is Fubar on roids, or crank (whichever you prefer). The character \\"Tron\\" from the first movie went from rather sedate to being the most over the top character in the whole story. It is a good thing in my opinion. If you liked the slower pace and complete lack of budget in the first movie, then you might be turned off by this ramped up sequel.It is a very direct sequel. The main theme of testicular cancer and how Terry and Deaner deal with it is once again the central point of the story. This time there is also a major \\"romance\\" plot, which is something that can ruin a good comedy, but this romance plot is clever and written and executed well and not tacked on.I've watched it twice and it is just as good as the first, if not better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Grace study","review":"Our study group is working through chapter 3 as I write this but so far the lessons, scripture, & writing hit their mark. As a longtime Christ follower, I thought I understood what grace was. But this study goes so deep in showing me with scriptures, stories, and words what grace is really--I feel I have a clear understanding what grace is & isn't. It fills in the gaps, gives the entire story, & repeats the information through the chapters that you \\"get it\\", really get it. Highly recommend this book & look forward to continuing through the chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad trip to Motown","review":"Only highlight is \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\\" by Dina Ross & The Supremes. The cartoon voices pale in comparison to the orginals.Thought I might find a couple nice takes the kids might like, but they just agreed never to play this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ups and downs","review":"I either ordered this pot either last year, or the year before. So, at most, we've only had it for 1 1/2 years. It seemed to good to be true. It's wonderful to have a non-breakable teapot with a very nice tea infuser. However, the metal interior started flaking off and began appearing in our tea. This just didn't seem healthy (to drink cast iron bits), so we chucked it. I was hoping that this teapot would last and last, but in actuality, it lasted just the same as a porcelian pot. For all those who like the teapot now, hopefully you will not experience the same phenomena as we did - flaked iron in your tea after little more than a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic value","review":"I have been researching these and they can go for 4 times as much, even more. The color is great, quality is fantastic. You wont be disappointed. it looks really smart too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Teapot, Color Doesn't Quite Match Picture","review":"My teapot arrived in perfect condition with the handle already attached. The size is very generous, so I don't even need to fill it half full to have several small cups of tea at a time.My only complaint is that the color doesn't look exactly like the picture. I was a little disappointed because the green in the picture here looks brighter, but when I received the pot the green is actually a little dull.However, you can't beat the price for the size of the pot. It's actually so generously sized, I may be getting a smaller one for regular use and keep this one for when I'm serving guests."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet deal over the expensive Teavana pots","review":"For a fraction of the cost this more than met my expectations for a loose leaf tea pot. Warmed up the pot and threw in some tea leaves, boiling water and BAM, a super hot and long lasting brew of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tea for two...tea for me!","review":"The tea pot was exactly what I was looking for. I have made three pots of tea so far and each of them maintained a proper heat for my drinking enjoyment. Cleaning is a breeze and I only wish I had bought one sooner. It is much cheaper in price than the similar pots offered at places like Teavana but the quality is there. It maintains heat rather well unlike some reviews have stated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most beautiful teapot ever","review":"I've had a rich brown version of this teapot for at least 10 years and love it. So I ordered this one for a gift and was really wowed when I opened it today. So beautiful in a gorgeous shade of green with substantial weight and presence. This is the teapot you want to display in a prominent place and use daily. Perfect pot for 1 to 4 tea drinkers. And the price is amazing! I paid 3 times this amount a decade ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"unity teapot enamel flakes off","review":"Purchased this teapot on December 24, 2011. Very disappointed. Although it is of nice design, after using it for 10 months the enamel is flaking off. The pot is rusted. I never used it on direct heat. Totally unusable. Would like my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely, but not a tea kettle","review":"This teapot is quite lovely and just as described. However, I thought one could boil water in it on the stove. Didn't realize I couldn't until I read the fine print once it arrived. (Cast iron that won't work on the stove?) Just in case anyone wants a tea *kettle*, this is not one. I was really sad, though, because it is beautiful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Surface Area - Does not retain heat.","review":"Here's the honest scoop on this teapot. This teapot has too much surface area for a tetsubin cast iron teapot. The result is the tea gets cold very quickly - even if you use a tea warmer with a candle. Since I like my tea hot, this was a very poor choice.Subsequently I replaced this with a Iwachu Japanese Iron Teapot at more than double the cost. If you really want a pleasant tetsubin teapot experience --- go with the Iwachu --- because it keeps the tea at the perfect drinking temperature and with care it will last a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful teapot and at a great price!","review":"Bought this teapot for my husband as a Valentine gift. He loves this teapot because it holds a large amount of water, keeps the tea hot for long periods of time, and has a great look. I also purchased the Cast Iron Teapot Warmer 5-3/4inch to go with this teapot. A great pairing if you want to keep your tea hot for longer periods of time.Let's not forget the price. Compared to a retail store, such as teavana, this teapot costs 1/3rd the price.
