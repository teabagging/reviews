The phone (this is my second i850, as I had to turn my first one in because of malfunctions) is very slow to respond, often shuts off for no reason, unless I'm trying to shut it off, in which case I have to push the button and then wait to see if it's going to turn off.

I only picked up this audio book, because I wanted some mindless entertainment on my long drive down to LA from SF...and it was one of the few audio books at my local library...anyways, the premise was interesting. But the twists and turns were just preposterous, unbelievable. I found myself laughing at the characters' predicaments. The dialogue was inauthentic and made me wonder, 'who would say such a thing in a real conversation?'. Perhaps it was the bad actress who read the book?

I always enjoyed the strong female characters and the way he wove the story together. I must have read the first few novels of his 10 times each .... You cannot compare this book to his earlier novels. He may have just needed the paycheck or has a vendetta against trees. The typical strong female characters are not in this book. Good plot twists & backstabbing family members are also missing.This book is very predictable and not written all that well. I was a Sheldon fan for a very long time and I must say that this book has turned me off to his writing. Maybe if I go back and read \\"Morning, Noon, and Night\\" again it would change my mind. Turn off the light because this book is just not that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment!","review":"I've never read Sidney Sheldon but remember Other Side of Midnight on tv years ago.

I don't know if it was Marsha Mason's \\"grandma reads a bedtime story\\" delivery or if I would have still hated it had I experienced it in written word form, but this book was not typical Sidney Sheldon. It played like the first novel of a very green, very naive writer who shouldn't quit his day job quite yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well.......","review":"If you like novels that are beyond reality you will like this book. Two goodlooking, but normal wives come together, and outwit professional hit men while at the same time seem to have an endless supply of cash.

I would hope that a seasoned author like Mr. Sheldon could come up with something better or at least more realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read his earlier books","review":"This isn't just the worst Sidney Sheldon book I have ever read, it is the worst of any! What happened, Mr. Sheldon? Your previous work was outstanding. This one was a big letdown. The book was too brief, unlike his previous ones. The big font type used made it look like a nearly 400 page book, but it isn't that long really.The story was too unrealistic and the characters nothing extraordinary. Three-fourths of the book was a cat and mouse chase. The plot was weak unlike the previous books' intricate and complex ones. The lines were too cliche. Overall, it was low quality work, something very unexpected from Sheldon. I still read it to completion because I have read every one of his books and am still a fan.It feels like Sheldon doesn't write his own books anymore. This one did not even seem to be remotely his style. Is someone writing for him under his name?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even for a fluff novel, this is really, really bad.","review":"It's July in South Texas, and too hot for anything requiring actual thought: perfect Sidney Sheldon weather. Thus, I wasn't expecting Dostoyevsky when I picked this up at the grocery checkout- just your average page turner. I was still disappointed.Usually, to find dialogue of the caliber exhibited in \\"Are You Afraid of the Dark\\" one would need to eavesdrop in a middle school. The instances of mind-boggling stupidity found in the 398 pages are far too numerous to reference. Suffice it to say: the thoughts, words and actions of the heroines are so insulting to women that legal action should be taken.Skip this, and read \\"The Other Side of Midnight,\\" \\"Windmills of the Gods\\" or any of the novels Mr. Sheldon wrote prior to taking leave of his senses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Oh, Mr. Sheldon. If you had something to say about our government's weather manipulation experiments, couldn't you have wrapped it around a good story? This book read more like one of your screen scripts, i.e., choppy. The characters were boring and predicable and so were the events. This one's not worth the time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"DUH?","review":"An average of three and a half stars? From people who are literate? So I ran through the first twenty or so reviews and there they are. Well, the reason I give it one star is because zero isn't offered as a choice and besides I finished the book.(I finish everything, including those lenghty pamphlets that come with new drugs.)Every chapter (remember, I read it all) has at least one event that is illogical, unreasonable and stupid. I've read better comic books and seen B flicks that are intellectual by comparison. Fogeddabout it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of paper","review":"First and foremost I would like to say that I am an avid Sheldon reader, and If Tomorrow Comes is still on my best sellers list.That being said, I do not recommend this book to anyone. If you are a moderate reader, you probably have read most of the mini-storylines in other works. In my opinion, Sheldon has simply added ideas from here and there and come up with a sub-standard, cliched filled book. Also the end plot is completely unbelievable and left me feeling like I had wasted my time reading this work. Sidney you can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheldon in the Dark","review":"I have read several of Sheldon's novels and found them entertaining. I finished this novel only hoping that it would suddenly improve. It didn't. Sidney should be ashamed for putting out such drivel. Do not buy, do not borrow, do not read this miserable piece. Shame on you Sidney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not One of his Best","review":"I'm a big fan of Sheldon's- having read all his books in the past. This is not one of his better reads, I am sad to say. The storyline is too simplistic, the characters are not believable and the ladies get out of EVERY assassination attempt with ease. I found myself shaking my head after many of these 'get aways'.For me a book is good if I can imagine the scene and place myself in it. This never happened with Are You Afraid of the Dark. It's all just a lot of fluff. I know it's onlya fiction book, but I know Sheldon can do better. He just didn't this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"least Favorite Sheldon Novel","review":"I have read 10 Sheldon Novels and this was my least favorite. Kelly and Diane either are cats with 9 lives or those pursuing them are the most incompetent clowns in the underworld universe. Also, with there lives in constant danger there is a such thing called police to seek out help from. Oh yea, Diane tries this and the detective is transfered. That means he does not turn his case over to his replacement? Was he the only detective in NYC?The other books I read had narrow escapes but the ones that Kelly and Diane get out of are so unrealistic that I found myself reading a comedy. I was waiting for \\"Angel\\" (Kelly's dog)to also be involved in the conspiracy also. (Heck, the rest of the characters in the book was including the person I bought it from at the store. I hope the next Sheldon novel I read has a plot along with twist that are more plausable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MUST SKIP!!!","review":"No way near what hes used to writting.

I can now say school served its purpose..hehehe"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I've read all of Sidney Sheldon's books and this one is not his best. The situations the two main characters were put in were unbelievable. I found the flashbacks more interesting than the rest of the story. The villain of the story wasn't even interesting. I felt the ending was forced. It would have been more interesting if Andrew had figured out what was going on and was able to stop everything and come out the hero.I admit I bought this book because I have never been disappointed by one of Mr. Sheldon's books. This one was a complete waste of time. I found myself wondering if this book was written in a hurry because he hasn't had a book published in a long time. If that's the case, he should have taken longer and done a better job. His loyal readers would have appreciated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DUMB,DUMB,DUMB!!!!!","review":"I agree with the above reviews. I was so excited that this book would live up to The Other Side of Midnight, esp. after reading the 4 and 5 star reviews. Obviously these people don't read much. This book was so predictable, and the characters were so awful! The dialog was just stupid. He writes of one character dying on a respirator, but he is talking to them! PEOPLE ON VENTILATORS DON'T TALK, SYDNEY!!! Sorry folks, Sydney is not back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to quit, Sydney","review":"Sydney Sheldon's storytelling and creativity started to show some wear and tear since \\"The Best Laid Plans\\". He picked up a little bit with \\"Tell me your dreams\\", then totally grossed me out with \\"The sky is falling\\" and especially, this horrible \\"Are you afraid of... being DUMB\\".I wish he would quit the game now and for good. For this writer, my best bet is that good stuff like \\"If tomorrow comes\\" never come again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Read!","review":"Sidney Sheldon wrote a novel that is loads of fun to read.

I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This book is terrible and it pains me to say so! I have been such a huge fan of Sydney Sheldon and have really enjoyed many of his books but the dialog alone was at times so corny I would cringe!! Save your time and read one of his earlier books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent for any other author","review":"This book was great, extradoniary, fast paced, and intriguing, with a great concept to boot. The only problem is it isn't up to par with Sidney Sheldon. I could be as bold as to say, any other writer, this book would be gold, but sheldon, it seemed to be just average. Still a great book, and everyone who likes to read any type of thriller will love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"You will be afraid of Sheldon after this!","review":"Having read other Sheldon titles I didn't expect a literary master piece, but I certainly expected something better. The plot is weak and predictable, the characters are shallow and the storyline is boring.Besides from the unrealistic set of events, the dull writing, and the geographical errors (the author confuses San Sebastián and Barcelona and states that there's a 30 minute drive from \\"the medieval town of Burgos\\" to Barcelona, while 500 miles stand between the cities), there is nothing of the thrill and mystery Sheldon has shown before.The book is not worth your money and is definitely no worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sidney, what happened?","review":"My third Sheldon novel. His first two kept me turning pages fast. Not even sure I could call this book good, but it took getting through half of it to get anywhere near good. And even when it got slightly good, it was just a cat and mouse chase. Thug trying to catch and kill two women, they get away. Tries again, they get away again...that happens a dozen times, you get the picture. That about sums up the book.I was very disappointed with this read. Had to finish it but almost couldn't. Wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable","review":"Poorly written dialogue, unbelievable characters, pointless plot.

It's a stupid story of epic proportions and not worth the price.Mark HillerChehalis, WA."},{"rating":"1","title":"my first Sidney Sheldon book","review":"This is the first Sidney Sheldon book I've read, and I ended up stopping after about 100 pages. The plot didn't keep me interested, and I didn't care about the various people and their relationships at all. I've read a number of best-selling suspense authors, and this does not measure up to most of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money and time.....","review":"I've previously quite enjoyed Sheldon's other books but there seems to have been a massive decline in quality since his first few books, either that or I've gotten smarter. From the first chapter I kept thinking how ridiculous the book seemed to be getting. This is easily one of the DUMBEST books I've ever read. I kept hoping the heroines would just die and put me out of my misery. Everything was so highly implausible and disjointed. I mean, for example, when the heroines are having a shopping spree in a pharmacy. Please someone point out the relevance?! I still don't know why (or how) I finished the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointed","review":"After waiting so long for the next Sidney Sheldon novel to come out, all I can say after having read it is that I am disappointed. If you love Sidney Sheldon then you will be happy with all the international cat-and-mouse chases, evil-evil bad guys, gorgeous brainy independent women, and lots of references to sex. However, the plot is transparent and the technological wizardry stuff is just plain hokey. With this book you can see every thing coming four pages before it happens. There is no suspense, and you know what is going to happen to each character the very moment that they are introduced. However, if you have nothing better to do, and just want to spend some time being amused, go ahead and read the book. It is without a doubt Sidney Sheldon's \\"lightest\\" read. There just isn't enough to it after such a long wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are You Afraid Of The Dark","review":"Wonderful wonderfu wonderful...will read in one afternoon.

I'm sorry to say it so bluntly, but I had definitely expected more from Sidney Sheldon, and this was a barley laughable waste of time...there is NO character development, and the girls, as noted by an earlier reviewer, got out of EVERY situation in the most corny, unrealistic ways. What was even more irritating than that was Mr. Bad Guy Kingley's remark EVERY SINGLE time they did that..kinda like a newer version of \\"Curses, foiled again!\\" The girls would escape and he'd go \\"Damn those bit**es!!\\" Hahaha, okay, maybe that was laughable, but really, don't waste your money. This plot would have been better off sometime after midnight on any B Movie cable channel...I.E: Lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book. You'll regret it.","review":"I'd like to add my agreement to all the reviewers who gave Sheldon one star. He actually deserves a zero!!

His last few books had been boring but this last one beats them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read if you are a critical reader","review":"The action isn't believable. The technology is silly.

Great to have undying fans I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"sloppy high tech","review":"This book is a laugh a minute, mainly because of the author's total inattention to detail. His 'German' is appalling, the plot a farce (including a dead mobile phone suddenly springing into life) and as for 'villages' in Australia being destroyed - that is the worst because we DO NOT have any villages in this country. Large and small towns, yes, but no villages. As for the two boring heroines beating the best hitmen ever ... oh well. Some people might like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Letdown!","review":"I'm a huge Sheldon fan and this book was a real letdown. The best read was the one page afterword re: govt. weather experiments. Other than that, I found the entire book to be fragmented and unrealistic. There is no character/reader connection and unfortunately what could have been a great story plot left me bored to tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I rarely ever write a review but after reading this book, I feel that I must write one to dissuade people from wasting money on it. I picked up the book from my university's library on the reputation of the author.However, it was a complete waste of time with illogical plots and actions by the characters who weren't fleshed out realistically. I'll still give one of his older books a try but I must say this book was very disappointing for me. A complete and utter waste of my 2 hours. I'm just glad it's from the library and not my pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful waste of time","review":"Utterly utterly atrocious. Non-existent characterisation. A plot that consists of the characters racing from hotel to hotel. The section where the 2 female characters embark on a shopping spree in the midst of extreme danger is an example of the hodgepodge, completely nonsensical,thrown together nature of this book. Cringe inducing descriptive passages \\"Your nose sings delicious little melodies through the night like the music of angels\\" That line had me crying melodiously. Characters that drop in and out of the plot and even a couple of S & M scenes for titillation!!

I felt no emotional bond to any of the characters. It was like some made for SyFi movie on saturday night.The story was interesting but the (very) end was predictable and trite."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst yet!","review":"The good part is that the book is easy reading, anyone (even a ten year old) can understand what is happening. You will finish the book in one sitting over a couple of hour.Sadly the characterization is appalling, the author has not even tried to give a semblance of personality to the main characters. These key players are there for a purpose, which they deliver and vanish. The story has no sub plots but it has a lot of deviations which amount to nothing in the context of the main plot.In all the writing and the plot are too simple and predictable.It is tired effort by the author, who has written much better books. This time he has taken his readers for granted.Avoid it if possible, don't expect much if you do read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story, Poorly Written and Bad Characters","review":"I have never read a Sidney Sheldon book, but I heard from my sister that he is a great mystery writer. So, I checked the book out or actually I borrowed my sister's copy and let me just say that it was a piece of work that was mesmerizing and interesting. Although it had a good plot, the characters were really sucky and obvious. Plus, it was a bit of obvious writing as well, it could have been better if Sidney Sheldon had a more developed writing style for this book and better characters. Other than that everthing else is find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aviod this book","review":"I picked up this book because I heard that Sidney Sheldon is an easy and fun read. This book was so bad; I did not make it past page 100. I felt that there was no depth to the characters and an implorable plot that I felt I could not justify one more second of my time. Do not waste your time on this book; there are 100's of more easy reads out there that deserve your beach reading time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you afraid of the dark?","review":"Are you afraid of the dark? Sidney Sheldon- A fairly disappointing novel from the standpoint that it was very predictable and farfetched. This novel gave the appearance of someone's first attempt or a writer that was tired and just putting out a book for a quick sell. My guess is about 1 - 2 months of work with many interruptions. Some research involved but all in all, research that could be had over the internet with a day or two of searching. Some technical phrasing appeared as if it was quoted directly from the source. This book would be good reading for someone that doesn't want to think too much and just be carried through a implausible story. I am sorry to say, it appears to be written for a quick \\"made for T.V.\\" movie with a possible sequel of two unlikely female private detectives. * October 23, 2004"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sidney Sheldon at his best!","review":"This is a classic Sidney Sheldon.

If I didn't know better, I would have thought I was reading a Reader's Digest Condensed version of this book. Most of the twists and turns were totally unbelievable and mostly predictable. I really used to enjoy Sidney Sheldon's earlier books, but I sure wish I had not wasted time reading this silly book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Sheldon actually write this?","review":"This is one of the worst I've ever read. Were his earlier novels that much better, or is it just because I was much younger? Master of the Game is one of my all-time favorite books, but this one is awful.

They would hate me forever for wasting their time.The reviews for this book are a far more interesting read.

Now THAT was a good book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who really wrote this book?","review":"I'm glad to see I am not alone in panning this latest Sheldon effort. As I read through the numerous and unbelieveable miraculous escapes from death that the two self-absorbed heroines managed, I decided that Sidney Sheldon's agent must have held a dagger over his head to make him write yet another novel. Or else he really needed the money. There were even times I wondered if Sheldon, himself, did the actual writing -- as in, perhaps his granddaughter did the honors and he put his name on it. If you want to read a real thriller, don't get this one. The only time I got excited was when Andrew ... well, I don't want to give that part away in case you decide to go ahead and throw your money down a rathole and buy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not anywhere near his usual...","review":"I found this book to be so far below the quality of Sheldon's other work that it is hard to believe he even wrote it. I have enjoyed all his other books, but this lacked plot, character development and a decent story line. The outcome was predictable and that is unusual for his work also."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time or money","review":"It's obvious people have different tastes in books! I thought this was one of the worst books I've ever read. The underlying gimmick - whoever controls the weather has power - is cute but the story is stupid and badly written. The characters are stereotypes - stick figure stereotypes at that - and the power and resources at the hands of the bad guy(s) are over the top. Maybe it's supposed to be a parody but to me it seems like the author whipped of a quick book to squeeze a little more money out of his name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stormy Weather","review":"Around the world in different places, four people who are connected with a \\"Think Tank\\" company, are murdered.

The beautiful widows of two of the victims join forces to outwit the resources of the powerful and influential Kingsley when he sends his hired goons to kill them, in case their husbands had talked too openly about their current project. The women whisk themselves around the world in an attempt to escape Kingsley's clutches....I can't go on! This is the silliest, most juvenile book ever, written in short, staccato sentences and I find it difficult to believe that it was even written by Sidney Sheldon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sidney Sheldon Delivers Once Again","review":"If you're looking for a way to pass a little time this weekend, look no furter.

It was unbelievably illogical and implausible and filled with annoying cliches. I too wonder if I enjoyed Sheldon so much in the past because I was younger??? Or has his style really gone this bad!!! I listened to the audiobook and it was excruciating to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic Junk","review":"Sidney Sheldon's \\"Are You Afraid of the Dark\\" is a prime example of the generic crap that a \`name' author often churns out just to make a buck.Nobody would buy this book if some no-name had written it, and no publishing house would even consider putting something as boring and generic and just plain stupid as this in print had it been the work product of an unknown.This book is simplistic formula to the max and is not worth your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusement, yes; Accuracy, No.","review":"Yes, the novel is fluff.

Hello?? European standards for cellphones are not compatible with U.S. standards.One of the evildoers is in the Barcelona, Spain airport, and gets on a plane by stating (without identification) that he's with the FAA.

The characters are one dimensional cardboard and the plot rolls along from one implausible miracle to another.You have four murdered scientists, two beautiful rich heroines (Kelly and Diane) and the villain who has discovered how to manipulate the weather and wreak havoc unless particular countries cough up a king's ransom.This is one of the poorest novels I've read in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the wait or time needed to read!!!!!!!!","review":"One star doesn't begin to not rate this book. Sheldon has joined my list of \\"not worth reading again\\" along with Grisham and Clark. He has totally lost his touch and anyone who gives a good review of this book has incredibly low standards or is being paid to do so. There is no character development - characters are wooden at best. Storyline is completely predictable and jumps all over the map. Don't spend your money or even check it out of the library. Sheldon has been on a long slow decline for several books and has finally bottomed out. Time to retire Sidney - your magic is gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"This has to be the worst piece of work Sidney Sheldon has delivered.

Admittedly a few liberties were taken with the plotlines but the stories were fast paced and enjoyable enough for this not to matter. I think one of the things I found most ridiculous in this novel (other than, yes, the heroines outwitting the would-be assasins at every turn - think New York Minute)was that one of the leading characters was a supermodel, on the cover of every magazine. And yet she managed to run around the US and Europe and not once be recognised! This, in a fame obsessed culture! I don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book, worse narrator","review":"This was childish drivel, narrated by Marsha Mason, a very good actress, a lousy narrator! This is a contrived story, significantly under the past capability of Sidney Shelden. Marsha Mason was amateurish, at best. Run from this disappointing effort!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Sheldon I've Ever Read","review":"This is without a doubt the worst I've ever read from Mr Sheldon. So much that I'm having a hard time believing this is a novel of his. He was such a master of the game (hint). Over the years I've enjoyed his novels mainly because of his beautiful writing and portrayal of strong women. The two women in this novel weren't the least bit interesting. I never came to care whether or not they made it through their predicament. I just didn't care. I'm always willing to suspend my imagination in just about any given situation, but most of the scenarios here were so simplistic and implausible that it was laughable. So disappointing. To give this harsh a review isn't easy, but I take my reading serious and usually expect much better from someone who's listed on \\"My Favorite Authors\\" list. Even if they've been around a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I know 6th graders who can construct a better story.","review":"This novel doesn't even comes close to any previous Sheldon work. It is trite, the plot is non-existent, the characters are cardboard at best and say the stupidest things, and the whole thing is a huge waste of time. I gave it one star because that's as low as the ranking goes. For work of this caliber Amazon needs a line of minus stars.The sad part is this novel was most likely only published to trade on the previous well-done work by this author, and that is the only reason i read it.You know, there is much validity to the cliche \\"quit while you are ahead\\" and it is really a shame that Sheldon 's editor didn't remind him of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Disappointing","review":"I have been a Sidney Sheldon fan for years, but could barely get through this book (as opposed to his previous books where I would stay up until 3am to finish). The majority of the text is boring flashbacks that add very little to the plot...you can skip over sections of the flashbooks and not miss out. The story itself had a promising backdrop, but none of the classic Sheldon traits are visible. No real suspense or suprise endings, very flat, obvious characters. True Sheldon fans will be highly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive Look at the American Presidency","review":"This book is great.

They are very stable and they will keep standing up in almost any position; they also seem to be made of some kind of rubber.The main reason why i like these little robots is that they look exactly like the cartoons. Not like the transformers G1 toys. Instead, they look chunky, cartoonish and fun. Bumblebee has a smirk on his face just like he did on the animated series. Soundwave seems to be pointing at himself like asking \\"Who, me ?\\". They seem to be having a lot of fun and i've just blue-tacked them to the top of my computer monitor as an ornament.

I had only used it one time before. We set it up according to the directions & the fountain flowed for about 2 minutes and then it stopped. The plastic rotating piece in middle that creates the flow of chocolate had been deformed: the metal twisting auger melted the plastic .Since I just bought this a few months ago and only used it once, I called Rival to find out about the replacement of this part (they supposedly have a 1-year warranty). I was told that they could not honor the warranty since the product has been discontinued.

I tried contacting them by email, only to be told to call the phone number I had been calling repeatedly for over 2 hours.I don't know if the product does work, and it is just this one that is defective, but after my experience with this company, I'm not sure I really want to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Fountain","review":"If I were to purchase another chocolate fountain I would spend more money and get a better quality one.

The chocolate we used was very tasty, we had fresh fruit, pound cake, and pretzels for dipping.

You can't slam an author based on the editing of her book. Take the time to look past the editing problems of a book and let yourself enjoy the compelling unfolding of the plot and characterizations. Granted, many people who are into gaming may not have the attention span to stay with a novel that is deeply plotted and well written. With games,(and I, too, enjoy them) it's the fast pacing of adventure following adventure following adventure that keeps the players interested and excited, rather than the love of words and word pictures that Readers love and celebrate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Forgetable; more like a Star Trek episode","review":"I have always loved the mysteries surrounding the Irda, and have had several ideas around them. I was more disappointed by their portrayal in Summer Flame (actually, my only disappointment with that book), but this one doesn't have a plot to back it up. The characters are nicely colored and attention is given to the fact that they're still ogres, but nevertheless, I cannot remember for the life of me what the plot was. I suggest the Kagonesti, instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Dragonlance Novel I ever read (i've read them all)","review":"This book was horrible. I have read every single drangonlance ever published and this was the worst i have ever read. The grammar is horrible, like it was never edited. It ends so abrubtly its like the author just ran out ideas and the ran the credits. The dragonlance legends, worlds and customs are completly twisted for this one book. For example several times the book refers to the 3 moons. During the time of the Irda there was only one moon. The three moons are explained in depth in the Kagonesti. And at the time of this creation the Kagonest were battling the Ogres. A horrible read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complex novel that fails to catch your interest","review":"This book is, frankly, a very boring one. While it does tell a key tale in Krynn's history, and the characters are very real, I couldn't help but ask, \\"What does it matter this character did that-and-that and the other character did that-and-that?\\" The Irda are quite different from the ancient ogres, as other DragonLance books have mentioned. This book explains little of the Irda except the origins, and I doubt that they haven't changed since they first settled. Paste a new title on it - \\"The Old Ogres\\" - and give us more attention-grabbing plot developments, then I'll give this book a better review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest, by far.","review":"To start I am an avid Dragonlance fan, in fact, it is my favortie series and I personaly have over 35 paperbacks and a few hardcovers. I am writing this review to tell all other Dragonlance fans to find another book before reading this one. This is the first Dragonlance book I had to put down because I just couldn't read any more. I dont even recall what the story involved. Usually with a Dragonlance book I read untill the roof falls on my head. Even then if I didn't die I would keep on reading. However this book bored me, failed to excite me in any way, and was in my opinion poorly written. It took me a span of 2 years to finish. Other novels have been devoured in a day. Now Linda P Baker has written other books and Im not saying she is a low caliber author, but this book was just plain bad. I didnt like it, and this is the first Dragonlance book I have said this about. Thank you for reading, thats my two steel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst of the Series","review":"I had looked forward to reading this one because I had found the Irda to be fascinating when they were mentioned in other Dragonlance books. But this novel was an absolute disaster. First of all, the author does not know how to write and should be sent back to grammar school. Secondly, where was the fantasy? Basically, the Irda were depicted as Krynn's version of blue-skinned, modern-day Americans. On top of that, the most important element of their culture -- the fact that they were transformed into ogres -- happened so fast and ended so abruptly that you had to wonder if the author was just plain tired from writing such a pointless story. The book was boring, disappointing, and a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not the best Dragonlance book.","review":"Don't waste your time or money on this waste of paper.This is one of the most boring Dragonlance books period.Just read the first 2 chapters and the last 2 chapters of the book, and you got the essential storyline of the whole book.It is that pathetic of a book.Hardly anything intresting happens in this book at all.I don't want to read 300 pages of how Ogres enslave humans and elves, and mistreat them through-out the entire book, and the only excitement in the whole book happens at the end, when some good Ogres break away and make their own civilization.This is not essential reading for Dragonlance at all.

Duracells don't fit right so I had to hunt down some generic alkaline AA's. My 5 yr old son does enjoy the extending arm and the claw but the sound on that thing is deafening even with my high tolerance to noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that practices what it preaches","review":"Anderson describes a world in which the self is endangered, nearing extinction. Though his style is charming, funny, appealing to the masses, his ideas, as innovative as they seem, really have too many loopholes to be accepted in the academic world. It is a glitzy, superficial book making a circular argument about the \\"liberation\\" of the human being from the concept of self. The idea is good, but each chapter really needs a lot more explaining to really get to the whys and hows of things, if he's really serious about making a social statement. Otherwise, this book is as souless as the society he describes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little scientific rigor in Anderson's analysis of the self","review":"Anderson basis his book on an argument that has little to do with analysis and much to do with superficially convincing the reader to accept his position as true. It makes me so upset when writers attempt to manipulate the reader, as if we are stupid and cannot distinguish between real evidence and the general, abstract references he has presented. I hope that this book will not be taken seriously by the readers, and that someday someone will explicate these theories in a REAL analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"BE WARNED: NOT THE DVD ADVERTISED","review":"Potential buyers should be warned that this is not a DVD version of the made-for-film production that includes Angela Landsbury in the cast, though her name certainly appears on the box cover in the advertisement, the product description, and the reviews. It appears that none of the reviewers actually own a DVD copy of this film, and are therefore commenting on a different production than the one being sold (which I already own). As I remember, the production being sold here has sound issues, and the volume fades in and out. Nonetheless, \\"Hyacinth Bucket\\" gives a very strong performance as the foolish nursery maid, and the production has other appealing features to collectors."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE RIGHT MOVIE","review":"Unbelievably, the sellers of this product changed the credited name on the photo of the cover from \\"Patricia Routledge\\" to \\"Angela Lansbury.\\" This is the STAGE VERSION, not the movie version which includes Angela Lansbury in the cast.

Instead it is more like a novel. The book itself is a nice presentation as far as the cover photo and the printing adequate in size. The content I did not care for at all. I found the subject matter a little to weird. For example she uses descriptions like \\"having an intimate relationship with her dogs\\" and she needing to be more like a dog and her dog wanting to be more human. I found this a bit to much closeness for me. It was out there. I didn't even get 1/4 of the way through it and stopped reading.

An overview and summary of various terminologies provides a window into more broad topics in the sciences. As a college graduate I was familiar with many of these definitions, but none-the-less found the collection refreshing. This type of assemblage is best presented in a palpable compilation of 100 unrelated pieces, suitable for perusal in a single sitting. I would recommend this book as an intro or summary of scientific words and concepts. Anecdotal examples and illustrations reinforce definitions by providing applications and background of the various words, and their generic origins.As a long-time user of The American Heritage Dictionary, Fourth Edition, I support this type of layout for concise review and stimulating exploration of the less frequently visited vocabulary of the sciences, with etymologies included!

I should get the one by Thomas Cleary.Read the Afterward in Thomas Cleary's edition and you willsee why this one has so many errors in its translation.The first part of the book was much easier to understand,and it turns out that the meditation technique was a yogicexercise that is not in the Chinese text (but that was notclear from the formatting of the text).I'm giving this book a low rating.

My business success is in large part due to the fact that I seek out the counsel and advice from those who have a proven track record.

My husband thinks I can sing--but then so do all of those parents of the deluisonal folks trying out for American Idol, right?

Secondly, she spent sooooo much time talking about consonants. Ok, I get it, but is it really worth spending half an hour talking about it? I almost fell asleep. I was really looking for something that I could practice along with. The only good thing I learned was the \\"turkey baster\\" analogy.

The potential was there, but, sadly, Mr. Moore obviously lacked the skill to finish what he started. I agree with the reviewer who said it was repetitive.

Plain and simple. Every time Jared even came near her she wound up having sex with him, and regretting it later. She was dumb and sex-craved.Third story, could have been good, but there were too many unnecessary problems written in that would have been better left out.The fourth one, I didn't even get past the first few pages.

Put about 1 inch of milk in a 16oz mug and nuked it til steamy. Added 3 level tablespoons of Cocoa and stirred well. Then added a handful of semi-sweet chocolate morsels (you can use any chocolate you like) and stirred that until melted. Added an inch of heavy cream and topped it off with milk and nuked it til hot and steamy. It was thick, rich and delicious.

Shunlar never stepped outside her role as the stereotypical Amazon warrior, and the rest of the characters are equally flat. Creedath, the villain, is also thoroughly mediocre; sure, the author has him rape and kill a few people to show how bad he is, but it never makes any impact, somehow. We're told that he's this big, threatening, evil guy, but we're not SHOWN it. As for the plot, I'm not even sure if I remember it. The idea about crossbreeding dragons and humans was kind of interesting, but it never seemed to go anywhere. I hate to trash a first time author; I know personally how tough it is to send out that first manuscript and get rejected time and time again.

The sterotypical \\"bad guy,\\" Creedath, was just that: sterotypical. And, the big fight scene that you just keep waiting for never happens! He is so easily overpowered in the end that his whole bad guy persona just gets blasted into oblivion. The heroin of the story never does do anything remarkable either: sure, she fights like a man, wears mens clothing, but geez, how many times have we read this? Make her do something that makes the reader say \\"wow.\\" Also, her romance wasn't all that exciting either; it was a very typical love/hate relationship, and just left you waiting for something more to happen.But, on a good note, the storyline is an interesting concept in itself, and I would like to see it further explored in future books."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like a script less like a book.","review":"After reading this novel, I felt as if I had just looked over someone's script, rather than a full length novel. The characters never really leapt out at me, or even cause me to care about them in any way. The villain was a rough draft of any villian out there.Overall there were some great ideas I wished had been explored in more depth, however by the end I was happy to get it over with and move on to something else. Feels like it was published before it was finished.Much like the other reviewer I hate to bash a new authors first work, but this was flat and needed more depth throughout its entirety.

After reading this book and practicing what it recommends we became pain free and are still that way almost 10 years later. We have rocommended it and/or bought it for all our friends with similar complaints. It worked for all but one and the other for whom it did not work sadi before she read it that a book would not help her so she was predisposed not to believe in the remedies in the book. Everyone we know who approached it with an open and believing mind has been freed from the pain without surgery.

Also Doctors whose business would be threatened by this book weighed in negatively. I bought this book after learning that Sarno solved the back problems of ABC's John Stossell and Howard Stearn. If you can think of two more skeptical people than that let me know who they are. Book is light on exact instructions but the premise is enough to have solved my pain by 75%."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"When I purchased this book I was teaching yoga and was in great shape. I had a history of back trouble, but was managing it well. I was careful to bend my knees in certain postures and babied my lower back. This book convinced me that my back trouble was all in my head and that I shouldn't limit myself. I started working on forward bends to get my head to reach my knee (I had been told by my doctor that this was a no no). This resulted in full blown sciatica and my right foot is still numb 14 months later. Would Dr. Sarno say this numbness is all in my head?? I am now well on my way to recovery, but putting my head to my knee is no longer a goal of mine, nor do I believe it should be. While some illness certainly is psychosomatic, be careful with the information in this book or you may really hurt yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book transformed my life","review":"I've always considered myself the most skeptical of skeptics, but Dr. Sarno has earned my lifelong gratitude. I've suffered from severe, chronic back pain ever since I was attacked by a combative mental patient when I working as an R.N. This book liberated me. Since I read it, I've been Advil and Tylenol free for over a month, I've returned to lifting anything I want, doing vigorous aerobics, jazz dancing, and most important of all, I'm able to sit when I work (I'm now a writer), when I'd been forced to stand and write for months now due to the pain. Yes, the book is a little like Tinkerbell. You have to believe for it to work. But Dr. Sarno's common sense theories had the ring of truth for me from the first time I read them. I realize now that my accident wasn't the \\"cause\\" of my pain, it was the \\"trigger\\" and that has made all the difference in my life. Give this book a try!

Simply reading it is the cure to chronic pain, because Sarno leaves you no loopholes. If, however, you insist that your pain is a physical phenomenon (therefore not your fault) and not emotional, then Sarno's book won't help. Of course, I'm assuming anyone with chronic pain has had thorough medical exams to eliminate possible serious illnesses. If that's the case, then you should check out Sarno."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is fine;Supplier slow","review":"It took 22 days to receive this book from Seashellbooks_inc.

I was very disappointed in this book, despite all the hype. The book starts off discussing how Dr. Sarno discovered this \\"new\\" concept of mind-body connection and stress causing back pain. He then goes on for several chapters telling us how smart he is, and how so many people want to take him down. The rest of the book is testimonials about his program.I didn't buy the book to read how wonderful Sarno is. I bought it to learn about his program to relieve back pain. There's not one thing about his program.

I tried chiropratic sessions and massage to no avail. The day I purchased this book I could hardly walk. Literally hours after reading I felt better, not perfect but better. A few days later I was much better. Now several months later I'm just about 100% cured and have been doing any physical activity I want pain free.

I had back pain and all other manifestations of TMS (Tension Myositis Syndrome) for 22 years. Intuitively I knew what the problem was but doctors/manual therapists/accupuntcturists etc.etc.etc. had other opinions. This book finally answered all my questions as well as confirmed what I already knew, but because doctors ect. never mentioned it I didn't think there were such thing as my condition. This book is also gave me a valuable lesson that I should always, ALWAYS trust my intuition and not to give up until I get the answers that make sense to me. The answers will come, one just need to read the signs.Anyway, my backpain is gone.

Another thing about the book is that I got the impression for complete healing one must go to his clinic.

Fortunately I was pleasantly surprised. The more I read and the more I reflected on my real feelings the more the pain went away. My pain was gone within a week and it's been gone now for over a year. I never even finished the book.

I fear that my MRI-documented herniated disc will cause pain about as much as I fear my wrinkles will cause headaches. It was hard work getting better again--3 months last winter of diverting my attention to feelings instead of pain, practicing relaxation techniques, exercising, and constantly telling myself that my pain, although having physiological causes, was not from structural abnormalities. It took a leap of faith, which is not easy when doctors are pointing in alarm to your disc's pressing on a nerve. But once I accepted that my back and nerves were just fine, my cure came steadily. I am grateful beyond words. Anyone who has ever suffered from this all-encompassing pain understands what not having it and not fearing it mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life...","review":"I had been suffering from back pain for eight years, including sciatica, since my pregnancy. In fact, my back was so bad, just the thought of having another baby really scared me. I just did not think I could withstand the pressure of the pregnancy on my spine. I have also suffered from knee pain and foot pain all of which made my life almost unbearable at times. I saw Howard Stern on the Larry King Show talking about Dr. Sarno and his books. I bought the book and thought, \\"it can't be this simple. These people are imagining this.\\" But at the time I was taking four ibuprofen at a time, three times a day, and it was starting to affect my stomach. I quit the ibuprofen, and followed Dr. Sarno's steps. The bottom line - I have been almost pain free for one year. Occasionally I have a flare up, but I realize it for what it is and it does not last long. I recommend this book. It sounds crazy, but if you are in as much pain as I was, what have you got to lose??"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"I was really skeptic when I first read the book once the approach was radical and did not include any physical therapy.

It is very readable and convincing. It offer that stress and repressed anger can actually physically constrict nerve impules and its related affects in ways that cause the lower back pain that affects millions of Americans. The key to Dr. Sarno's remedy - and this is the key to being able to believe it and apply it - is to confront the psychogenic origin of the pain and drop all other therapies and aids. In other words, no more physical therapy, braces, exercises or adjustments since these are crutches that preclude confronting the mental origin of the problem. His argument is convincing and worth reading - but as one who suffers from chronic back problems, its an awful tough call to quit the physical remedy in lieu of the mental one.Nonetheless, its worth a read because it does provide insight whether one takes on Dr. Sarno's remedy or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't work for me.","review":"My review never appeared here when I posted it two months ago, so I'm posting it again in hopes it will appear this time.I read this book and faithfullyfollowed everything it suggested, and it didn't work for me at all. In such cases, the book suggests that the reader should consult with a psychologist to see if their back pain might be due to unresolved psychological issues -- I did that and it didn't work for me either.

And the gist of his book is that it's all in your head, so just evaluate your thoughts and change your thinking and your back pain will disappear. While this may help for some and I do believe in the power of the mind, it is ludicrous to throw out the notion that real injury and pathology lead to pain .

And although this book is fairly well written, I would actually give it negative stars if at all possible. Dr Sarno makes the mistake of strongly suggesting that virtually all back and joint disorders are the result of mind driven oxygen deprivation...resulting from stress. This, while true for many, is also likely equally untrue for many more. However, if you follow his advice and try to physically perform as though your ailments were imaginary, as he seems to suggest, you could very very possibly turn an already damaging condition into a crippling one. If, for example, you decide to lift heavy objects like you used to, operating under the premise that you shouldn't give in to the \\"illusion of injury\\" that your mind is creating, then you could very well rupture discs, tear weak ligaments etc...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Travesty of \\"medicine\\"","review":"Frankly, I would give this book less than 1 star.

As a nurse, it concerns me that people will follow his way of thinking without consulting a physician. I know he states to consult a physician...but that often doesn't happen.

Finally, a massage therapist brought it to my attention that the anti-depressants I was taking was causing the pain. I stopped them, and my pain went away. It blows me away that Dr. Sarno has written a book without considering any of the many, many causes of back pain. He is doing his readers a real disservice. Doctors in general need to be much, much aware of side-effects. Any one with back pain, who is on anti-depressants, should consider whether these drugs could be causing the pain.

Sarno ommits to tell us about these other sources he gives little credence to, which is an enorrmous oversight in educating people about back pain. It is misleading to people who would be better served to know the full truth about sources of back pain, particualry exposure to toxic chemicals in our environment disrupting the hormonal system.

I had been suffering for three years with lower back pain and a so-called \\"slipped disk.\\" I spent thousands of dollars on conventional methods without any positive results. I constantly thought about how much my back hurt. One day I saw Sarno's book in a bookstore and bought it. That evening I read the first 30 or 40 pages. As I read, amazingly my back problems melted away. No pills, no exercise, nothing. Just a quick attitude change. It really was exactly as Sarno said. Back pain was due to emotional stress and nothing more. Sounds strange, but my back pain went away that day. It has crept back at times since then, but simply rereading \\"Healing Back Pain\\" makes it go away every time, and immediately. This is an amazing book. If you have given up on doctors, exercise, and you fear surgery, read this book for the easy way out of your pain. This is one thing that sounds too good to be true, but it really is true!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable!","review":"List me as one of those who began feeling better while reading the book. I've been battling lower back pain as well as sciatic pain in my right leg for a year and a half. I've tried chiropractors, massage therapy, orthopedic m.d.'s and physical therapy. Admittedly, I am a LOT more flexible now with all of the stretching excercises. But, not until I read this book did the pain subside. That is simply astonishing. And, it's only getting better. Dr. Sarno accurately described my history of symptoms. And, his methods for recovery have worked. If you have chronic pain, back or otherwise, this book may offer you an unbelievable answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"This works for other body pains!","review":"I originally heard about this book by watiching the 20/20 segment about Dr. Sarno's theory. I have suffered abdominal pain and indigestion for years with little relief from medications, diets, etc. After hearing about this mind-body theory, I applied it to my abdominal pain and within one week I was pain free. In fact, I've had almost no indigestion or abdominal pain in the months since - and now eat almost anything I desire!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent exposition of author's experience treating back pain without surgery","review":"Dr. Sarno describes has management of chronic low back pain on the assumption many cases can be healed without surgical intervention, in spite of positive radiological findings."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book very helpful","review":"this book help me to get rid of back pain and thought me how my pain was more phycosomatic and any mechanical/phycical problem with my back. I'm pain free and will highly recommend this book to anybody that suffers from back pain, it works"},{"rating":"1","title":"Psycho-babble Masquerading as New Approach to Pain Treatment","review":"Sarno's thesis, that repressed rage and anxiety cause back pain in almost EVERY case, is ridiculous, unsupported mushy thinking. Just the fact that he lumps all kinds of other pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia and TMJ and bursitis under his umbrella of Tension Myositis Syndrome (TMS) should be a tip off that his theories are vague and unsupported by scientific rigor. Yes, we all have some repressed rage and some anxiety in our psychological makeup, so it is easy to \\"see one's self\\" in his typical patient profile. And yes, there surely is a Mind-Body Connection, but Sarno's work doesn't offer any original thinking or even a cogent explanation of what we currently know about this topic. A well-meaning friend sent this book to me. I have had 4 surgeries for a very painful, ongoing degenerative condition. Frankly, I was insulted by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summary: It hurts because your ticked off about something","review":"Your back pain is a psychologically manifested from your problems in life...at least that is what John E. Sarno is trying to convince you to believe. Actually, he has probably gotten a lot of publicity because it give's psychiatrists the ability put people on psychotropic drugs for life. Yes the fact that you are probably over worked and underpaid is probably why you are ticked off and you have back pain. This book completely disregards the fact that people weren't made to sit in front of a computer 8 hours a day. Face it John Sarno- Our back's are messed up from an injury- too much work and not enough time to re-create and exercise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarno's amazing book","review":"This book is amazing. I have been suffering from stomach problems, specifically a spastic colon, for years. From reading this book I became aware of how much I have been repressing for the past 30 years (and I've had a wonderful life.) I also became aware that all the fear that I have felt has just been a coping mechanism to distract me from facing what I really felt. I read the book 1 month ago, have had numerous revelations about my life and am about 90% pain free. Unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am completely healed!","review":"Thank you Dr. Sarno for giving me my life back. I broke my back and suffered for years with crippling chronic pain. I tired every therapy imaginable. Nothing worked. I was terrified of my back, and of being crippled for life. Since reading these books (Four years ago) I do everything I want to do; dance, lift HEAVY things, garden, play sports, etc. I am thrilled out of my mind. READ THIS BOOK! I read all of his books - twice. This was the only diagnosis that resonated with me. Just trust his advice and go as quickly or slowly as you need to. Thank you, thank you, thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a look.","review":"I think this book will be most helpful for people who have been suffering with back pain for a long period of time (months to years). Most back pain lasts only a short time, and if it persists, you probably either have a really serious medical problem (that is usually obvious) or there are psychological factors involved.If you've been through the conventional medical system with your back pain for a long time with no satisfaction, have had many physical treatments (such as heat, massage, manipulation, etc.) with no relief, AND have had serious back pain issues ruled out, then I say it would be well worth your while to at least check out this book. While there are true physical causes of back pain that are not psychological, this book will make you think about any stress related issues that could be a part of your pain. Other self-help books I liked includeTreat Your Own Spinal Stenosis. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still doing great after five years!","review":"I like to check in every now and then with my progress and I have to say that since reading this book and implementing its suggestions in 1999, I have been free of back pain for five years. I NEVER take it for granted. I biked 35 miles just today without so much as a twinge. I had suffered with back pain for ten years after being attacked by a combative patient at work (I was a psych nurse) so it was pretty much a miracle to stumble on Dr. Sarno's book and his theories. I'm an incredibly practical person who tends to pooh-pooh a lot of holistic medicine, but these theories are based on common sense. If I ever feel even a twinge of discomfort, usually re-reading the Prologue is enough to make me better. Thank you, Dr. Sarno, for changing my life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have chronic back pain read this book!","review":"Hands down, read this book if you are experiencing chronic back pain and you really think there could be more to it then structural.In 1998 I suffered torn SI ligaments and ruptured lumbar discs in my lower back. After a year of physical therapy the left over aches and sciatic pains had me limping for another year. It seemed to me the chronic pain I was feeling should not have been as severe with all the healing work that was done to strengthen my back. At the end of 1999 I saw an interview on television with the author of this book. The next day I purchased the book and read it cover to cover. The following morning my back pain was reduced by 90% and it has never returned to the chronic ache that I felt for years before reading \\"Healing Back Pain\\".Did I mention if you have chronic back pain you should really read this book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It worked!!","review":"I have just read this book. And he made sense. I have suffered with back pain for 3years (during 94-97) and I have tried everything (PT/meds/Injections). MRI findings were normal. After 3 years, the pain was gone (I can correlate that to phsychological reasons now). Now, of course I am having back pain and as soon as it started I was terrified with the very idea that I might have to suffer this a few more years (or life long). The idea itself, I think, is causing varibale symptoms (This time also MRI findings normal) and excruciating back pain and sciatica pain symptoms. After reading the book, it all made sense. I am still in pain but am trying to fight out my *fear*. I understand, (as the book itself states), it would work for the *majority*.----------------------UpdatedFinally, Within 4 weeks I am free of back pain. Just because of the book. Period!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Valid, but leaves out the body to mind connection.","review":"While I agree with the importance of the mind and emotions in influencing our health and well being, I think it is also important to remember the corollary. If the body is in need of attention, healing, repair, then treat the body! That may require help from someone outside ourselves. Often, if the body is re-set, so to speak, the mind follows suit. That's often as true as the mind being primary. So, don't get discouraged if Dr. Sarno's method doesn't work for you. Think also: Free the body of its stresses, which frees the mind, which helps the body. Sometimes you have to approach the problem from a different point on the loop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I would have read this first.","review":"Well, I know it is hard to believe that simply reading a book could help you heal so much. I read through the testamonials too. After failed back surgery in 1995, many chiropractors etc., I thought my career as an airline pilot was over. After reading Dr. Sarno's book, I was skeptical. I worked hard at it though, because I was desperate. And guess what...no kidding, my pain went away. From watching a grown man cry, not being able to move, not even lie down without pain, my friends and family watched a truly miraculous turn around. I am 100% pain-free. What do you have to lose, $12? How much have you already paid for other medical help? It's worth the investment to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Author Clark Night, William H. Bates Review, Book Video","review":"Good Book. Teaches me to keep my mind off the tension in my neck.

I get the courage to go out, keep moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works for me!","review":"I had years of back pains and went through all kinds of therapy you can think of. I won't list them here because I don't want to discourage you from trying any of that. I was practically giving up and ready for surgery until I came across this book in my local library one day. As soon as I read it, the whole thing became crystal clear to me - that the root cause was not my back, but the things that was happening to my life during that time. I'm an engineer by training and by profession, and I would be the last person to embrace the new age things, but this book showed me the clear path on how to rebuild my life and my health. If you gave up all hopes like I did, give this book a chance. It worked for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book - read with open mind","review":"I bought this book for my wife but I read it and it made sense to me. I used the concepts on a problem I was having with my left foot. I was amazed to find that within 2 weeks the swelling around my big toe (which has been swollen for over 10 years due to an injury and arthritis per the foot specialist) went down to around 25 percent of what it had been for all those years. Now my shoes fit and I have very little pain. Previously I was told I would need to have the bone and socket cut out and replaced in order to resolve the pain. I do have an old injury that will not completely go away but by using the concepts of this book, I no longer worry about it nor does it bother me. I think this book will work for people with certain mind sets better than with others. I gave it to my brother who has back issues almost exactly as the book describes but he is very skeptical and doesn't believe in it and has not finished the book. He still has back problems..."},{"rating":"2","title":"no more pain","review":"This book literally saved me thousands and thousands of dollars. Last summer I threw my back out and was in excriciating pain. I was so bad I literally could not walk, and was on painkillers. I bought Sarno out of curiosity and within a week of reading it, and recognizing that my pain was stress related, my back pain was gone. One has to be willing to deal with issues, though, and I'm sure there are many people who would rather take a pill or have surgery than really deal with their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Pain? Read this book!","review":"After suffering on and off from back, knee and foot pain for years, I read Dr. Sarno's book. I have felt so much better ever since - four years now! Everytime I start experiencing pain, I reread his book and within a couple of days I'm better. I am off of my 800mg of Ibuprofen a day. I don't know if he is right on the money with his theory, or if it is just mind over matter or what. Quite frankly, I don't care. All I know is I am in my forties and feel better than I did throughout all of my thirties. I only wish I had heard of his book earlier."},{"rating":"2","title":"can someone please remove the Fred Amir reviews?","review":"Sarno's book gets 5 stars - cured me in 2 weeks - and I only found it because of Amazon.

However, many chronic back pain patients certainly do have structual damage. Such as Degenerative Disc Disease, severe Lordois, Stenosis and many other true structual conditions. I and my patients did not find his daily reminders particularily helpful, since their conditions were much more then TMS [ Tension Myositis Syndrome ]. Many doctors have their own opinions. He did not have the clinical studies to back up his hypothoses. Many of my colleques just do not agree with him.

If you are in crippling pain and it is due to a real condition such as a herniated disk then wishing the pain away is not going to work.My advice, bypass this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly a good book","review":"The information in this book is very good. However, the fact that pain can be rooted in repressed emotions and anger is nothing new to hypnotist, it just seems the author is wanting to claim credit for 'discovering' this. Hypnotist have been addressing this problem since before the author 'discoverd' it. The method the author uses for removing or acknowledging the problem and relieving the pain is strictly along the lines of a medical doctor and psychologist. Sarano is way out of line poohooing hypnotist and saying their treatments will wear off. As with most M.D.'s they feel their way is the only way and I am sure much more expensive and profitable for the M.D. versus seeing a hypnotist."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a gift","review":"I ordered this book as a gift for my husband so I have not actually read it myself. Based on the other reviews I have read, they seem pretty accurate. It seems the book has a theory that some pain can stem from repressed feelings. It is a quick, easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Skeptics Only","review":"Despite the inference contained within the title, this book has painfully few words directly applicable to how the reader may address his/her own back pain. It is definitely not for the reader who is seeking a \\"how to\\" book. Rather this book is directed toward the reader or practicianer who does not believe that the mind has an influence on the physical experience of pain, and/or the reader who wishes to review the author's model candidates of those whose pain may originate in the mind. If you are a non-believer, this book just may be for you. If you are already a believer, prepare to be bombarded with a sufferably heavy dose of redundant justifications and patient stories aimed soley to convince the reader that the mind does influence the body."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Years Later, Still Pain Free","review":"It's been three years since I first read this book and said goodbye to my long history of backpain (see my first customer review \\"My Back Pain Evaporated\\", 3 Aug 2000). Today I ride roller coasters and roughhouse with my young sons, help co-workers move office furniture (including large safes), and enjoy life each and every day. I've probably purchased 15 copies of this book and given away all but two. I always keep a copy close at hand to review whenever my back gets stiff from day to day pressures. It allows me to re-focus and my back quickly loosens up. I LOVE THIS BOOK. Thanks Dr. Sarno."},{"rating":"1","title":"tere may be another answer for you....","review":"Some of you may have what I have and it's called PYRIFORMIS SYNDROM. The muscle is trapping the sciatic nerve. A test can be done to diagnose this painful problem. Dr. Sarno discounts this information completely. His methods did work for me, but never more than a few hours at a time. I had no life,just pain down my left leg and it never moved anywhere else for four full months, 24 hrs a day, 7 days a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful but!","review":"I agree with the reader from Kansas City. Dr. Sarno does an excellent job describing the cause of back pain, but he does not give the reader concrete steps for recovery. That's where Fred Amir's Rapid Recovery from Back and Neck Pain complements the process. It gave me specific things to do to plan my own recovery from back pain and sciatica. It worked very fast and the additional strategies in the book have helped me remain pain free for two years now. Maybe someday they will be made into one book, as the other reader suggested. Thank you Dr. Sano and Mr. Amir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for pagans...","review":"In my continuing quest for good books for pagan children, I picked up some of the \\"Little Witch\\" titles.

Ugly, bad, cooking up icky potions, riding on broomsticks...you know the type. Little Witch gets in trouble for being \\"too good\\" because she makes her bed and things like that.I'm glad I saw these at the library and did not buy them.

Did any body think that even our resources in life & business are like that goose & we have to take care about the well being of our resources.The best thing about this book is that it redirects your priorities.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Habit-forming","review":"Covey's one-man publishing industry stresses the application of common sense to your pathetic, meaningless life, most importantly in the service of the company/corporation/entity/thing you work for.The 'substance' of this book can be condensed in a magazine article, or a good web article, but that would negate the reason to publish yet another book chock full 'o stories about personal success, vision, leadership, success, enhancement, empowerment, blah, blah, blah, vision, moral integrity, data integrity, success, effectiveness, and other important things.Covey is a thinking man, hence the tweaked model with the 'discovery' of the 8th habit. No doubt a 9th, and 10th habit do exist. Perhaps penning another rehash of previously published material? A true success story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, tedious and MUCH too long","review":"I just read several of the other reviews of this book on the Amazon site and they were obviously written, in my opinion, by people who either haven't read the book or have some interest in selling the book. I have loved Covey's other books and I think his software and paper products are terrific, but this book is the ultimate in taking something simple and making it complex (and very tedious to read). Way too long. Tedious reading. I have a feeling many of the other reviews originated from areas near Provo, Utah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long-winded, scattered, unoriginal, lack of application","review":"Given the high-expectations most people have for Covey, this book disappoints.Long-winded: Covey takes way too long to explain what he is trying to say. I found myself saying 'OK!, lets get to the point already'. This book should be a quater of its size.Scattered: The material and thoughts in the book are scattered.Unoriginal: Alot of material from other authors were used. Alot of time spent reviewing his ideas from the 7 Habits. Alot of pages wasted mapping his ideas to other authors.Lack of application: No substantial application for readers to apply.Overall disappointing. Book has good intentions but message delivered poorly and uneffectively."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reactions- Jeff Kucharski","review":"The 8th Habit will take you from effectiveness to greatness. Stephen R. Covey creates the road map that will expand your mind to a higher level of thinking.

Sixteen inspirational companion films are included in a DVD for viewing at your leisure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Researched and Redundant","review":"Having admired Dr. Covey's 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and First Things First (the latter written with the Merrills), I admit to be highly disappointed with the current volume. It's a shoddy piece of work; a real cut-and-paste job.Here's just one example: There is a lengthy quotation given, which readers of self-help books will recognize as \\"The Paradoxical Commandments\\" by Dr. Kent Keith. I can not quote them here for copyright reasons. The point is that Covey has erroneously attributed them to Mother Theresa, who no more wrote them than I did. And that's only one example.Stay away from this book, and if you've already bought it, see if you can return it. If not, hurl it in the garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Covey hits a home run","review":"For those who are familiar with his writing, Steven Covey is (was) brilliant in his use of facts to drive home his theories.

Though he was probably not too terribly preoccupied with himself and his work being intentionally shunned by the CCM crowd (a commercialized, mega-industry he had hoped his music would not lead to), everyone else should be.That intentional and painfully obvious snubbing of Larry Norman alone makes this collection fall completely off of my list, relegating it to little more than a record of a select group of industry insider's private taping session as they reminisce and perform some of their own past works for each other. Sure, there is the occassional, \\"Oh, yeah, I remember that.\\" or \\"I wish they were still a part of the music scene.\\" but those observations are too few and far between.No thanks, I'll pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Global Perspective...","review":"Philip Gardiner skillfully blends history, spirituality, tradition, religion and myth in an engaging exploration of the Ark and Mary's shroud.

I was expecting some kind of fantastical concept of aliens or batteries and yet what I discovered was common sense missed by everyone. Suitably impressive is an understatement for this DVD, whereas exceptional entertainment and information equally does not seem to do it justice. A clever film that makes you seriously think and nice in these days of What the Bleep nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"A joke","review":"Tell me they're joking, the earlier reviewers. This DVD is a dreadful piece of work.Gardiner's arguments are all over the place, and time after time he makes assertions without any evidence at all, then treats them as fact.As for the production, it's so OTT it's laughable, with the ridiculous over-use of jangling artwork and the music frequently drowning out the speech (though maybe that's not such a bad thing!).Bad, bad, bad.

There is no jargon, just pages of common sense approaches that apply not just to children who fall within the diagnosis of DCD, but for many other children who struggle to concentrate, sit still or just take part with their peers. It should be read, not just by parents, but by all child carers who are interested in providing the best possible care for the children they work with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for the Price","review":"The price was too high for what was given in my opinion.

As many of the reviews mentioned it worked at well at first but this lasted no more than a couple of days and seriously we didn't even play with it that much. None of the remote buttons work, it won't walk at all, all it does it make sounds and the eyes change color. Every now and then my daughter brings it out to play and then I am reminded at what piece of garbage this thing is. She really wants to play with it and can't understand why it doesn't work anymore. Neither can I. And yes we've changed the batteries so many times, I've lost count.Seriously DO NOT buy this toy. Maybe we got a lemon but based on the other reviews there are a lot of lemons out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for older children","review":"This \\"pet\\" is a good choice for children who can't have real pets.

Tekno doesn't do half the things promised on the packaging. We've replaced the batteries, followed the instructions to a T, and tried their customer service line (which always seems to be a recording saying \\"All representatives are busy, please try again later.\\" no matter when you call).So... customer service is non-existent AND you can't return him to the store. It says right in the instruction booklet, \\"This product cannot be returned for a refund after it has been unpacked and used.\\" How do you know it doesn't work until you unpack and try it????In short, save your money.

Truly disappointing! First, it was a major hurdle just getting this thing out of the box. The whole process took about 40 minutes or so. But then, the pre-installed batteries did not work in either the dog or the remote. So, off to a local pharmacy to buy batteries. After the new batteries were installed, the product turned on but did not work as was claimed. The remote does not work at all and it seems that the dog just walks back and forth.

Both books are enchanted windows into past worlds. Malvern's tale of the biblical heroine Esther brings a time long-ago vividly to life.

I recently found another copy which I plan to give my granddaughter. I re-read it and found it is still a good read and I will check out other books by Gladys Malvern. \\"Behold Your Queen!\\" may be more myth than reality, and in some aspects is today not quite \\"politically correct.\\" It is nonetheless a gripping story. I even read the Book of Esther and could see where the author incorporated descriptions of the royal palace into her narrative. I recommend this book which stands the test of years because it is well written and is the type of book which would send a reader off on other quests for knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully well written historical romance","review":"Among the best of this author's many excellent historical novels. I discovered Gladys Malvern by chance in grade school. She was my introduction to the genre.

Her experiences are essentially generic. She rides on back of a motorcycle ridden by her mentor. Was it a dirt bike, street bike, crotch rocket, cruiser...? What group of Indians did her mentor belong to--plains, coastal, southwest...? Pretending fiction is fact is an old marketing ploy that goes back at least to Robinson Crusoe.

Very lightweight. Your suspension of disbelief will last about 5 pages, unless you have been put under its corny spell like many reviewers seem to have been.

Departments, where they use the input from staff and actually give credit to their staff, display positive progress and turnover percentages go down. Employees feel valued when their input is taken seriously. Too many times in organizations, I see the presidents, vice presidents, directors, and sometimes managers all give lip service to utilizing their staff, but I don't see the action on follow up. And supervisors are usually left in the dark about what to do; so the whole idea falls apart. Following this book will truly improve the workplace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Motivating After all these years","review":"I just recently re-read Gung Ho! and found it just as refreshing and motivating as when it first came out. Without giving the plot away, let's just say it's an easy-to-remember system that builds the foundation of an enthusiastic team geared to achieve more than they ever thought they could. Since I was the business leader and development manager on a memorable and exciting project, where everything just clicked, and our team was able to deliver a product that is outselling others of its class in record time, and against the disbelief of the other units, I have to say that it is a once-in-a-lifetime confluence of the stars (or the squirrels, beavers, and geese), that makes all of it happen.

I find it hard to believe that Ken Blanchard with all his millions would be having coffee at a Denny's restaurant. The story is a total fabrication.

Gotta make the big bucks for those CEO's! After all, \\"Gung-Ho!\\" is an old Haida word that means--no, wait, it's a word GI's brought back from East Asia.

This was easy to read with clear concise examples on how to put this common sense advice to use. Peggy Sinclair and Andy Longclaw attempt to change their organization in order to save the company and town they live in. The story is a simple parable about how to motivate people to be productive, encourage leadership and increase customer service. The Spirit of the Squirrel, The Way of the Beaver and The Gift of the Goose discuss various ways to make employees feel important and provide positive reinforcement for work well done.I definitely recommend this book for managers/leaders that may be stuck in a rut and looking for motivation. If you are a student of leadership, this will be a 45-minute read and much will be review. Small business owners can use these techniques when dealing with their employees...I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Typical Management Book","review":"Gung Ho has it all - a great narrative, humor, inspiration and valuable lessons that can benefit any organization. It illustrates the significance of intrinsic motivation and allowing employees to own their organization's success.

Leadership is not about making employees do their job - it is about inspiring them to want to do their jobs to the best of their ability and to be a part of their organization's success.

They're almost common sense in a way. If people participate in deciding goals they'll be much more likely to work towards them. If people are given more control over what they need to do, people will feel like they're accomplishing their own challenges. If people are verbally congratulated about their work, they will feel better about themselves and have higher moral.Overall, it was an easy read and provides sound advice.

Recall first seeing the B-52's perform on (of all things!) The Guiding Light soap opera back in the early 1980's, its now hard to believe they have been around for over three decades.

I spent time with Rachel Saint and Dayuma - left out of the film was how Dayuma's son played a part in the tribe's development in contact with western civilazation. Also, how Dayuma became Materiarch of the tribe and worked hard to get the protectorate formed, The last scene showing Minkaya down on his knees was terrible, Minkaya is to bashful to ever have preform in that way.Since I am so familuar with these people, I guess the film was not what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Spear Missed Its Mark","review":"I was disappointed by the End of the Spear for one major reason: they avoided the whole reason that Nate Saint and his team went to the tribe. The main reason was not to stop the killing althought they wanted to stop the killing. It was not to change their culture although it needed to be changed before they killed themselves off. It was not to bring better living conditions, health, and clothing although these needed changing. The reason the missionaries risked their lives to go to this tribe was because they sincerely believed that since these people had never heard the Gospel of Jesus Christ, they would never have a chance to believe and have eternal life with God. Their earnestness came from this conviction. Aside one or two vague references to this, the movie missed the point. This is not merely an opinion. Read the primary sources yourself. These include: Through Gates of Spleandor by Elisabeth Elliot, Jungle Pilot by Russel Hitt, and The Dayuma Story by Ethel Wallis"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful movie!","review":"I have rarely seen a more moving story than the one told in The End of the Spear. The acting was superbly done. It gets across not only what the main characters did, but quite a bit of what they were thinking, as well. Much is told through facial expressions and body language, and this is quite well done.My only beef with it and the reason for four stars instead of five is that I thought some of the narration was lacking. Occasionally, it was hard to follow the story, exactly. It helped that I was familiar with the story through Elisabeth Elliot's writings. Some of these things may not be caught by the uninitiated!It is still worth seeing. I am rarely moved by something I see on screen as much as I was by this movie. I recommend it to anyone other than young children. Because of its level of violence, it may not be appropriate for young children, but it is a story that needed to be told."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good.","review":"I really enjoyed this movie.

Scenes of tribal warfare and bloodshed dominate the early part of the film and they are confusing and disjointed, with subtitles which don't do much to enlighten the viewer. I agree with the reviewer who said that the missionaries who give their lives in Ecuador are shown as rather silly, instead of the dedicated Christians that they were. The photography is quite beautiful at times, but that is sometimes lost in the disjointed editing of the film.

Worst of all, it was just plain boring.

It stirs you when you read of her childhood and her persistance to love her mother who never wanted to love her. Her gradual ascention to show business fades Norma Jeane out as you see her fall victim to slavery under the strict authority the Studio had over her. Her failure to have a family, a loving marriage and even string together her own life is depicted so graphically that when you read this book you relate to Norma Jeane in a very personal way. I thoroughly suggest that you read this book to inspire your opinions of this beautiful, intellegent woman who was rightly portrayed as a candle in the wind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book of the year","review":"The year isn't over, not even half over, but I doubt that there can be another book this bad published this year, perhaps even for a longer time. The writing, which tries to pass itself off as \\"poetry\\" (in italics yet!) reads at best like a rushed first draft, unrevised, repetitive, at times incoherent. The story itself about a \\"fictive\\" Norma Jeane is grueling. Oates uses some details from Marilyn Monroe's actual life and then shrouds it in trashy fantasies, mostly violently sexual, so ugly at times that the reader has to recoil from it, especially since those parts are linked to a real person, however fictionalized. Despite all the publicity that Oates has received because of the association to Marilyn Monroe, readers like myself will feel a strong aversion to this tawdry performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reckless, over-wrought novel","review":"It's been almost two months since I read this truly awful book, and the sense of it still lingers with me like an after-taste--those horrifying scenes of sexual brutalization that Oates makes up for her fictional Norma Jeane/Marilyn Monroe; those endless ruminations on God-knows-what, rambling, incoherent; those mean-spirited passages that pretend to be Norma Jeane's judgement of herself, but are, of course, Oates' judgement of Norma Jeane. Based on what? Oates owes her fans an apology, for allowing this reckless, over-wrought book to go out like this; didn't an editor see it? Is Ms. Oates so beyond reproach (but why?) that no one cautioned her about this disaster?

Ms Oates even refers to Ms Monroe by her screen names roles. It always bothers me when imtimate conversations, and emotional feeling are conveyed as though this is based on....interviews with the dead?

It showed her addiction to sex and sedatives. But you have to wonder, what's the truth and what's not? How can the author of this book know how Marilyn felt in the different situations? If Marilyn was alive, and could retell her story, then it would be great. But this is based on facts about her life, and the rest seems like guesswork. That doesn't give you more knowledge of her life. I know it is a novel, and not a biography. But when you her that this is the story about her behind the glamour, you expect a lot. And I wasn't impressed by the result. Some chapters are better than others. But once the author repeats herself over and over again in what is supposed to be a poem written by Norma Jean, it is awful. I would not recommend this book for anyone.

Monroe's life wasn't exactly the happily ever fantasy what with her rough beginning, the abuse, the sex and the drugs. I thought Oates did an enviable job of recreating Monroe's voice, her motivation and getting to the heart of the woman behind the myth. It begins with Monroe as a young child and portrays the abuse she suffers at the hands of an unstable mother and sets the ground work for Marilyn's unsuccessful search for a normal life which clashes time and time again with her overwhelming drive to become a successful and important actress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even The Best Authors Can't Always Be Great","review":"Oates is fond of taking iconic figures (Marilyn Monroe in Blonde) and watershed events in American history (Ted Kennedy's Chappaquiddick incident in Black Water; the Detroit riots in them) and novelising them. Usually Oates is dead-on in her re-workings of fact but in Blonde, she misses the mark. I know some people who read this long, stumbling book and liked it, but they were major fans of Monroe. Personally I found the story uninteresting, the message of tragedy and blame unworthy of the intricate genius of Oates, and the Marilyn of the novel less exploited and pre-programmed to failure, as Oates wished her to seem, and more of an annoying fool too hamstrung by her own inability to learn from mistakes to successfully manage her own ambitions. Joyce Carol Oates is still one of the greatest writers in American letters, but in Blonde she fails to deliver a work that meets her own lofty hopes for the ideas out of which it grew."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shameful performance, all around.","review":"It's distressing to me to read the violent criticism that Oates' fans are aiming at those who disagree about their view of this really terrible novel. The word \\"Masterpiece\\" recurs with amazing regularity; the tone is almost the same in each \\"review.\\" To call those who dislike this book \\"fascistic\\" is extreme, as extreme as this novel that purports to be non-fiction, and yet uses actual names. The book at times is so assaulting that one has to put it down, disgusted by some of the sexual details that Oates makes up; they amount to violent fantasies, really. To say that this book is well written is to say that one doesn't recognize good writing. Messy, has been used, and I agree with the Kirkus reviewer that called it \\"one of the worst novels ever written.\\" Oates should indeed be ashamed of herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another misfire from JCO","review":"I'm am a very big fan of JCO.

I didn't find the story compelling or interesting even though it was about Marilyn. I'm not sure if this book was a ploy for JCO to get more readers by writing a story about a popular person. New readers I';m sure will wonder what all the hype was about. Here was a missed chance for JCO to get the acclaim she deserves.

Why? Because in this novel, Joyce Carol Oates (author of such fabulous novels as \\"Bellefleur\\", \\"Them\\", \\"Expensive People\\" and \\"My Heart laid bare\\") paints a portrait that is painful and disturbing to see... in here Marilyn Monroe not as Mailer's Goddess, but as a woman who was a victim of herself and of the greed of others.This is one of the best novels I've read in years.

But the biggest insult is from Oates to her readers. Her bizarre infatuation with Marilyn Monroe did not need to produce a book.

Ignore all the reviews that worry over its factual details as if it were a biography and not a work of the imagination. Oates, of course, has the richest, most detailed, most terrifyingly thorough imagination around and it's likely that we won't need another novel about Hollywood for a lot of years. BLONDE is certainly shocking, but only because its ugliness seems so truthful. It's also a lot of fun to read, creating, at times, a buzz in your head, a kind of high. It messes with you, this book. There's a line at the end of Russel Banks equally great novel, \\"Continental Drift\\", that seems to apply to what Oates has accomplished here: \\"Go, my book and help destroy the world as it is.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Blonde","review":"Tragic...poignant...a woman undone by her own circumstances and the people unable to see her for herself.

If you like novels, you'll like Blonde. If you like mysteries, you'll like Blonde\\".I like biographies, I like novels and I like mysteries. But I hate Blonde. For me Marilyn counts more than the literary aspects of the novel. If your a Marilyn fan-you'll hate Blonde.It's another degrading book about Marilyn. Who cares if it's fictious or not - the line between the truth and fiction (lies?) regarding Marilyn's life is blurred enough already but this book makes it disappear. People know that it's fiction but they forget about it while reading it and soon everyone thinks it's all true. If you don't know anything about Marilyn from other books, please don't read it. For Marilyn's sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"The famous are victims of us all - poor Marilyn, psychoanalyzed by a great writer gone amuck. I found this book self-indulgent, excessive, unremitting and completely lacking in insight for her main character.

Of course, this book gets by under the guise of fiction ... whatever, I could not finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful and pretentious, eh?","review":"I kept from reading this novel because of all the terrible reviews it was getting all over the place; but then I decided no novel could be that bad. I was wrong--it's worse. The prose is at times undecipherable, and I kept reading only to see whether it would become even worse. It did. Ostensibly the story of Norma Jeane who became Marilyn Monroe, it amounts to drivel, hot-house imaginings about another's sexual life, pretentious pronouncements about acting and just about everything else Oates can conjure up, including (really!) stuffed birds. And why does every character have to end sentences with, \\"Eh?\\" .... And pretentious?

Young childhood in Chicago, growing up in rural Iowa, then being lucky enough to land a newspaper job on a trip to Europe (days before having to head back to Prohibition-time rural America), and then spending his young adulthood in the glorious cities of Europe in the Golden Years, before the shadows of Fascism and Nazism began to dim the lights...(but that leads to the second book of his autobiographical trilogy).I find this man's accounts of life in the U.S. Midwest, of meeting celebrities and writers and leaders of the thriving, to-be-short-lived Europe of the Twenties (and falling in love as well..don't we all), to be gripping and entertaining. I envy Mr. Shirer's life, too. My favorite autobiography of any I have read, bar none."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to return my copy","review":"No one is a stauncher men's libber and supporter of men's rights than I am, but this book was so lousy that I had to send it back. Sieberman comes across as the sort of guy who rushes out of his house to yell at the kids to get off of his lawn. The writing was only marginally coherent, and while I might agree with some of his anti-feminist positions they just weren't approached from the right perspective IMO. I think he really missed the point, and he made me feel somewhat embarassed to be on basically the same side of many of the issues he dealt with. There are many much much better books out there which handle these topics better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should not even be touched by human hands","review":"First of all, this book is written by someone who has dedicated their career to writing military technical manuals. Enough said. This man is a blatant misogynist and misandryst. Furthermore, he obviously has no idea what feminism actually means and seems to be reacting entirely from media inspired images of 'angry women' with hairy legs and armpits. Please, reader, do not buy this book. I'll give you one quote (from the cover) that sums up this book: \\"Now, at the bidding of feminists, women have cut their children adrift without thinking or caring about the consequences of this experiment. Our daycare culture, brought on by the feminists, has given us dysfunctional older children most likely to be emotionally maladjusted, violent, antiosocial and resistant to discipline...\\" Give me a real break, Howard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another side of Faulkener","review":"My wife worked for the Greenville,, MS paper and knew the author.

I read Turtle, Swan, and only one of the poems in that collection left any impression upon me. (The title poem of the book--it touched me very deeply.) I came into Atlantis not expecting more than one poem to impress me.I was pleasantly surprised. In this collection, he wrote many more poems about his homosexuality (as opposed to boring nature poems), people he knew, and talked more about his love of language. He talked about real things as opposed to the esoteric things poets seem to love. It's poetry that is simple enough for most to understand, yet it doesn't hit you over the head with what it's trying to say.Mark Doty is always lyrical, and uses wonderful words, but this collection also has some poems about real life. It is well worth the price and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"Mark Doty's poems are seriously overrated.

This may not be quite up to the stellar Blame it On My Youth, which in my opinion is one of the greatest recordings ever made, but if you are like me and are so stunned by those recordings this is like finding Beethoven's 10th symphony or somethin akin to that.

You cannot get the pressure of a Shubb or other similar capos. Consequently the sound it produces is not as clean. As has been said, this also contributes to other problems. The guitar does not stay in tune while using this capo and bending strings, or during hard strumming. It is also more expensive. I would send it back if it were worth my time. I would not recommend this capo or buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clearly the best!","review":"I've been playing the guitar for 40 years, and have tried my share of gizmos, gadgets and capos. Without question, the G7th capo is best that I've experienced. I let a few friends try it, and they ordered their own G7th capos. I've purchased two more for Christmas gifts. The quality is matched only by the outstanding performance. If you use a capo, you'll really love this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"G7th Performance Capo","review":"I bought this as a gift for my husband.

I've used others before and they mostly feel cheap and flimsy like they'll only last about a year or so. This Capo however is metal, and is very likely to be the last capo I buy because I will never need another. It doesn't use a spring to stay clamped, it just will not loosen until you pull the little black lever on it.

After all, I've tried capos that were less than half that price, and they seemed to work fine. Sure, they throw the guitar out of tune (especially my electric), but that's the price you pay to use a capo. They all throw guitars out of tune, right? Wrong. This one is indeed different from all the rest. Dead easy to use, very stable once locked in, and releases with the flick of a lever when you're done. But the main advantage with this capo is, YOU cotrol the amount of pressure on the strings. So, if you don't need a vice-like death grip on the strings, you don't have to have one. In a nutshell, I highly recommend this capo. Buy once, buy right, and don't look back."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best capo's I've tried","review":"This capo is easy on, easy off and puts even string pressure throughout.

Worked well, but I always had to worry about gouging the neck of the guitar.This capo is simple, doesn't interfere with my hand position and provides a tight pressure on the strings at almost every fret.

It's great that it works for everyone else here, but it doesn't work for me.I have an Ovation Acoustic/Electric guitar and there is no way I can position the capo on the neck so that all of the strings are dampened. The capo is completely worthless to me because of this and it's very frustrating.

This one is easy to maneuver but it doesn't dampen all of the strings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good.","review":"This capo is VERY good. It is easy to take off and simple to put on. It does not stretch my strings or scratch my fretboard at all. The rubber protectors also keep the neck from receiving any damage from use.

Yes, she might be a bit afraid to leave familiarity behind, but it just wasn't handled well in this story. I also didn't like his attitude towards her or the first child they had. So Gray Wolf didn't like the baby because it looked white? Come on, that's what happens when you yourself are half-white and the woman you take is white, too.

Friends loved the design and the sound coming out of such a small unit.Manual instructions could have been a little more informative, as certain things you will have to figure out for yourself by trying them out.

Makes it harder to use the iPod also. Remote light as a feather and feels delicate and a bit cheap. No bass and treble controls. Newer model ipods will not charge in dock. (supposedly latest model fixes this issue though)Now the positives: Outstanding crystal-clear sound with surprising bass and ridiculous volume when cranked.

Not only isn't there an adapter for the dock connector, but the device doesn't fit in the recessed resting area.Second, the integration with my iPod mini is poorly conceived. The device is smart enough to tell when music isn't playing after a while and turn the power off, but:- it doesn't automatically turn on when you turn on your iPod- it doesn't turn off or even pause your iPod when you power it downThese are basic and integral functions that are inexcusable to neglect.

It perpetuates the destructive myth that women REALLY want to be forced, they just don't know it.

She is a GREAT writer, with her other books always pushing the envelope and having elaborate plots with trademark character buildup.What happened here? The heroine gets no development time, leaving us to think for the whole book that she is just a TSL (too stupid to live) gold digger. The whole plot, what there is of it, involves the two MALE characters playing foil off of one another. The heroine is merely background, except that the furniture was described better than she.A vampire romance where neither the hero nor the heroine is the vampire doesn't work. Even if the hero is pretending to be the vampire, or whatever he is doing.The ending is given 4 pages from the being in the middle of the plot, into a resolution that doesn't make sense. Still no idea why the pair got together -- all they did in this book is have rough sex, and almost no conversation.Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting....","review":"I've only recently come across the Jazz Passengers and I'm in love.

It is neither. Perhaps you could rate it a curiosity - if you happened to be a fan such as myself. The idea of the film would seem to offer great opportunities for both Sellers and Starr to shine, but the script and story (what there was of it) fails to deliver on the promises it alludes to. One strange setting after another ends anti-climatically, which in turn quickly leads to a sense of frustration at a great missed opportunity. It really does seem that they \\"wrote\\" it as they went along, if there was anything written at all.

Peter is not the same as many of his other films and that might make for an interesting discussion. My hope was that it would be useful in a classroom situation but I am left searching for a contemporary redeeming value other than remembering how weird things could get, or can get.

New dad and son set out on an endless journey to torment the populace, particularly the high society snobs who travel in Guy's posh circles, culminating in a finale that will leave you both breathless and nauseous.

(2) Since this horrific joke was set up in the middle of London, there was a fairly representative mix of economic classes wallowing in the offal, not just aristos.

My VHS is wearing out....I love the Bath scene!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Light-Hearted","review":"This is a very enjoyable, light-hearted flick. It features a younger, slimmer, and funnier version of Tom Hanks than the one we know from more recent politically correct or repetitious movies. His Socratic reasoning with Shelley Long is just hilarious. Exaggeration is what makes this movie, and every comedy that uses it, funny or funnier. So I do not see why people criticize the film as \\"unrealistic.\\" This is not a documentary. I definitely recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely hilarious","review":"I cannot imagine why the critics have been so hard on this movie. I am a huge fan of Tom Hanks, and seeing this movie started me out that way. There are so many hysterical scenes, especially the one in which he goes to the kitchen and simply turns on the light.

It's just plain funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Hanks old movies are just killer funny....","review":"Very funny, a must see!This movie really does match it's title.

It's one of the best comedies ever done, and contrary to most of new silly ones, this movie will make you laugh on the floor every time you see it. It's classic humor, performed by excellent actors. Tom Hanks was at his best ever, I've never seen this guy so funny before or after this movie, he's a consumate genius. His reactions to the otherwise tragical situation are astonishing and show how well he understood the character. For me, Tom Hanks performance in this movie is a reference of how a part like this should be acted. I hope the producers publish a DVD version. I'm sure there are more unedited material that will be great to include. These actors sure had big laughs during the production, and would be great if this material is available to share it with us. I applaud the actors, directors and producers of this masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a hysterical movie","review":"Even if nothing else in this movie were good, the scene where the bathtub crashes through the floor and Tom Hanks' ensuing reaction of maniacal disbelieving laughter (he honestly must have hurt himself laughing like that) makes the entire movie worthwhile. Even though I haven't seen this movie in awhile, just thinking of that scene makes me laugh. As an added bonus, the rest of the movie is great too. I'd rate the scene with Shelley Long and the raccoon as a good runner-up for funniest scene. There are so many others though... one of my favorites was really an audio-only scene. The frazzled couple had turned the lights off after a somber discussion of marital fidelity and Tom Hanks roars at Shelley Long in the dark, \\"You WHORE!\\" His inflection is perfect and that line just always makes me laugh. Don't miss out on this priceless comedy if you haven't seen it yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Hilarious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This has been one of my favorite movies of all times since i was about [...] old.

Let's remember that this bombed when it came out. There is no story in this movie except a house falling apart, and that is the only gag as well, a lot of ridiculous scenes of parts of the house spontaneously falling apart. As implausible as this is, it's occasionally mildly funny, unlike any of the dialogue, which is just implausible and not funny. Tom Hanks is in his forced acting stage, and very plastic.

However, I was not impressed with the sound quality of the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow. This is supposed to be a comedy?","review":"There was not anything even remotely funny about this movie. Constant disasters costing more money---how is that amusing? I see it as a disaster film. I know if this kind of thing was happening to me I would not be able to see it as humorous; just painful. I left the room in protest the first time I saw this movie, and when I decided to try and watch it again a few years later, I was reminded of why I left. In addition to the disasters befalling the house, the couple does not have a single ounce of chemistry between them, and towards the end it felt more like they were at war.

And with each situation comes a change in the characters involved, it being good or bad depending on what they hold dear.

The story moves at a prety fast pace, which is good, and if you can get by some of the more outrageous parts of the book (the marraige of the main characters, for instance). But unlike \\"We Were The Mulvaneys\\", this one never seems to catch fire. I think it's because the characters aren't really that likeable; I never really cared what would happen to them. And the last third, where the children are grown, has no heart. Overall, while interesting, it certainly wasn't a page-turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, But Not Quite Satisfying","review":"I'll dispense with the summary of the story - the other reviews have covered that in detail already. What works about this novel is how Oates creates frail, unusual characters that we believe in and we care about, and that's enough to carry the story a long way. But ultimately, there are too many main characters and too many individual conflicts for any one to stand out and pull us over the falls to a satisfying or heartbreaking ending. The book peters out in the end rather than rising to a thunderous crescendo."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Falls","review":"This author has a real gift, no doubt. However, her characters are all so flawed and depressing. None of them were people that I would wish to be with or to know! Her description of Niagra Falls and the impact it has had on the inhabitants was mesmorising and well done. It is a \\"heavy\\" book that weighs you down. There was nothing uplifting in this book. Our book club certainly found a lot to discuss, and it did bring back memories of the Love Canal incident."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Me","review":"Ms. Oates is a lovely word crafter...however, the depressing and frantic nature of her characters are just not for me. I did not finish this book because I got to the point that I no longer cared how it ended, and I rarely do that. I wouldn't recommend her books to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literary Romance","review":"It's been years since I've picked up a Joyce Carol Oats novel,and I don't know why, because she is such a fantastic writer. Longing, regret & tragedy are the trade marks of her novels and this is no exception. A young bride the morning after her marriage discovers her husband has thrown himself into Niagra Falls. What follows is an offbeat but sweet love story that becomes a somewhat traditional melodramatic multi-generational story. However Oats transcends the genre with sharp astute writing that cuts to the core of emotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fall from Grace","review":"In \\"The Falls,\\" Oates has produced a shaggy dog story with about 200 pages of excess fur, characters who don't engage and incidents that don't convince, plus some of the slackest, most cliched writing of her career. It really does seem as though she premised the entire novel on a wondrous opening scene and couldn't figure out where to take it from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Falls","review":"I love it. Very interesting. Always waiting for the next situation to take place. Page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning Novel of Love Gone Wrong","review":"I love the writing of Joyce Carol Oates. She is so prolific that it is hard for me to read all the book she publishes. When I do get to read one of her books it is usally a real treat. This book is no exception.This is a stunning novel about love gone wrong, gone \\"too far out of the family\\". It starts and ends at Niagara Falls.Like many of Oates' books, this one deals with loss, destruction, betrayal and finally redemption. It has a gothic flavor mixed with magical realism. The story focuses on an attorney who becomes obsessed with toxic waste in Buffalo, New York and ultimately loses his family and his life. His wife and children become lost or obsessed about his life and/or death. How the living come to terms with the dead is beautifully wrought in this novel.I give it my highest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absorbing read","review":"I am a great fan of Joyce Carol Oates, especially her earlier novels.

Joyce Carol Oates has always been a masterful storyteller, and she has outdone herself with this book. The saga of Ariah, a complex and troubled woman, who loses both her husbands in sudden and strange ways, is completely engrossing. If you like an excellent story, with descriptions that make you feel like you are a character in the book yourself, you must read The Falls."},{"rating":"2","title":"An \\"opera\\" of a novel","review":"I was sorely disappointed last week when the Nobel Prize for Literature, handicapped to fall to a woman, missed Joyce Carol Oates once again. As wayward as her work may often be, I can't think of another novelist who says so much with such skill so frequently. Oates' sheer volume doesn't necessarily make her great. But it is astonishing how consistently terrific she is across the vast landscape of words she has thrown at us. The Falls is one of her grand operatic works: arias that go on too long, scenes heightened to melodramatic unbelievability, characters (including the heroine here) painted in such hot or cold colors that they are hyper-real - and all of that is a collective good thing. I really rolled through (and in) this one. (And the amazing thing about Oates is that she has so many more that I haven't yet read. She could stop writing now, and I'd be set for life, but I hope she keeps turning them out.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the hoopla?","review":"I guess it's just me, but I really didn't like this book. The story was just ok and the prose was so laborious and repetitive that it kind of circled back on itself a few times. It didn't help that the edition I have had so many typo's in it that I wanted to burn the darned thing and send the ashes back to the publishers (Ariah's name was even misspelled in a couple of places). The only reason I finished this book at all is because I stuck with it, hoping it would get better, and by the time I realized it was going to pretty much stink throughout, I was too far in to NOT finish it. If this is a good example of Oates' work, I definitely won't be reading more from her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling","review":"Living in Western New York, I immediately became immersed in the characters and setting of this book. The local culture, color and geographical correctness pulled me in. When I finished reading it, the characters stayed with me for awhile, almost like they really existed. The story is compelling, from the first chapter. As with other books by Joyce Carol Oates, insights are often accurate, introspective and totally unexpected coming from a woman unaware of her accute mental discord. I also purchased the book for my best friend who lives in the Falls. The era, the politics and the cover up of Love Canal are spot on. Woven in an unexpected tapestry. Good Read."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Falls\\" not my Cup of Tea","review":"I hadn't read a J.C.O,'s book in years, and remembered her writing as having a rather strange, Gothic spookiness but I wasn't prepared for this, The dismal offensive characters, atmosphere, and overall trend of the book was depressing, and worst of all, not well-written. When, half-way through, it veered off on an entirely different tack, I gave up and Deleted it with a sigh, and \\"Good Riddence\\" One offensive detail : when the rich play-boy suitor, comes to woo the \\"heroine\\" bringing two bottles of Dom Perignon.; she doesn't own a CORKSCREW, he must dig it open with sharp kitchen utensils (?)

As a preliminary matter, the main character (Ariel) had no redeeming qualities--from her willful ignorance of the surrounding world, to her pathetic and also contrived frailty, she made me wince. The plot itself jumped from topic to topic with absolutely no plot development (ie the sudden woman in black, the sudden Dirk obsession with Ariel at the beginning leading to a sudden marriage). The entire work is counterintuitive and quite awful. Do not waste your time...particularly of you are a woman with an iota of independence--feminism not required for pure disgust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too long","review":"I \\"read\\" this book in audio form, and it was just way too long. Not really exciting, nor gripping. That said, I did finish it, hoping for a astonishing closing.--It didn't happen. It follows a woman and her family from her pre-marriage days, into her early 60's. The main character gets stranger and stranger, yet her children still have unfailing love for her. Which is admirable. But it isn't a novel you finish and say, \\"Wow. That was great\\" and pass along to someone else. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"I gave up listening to the audiobook even before the second husband appeared.

Larry Gwin's book was for me a startling introduction to fighting an often unseen enemy, in a jungle environment horribly alien for the young Americans who found themselves there. Pleasantly avoiding the politics of the war, and instead concentrating on one man's view of the combat, Gwin takes you from his naive first jungle patrols to his combat weary veteran status at the end of his tour. As the casualties mount, and the men around him either die, return wounded or get promoted, Gwin becomes increasingly important to the men around him - a cool experienced head in difficult times.The language is plain and everyman, allowing the reader to move quickly through the book from one engegement to another.A thoroughly enjoyable memoir, and an eye-opener to the horrors of air-cavalry combat in South East Asia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Soothing","review":"Bob Dorough's music is the perfect thing to come home to after a stressful day of work, or a non-stressful day for that matter.

The most interesting part was the movie reviews by the David Koresh character, such as his discourse on \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\".I suppose I should go back to my copies of Hawaii and Centennial.

Such normal, small people with circumscribed lives, even the Hollywood actress. In fact, Updike succeeds in making everyone seem small and ordinary, even Gable and Cooper.

But there's no character development; there's just the author working out an idea with wooden puppets.

The 1938 Hollywood version, is in some ways, better such as its supporting cast & greater expositon of the story. Reginold Owens as Scrooge is fine, but it was a part built for John Barrymore. Who could fill those shoes? Unfortunately he was falling down drunk. He was injured & could not do it.The 1951 version is simply the best because if you don't have the best Scrooge you can't have the best Christmas Carol. It is regrettably short, but stll the best. See them both & compare. They are quite different versions of the same classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The One And Only!!","review":"I'm a purist. It's almost sacrilegious to tamper with Dicken's timeless Christmas story, as the Reginald Owens version of the movie did, and if they had wanted to shoot the 1951 version in color, they would have done so. Of all the versions of \\"A Christmas Carol\\", this is the only one to do the book justice. Alastair Sim is the perfect Scrooge, just as Dickens wrote him. The black/white version shows us, far more than the god-awful washed-out colorization, the dank and dark atmosphere lit only by the good-will of the season. Scrooge's regeneration at the end of the film (\\"Will you forgive a pig-headed old man...\\") would melt a heart of adamant. I watch this movie every Christmas season.

I had no choice but to purchase a copy of the best rendition of Dicken's beloved story. Alistair Sim's portrayal of Ebenezer Scrooge is the prototype against whom all others must be compared to, and they all fall short of the mark. Sim manages to embody the spirit of the character, not merely play the part. The supporting cast is no less inspired, especially Michael Horndern as Marley's Ghost- he conveys the torment of a tortured soul like no other.

NO one tops Alister Simms, this is a timeless classic.

They appear to be embedded in the actual film. Whoever did this should be ashamed of themselves.

It has three discs, the original, cleaned-up film, the colourized version and a copy of a 1935 version of the classic tale. The latter does not have captions nor English subtitles, unfortunately, but the other two do. There are numerous versions of this classic Dickens story, but, none compare with the Alastair Sim version... It is incomparable and will be cherished for all time I believe. Everyone should own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"childhood memories relived","review":"My husband has talked about how he would watch this movie every Christmas Eve on CBS growing up.

I do enjoy Alastair Sim as Scrooge. With a colorized version included it helps to introduce new generations (they seem to be tramatized by black and white) to this English classic. An annual viewing is traditional. A nice addition to the Christmas library. I only hope that the 1938 and 1970 will follow into the DVD arena (soon). Not this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent buy.","review":"I won't have to try to catch this version of Scrooge, when it is showing on Cable. They seldon show this version.

Each one is a good movie in its own way, but with Alastair Sim is the only way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive \\"Christmas Carol\\"","review":"Of all the many versions of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" now available on video, this one is the defining one: it isn't necessarily the most accurate recreation of the Dickens story, but I think it surpasses it in what it is teaching us. Alistair Sim is not a cartoon or caricature but a chillingly realistic Scrooge in his \\"before\\" incarnation, and his transformation is more profound and complete, into his wonderfully warm and touchingly humorous \\"after\\" character. Avoid the colorized version -- the gloomy mood is best captured in black and white."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This is the most heart wrenching and inspirational version of Charles Dicken's tale I have ever seen on the screen. Alistair Sim should have won an Oscar for his portrayal of Scrooge. If you can keep a dry eye when Scrooge revisits his dying sister's bedside--or when he asks his nephew's bride to \\"please forgive an old man...\\" than you might be as cold as old Scrooge was himself! And the scene on Christmas morning is glorious--you will find yourself mimicking the dialogue to your family!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Christmas Carol","review":"This is the second review I am sending.The tape was defective.

Doesn't seem like Christmas if I don't watch it. No longer on tv. Absolute favorite version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie-- B+W and Colorized!","review":"I just received this DVD and am impressed with the quality of this version. The source is from the original British print (\\"Scrooge\\") and for a film 50+ yrs. old is in very nice shape. There are a few speckles and a scratch or two on the original source film, but I am very pleased overall. The opening and closing by Patrick Macnee is nice but dated, he states that this 1951 movie is only 38 yrs old. My biggest complaint is that the DVD option screens are difficult to read as the green lettering is hard to read on the backgrounds. Also the white type used in the CAST/ PRODUCTION NOTES section is tiny and hard to read as well. The Max Fleischer cartoon is OK, but not great- scratches, sound dropoffs. Max Fleischer's Superman cartoons are much better. Overall, I'm very happy with this DVD. It's great to have the option of colorized or B+W with a beautiful copy of this holiday classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Classic","review":"Many \\"Christmas Carol\\" movies and TV productions have been made through the years.This is by far THE BEST and definitive version.

A beautiful and heartwarming Christmas watch for all families."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, oh why?","review":"This great movie, the best version, is ruined by the colorizing. All it really adds is ... colors that are pale and out of place, as with all colorized versions of any movies. The old B&W scenes add a touch of old London in the 19th century to the whole movie watching experience. Either find the B&W version or try to turn off the color on your TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Scrooge of All","review":"Watched both versions (color, black & white) at Christmas. Grandkids liked the color version better but hubby and I enjoy the original B&W. All of us agree Alastair Sim is SCROOGE. His grumpiness, his fright, his seeing of the light, his giddiness, his happiness and delight in the end are all infectious. Nothing gets me into the real \\"spirit of Christmas\\" as Alastair's portrayal of Ebenezer Scrooge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Version of A Christmas Carol","review":"Alastair Sim's performance is hard to beat as his Scrooge is done so well, so despicable in the beginning and so giddily child-like after he learns his lesson. This movie to me is a classic which should be watched every Christmas. The sets superbly capture the atmosphere of the time and the actors all seem to be expertly cast for their roles. Just an enjoyable film which should be in every movie buffs movie library. If you have not seen this version of A Christmas Carol, you are missing something special."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Film by which all others are compared to","review":"This is one if not THE best ever version of A Christmas Carol in my opinion. Alastair Sim does a masterful job of making himself into this role. The casting was excellent. There were many small moments as well that made this movie so memorable. The undertaker at the top of the stairs, Scrooge falling onto his grave stone, and his dying sister crying out that he take care of his nephew (Which he missed). These and other scenes added so much more depth to the story.At the end of the movie, Sim does another incredible job becoming the jovial transformed Scrooge. It will bring tears to your eyes.I never tire of this version......"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Carol 1952,starring Alistair Sims","review":"Viewrs who are passionate about films adhering to the integrity of the original text will be delighted with this dickens classic which is rich in the flavor of the language,culture and spirit of the Victorian England which Sims and the other actors portray."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only one to see!","review":"The best \\"Scrooge\\" ever! Be taken back in time to when Christmas was more personal. Alastair Sim plays the lonley and shrewd \\"Scrooge\\" like none before & none after him.

This is less. We have here, three black and white versions, one on blu-ray, two on dvd including a 16.9 version. I do believe the 16.9 version has been previously released. Looking at the cover, one might have expected there to be at least one colourised version. The quality of the picture on blu-ray is just fair, the 5.1 sound quite awful. This really is of little value if you have a recent dvd version. I purchased this because I have previously lent out my dvd's, never to be seen again. Scrooge would certainly have not purchased it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why does Amazon continue to confuse reviews and ratings?","review":"I fail to understand why Amazon continues to lump together reviews from different DVD releases as if they were all the same. It can be difficult to figure out if a review is referring to the particular DVD or of some prior release. Often the only help is the date of the review. In any event I greatly enjoyed the blu ray release. I did not compare it to an earlier release that I own but I found that the blu ray images were sharp and without a lot of artifact. I noted, as did others, the occasional skipped frame or jump, but I did not find them bothersome. I only listened to the monaural sound track so I cannot comment on any benefit from the 5.1 mix. The monaural track sounded fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"a true classic","review":"This particular version is better than any one out there. You can't improve on the original.

This is a Christian classic. The theme and message Dicken's expresses are the true meaning of the holiday, caring for and loving one another. Sims acting is superb, the dialogue is \\" Dickens \\"and each character is potrayed by people who love theather. These actors are exceptional. Scrooge's maid, shown announcing Marley's death, selling Scrooge's belongings and recieving a gift from Scrooge, shows a range that not many actors are asked to today. When Scrooge realizes that \\"The spirits have done it all in one night\\" and he starts dancing, you can not help but to get happy as well. This movie reminds us that Christmas is not about presents and shopping."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best version of Christmas Carol","review":"I have seen many different versions of this though not all, but this is still my favorite.I usually dont take to old movies but this is the only version I will watch of this beloved classic.The acting is superb.

Even though it is a musical, \\"Scrooge\\" with Albert Finney is far superior or to see George C Scott's performance in \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is awesome and both available on DVD. This version is poorly acted, very dry and horribly dated. I cant see how Sim is regarded as the best Scrooge. Even the scrooge in the 1935 version is more animated.

I would recommend either the George C. Scott version or the Michael Caine and the Muppets version. Either one features a Scrooge portrayal that comes a lot closer to the spirit of the book (not to mention the season!) Alastair Sim is relatively effective in the role, but he just seems like Mr. Potter from \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\": too stupid and lost to be worth redeeming anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"George C.

Why would you want the Blu-ray version? The restoration is the best ever, and the extras add more enjoyment. I first saw this version of Dickens story on television in the early seventies. I fell in love with the performances and was always disappointed in the visual and when it was colorized... Well that was too much. I bought the dvd version when it came out and while it was ok it lacked the sheen that I saw in the film version. With the Blu-ray the sheen is back. As usual in 1080P the film grain is visible. On the big screen you can enjoy a very filmic display.

As with VCI's BR release of GENEVIEVE, all moving objects in A CHRISTMAS CAROL had a jerky movement to them as though the print was missing every second and third frames. Reminded me of a very bad silent stop-motion film. I suspect VCI must be using some new type of coding, but until I'm sure, no more VCI blu-rays until I'm sure thie problem has been corrected. Again, I've only seen this VCI blu-ray problem on Samsung machines. Don't know if they'd play any better on other players. Last year's VCI CHRISTMAS CAROL shows no problem at all.

Sim is incredibly funny, and the cast is incredible. But he seems to be more generous in this version than in any other version. He becomes exhilerated come Christmas morning after the 4 ghosts give Scrooge a visit. They take him through time, and everything fits. I especially like the ghost of Christmas Future. He is the most haunting and scary. He doesn't talk and has no face and show Scrooge of his death soon if he doesn't bring his act together. After waking up from his dream, he evn raises the salary of his maid. Plus, he gives his employee Christmas day off, unlike any other version. Tiny Tim and his family, Scrooge's nephew and niece, and Marley also all add a great touch in this film highly thought of by me.

The plot is packed with tention and although you know that the story will end on a good note, Rice keeps you occupied until the last word.Least favorite? Wild for You. The plot device is weak and unrealistic. That doesn't take away from the hot sex.Would I buy this book? Yes. Would I keep this book? Maybe."},{"rating":"2","title":"First class CD crosses the line between Prog and mainstream.","review":"This is a hard sound to describe; it is a very full sound with 3 guitars and a bass creating unusual textures and moods. The drumming is very good too. The vocals are good ranging from a kind of dark and anxious solo voice to a full bodied , multi-tracked anthem like sound. 'Closest comparison I can think of is Pink Floyd, though some of the songs sound nothing like this. Favorite tunes include track 3, which is a hard proggy rocking tune, track 6 (Music for a Nurse) which is a powerul, emotional piece that I think draws from both Floyd and Eno, track 9 (You Can't keep a Bad Man Down) which has a full \\"wall of sound\\" Floyd-like quality, and the last track - a very strong anthem like piece. Of the 10 tunes, I give 4 an 'A', 4 a 'B' and 2 a 'C', those being the more radio friendly tunes, but still interesting enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"oceansize","review":"Looking for more prog rock.

Last night I noticed something peeling off of the silver hood ornament and cut myself twice trying to remove it.The boy and girl versions of the toys appear to be identical except for the color of the body, and the silver-colored parts seem to be exactly the same.The paint-like silver metal paint or laquer on the Schylling girl's pink speedster ornament peels and is a sharp, metallic substance.

The author's tactics also resemble those of car salesmen themselves. For example, he recommends a certain company that sells extended warranties and goes into great detail over its product. I did a quick search of this company on the internet and found it had gone into bankruptcy and did not have the most reputable business practices. Yes, perhaps the author just made an error in judgment. Are you sure, however, that you want to follow someone's advice when it comes to spending this much money? I would think your money better spent just scanning over a few books at a local bookstore or picking a better book online."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"love this product, it works!

From start to finish this albulm is superb, each song outdoing the next. My only criticism is that when covering Mr. Paginini she copies Ella's version scat for scat. You can't copy scat(you can but you shouldn't)it should be individual and spontaneous.

If you have the right group of people, this game is an absolute riot. If your family or friends like to talk or if you have a loud family like mine, this game is perfect. The funniest part is the silly things that you can make someone do while arguing. Like debating the topic in between making silly faces, having to sing or rap your argument or having to argue your point while laying on the floor. It is also great when someone is forced to argue against what they really think. It can get competitive because voting is involved, and the debate over the who won the debate is part of the fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complicated","review":"This game was more complicated than i expected.

(Falls apart)","review":"One of the lenses fell out of the frame as soon as I carefully took it out of the package. On top of that, after a half of a day's gentle use, one side snaped at the henge and became very flemsy while normally opening the glasses for about the third time. The next day that side actually fell off while trying to open them up again. The only thing nice about these is that the lens was completely mirrored and you can't really see through them from the front like others. Other than this, these glasses are a horrible buy, and you get what you pay for. I just bought a pair that is way more sturdy and durable enough so you can open them up without them falling into pieces. I got them at a stand in my local mall for a price of 2 for $25, I suggest you do the same and I absolutely do not recommend these."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen better sunglasses at bad gas stations","review":"For $5.99, I wasn't expecting a lot.

What's more, the promised \\"case\\" (which would have been nothing but a pouch made of cheap fabric) was missing from the package. Very disappointing, because after taking one look at this lemon, I knew that the pouch would be the only thing of value in this order.

Well, both handsets work now - - terribly. The echo is unbearable. It's near impossible to hear the person on the other end. All 4 ring types are just annoying.

Grunberger explores all facets of the regime, giving the reader a unique insight into how the Nazi machine permeated all levels of German society. I may be slightly biased in my review, as Richard Grunberger taught me history at school in the 70's.

The art, while all new, is merely rehashing of the same poses, backgrounds, colors, faces, etc... just switched around to appear, on the surface, as something new. My advice is buy one of his earlier artbooks for about the same price and get some quality artwork. Julie Bell, who has always been hit and miss with me for the same reason this Calendar is.

I live in a high-humidity, steaming asphalt climate type of city and the flip flop is the unofficial foot ware so I have had many pairs of flops that have bitten the dust very fast during the course of just one summer. I was skeptical at first about Havaianas but my first pair are still going strong, almost a year later - they have not yet lost their wonderful colors or the cute designs despite the constant wear and tear of every day life.

The prose was overwrought, turgid, and inconsistent with English usage, on every page. The back cover claims that the author was born in the United States; but the author's countless mistakes in English idioms and phrasing suggests that English is only the second language of the author--and a poor second, at that.

There is a charachter that reminds me of my uncle who I got teary eyed when he died. But it's action packed and reads in 3rd and first person in different parts.

I remember that TurboTax at least knows how to generate an amendment (though it cannot be filed electronically). Another thing I didn't like about TaxCut is that it imported some fields incorrectly. It created duplicates of some of my itemized deductions, and it incorrectly imported my children has non-dependents, even though they were clearly marked as dependents on last year's form.Looks like I have to switch back.

Textboxes overlap labels, text is not formatted to fit on the form, controls are not aligned, and on and on. It appears this was a high school project for introduction to programming. While the input forms are laughable, somehow, the results have been correct and the IRS accepted the filing. TurboTax is obviously done by professional programmers but often has technical problems. The amazing thing is that these big companies cannot create a decent tax program after many years of trying.

So, I look and that fact is on their web site! Silly me - I trusted TaxCut. When I present this in a claim to the company they reply that it's not a processing error or an arithmetic error, so my claim is denied. How odd. Even a simple man like me can see that, in fact that's not even the issue! It's a FACTUAL error, an INFORMATIONAL error. DID ANYONE THERE BOTHER TO READ MY CLAIM?

It also offers a $5 rebate for itself unless you opt for the Microsoft 2005 Money option.The signature edition was tempting but means little unless it is backed by a CPA.

So, using Bamford's thesis, perhaps it is possible to believe that Clinton's refusal to do anything about Palestinian terrorism, or about the first WTC bombing, the Khobar Towers attacks in Saudi Arabia, and the twin Embassy attacks in Africa in 1998 which in fact emboldened bin Laden to attack the mainland United States.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I have not only read Bamford, I have seen him interviewed. This man is obviously campaigning for Kerry. He has taken a few grains of truth and used them to grow a crop of B.S. I can't belive he would even think of relating the problem with Palestine to, as he says, and I paraphrase, Bush's failure in the 911 event. Of course, they have had their eye on Iraq for years. Why wouldn't they? We've know for years that Iraq was a threat to all countries around them, and eventually to the world. How petty can a man be when he criticizes General Myer, President Bush, and others for being busy at their jobs, and not knowing the attack was coming? Hindsight is wonderful, when applied to the good, but when filled with hate, it is useless.

Without 911, what would be the reasoning to spark a war that had been meticulously planned? Bamford said he had no evidence to to support that the Bush White House knew about the attack beforehand, but where is the evidence to support (other than from the White House) that al Qaeda had the capacity to train the hijackers on Boeing aircraft, calculate the tactical plan and make billions of dollars worth of insider trades?

His experience changed both him, and his wife. Brady is played by Beau Bridges, with his wife played by Joan Allen. Both are astoundingly good. It's a frank, personal, nonblinking account of Brady and his wife, and the whole of their ordeal. It can be funny, illuminating, and very moving at the same time.

The story of his experiences manages to be both touching and hilarious.

This is definitely the laziest remake in the history of cinema, the same script, the same camera movement and the same dialogues only with a terrible performance from Naomi Watts (as if King Kong wasn't enough). While everything worked very well for the original movie, the European set and dialogues are completely artificial and stupid for the American remake.

They act so nice and are all about good manners and behaving well, yet they are very violent, though in a calm way. They intrude on rich people and play their games which seem to end badly for most of the family memebers if not all. The only reason this film won't get full stars by me is because it got real boring when round one of the games ended. The family recovery up until round 2 of the games started again was slow and boring. I fastforward through that part. Naomi watts did a great job besides the two evil boys.

Just weird and what I found to be pointless.

The intruders have one golf club, the family has access to two bags full! The cellphone doesn't work but the father's was in the car. No attempt was made to retrieve it! The woman escapes only to be recaptured by one of two cars driving at 2:00 a.m. Who did she think would be driving at this time?

I did not like the opening credits, there was not a stitch of character development (although that was part of the point of the movie), and I wish it had fewer stars so I had avoided buying it.

I used to love the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Hostel type flicks, but I don't so much enjoy the torture types that are all too possible. As long as there is a layer of fictionalized separation, I can enjoy. In this case, the movie provides an all too possible eventuality of a normal family being tormented by a pair of social deviants.

Or darkly amusing.It was a filmmaker dangling an entertaining moment in front of you, then pulling it away and smacking you in the face. I can just see all the smirking film snobs politely applauding that the audience had a terrible time. Hoo. Ray.I love Naomi Watts but I have to wonder why she'd use her talent in such a film like this.

Hoods kill family after husband puts up predictably feeble resistance.There is absolutely no moral ambiguity to make this interesting, and watching this family die is completely pointless. Is this film meant to show there is pure evil in the world? No kidding. Watch the news.Don't let people fool you saying Funny Games is some huge statement.

The only more disgusting movie that comes to mind was a biker film I saw 35 years ago in Tijuana. Frankly, I've seen better plot development in a porn film, and at least they don't make any pretense about their work actually being art. Whoever wrote this garbage needs years of counseling. I can't believe it's priced at $19.95. I'd gladly pay ten times that to have it erased from history. To sum it up, the only positive thing about this cinematic flatulence was that I saw it for free.

Having to sit through non-stop torture and abuse of victims by two men without any purpose other than to show amoral behavior was a waste of time and talent for actors Naomi Watts and Tim Roth in the film.

And it works.The original and re-make were both filmed by the same director (Michael Haneke); I don't really see how he could have done a better job. The acting is superb, and the entire movie is disturbingly intricate. This is hands down the stuff of nightmares.

Another disappointing and distracting plot device was the asides by Myakes -- to have a character supposedly \\"discuss\\" Justinian's autobiography wouldn't be bad if the other character to whom he's supposedly speaking is actually represented in writing. It's a device that simply doesn't play well -- this is a novel, not a play where characters are allowed to have asides to move the plot along. Perhaps the author didn't feel up to writing about the character of Brother Elpidios -- which is probably a shame since none of the other characters were even remotely likeable.Overall, this book was disappointing.

They do like and want to take it everywhere, but the tires have little to no traction, so unless the dirt is extremely hard packed with no bumps or you are on pavement, good luck using the pedals.

I have become so engrossed in the Lytton family and publishing company, I feel as if I know these people. Also, this book covers periods of history of which I was not too familiar, i.e. World War I. The horror of this war was written about in such detail, and the lives of the people in London during the war was also described in detail and the returning soldiers was heartbreaking. I am so caught up in this family and their friends and associates,that I couldn't put this book down and read through approximately six hundred pages in a short time and now I am started on the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Felt gipped at the end","review":"Like other reviewers here, I found Vincenzi's family saga unputdownable--but only for a while. I grew restive in the last third of the book as I sensed increasingly Vincenzi manipulating the ending so that the saga could continue. Some of the action was predictable (of course Lady C didn't run away w/ Sebastian), and some of it, downright implausible. Indeed, I just couldn't buy it that Oliver would be found out as having conducted a transatlantic affair w/ someone else's wife, which would somehow make Lady C feel better. Puh-leeze! I wanted to like it, I really did. But by the end I could see why No Angel was on the Strand's $1 rack."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Angel","review":"Enjoy the book. It is a continuing family saga which I found to be a bit of history, romance, deception and enjoyable reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical fiction at its best","review":"Penny Vincenzi's \\"No Angel\\" drops you into the early 1900s and makes you sympathize with the characters to such an extent that you feel you are there with them. This is historical fiction at its best -- when the reader can live alongside characters of the times. It makes the history come alive.But \\"No Angel\\" is more than just a history lesson. It's a great tale, well-told. It reminded me of both The Forsyte Saga and Elizabeth Jane Howard's wonderful series about the Cazelet family before, during, and after World War II.My only complaint is not with the author or the story, but with the proofreader. My copy of the book seems to have numerous typos in it. However, it is a measure of how engrossing this story is that I brushed past those.I highly recommend this book to readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family saga at its best","review":"I have long been a fan of this author. Her first (and as far as I know only) triology is simply a very good read. The book transports you into the world of the characters - they seem real and you become genuinely interested in their fate. I have just started Book 2 of the triology and so far it is as good as the first part. There are many twists and turns and just when you think you have something all worked out - you are in for the next surprise. If you enjoy family sagas spanning generations with historical background thrown in - this is for you! (P.S. I bought this for my Kindle - although it states paperback at the top. The whole triology is available on Kindle.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"small!","review":"The size was not as advertised, much smaller.

I have been a law enforcement agent for twenty years and this is one of the cornerstones in my personal library of law books.The seventh edition contains approximately 900 pages, but is a very interesting read.

Much of this is very stereotyped.Didn't this type of thinking go out with the last Edsel to be produced? NO, I am not glorifying alternative lifestyles, but the O'Haras seem to be wanting more attention paid to them by law enforcement than is realistic.If we followed the anti-gay fervor of this book, then we would be dedicating more police hours to the \\"homosexual problem\\" than is economically feasible.If the O'Haras had fixated upon stereotypes of Roman Catholics or African-Americans instead of gays, this book would disappear off the shelves forever.Such material does not belong in a good police investigations manual today. Child sex abuse, crack dealing, murder, and arson belong there, but too much time is spent on social problems and lifestyles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute pup!","review":"Shipping was a little slower than we had hoped it would be- took 7 days, but the product is so cute!

You need to have dry walls. The old walls are too hard for the hooks to penetrate. We have one room in the house where the walls are new and can be used. Too bad. I was looking forward to the ease of them. My cousins' son said don't buy anything else and he intends to throw out any of the old hangers that he has.

Less damage than traditional hanging methods, especially for somebody like me who isn't as skilled in the area as I should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I've never used the hercules hooks but I imagine these are pretty much the same thing. Don't let it fool you though, the hole is still pretty substantal, about the same as a small nail or screw, but I think these are more secure and less likely to tear up your wall. Make sure you know exactly where you are hanging items before you go stabbing them through the wall though. They have held up some picture frames and a mirror just fine. They are also holding up some movie posters I have. Be careful and make sure they are twisted around 100% and tightly hugging the wall on the inside...one of the hooks holding my movie posters swung back around and dropped the frame, so just a heads up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Imitation","review":"Cheap imitation of the brand ones.

I was very skeptical about this product but I am happy to say that it actually worked as described. You just press the hook into the wall, twist it until in goes in and rotate it up until all you see is the hook. As described in the instructions, it will only work on wood and drywall. These will not work on stone or plaster walls. The heaviest thing I have hung on these hooks is a 20 something pound 5 foot tall mirror, and it has held up for a good week so far, even with my dogs running into a few times (since it's right by my front door). This is an excellent and simple product and works exactly as described, will purchase again.Edit: After using these to hang pictures and a heavy mirror for a few months now I can verify that they still hold strong, but they are definetely not made for wood, just drywall...just wanted to clarify that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good...","review":"I tried using these, but they stick out from the wall.

For pictures and other decorative items they worked great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works out pretty good","review":"I'm quite satisfied with how the hooks worked. It's much easier to put into the wall than using hammer, drill and nails.The only regret is if you didnt do your measurement and alignment right, there'd be holes left, even though the holes are pretty small they definitely damage the painted surface. Try to get them covered by your hanging objects and forget about them at least for a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"hooks were awful!","review":"The hooks were awful!

(Isn't that a coincidence! ) Anyway, I would highly recommend this book. \\"Thinking positive\\" and seeing in your mind who you want to be is very powerful. I had never heard this before. I was such a negative person. Thanks for letting me state me feelings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Misleading","review":"THIS BOOK IS CHRISTIAN LITERATURE. Don't get me wrong, I am not against religious literature or writings, however they should not be marketed as \\"self help\\" books. In the bookstore I was just cruisin around looking at titles and I had heard this book was good but did not know specifics behind its message. Nowhere on the book jacket were any Christian ideas mentioned (I read it twice), but upon opening it and reading the intro and first chapter, THAT WAS THE ENTIRE MESSAGE. The message is beautiful and strong, but what if my beliefs are anything other than Christian? This should be mentioned on the jacket and the book should be categorized as RELIGIOUS LITERATURE, not self help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother if you're atheist..","review":"Waste of money, book is full of references to the Bible and God. I could go on and on about how pointless the story telling is in this book.. but I won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Christian book","review":"The most important thing to know about this book, is that it is very Christian based. The author is a Preacher, so a question of how to \\"Believe in Yourself\\" is answered with \\"I can do all things through Christ which strengthen me\\"; and \\"How to have a Peaceful Mind\\" is answered with \\"Read the Bible\\".If you're a Christian, or open to Christianity, this book will strengthen your faith; otherwise, this book will leave you flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Aspect of Thinking Skills","review":"As a book on positive thinking, this is *the* book to read.However, you don't become successful by positive thinkingalone. You need negative thinking sometimes. When buyinga stock, you need to look at the risks. You sometimes needcreative thinking in your work. You need to think abouthow others will think, feel, and perceive your service orproduct.Therefore, as a thinking skill book, it only covers one aspect.I think the title is appropriate.I don't consider this a Christian book but a thinking skills book.Note: I'm referring to the original version. This is the miniatureversion according to other reviews. Amazon got themmixed up."},{"rating":"1","title":"not useful","review":"I read this book 30 years ago, when I was a troubled youth.Somehow, it does not translate well to my current life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very christian pep book.

I suppose that this is a good book if this is what you're looking for, but useless if you're not looking a christian message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book EVER","review":"This is by far the worst book I have ever read. Do not buy this book. Save yourself the 1.65 and the time. In this book Peale uses faulty induction and touts that his method of positive thinking is \\"scientifically proven\\". This guy should go back to grade school and study the principles of induction and re-read the definition of science. Science is based on empirical data, in other words things that can be quantified, observed, or measured. Additionally I highly doubt that God, being the 'all-knowing' god he is, would care how \\"big\\", as Peale puts it, your prayers are. The bottom line is Norman Vincent Peale is off his rocker and the only reason he sold 2 million copies, if you can believe him on that, is because of those moronic religious saps that fill up the 'red states'. Those people will buy anything if they think it will get them into heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor book","review":"poor book, nothing really worth to listen to.

Don't buy this book, it totally doesn't work. Nothing changes, nothing gets better using this stuff. Not a thing. You start to think, hey maybe this stuff will work, but guess what? IT DOES NOT. It's a waste of time like everything else I've ever tried to improve myself, just a trip down the dark tunnel of parasuicidal depression, it always is, it never gets better. Even this book doesn't help. Never could and never would. Might as well read Kurt Cobain's diary for natural mood enhancement. Why bother? I sure won't anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read","review":"This is the first time I have felt the need to write a review. This book is beyond words. I love books, I am an avid reader. If you are looking for a spiritual uplift then, you must get this book. I am already trying to find it for family and friends. What is written in this book is impossible to put into words. But just know that once you pick up this book, you won't want to put it down. Especially if you are spiritual and are looking to change certain aspects about yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power of Positive Thinking- Audio Version","review":"I have read the printed version of this book many years ago. I was aware of it's content. The media I received was of good quality and was packed well when shipped to me. The audio on this CD was very good too. I was however a little disappointed with how abridged this audio version was, compared to the original work. Also it appears that the publisher made a copy of a audio version originally distributed on cassette. What content there is on the CD is of good quality but a lot of the material is missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Change your thoughts, change your life!","review":"This book is one of the best (if not the best) books I've read on self-improvement. No fancy jargon. No gimmicks. Easy to read without being dry and boring (like some self-improvement books out there). Also, the author is a christian, so it's from a christian perspective.Just recently read it again...read it for the first time about 15 years ago, (when I was 16) and I'm convinced I would be a different person had I never done so. It changed the way I think for the better. So much of it makes so much sense. After all, we are the results of what we think, and if we can decide our thoughts every minute of every day, why not make them great thoughts??!!I love Abraham Lincoln's quote (which Peale references in the book) which sums it up nicely:\\"Most people are about as happy as they make their minds up to be.\\"Everyone should read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed My Life","review":"This book has definitely changed my life. I recommend it to anyone who is at a low especially. It has given me a new outlook on life and helped me become a positive person. I was very jumpy, nervous, even depressed before, this book really helped me to take my time and calm down. I now know that I can handle things much better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't think positive unless you read the Bible??","review":"This book is definitely only for Christians.I am a spiritual person and have a lot of appreciation for the teachings in the Bible, but Peale repeatedly insists that self-confidence cannot be acheived without faith in the Bible and practicing Christianity. Peale didn't consider that folks of different faiths might also benefit from his positive thinking techniques.Too bad, I was looking forward to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"An oldie but a goodie. Everything in this book was so uplifting. Wonderful daily reminders. Lots of suggestions to improve your life. I love that scriptures are quoted. Who knew the Bible book of Job first spoke of the law of attraction! Interesting stories of healing and the mind/body connection. Must have been quite controversial back when it was first published.Don't be put off by those who say it's religious. I am not religious at all but rather I say I'm spiritual. I will reference this book often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"This is not a self-help book how to influence your approach/thinking to improve results/lifestyle etc. It is a heavily relilgious book which tries to convince you that the only way to get there is through chirstian faith. So if you are not a very religious person, an atheist, pantheist, or of other believes - well, thats it. Nowhere in the description of the book this is mentioned, not in the title or the cover text. Truly false advertising, in my opinion. I send it right back to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A read for the \\"Believer\\", otherwise give it a miss","review":"I have read a number of self-help books and this is the only one I have really had a strong, NEGATIVE reaction to.The only message this book conveys is that FAITH (and more specifically faith in God) is the key to success and happiness. For those that are religious this book might be a positive affirmation for your beliefs and therefore provide you with a motivational \\"push\\".However, For those who seek something that provides some strategies or ideas on how to make a behavioural change that will positively contribute to the results you seek then I would look else where. Actually, I would recommend you do not purchase this book. You may end up like me, getting really angry with what the author is saying, that you end up throwing the book (and hence some of your hard earned) away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gospel on tape","review":"While he has some good points and positive thinking can be very powerful, some go overboard with it. I was looking for something more along the lines of building self-esteem to help encourage me to pursue my dreams and this is more of a Sunday morning gospel. Not what I had in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"description of book is misleading","review":"I read the front and back cover of this book. The back cover gives a reasonably long description of what the book is about, but it does not mention religion anywhere. I was after a motivational book on positive thinking but instead I got a christian sermon. The description of this book is misleading. This is a book for christians looking for motivational inspiration thru prayer and the bible, for anyone else it is useless.I returned this book to my local bookstore and exchanged it for another."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was ok","review":"Someone gave me this book as a gift and looking at the cover, I thought that it would actually be a great book since several million copies were sold. But I read it and it didnt seem to help me as I thought it would. I am not a religious person and this book was filled with Christian stuff. Every other sentence has a reference to god or praying or whatever. And the anecdotes were interesting in the beginning but there were too many of them. Towards the end, I was bored out of my mind. Mr. Peale repeats the same things over and over and over... I think this book didnt help me because I am not a Christian. According to Norman, I probably wouldnt be able to have a positive view of life if I don't pray, read the Bible, and think about god all the time. But I guess it would work or at least be a fairly pleasant read if you are Christian. So, buy this book if youre Christian, and don't buy it if you're not."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S NOT WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK...","review":"It's a religious book. And an extremely boring one. The only real advice is that one should pray...After sometime you pray to finish the book soon..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointed by religious overtones","review":"I read half of the book and could not go on any longer. It was splashed with references to \\"God\\" and \\"Believing in Christ\\" and I could not turn a page without seeing at least 2 references to religion, namely Christianity. I happen to be an atheist, and the religious overtones of this book highly offended me simply because I bought the book having no idea that it was supposed to be this religious. Nowhere on the back covers or the introduction was religion mentioned at all. I believe the methods that the publishers used to market this book was highly misleading. Therefore accounts for the single star I believe this book deserves. And for you, Norman Peale, if you want to indulge in your religious rendezvous in the future, I suggest you not mislead or lie to the readers in your introductions to the book and place the book under \\"Religion.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Reignited My Faith","review":"For a long time I have stayed far away from anything religious. In fact when I bought this I had no idea that it contained a religious message. All I knew was this book is considered one of the all time great personal growth books, for good reason. This book has given practical application to the teachings from what I would only now agree is the greatest book of all time.Frankly the way religion has been presented to me my entire life has lead me to despise religion completely. Norman presents the practical application of scripture in such a that those who, like me, are quick to tune out anything religious will find strangely engaging. Norman explains his message humbly and sincere desire to aide the reader. Whether you view the bible as fact or fiction you will certainly gain some of the most powerful affirmations the bible contains and you will understand how they apply to real life challenges."},{"rating":"2","title":"If things are'nt going right in your life this is the book!","review":"The first line in the book is believe in yourself! That sums it all up for me. It really struck a cord with me. Most of the book puts God back in the driver seat in your life...along with belief, faith and trust. I always say I believe in God... but this book reminded me if I really had just the faith of a mustard seed, great things could happen in my life...and I forgot this truth. I think anyone in great self doubt or feeling really insecure should read this book. He puts it all back in perspective! So glad I bought it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of Positive Thinking by Norman Vincent Peale","review":"The Power of Positive Thinking is just about that, unlocking the power that arises from thinking and acting positively all the time. I come from a continent (Africa) with its fair share of challenges, and the resulting feeling of powerlessness, dejection and hopelessness by millions of people. Many cite various daily perennial challenges like bad corporate and national governance and cannot see the way out. However, Norman Vincent Peale shows that through conscious positive thinking, actions and prayers, each of us can make a big difference. Positive thoughts and actions are contagious and they have to start from you and me. From there, it is amazing the positive difference this can make to those around us and beyond. This book is highly recommended so that we can all change our lives for the better and win success through positive thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for Christians - not good for me","review":"This purchase reminded me that I should always read more about the product before ordering it. I will read customer's reviews more thoroughly from now on.I think that this is probably a very helpful book for Christians who wants to make something more of their faith, or people who would like to become a Christian. 'The Power of Positive Thinking' is very well written, and many of the problems it speaks about is pinned down in a precise and nice way.Some times, the author gives interesting advice and interesting new perpectives. But the most given advice is \\"pray more and pray hard\\", and have faith in Christ.For me, who was looking for techniques in positive thinking, and who is totally un-interested in religion, this book is not helpful. So I will look for another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"More about religious thinking and less about positive thinking...","review":"I started reading this book with great hope of getting some push on positive thinking. But, even after reading 70 pages I could not find anything that is closely related to positive thinking. The writer, through out the book, was telling that reading the bible is solution for all problems.I myself is very religious and I have nothing against the content of the book, but the title is not apt. I would have given atleast four stars if it would have been titiled \\"power of bible\\".Once again, this book is just promoting religion/bible and it is not any thing about positive thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"text to speech NOT enabled","review":"I am so disappointed in my recent purchase of The Power of Positive Thinking by Norman Vincent Peale. While I clean house, I listen to my Kindle read books to me. The reason I bought the Kindle version of this book is for this purpose, since I already own it in hard copy. Imagine my disappointment to discover the text to speech had been disabled on this book by the author/publisher.I would really appreciate it if they would reconsider turning on this function. Thank you for a chance to express my disappointment. I will know to look for this in the book details BEFORE I make my next purchase.This is the big letdown I have with my new Kindle Fire. It doesn't have the text to speech feature either. A real disadvantage. If I'd realized this, I would have looked for a reader that had this feature.

This book help you to believe in God and life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews I read. It wasn't what I expected. I felt that the content was something that anyone with common sense would already know. One could also get the same results from going to Church with regard to the advice regarding praising the Lord everyday. The voice of Norman Vincent Peale was also very annoying. It may have been more bearable had they used a professionals voice. His voice was scratchy and crackly. Last of all... It was very short. Not enough content for the price. I'm tossing this CD as Its of no use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bible Basher","review":"I really wish I had properly read the reviews, especially the negative ones, as I did not spot that this was a Christian based book. I am not anti-christian, I just want to be able to think positively, as the title might suggest it can bring. But this book will only help you if you have an open mind to that religion. Otherwise you will not gain much from it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY motivating FANTASTIC book!","review":"This book will change your life! You will never go through any situation the same way again! Your thinking will change, your actions will change and all for the better! This book contains the solution to every problem there is and ever will be. If you are seeking to build your faith to overcome obstacles in your life this book will do it. This book reminds me of the fact that anything is possible with God! I almost didn't buy this book because of some comments I'd read on certain Christian websites about the author. But I had the condensed version at home and loved it, so after reading all 45 reviews on this book with 99.9% of them being in favor of the book I went ahead and bought it and I'm VERY glad I did! I am over halfway through with this book and I count it 2nd in importance only to the Bible!

Phooey!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinking Power -- Positive and Negative, old and new","review":"I like this book, even though it is a bit heavy on the religion aspect for me (not that I mind some, just a bit much). So anyway, I decided to check out the new book with the word play on Norman Vincent Peale's classic title, which is by psychologist J. Norem and titled \\"The Positive Power of Negative Thinking.\\" It was good, too -- kinda adds a balance and new info to this wonderful classic, so I'd have to agree with the previous advice to try them both as a pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this if you are not religious!","review":"(sigh) I have heard so much good stuff about this book that I literally could not wait till I received it. However nowhere do the ads (that I recognized) do they let you in on the insipid religious bigotry that permeates the book. If you don't believe in god - then forget it! According to the author you've got no hope. In his mind success and religious spirituality cannot be separated and although there are probably some meritorious elements of the book, they are bastardized by the cheap religious recruitment drive endlessly spewing from the pages. As an atheist I couldn't get through half the book without retching. Consequently it went spinning out of my window and hopefully into a bin.If you are not a fundamentalist Christian who believes in prayer - or you are not easily brainwashed then don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC!","review":"This book is the one book I refer to over and over again whenever I need a boost in my thinking and outlook.It is one of the best books ever written and it deserves all the great reviews it has gotten.I would recommend it to anyone in a slump and to today's youth which so desperately needs this material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond my expectations","review":"These days I had the great chance to read this meaningful book. No matter if we believe in God it is a practical guide on how to improve our lives. Christianity has nothing to do with theories; On the opposite is a path to happiness and balance. I am so thrilled with this book, I recommend it for everyone. Try to read it and I am sure you will notice the difference in yourself, from the very first pages. We CAN be happy, why don;t we try it?Regards from Greece!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm positive thinking I didn't like the audio tape ....","review":"It has been some time since I had read this 'famous' book and found that it helped me at a time when I had a loss in the family. The book helped so much that even after some 20 years I can recall some of Dr Peale's suggestions and thoughts quite vividly.I bought this tape to really give it to a friend who is quite depressed, and, not being sure that he would read the book decided to get it in tape. Unfortunately this is certainly not anywhere close to the content of the book. The tape has none of the rich anecdotes and wonderfull stories that the author used to put his point across in the book.Not only is this tape abridged, but is simply and nothing more than a summary of the book.... and, it's depressed me even more than my friend that I was trying to help ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian Enlightenment","review":"As a Christian, this book was incredibly inspiring. I recently finished it and lately, when I come across a problem at work or school I remember various methods of thinking in order to solve the problem. If there is no solution to the problem, I use a couple of methods to \\"view\\" the problem. Dr. Peale uses countless examples and stories of experiences of people that have changed or developed by faith in God and the following of Christ.Throughout the book, he emphasizes the concepts of faith, peace, serenity, love, patience, perception, and prayer power in order to deal with life's headaches and hard-times. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Little too much preaching...","review":"Picked this up recently based off the description and the 202 reviews averaging four stars.

C'mon","review":"I'd like a copy of this book, but I can think of no reason the Kindle version is $3.49 more than paperback ... can you? ... anyone?No human being must intervene when I buy it for Kindle, no printer was ever used, no paper. The only additional resource used when buying for Kindle is electrons.Of course, the author and publisher should make a profit, but, in the process, you'd think they'd use good sense in pricing their various versions. On Amazon, they'd make $4.20 at the current Kindle price of 11.99. If they dropped the price to match the paperback price, they'd make $5.95.Now which makes more sense ... keep the no-added-work-needed Kindle price high and make $4.20 ... or drop the price to match paperbacks (still with no work added) and make $1.75 MORE?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A disappointment despite all the good reviews.

Of course, I'd heard of the title...but I didn't know much about it. This book was definitely not what I was expecting. The best way that I can describe this book would be to say that it's one part Napoleon Hill's \`Think and Grow Rich', one part Dale Carnegie's \`How to Stop Worrying and Start Living', one part Andy Andrews' \`Traveler's Gift' and three parts Holy Bible. Peale packs a ton of great advice on how to improve your health, be more successful, help others and how to \`think' more positively. However, it's not the typical \`secular' advice that you receive from most self-help texts. Given my limited lifetime exposure to organized religion, I found it difficult to apply much of the information in this book. However, that should not discourage anyone from reading it. A great book for self-improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for every person young and old and all in between","review":"This book is must have for all adults.

I am not disappointed in my selection of this book but it is certainly not a quick read or a page turner.

I was expecting a discussion of Palestine in the Time of Jesus: Social Structures and Social Conflicts and not another detail (word-by-word) dissection of the bible which clearly sees the current King James Version of the bible as the true word of god.Perhaps it's that I just finished, \\"Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why,\\" By: Bart D. Ehrman, which is a terrific introduction to the concept of the bible being crafted and changed by humans.I was just not prepared for a book which suggests that readers of the bible, \\"Identify the biblical passages relevant to the topic, using a concordance: words and phrases; metaphors; conceptualities.\\" (pg 164)I was expecting a discussion of a day in the life of Palestine in the time of Jesus - A history class and not another religion class.If you are already a true believer, then this book is for you.

The best word to describe it is \\"innocuous\\". These retelling of fairy tales are watered down so that they won't scare the young ones too much.

It is great, because you know how wax can sometimes leave white film on old bug spots or scratches, well when you have the color it doesn't do that. My car is six years old and a beautiful dark sparkling red. I wish I could have a darker red color wax, but it is better that white wax. It is really great for red and black cars (black color of course on black). I highly recommend it if you don't have the money to have you car buffed or repainted.

The colored wax stains your hands, rags used to buff and it shows up for weeks down the road in every little crevice you missed removing it from, since it is a glowing pinkish red. I tossed it in the garbage right after finishing waxing the car the first time. I was wondering why you don't see this product made by a well known company like Turtle Wax anymore.It was actually a good idea if the auto manufacturers made it themselves to match each specific paint color. But just one red color to cover all the reds out there won't work. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Color Magic, where did it go??","review":"I have found that this product, though it does cover small scratches, and does help make the paintlook better, once done polishing with this product, you MUST apply at least three to four coats of a gooodwax, for it to stay on your car, truck ect.

Also matches two very different shades of red flawlessly. I love this stuff so much I bought two of them when I heard they were discontinued.

It consists of a long (57 pages) introduction followed by a great many quotes (rendered into English) from ancient Greek authors.

When it was lousy he didn't embarass himself. \\"Bank Shot\\" falls into the latter category. As a comedy it's almost completely bereft of laughs. The caper itself is uninvolving. Gower Champion's direction is strictly sitcom pedestrian. The film is also saddled with one of the worst supporting casts imaginable. Too mediocre to truly hate but avoid by all means. Based on the work of renowned crime writer Donald Westlake who should have sued at the very least to get his name taken off the credits.

Much of the hughlights in the tracks come from the superb mellotron backing which indeed sounds so good. \\"Silver peacock\\" is yet another great long track with its lyrical themes and melodious playing.

In the fast mode and with manual ranging, it does a good job with this and gives a repeatable reading.I don't have anything to calibrate it with, so I can't comment on accuracy, but it appears to read about what I expect it to. The owners manual is adequate, but the user interface is not intuitive, so keep the manual with the tool, as you will need it again if you have not used the tool in a few months.

When I returned the first one, the company said it must have been a defective unit, but the replacement one does the same thing.The problem is that the MIN/MAX function does not work properly. Even when recording very steady sine wave acoustic signals well within the device's measurement range, the unit often reports that the MAX signal value encountered during the recording period was too LO to be recorded. And about as often, that the MIN signal level encountered was too HI to be recorded. This obviously makes no sense, and points to a problem with the device's data acquisition or a software bug.If you just want to look at the numbers flickering by and make a guess about maximum, minimum, and average values over a time period, this might work for you, but for any serious quantitative engineering or scientific work, forget it.

Just to clue everyone in, Halo is the story of the Master Chief, a cybernetically enhanced soldier who is humanity's best chance against a collective of alien races, known as the Covenant, who are bent on destroying the human race. The first book, part one of a trilogy, tells how the Chief, as a young boy, along with other children, were abducted from their parents and trained from the age of six to be the greatest soldiers in history. Eventually, the Covenant attack Earth's various planet colonies, and the soldiers, codenamed \\"Spartans,\\" are the only thing that can save humanity. This is an enthralling read, especially for fans of the game, but even those who haven't played the game will surely be pleased with this tale of hardships, sacrifice, loss, and war."},{"rating":"2","title":"First HALO: FIRST STRIKE, now this masterpiece","review":"Even though I'm a bit too old to be a \\"gamer\\", I can certainly see why people would want to play the videogame version of this. This book, and the one that came immediately before it, are not only great science-fiction/high-tech, like \\"Snow Crash\\", \\"Cryptonomicon\\", or \\"Darkeye: Cyber Hunter\\", but these books are great Space Operas in the true sense of that term. To me, they are almost the sci-fi equivalent of \\"Lord of the Rings\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent. The origin of Master Chief is a compelling story!","review":"If you're any kind of Halo fan, you'll want to read this story. It's a great origin of a character that we've all come to love as part of some of the best games on Xbox!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa a Good Video Game Book?","review":"Yeah... I was like you too. I picked this up with a few other books with very low expectations, but I was very surprised. This book is actually decent. Even without a Video Game to back it up it would still make a good read. I enjoyed learning more about the Master Chief (main character in that Halo Video Game) partly because he identity is always hidden and the Video Game does not go into detail about how the current situation came to be.This Book is the Prequel to the first Halo Video game, I enjoyed it and my only suggestion or flaw i found was that the battle sequences could use more description."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling Story, offering insight to a great game.","review":"I was very impressed with Eric Nylunds book, \\"The Fall of Reach.\\" Going into the first chapter, I had many doubts, due to the fact that it was based on a video game. However, Nylund creates a great story that is moved along with detailed characters and surroundings. I liked how the book switched between John, and Keyes. The reader gets to see great development in their characters as they move through training and battles. One thing the book lacked in its style was the use of foreshadowing, and figurative language. The book is very straightforward, but that makes it easy to understand. Overall I was very impressed with Nylund's work, and i look forward to reading his other Halo novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Epic Struggle","review":"I played the videogame before reading this book, which is basically the same as reading the second book in the series, The Flood, before the first (this one). I always found the story in videogame quite exceptional, yet I didn't even know half the story until I read the truly outstanding Fall of Reach. All of the battles in this book are so brilliant, so powerful, and so grand, it just leaves the reader with utter satisfaction.You really get a sense of a large war and an intense struggle to fight against an enemy of such intelligence and brute force. Humanity really has its back to the wall. Fall of Reach actually just skims the surface of all the great plot twists, yet its character and story development are absolutely top-notch. The best 7 bucks I've ever spent on the internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"The fall of reach review by andy","review":"I normally do not like science fiction but after playing halo and seeing how good the game was i couldn't wait to get my hands on the book.

Also, its version of the battle for Reach makes a lot more sense in context of the other games than Halo: Reach did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, calorie-free fun","review":"Nylunds' prequel to Halo:CE is a gripping account of some fairly loose, shallow military sci-fi. Not the most ground-breaking stuff, but definitely fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"After reading Greg Bear's two \\"Halo\\" books ,I had to sample someone else's effort. Nylund does a nice job of depicting a completely different perspective in the same universe. I was pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Halo: the fall of reach was a great book. If you liked the game halo you would love this book. It goes into detail about the plot of the game. Also this is a great book for anyone who loves action/fantasy/sci fi books. I loved this book and i dont know anyone who didnt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shockingly good!","review":"As anyone who has ever reached for a game novel knows, it's more than likely gonna suck big time. I was literally shocked at the quality of this novel. It seriously is one of the best science fiction/fantasy reads I've ever had, and I've had alot! It's astonishing how little Nylund had to work with and developed such a rich world, with great background constructs, and exciting action. It's as if Nylund is reaching for some tracendency in a Halo book with each page of the novel. I'm serious! The battles are so expertly crafted, that you can culminate the visual in your mind of the Chief jumping through space to another craft, or the astoundingly well written section on Keyes maneuvering against two superior covenant vessels and coming out victorious. This all in a Halo novel! Bravo good sir. They should never let anyone else write another Halo novel again, or be damned."},{"rating":"2","title":"HALO The Fall Of Reach","review":"HALO The Fall Of Reach is an exciting book that explains the master chief's child hood. The chief A.K.A John is taken by a doctor named doctor hasley to a battle school where he under gose the sparten program, where they enhanse his body to nake him in to a super soldier. My favorite part of the book is when Master Chief and a group of spartans is on reach trying to save some marine ouutpoasts bieng atacked by covenant. in this part of the book the Master Chief Encounters his first hunter (a very large alien with a very large gun). I recomend this book to anyone who likes guns, aliens, and Halo. I read the book after I played the games and it was nice to learn about The Chief. So if you like any of what i just said you should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best vdeo game novel ever wrtten","review":"This is by far the best novel based upon any video game, it had me thnking for months about what the spartan children went through, i was upset when i turned the last page.... didnt want it to end"},{"rating":"2","title":"(T.B.K.A.)..This Book Kicks Ass","review":"This book is awesome i think any one whos thinkingabout buying it should.

Answers a lot of questions and gives great insight to the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've read","review":"This book was excellent. I have Halo and have beat it on three levels. It was amazing before I read the book, but now that I have it clears up any of my questions about the game. It made the game just that much better. This book is filled with suspense and action on every page. I absolutely loved it. I think I read it faster than I've ever read any other book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halo: The Fall of Reach, I great read for Sci Fi fans","review":"A great book for anyone who loved the game or just likes science fiction. For game fans it gives much more insight into what the master chief really is and who the covenant are, you will never look at the game the same way again. For Sci-fi fans it's a great story that you can get into even if you have never played the game. I finished it in 5 days just because every time I started to read it I couldn't put it down, even if your not a big reader you should check this book out. Don't think that just because it's a book based on a video game that its not going to be very good, it will really surprise you. Can't wait to read the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halo is really cool but...","review":"... I have a different reason for placing this 'review'.I'm wondering whether LST Vankan from Hoensbroek (NL) is called Lars, and whether he lives/lived in the Kouvenderstraat several years ago.If so (and if he's reading this by any chance), can you contact me?

The backstory with the Chief was worth it all by itself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd Time Around","review":"Second time reading this one. Loved the games and the story gives Halo an origin. Also gives a great history on the Master Chief!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A superior product.","review":"When I picked up The Fall of Reach, I expected a fairly amateurish attempt to make a prequel to Halo. I was pleasantly surprised. Eric Nylund obviously put a lot of thought into the thing, and it shows. The book is a believable and knowledgable, staying close to the story of Halo while adding in interesting background information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinda like Starship troopers, but without the proof reading.","review":"Imagine Starship Troopers (the book) and then imagine it as being a little easier to read and without the bugs. Thats \\"The fall of Reach\\". Overall a good SciFi book, which is even better if you are a fan of the game. My one complaint is that the editing is a little sloppy. Nothing that will hinder the enjoyment of the book but enough to make you scratch your head once or twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tribute to Spartans","review":"Take Steven Pressfields \\"Gates of Fire: The Battle of Thermopylae \\" and mix in \\"Starship Troopers\\" and you have \\" The Fall of Reach\\". The book has the same boot camp and sense of personal sacrifce that make both of those books great. Master Chief emerges as a man behind the armor that any trooper would want to follow into battle. It does not try too hard at being epic ( see Star Wars: New Jedi Order ). I would have given it a five but the editing is bad. Many dates and phrases contridict themselves so it gets annoying after the third or forth time. You thing 35 years have passed and it has only been 25. A guy that has his arm blown off , salutes with the same missing left arm on the next page."},{"rating":"2","title":"This should be made into a movie","review":"This book is one of my favorites. It turned me into a big Halo fan. It is really exciting and very well written. You do not have to be a Halo fan to like this book. Its great for anyone who likes science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Addition to Military Sci-Fi","review":"I have not really played Halo, but after hearing several people who have absolutely rave about the books I decided to check them out. I was not disappointed. One small problem I did have was with the editing. There were several typos (ie colleges instead of colleagues)which tend to take me out of the story.If you are a fan of Robert Heinlien'sStarship Troopersor Warhammer 40KHorus Rising (The Horus Heresy)or even Frank Herbert'sDune (Dune Chronicles, Book 1)you will greatly enjoy this book. Also, fans of ancient history and mythology will love all the names and references that pay homage to the ancients."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halo:Fall of Reach","review":"I rated this book a 5 because its action and detail was very appealing to me. The author wrote this book as if this fight could really go on in the future. The book was also constructed very neatly and the story flow great.Halo:Fall of Reach discribes a fight in an alternate universe with the covenant Elliot and the super powered Spartans. John is the leader of the Spartans. And with his leadership skills he and his teammates concur alot of missimons.I would recomend this book for anyone that likes killing action and just plain fiction books will like this book. So if your in the mood for a good book pick this one up. Although this book has alot of detailed fights I would recommend this book to girls to."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give this zero but it's not an option","review":"Eric Nylund knows zilch about writing combat. This some of the worst amateur drivel I've ever had the misfortune to come across.It must have been a struggle to write something so flat and uncharasmatic as this. The action reads like it was written for members of the Oprah Book Club or as an after school special.It's not good scifi. It's not good action. It's not emotionally mature or challenging in any way.What is most surprising is Nylund's other books \\"Signal to Noise\\" etc. are pretty good. This on the other hand is a car accident with no survivors. There are dozens of fantastic authors writing military scifi. Nylund is not one of them.Want good miltiary scifi? Try John G Hemry's Stark series, Ian Douglas's \\"Semper Luna\\" trilogy, Steve Perry's \\"Matador\\" series, Walter Jon Williams \\"Metropolitan\\" series, David Weber \\"Honor Harrington\\" series, Joe Haldeman's \\"Forever Peace\\" and \\"Forever War\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected........","review":"I purchased this book thinking it was a \\"cheat\\" to help me get through the levels and found that it's a story.

This is of no help in this area!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined HALO for me.","review":"This book sucked. It ruined the whole Halo story for me. A book about dumb bunch of kids running around.

Berry has a beautiful, haunting voice with a clear resonance. Her music at first may seem out of place among other 4AD acts, but the more you'll listen to it, the more you'll come to realize how unique it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely, moody late-night album","review":"Heidi Berry has a lovely sad alto that she uses to sing lovely sad songs on this fine album. The livelier songs sound something like Sade on quaaludes, but most of the album consists of spare but satisfying slow arrangements, with Berry often providing multiple layers of vocals. The idea of recasting Hüsker Dü's \\"Up in the Air\\" as a slow ballad is gutsy enough, but Berry pulls this off with jaw-dropping ease. The lyrics tend toward melancholy, such as \\"Hand Over Head\\" (\\"Some of us live too hard/some of us die too young/some are destroyed by all they might have done\\"). But Berry's singing and the arrangements provide a warmth that offsets the lyrics. On \\"Bright as Day\\", she lets the sadness fall away (\\"Something's lifted off of me/Shrugged it's shoulders, went away\\"). The perfect album for a mellow night curled up next to someone special."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Set","review":"While cynics will cry that Pharoah is cashing in on his Coltrane connection, just listen and you will hear what a fantastically sensitive player Sanders is.

For those looking to explore the connection between scientific inquiry and religious faith; if at all they are reconcileable (which this reviewer thinks thye are, and without compromising the integrity of either), Huchingson's collection provides an amazing starting point from which to view various interpretations of the questions at hand. Contributors run the gamut, from C.S. Lewis and Paul Tillich, to Annie Dillard, to Isaac Asimov and Richard Dawkins.

Fischers work reamins largely unread outside academic circles largely because he raises questions about german history that many people are unwilling to confront, but also because his prose tends to be incredibly turgid. This book, which argues a continuity in war aims between the two world wars raises important issues not only about Germay but about war in general, and represents Fischer at his most lucid."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could have found this at the dollar store!","review":"This item was not even close to what the picture looks like.

It just wasn't detailed enough for me, in spite of the obvious richness of experience there must have been. It was as if the author was compelled to write this, but not too much, or it would be too painful. Like reading a journalist's account, not a novelist's. The author was perhaps too close to the material to do it justice. It was in the Hemmingway style, sparse and terse. Were it not for the journey related, the writing would not be good.

I bought mine at walmart for $5 and it has no complaints. I have used it on numerous knives ranging from small swiss army knives which got sharper in just a few strokes to 11.5'' Bowie knives which took much more time but the result was pleasing. Absolutely 5 stars! Course and fine side, both work well! Don't put to much pressure on the blade as you slide it through however, at the best this will do nothing to your knife, worst result is that it will chip your knife. There is enough friction between the steel of the blade and the sharpener. Great Tool All in All!

You can touch up a sharp knife with a few draws through the ceramic posts.

They work best on a factory edge. They work so well on a factory edge that you can shave the hair on your arm. I find if I use it on an edge I've been using a stone on and have achieved a good polished edge it doesn't work as well. I think that is because my hand sharpened edge is rounded and polished. The rounded and polished edge just slides right through the pull through sharpener.

I read this book several years ago, so I don't remember the characters names, but I do remember the story. A couple loses their way in a storm. They take shelter in the summer house of an old deserted mansion. One of the highlights of the book was the love scene that takes place while they wait out the storm. In the morning they discover that the house is not as deserted as they thought. The owner invites them to stay. The couple soon begins to feel there is something quite strange going on, and they are right.The reader will enjoy the erotic scenes, but the plot will be equally interesting.

It is the first Cohen album I owned -- on vinyl -- and it took me a while to latch on to it. But it was so worth it. Every passing year I seem to love it more.\\"Story of Isaac\\" was the first thing to hook me; it is almost a chimera of two songs that are not closely related -- a biblical story from the point of view of the boy about to be sacrificed, and an antiwar song that recognizes the violence in all of us -- but they set each other off well.It seems wrong to blather on and on about an album that is beautiful because it is so spare. When you look up the word \\"plaintive\\" in the dictionary there should be an illustration of this album cover. I hope the new remixes don't run over that austerity. This is music that gives you space to breathe, and think, instead of pounding you over the head with mindless sound. I have the earlier CD, and when I play it I find myself missing the vinyl crackles."},{"rating":"1","title":"bitter doctors, please leave the profession","review":"As a cancer patient, I find it alarming but not at all surprising to read how much doctors hate their patients.

He had ignored the enlarged lymph nodes revealed by the pre-surgery cat scan, and in his hurry to finish the surgery, he didn't even see the primary tumor that was in plain sight. There was never an apology, and he's still billing me.I'm betting that, like Farrago, he complains about his patients for fun and profit.

It reads like a bunch of articles written by the doctors of the several people I know who have been turned away by their doctors for being hypochondriacs (or worse, in case of the several \\"my favorite Munchausen\\" sections of this book), only to turn out to have incurable bone cancer, breast cancer, giant ovarian cysts, and blocked up gall bladders. If the first doctor had not called up the specialist for a laugh (see the \\"new doctor vs. old doctor\\" list), these conditions may have been caught before they reached the critical or fatal stage.

It is extraordinarily clear in presenting the options faced by Presidents and decision makers, and how they resulted in strategy that varied between \\"Nuke them back to the Stone Age\\" in 1948 to \\"MX Racetracks in the Nevada Desert\\" in the Caarter and Reagan Administration.I found it a most compelling read, causing me to sacrifice sleep to continue, because it names names, dates, and places. Insight into all the news figures I grew up seeing on TV News.I grew up as an Army Brat in the 1960's and 1970's, and this book explains why many of the weapons systems came and went.

They all come with extra pieces which is a lot to pick up, but she is pretty good at keeping track of everything. This is a fun toy because it allows her to use her imagination with them.

But I also found the narrative to be much more engaging and enjoyable than The Man Without Qualities or Magic Mountain, despite a pace that was just as slow. It's a little less ironic than Stendhal or Musil and more melancholy.

They have results of show tapings a week or so before they come out. Plus fans can go see it for free, so why watch it? Even going to two hours has not changed the ratings in TNA. Even the crappy ECW beats TNA Impact. Thats really sad. I think they put too much faith into Kurt and Karen Angle, then again thats all they put on tv. They seem to forget the X-division and make bigger men the top dogs, just like WWE does. Jeez, they'll sign any WWE castoff hoping to garner some ratings. So how do you fix this? I dont know.

All lessons well written and explained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many errors","review":"There are tons of errors in the book. From the simple -- giving the wrong information to input -- to the inexcusable -- providing a CD with tutorials that don't have the same information as the tutorials in the book. How are we supposed to learn a program if we can't depend on the information from either source provided?Do these books have editors and fact checkers? Assuming they do, shouldn't the priority be on getting the information in the book perfect?Having said that, I have run into this problem before with books of this type. They try to rush them into the bookstores to get the first-mover advantage with not much regard for the accuracy of the information contained in them. In all honesty, I've seen worse examples of this than the Studio 8 book.If you're a true beginner, I can't recommend this book because you'll never know if you're doing something wrong or if the information in the book or on the CD is wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off strong, but finishes weak","review":"First off, let me say that I don't normally do these reviews, but for this book I had to say something.Within the first few pages, you will find two issues. The first is this book still talks about Freehand, which no longer ships in the studio package, BTW. The second is a incorrect instruction, which if not found, will mess up the first lesson. In general, you can usually figure out the problems, but not aways.And that is the second major issue with this book. There are no updates to this book. If its broke, and you can't figure it out, tough luck.In conclusion, the book does do a good job of explaining workflow within the suite, but sometimes it is just way too off (particularity in the second half of the book) for anyone who is a true beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, beginner's guide","review":"The initial chapters on Evolution of SAN, description of different Storage interfaces - information about IDE, SSA, SCSI, HIPPI, and their comparisons is good.One of the things that i really liked was the information provided in the TIPs and the NOTES sections and the simplicity of the content.Information about the Products Arena is limited.Case studies are ok- they not only tell you why you need to go in for a SAN, but also give sample SAN implementation scenarios.It is a good book for a person who does not have much idea aboutFibre channel and storage, and is a good starting point for getting inputs on designing a SAN, but cannot be treated as a bible for a SAN architect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A simple book!","review":"This book gives an amazingly simple view of SAN. It presents SAN from a perspective of a beginner and takes you through the design side of SAN.

I did read Blindsighted and found much repeated word for word from that. The people in charge of solving this do indeed have too too many personal problems and not enough swapping of information. When the doc hears something, she doesn't know what they are talking about as no information was given her by the detectives. After all she was at the scene of most the crimes and should have been given a better handle on it. Then I hate the way the perps get away with stuff right under the noses of the surveilance. This author sure leaves you dangling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything you don't want in a thriller","review":"Boring, predictable, bogged down in painfully irrelevant character development, slow moving, full of trite dialogue, long on unnecessary or simplistic details, short on key details. It was tough finishing this book and the only real surprise is how bad this effort is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very, very over-touted work","review":"While Blindsighted showed some promise, Slaughter's follow-up book loses points. She makes a number of mistakes. First, there's far too much time spent on truly unlikeable characters. Second, the two protagonists are cardboard cutouts. No? Try imagining them as friends for a minute ... Couldn't happen, as there's just not enough substance. Third, there's too little action and too much character background, one inner conflict after another, *endless* self-questioning, which is meant to show their depth I guess but only makes them look weak and unsure. Forth, I had A LOT of problems with sloppy, unrealistic procedures, as though the town wasn't staffed by professionals but was using the butcher to sub as the sheriff and the local school teacher as the doctor. Finally, a lot of the dialogue seemed forced, and some actually made me cringe.I'm not sure I'd even buy the paperback on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery -- NOT here!","review":"As much as I want to like Slaughter, I just can't get into her books. The subject, while relevant, has been covered before and much better -- see ANYTHING by Andrew Vachss, especially the BURKE novels. The \\"medical-examiner\\" chic prose has been done before, and better -- see the \\"Scarpetta\\" novels, by Patricia Cornwell. And the characters are too unbelievable and coarsely drawn to inspire any emotion for them.The character dialogue and interaction seems stiff, as evidenced in the excerpt posted here. And the \\"graphic detail\\" often touted in \\"reviews\\" seems to be borderline gratuitous. Slaughter has no credentials in forensics or law enforcement and this book highlights those deficiencies.The reviewers that have compared her to Cornwell, Vachss, and Reichs do those three authors a major disservice. Imitation may be \\"the sincerest form of flattery\\" but not in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cry for ME: I just wasted $18 on this book.","review":"This is another one of those \\"child abuse is bad\\" books written by people who think that watching CSI and Law & Order qualifies them as authorities. It's all recycled emotions and plot here, there's nothing new, even the faux insights are canned. The graphic details are used gratuitously and add nothing to the book. Can't believe anyone would fall for this as a valid message on any serious social issue. If an author is not contributing anything meaningful to the undersandng or prevention of a problem, they're only trying to piggyback the salacious details to fame. I don't want to be too hard on this author. She's just one of about 25 who wrote similiar books last year. But I do wish someone somewhere would be more original, insightful and true to life on this topic when used in a crime book. I'm sick of all this fake stuff that demeans and distracts from the real problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Have Finally Found a Book I Don't Want Read to Me","review":"This is in reference to the unabridged version. The reader uses what was probably intended to be a Georgia accent. I don't know if she knows what one sounds like but it watered down by a producer or she actually thinks that this was a Georgia accent-- but whatever the cause, this was BAD. I was gritting my teeth over the narrator's nasal voice within the first five minutes. Within the next five I was praying that someone would get killed so I didn't have to hear any more about the heroine's relationship with her ex-husband as they groped one another in a crowded skating rink. Finally, I gave it up as a bad job.I am left with only one burning question-- now mind I make no claim to being able to wear Cinderella's glass slipper myself-- but how big are the heroine's feet and why did she have to wear men's skates?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read - I couldn't put this down!","review":"After reading this book Karin Slaughter is now my favorite author.

As soon as you are getting to know a character, the perspective will switch to one of the other many, many characters. However, this could be a blessing-- considering that all of the characters are infinitely boring, unlikeable and depressing anyway.This dreck was so INCREDIBLY BORING that I began skimming about half way though. And then I just gave up and skipped to the end.This book was so horribly dull, I just had to see if the author could salvage it with an unexpected, creative conclusion. No such luck. The author tries to push the envelope and go for shock value...but fails miserably. Instead, the ending was...well, just plain gross and stupid.Save your money and bang your head repeatedly into a brick wall, instead of purchasing this boring dreck. You will achieve the same feeling as if you just read the entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why write this?","review":"This is not the first book I read by Slaughter.

Other readers who haven't lived in small towns might find certain plot elements unrealistic, but they rang very true to me. In a town where everyone knows everyone else, and where we all just have to do our jobs whether we want to interact with that person or not, I thought Ms. Slaughter brought a lot of realism to her story.

It's not often that I want to immediately jump to the next one in a series but I am ready for book #3 now!I thought that there could be a better title for this book but it doesn't take away from the impact of the book.Karin Slaughter is quickly moving up in my ranks of top authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your $5","review":"This is the most worthless piece of fecal matter I have ever bought.

Trail selection and details are very good and the trail maps and elevation profiles are extraordinary. Unlike most guides there is no hesitation to repeat a map a couple of pages apart if it will be helpful to the reader. The primary drawback of the book is that it lacks big picture planning tools like a map that puts the different sections of the book in perspective. A downloaded trail map from the national park service web site supplements it nicely. Additionally there seems to be more detailed coverage of Sequoia than King's canyon. Overall, however, it was a very helpful guide in planning a fantastic backcountry experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Useful","review":"I initially did not like this book. But then we went to the park and I found that it is actually very logically done and quite accurate. The initial problem was that I was not familiar with the park and so it did not make a lot of sense, but once there it was much better. I would suggest to the author a little more detailed introduction to the park with an overview of how the book is arranged.

From her temperamental faults to her unfulfilled hunger for affection, he gives a frank and accurate portrait of the world's most admired - and missed - woman. The world is a poorer place without Diana, and may she rest in peace. The fact that Diana herself never knew how very much she WAS loved is yet another tragedy of her untimely death"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING NEW IN THIS BOOK","review":"I've read almost every book ever written about Diana. This contains no new information. It is the standard stuff-how Prince Charles cheated on her, how she had affairs with James Hewitt, Hasnat Khan, Dodi Fayed. I've read it all before. The only thing that I found interesting is how Andrew Morton portrays Diana's butler, Paul Burrell, who wrote \\"A Royal Duty.\\" He makes several unflattering comments about the butler and in so many words, accuses him of lying about many things. We will never know the real truth about Diana."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old stuff","review":"Morton has nothing new to add to Diana's story except perhaps to promote himself and his earlier books on the Princess.

The author includes references to \\"10 million\\" years ago as well as presenting a God who had to send plagues on Egypt to get Pharaoh to let God's people go (no mention of God hardening Pharaoh's heart). If there would have been color pictures (like his book for adults), I could have edited the content and still received what I was looking for.

At age 77, he was out of touch as a filmmaker and no longer enjoyed the creative autonomy of his own studio - hence the overall static quality. Marlon Brando and Sophia Loren are expected to do little more than Chaplin imitations and both appear ill-at-ease with the weak romantic-comedy material. One wishes that Chaplin had permitted a documentary to be filmed on the \\"Countess\\" set - it would have been more enjoyable than this leaden farce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye Charlie","review":"This is the final motion picture written and directed by Charlie Chaplin. He was 78 years old when it was released and had been in political exile from the United States for the past 15 years.Although the movie features two of the biggest stars of its time, Marlon Brando and Sophia Loren, and was written as an old-fashioned comedy, it is rather slow and \\"talky.\\" It has plenty of curiosity value, but I'm sorry to report, not a great deal of entertainment value. The once mighty Chaplin, had simply run out of gas. Working with Brando (who openly made fun of Chaplin during filming) and a script he had first drafted in the 30s for Paulette Goddard, Chaplin was out of his element."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the Chaplin film to avoid....","review":"This film is not without some merit, but overall, it's pretty disappointing, considering it's a Charlie Chaplin film. Out of Chaplin's five sound films, this is the one to avoid. It seems Mr. Chaplin was trying to put Marlon Brando in a role Chaplin himself would have performed in his heyday. But Chaplin was obviously too old to play the tramp (he was 77 when he made this), so he put Marlon Brando and Sophia Loren through the antics. There are a few funny moments, a lot of doors slamming, some nice humanistic touches, but most of it just seems tired. The supporting performances are very subpar, the editing is quite awkward, and the atmosphere of the film is almost dirge like. A rather sad experience, especially if you're a Chaplin fan.

Worst of all Brando's Movies. You wouldn't believe that the Great Chaplin created this movie - poor closure to a near perfect film career. No wonder Brando picked this movie purely out of respect for Mr. Chaplin. There is just nothing good about this movie, very primitive in everything. Monotonous Music and Camera work, and the worst acting job by all actors involved.

Well, everything. The plot may have had some possibilities but none of it emerged with any coherancy. There were scenes that were supposed to be funny but were merely embarassing (consider the scene with the cigar smoke and ask yourself, Why?). The acting was uninspired and that's hard to say about Marlon Brando. I was disappointed in everyone although I understood Chaplin's purpose; he spotlighted his offspring although they were uninspiring as well. Even the two songs he composed for the movie were played too much. I'll continue to watch other works of Charlie Chaplin and Marlon Brando because I know what they're capable of.

Even though this is Chaplin's last film, it's his first and only film in color and widescreen. The movie is old fashion to say the least, it might of been better in b/w. Brando and Loren are completely wasted, the supporting players fair much better. Chaplin is quite good in his cameo role (makes you wish he'd given himself a bigger part). At the time, Chaplin took the negative reviews as almost a personal threat. He really defended the film, even going so far as to say he thought it was the best film he ever made!

For those of you familiar with the (80's) names of the trade, there's Chick Corea, Steve Gadd, Eddie Gomez and Mike Brecker. What makes this recording stand out to my ears is the crossover nature of the material and the way it is played: it is definitely a Jazz album with bells and whistles, but there's no standards, and every jazz \\"element\\" is played in a very funky way; but not funky as in slap bass and a pumped beat, more in a fusion kind of way but then it's STILL more of a jazz album.....warm fusion, perhaps?As you have probably figured out, it is hard to describe. it does certainly bring a lot of threads together, though, in an extremely tasteful, fresh, haunting way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thick and long, but oh the smell!!!","review":"I ordered this mat three weeks ago and was very eager to try it out when it arrived.

While many philosophers have categorized the Lockean liberal theory as individualistic, the author has successfully enlightened us to reconsider Locke's theory. Through the critical analysis on Locke, the author concludes with two important points. First, Locke was not successful to justify private ownership by the notion of equality in the State of Nature. Secondly, based on the discovery that Locke failed to justify private property, the author put forward that the Lockean theory, though at the first glance be classified as individualist, \\"Locke's service as an apostle of individualism was merely part of his service as an apostle of collectivism.\\" (p.318)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Great CD!

A great collection of musical conspirators of Frank London from the Klezmatics, including omnipresent scenester guitarist Marc Ribot, Sebastain Steinberg from Soul Coughing, Jim Leff of the awesome website chowhound.com on trombone, Donwtown doyen Elliott Sharp, all produced and mixed and guitarized by great producer Bob Musso (Bill Laswell's partner). with Steve X. Popkin (DJ Steve). I encouraged Frank and friends to take klezmer beyond the outer reaches and they did.

I love the manga too! What is so great about fooly cooly you ask? It's different! It's mind boggling and comedic. Anyways it's about this boy named Naota that lives in an ordinary town with an ordinary life with his perverted father and and a brother who moved to america for fortune who's ex girlfriend, mimika just dosen't leave Naota alone! One day this alien girl with a guitar and scooter named haruko aka the vespa girl bangs him on the head with a guitar and starts giving birh to robots that come out of his head. So thats pretty much the main idea. The manga artwork isin't the ordinary anime style. It's kinda sloppy but who cares I still like the artwork! The series is kinda hard to follow so maybe the series will help. Anyways, this is a great book so buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Manga Gives Ungiven Info not Provided by Anime!","review":"Okay, so this is an essential for any Fooly Kooly fan of any age. A crap-load of background information on Characters is given, though still using a quirky, humerous plot to describe it all. The art is OUTSTANDING! It follows in the quirky, 90's rock feel that was displayed through the Anime. Though it may be confusing at some times, anyone who has watched the Anime should already expect that. This is one of the only must-buy Manga's I have ever encountered, and is a must buy for any fan of Takkun and the rest of the gang."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it more then 1 time.","review":"I must say that when I got this book I read it once and set it at the button of my shelf...

Reading it again I figured it out and was like \\"WOOOW_O...\\" So I bought the second one and they wore totally cool.

Trust me you would be missing something if you don't give this a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same as the anime","review":"If you are looking for a printed version of the FLCL anime, you won't get it here. Other than the character names and small bits of the plot, the manga version bears no resemblance to the anime. I won't outline the story here because, well, I can't. Let's just say that the manga is more of a surreal exercise in style rather than a coherent story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I was wondering how they could adapt this crazy anime to manga. I thought it would be just about impossible and unfortunately I was right.This looks like it was drawn by a five year old. It's almost impossible to even tell what you're looking at in many of the panels.The story just doesn't convey the manic craziness, emotion, and sexuality of the series. I was just bored.I say don't bother with this just watch the anime again."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for the drawings","review":"The artwork for this manga is pretty interesting to me, but after reading 2 volumes, I feel I have wasted my money as far as the story goes. The story is totally incoherent, and I have heard from people that watching the anime is the only way to understand the manga (which I feel makes for bad manga) and so I cannot reccomend this manga as a stand alone product. I've watched a lot of anime and read a fair amount of manga, and so I'm able to put together even strange stories... however this manga has almost no story and jumps around so much that nothing is ever developed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dogs love bully sticks","review":"These things are the best.

Finally, I took a suggestion off of this review site and made it like hot chocolate. Well, the powder mixed up this time and does taste a bit better, almost like sugar free hot cocoa.

This movie shows the trials and tribulations that girls have to go through...teen pregnancy, money troubles, friendships coming together and some breaking up, guys, school..The three main characters of the film created a beautifully acted story that was so natural, that you fell into it and found it very believable. I liked the acting better than I liked the movie.It shows you that even though the scenery may change the feelings still are the same for every girl because we all go through it.Some light humor was included and depressing times as well.. it was all interwoven nicely throughout the film.

Three high school girls living in Brooklyn discover that when summer ends, they will be sent to different schools as their current school will be closing due to an asbestos problem. The way these three friends deal with their respective comings-of-age, and slowly drift apart is unrushed and sensitive.

It's almost in a documentary style. Very real. You know these girls, or you know someone just like them. I was one of these girls when I was in high school. They could've been my best pals. It's about being on the cusp of womanhood, and what you're going to do about it. Decisions, decisions! Oh the angst of being old enough to do whatever adults do but too young to have the wisdom to deal with the consequences. Should be required viewing for all teenaged girls.

But the truth is that I have tried to watch it three times - and I have seen all of it but once. Visually it's a great improvement overDG's hilariously ugly DVDof Bernstein with the BSO from 1976. Musically Thielemann's sedated \\"interpretation\\" is light years behind Bernstein's rendition (which is no great shakes in the first place).

So tight that it was uncomfortable and made a mark on my skin. I tried stretching it a couple of different ways, but that still doesn't help as stretching overall doesn't affect the duck bill. The main problem is that the hard duckbill material inside of the knit material is too stiff and hard--especially at the forehead edge.

What I wanted most by the end of this book was for that primary voice to just shut up and let someone else tell the story. Someone with a real story to tell. Its tiring to always read how someone felt about others actions.

I continued on and soonlost interest when I realized that this book contained overt detailed descriptions of the acts between the female slave owner and her female slave.Naturally in any slave story there is expected to be reference to some kind of non consenting relationship in most cases. However,this book appeared to be going down the path of a Harlaqin Love Novel in it's detail of such acts and that is not what I was looking for in a period piece at all. That aside the book does highlight a different aspect of slavery ownership, and the whole degrading and demoralizing institution of slavery and how it affects the minds of the oppressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is all the hype about?","review":"I read this book in two evenings. This book is based on some interesting ideas but the writer does not develop them very well. I felt half-dead reading the book because I didn't care about any of the characters and it didn't matter much what happened to them . The book is an ok read at best.

I was not happy with this read at all"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Ain't Gone with the Wind","review":"This elegantly written very dark novel set in the early 1800's in Louisana is one you won't soon forget. In contrast to Margaret Mitchell's happy darkies singing in the fields, Ms Martin's treatment of slavery and how the institution affected everyone is chilling and often shocking. The white characters to a person are pretty dispicable.I don't recall any fictional character who to me more deserved getting killed than the main character's husband. Boy, talk about no redeeming value as a human being whatsoever.Interestingly to me, the author doesn't develop any of the slave characters much at all which I suspect is how they had to lead their unfortunate lives in reality, as just worker appendages to the \\"real people\\" who benefited from their labors. Disturbing is an understatement for the book. However, it is a whale of a read. Ms. Martin is quite the accomplished author. She not only spends an intriguing tale, but does it in a way to keep the reader turning the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Company's Inspiration","review":"Hello, reading this book was incredible, because it explains the core of our company's approach to how we treat all our dogs on The Dog Island.

We now link to this book directly from our website, and recommend it to all dog owners who plan on sending their dogs to us. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK _ WELL WORTH IT. Great job, we love."},{"rating":"2","title":"a quick, fairly satisfying read","review":"I was drawn to this book because it took place approximately 40 years before the Civil War, and it was told in a voice that we rarely hear from...the female point of view, specifically a planter's wife who is completely unsympathetic. I enjoyed this book because it was sharp, quick, and closely focused on the shared women's issues that Manon and Sarah have in common, despite the mistress/slave relationship. Unlike other books on this period that I have read, it has no fluff. I enjoyed it, and read it in a day and a half."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"This was a fictional story written from the point of view of a remorseless female slave owner. It examines the thoughts of the oppressor, which was a bit unusual. The author skillfully created a fascinating portrait of an insolent and self-centered young woman and, in doing so, delved into the institution that denied freedom to whole race of people and was tolerated for so long in this country! It was very powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Perspective","review":"This book gives an interesting perspective of Slavery from the viewpoint of a Slave owner's wife. It depicts the conditions of life for the impoverished and enslaved people whose ancestors once lived in Africa. One can see from the beginning that Sarah is as much a slave to her husband as the mulatto woman living under her roof with her. All though she can see that they are being mistreated, she herself is part and parcel to this way of life. It's an interesting perspective, another point of view in the saga of slavery. I don't think it was written for one to sympathize with the main character. I think it was written to allow the reader to learn more about the dynamics of those conditions from someone who was not a slave but a slave of society. You will not feel sorry for Sarah, but you will get a full view of her perspective and a glimpse of slavery from a grimy angle.

So hubby recommended that we buy replacements online and Amazon is our go-to. Price is reasonable so we bought 2 pairs and now I do NOT allow these to soak in water and take care to dry these immediately after washing. Shipping was timely (for being free, but I do not like to pay for shipping, so it's worth the wait).

The beaters are no where near the quality of the original beaters. The replacement beaters are lighter in weight, not the heavy duty stainless steel the original beaters are. Not only that, but they do not stay in the mixer which is the problem trying to be solved for. And it looks like they cannot be returned as they are considered an \\"in touch with food' item. Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A subtle, wonderful, erotic and \\"sense-sual\\" book","review":"An all girls school, a crush on the English teacher, divorce, rape and jeolousy - as an alum of an all girls high school, I could not resist the story line and I was not disappointed. This book captured the all the intensity and subtlety of the relationships between men and women without sensationalism. It was quietly erotic and full of suspense without really being a \\"mystery.\\" One of my favorite aspects of this book was the author's inclusion of the ecology of the setting in the form of the main character's love of the local natural environment. It brought the Connecticut shore to my senses in the same fashion that \\"Water for Chocolate\\" made my mouth water"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As an enormous fan of \\"Give Me One Wish,\\" I read Jacquie Gordon's debut fiction novel \\"Flanders Point\\" with great anticipation. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I found the book far too mannered, and it seemed more like a literary experiment than a fully-realized story. The heartfelt emotion of the memoir \\"Give Me One Wish\\" was missing in \\"Flanders Point.\\" I do hope Jacquie continues writing and explores her talent further, even if I didn't enjoy this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alice Ellis is excellent","review":"Ms Ellis writes about several disagreeable people all trying to be antisocial at Christmas time. Her descriptions of these horrid people are hilarious, especially the psychiatrist obsessed with getting his wife back to make him his supper. As usual, she puts a touch of the uncanny into the story. I recommend this and any of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quirky","review":"This story is set in a small hotel on a remote Scottish island, where the characters have gathered to avoid having to celebrate Christmas. Having often wanted to do the same thing myself, I thought the book would be about Christmas, its true meaning, why we celebrate at all, what we accomplish by escaping it, and stuff like that. However, the story has almost nothing to do with Christmas. That's just the excuse the author uses for assembling this group of characters. I've never read anything by Ellis before, so didn't know what to expect. It's a quirky little story, what there is of it. The best parts of it are the characterizations; they are excellent. Each person is drawn and developed so uniquely. I could recognize aspects of myself or friends in each of her story's characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise and eminently readable","review":"Chancer & Watkins' Gender, Race, and Class: An Overview provides an insightful analysis of the power structure in our society. In addition to devoting a chapter each to gender, race, and class, this work helps the reader grasp the interrelationships between each of three critical components of our identity. Chancer & Watkins' concise and engaging writing unpacks the factors that so greatly affect how we function in today's world. Reviewing the essentials of established theory and contemporary studies, the authors extract a unique and relevant snapshot of gender, race, and class' impact on the family, the workplace, the community, and beyond. I am not a student of sociology, but I found the book eminently readable, interesting, and eye-opening. With a reader-friendly style that includes specific examples and scenarios, this publication has piqued my interest in the underlying forces at work in a capitalist society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable.","review":"It's astonishing that one could present a biography of Jung and not deal with the many allegations of unprofessional, irresponsible, and certainly bizarre behaviors that have been advanced about this man.

Each round is 3 min with a 1 min break in between rounds. Each round is 3 min straight through, meaning you will not put down the kettlebell during the round. Movements are basic foundational kettlebell exercises, nothing fancy.PROS:-The quality of the DVD is good, there is a lot worse out there.-Good workout. It will improve your endurance and strength.-Shawn guides you through the workout with tips and motivation. No cheesy jokes.CONS:-There is no timer on the screen.-There is no instruction on the exercises.

Both Ralph and James were the rulers of the tele and steel, as far as I was concerned. Nobody played like them..nobody!Recorded at the Capitol Records Tower in the mid 60's, this album, while perhaps sounding corny to some, laid down a true blueprint for west coast country playing.Burton's dobro (both fretted and with slide) transends good taste and originality, while Ralphs one-of-a-kind steel guitar weaves its way around the great selection of songs.James and Ralph helped establish a sound that put LA on the map as a true contender for west coast country music hit recording. These guys were simply the best at their ax..and this album captures then in their prime. I highly reccomend this CD. It sits on my studio shelf as a reminder of it's influence on my playing.JOhn BelandFlying Burrito BrothersAustin Texaswww.johnbeland.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Way Out Country....","review":"I may be going overboard, I would probably give this record 4.5 stars but I still love it dearly. As the other reviewer said it definately show alot of Owens influence, but it also treads some interesting ground. There are some really interesting and memorable arrangements/melodies in here. My personal favorite cut is \\"The Texas Waltz\\" which I believe Mooney wrote, they got a wah-wah lead guitar! That must have been pretty daring for country music in the late 60's! It reminds me of what groups like the Byrds were doing at the time by combining sort of \\"psychedelic\\" sounds with traditional country arrangements. All in all, any fan of good guitar and steel guitar pickin, or anyone who wants to hear country music from a different point of view need this record!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice 'Little' Country Instrumental Disc","review":"I've always been a fan of James Burton, but just finally got around to pickin' up this CD. I don't really have anything to add to all the other positive reviews for the disc with regard to the quality of the music, musicianship, influences, etc. However, for others that may be interested in purchasing the CD; be aware that there is only about 26 or 27 minutes worth of music, so I wouldn't pay a whole lot (as in pay a BIG price for a LITTLE bit of music) for what is essentially no more than an EP's worth of music from a time or duration standpoint. Sundazed/EMI should have combined this album with another release and put out a 'Two-fer' package to provide more music for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with this Video","review":"I have a few of Leslie's other videos, my favorite is the Boot Camp and second favorite is 4 mile walk with Weighted Gloves. This video is 5 miles which is what I wanted for this winter but a bit too rah-rah and lacks what is in the Boot Camp video. She spends a lot of time talking to others on the set and mis-cues happen. I will give this video away and use the others I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old package sent when a new one was bought","review":"Even though I had ordered a new one, I received an already opened package and did not include the toning band as said in the DVD cover"},{"rating":"2","title":"Luv it, luv it, luv it!","review":"I was introduced to Leslie Sansome's work-out DVD's last fall. After being addicted to three of them throughout the fall and winter I took the summer off and enjoyed out of doors exercise. Starting up again this September, I just couldn't get back into doing the same kicks, side-steps, etc. I ordered this DVD and I am once again addicted. I love the new steps, especially the shift, and the change-ups and combinations of the old steps. After doing 5 miles, I am really sweating and feel that I have had an excellent total body work-out and especially the mid-section which is where I need it. I wouldn't recommend this for someone just starting out unless you are in really good physical shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"I have purchased or rented several walking/exercise DVDs over the years but have never stuck with them. I like this 5 mile DVD VERY MUCH! The music is good, the different moves are not hard to follow, Leslie has a nice manner & it is a good workout. The 5 miles are each separate so you can do them all in a row or pick & choose which ones you want to do. Sometimes I will do just mile # 1 in the am before work & then do more later in the day. Finally.... a winner for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Love It!","review":"I have several of Leslie's workouts which I alternate using weekly, along with several Wii games. While trying to find new workout DVDs to add to my collection, I decided to purchase this and another DVD Leslie released in 2011, as well as Exerbeat for Wii. After trying Exerbeat on Monday (love it, btw), I decided that I would try this on Tuesday, expecting pretty much the same ole, same ole from Leslie. I was pleasantly surprised to see the bright set, fresh faces and best of all, several new moves! Since Exerbeat wore me out, I had already decided that Tuesday I would only do a mile or three, but I ended up doing the whole 5 miles - and boy, what a workout! Leslie really had me moving and sweating up a storm. Glad I bought it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacing Her 4 Mile Walk as my Favorite","review":"Leslie'sLeslie Sansone - Walk Away the Pounds Express - Super Challengehas been my favorite DVD for years. I've bought a bunch of her newer ones, but kept coming back to it. Her new \\"5 Really Big Miles\\" walk actually is replacing my old stand by! I love it. It actually has some \\"real\\" music too like \\"I say a little prayer....\\".Some miles are toning miles using an included band, others are typical Leslie walking workouts. She has a nice variety of walkers--some bigger girls and one man (I think...might be two).This would work for anybody from a beginner to an intermediate exerciser. I think it's ideal for an advanced beginner. The key with all Leslie tapes is you can tell yourself that you're only going to do one or two miles, but for me at least, 95% of the time, I do more. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leslie Sansone video","review":"This Leslie Sansone's latest video.

Thank you Leslie, for this new DVD ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for.","review":"I thought I was buying another 5 mile walking CD. This workout interrupts the walking with stretch bands. Guess I am just not very coordinated. I was afraid I would trip while trying to move using the bands and walking. I wanted another version of her other 5 mile CD. This is not a very good cardio tape, but I guess if you want fake muscle building, you might like it. I prefer going to the gym to do weight training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas presents","review":"I bought this DVD for all of my sisters and girlfriends for Christmas. It has really helped me to feel energetic and also to go down a size in clothing in about 3 weeks! So I wanted to pass on this wonderful DVD. I have many more Leslie DVD's but this is my favorite. I can do the warm up, cool down and 12 minute mile on days I don't have a lot of time.

As all of us I stopped and now several years later I've decided to really do something nice for my body without injurying myself. This DVD offers safe and effective moves that bring results. You can customize to fit your pace/needs. I personally enjoy the first three (3) miles. I also love this DVD because it doesn't require floor/mat work and YOU REALLY DO SEE RESULTS.Think about it when you go to the gym you are doing the same routine why not invest in a DVD and enjoy in the comforts of your own home, save the money and invest in new clothes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"This is a great workout.

She strayed from her usual 4 basic moves and incorporated some new moves and very simple combinations. I appreciate her effort to create more variety in her workout, and I can enjoy a good dance workout DVD (which this was NOT), but her end product but was boring, rather cheesy, and reminiscent of a bad 80s workout video. More importantly, I did not feel it was as hard of a workout. I did not feel the \\"burn\\" in my muscles that I have felt in her other videos, and I was able to do nearly the entire DVD the first night I owned it without hardly breaking a sweat (and no, I am not in that good of shape!). I wanted to like this DVD, but I am quite disappointed. I wish I could return it. Her \\"Ultimate collection\\" is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"more or less happy","review":"am a devoted Leslie Sansone walker !!! Did this workout this morning and loved it !!!!!!

The images are consistently blurry and there isn't a lot of detail thanks to the low-resolution sensor.I decided on a whim to buy a Kodak DX3700 3.1-megapixel camera, hoping to get higher-resolution images (I knew nothing about digicam technology last year...call it naivety). Okay, first of all the Kodak is definitely more expensive. Secondly, the Kodak's photos are light-years better than the Polaroid's. Period.I have now shelved the low-resolution Polaroid and have used the Kodak exclusively.If you're on a budget and don't mind inferior images, then the Polaroid is great.

Really, you won't find a better camera for this price, but you won't get much out of it. I know I will be re-saleing this camera as soon as I get a better job, so I can take pictures at a better clarity, though my most useful trick with the camera is to take all of your pictures at the high resolution option, and then resize them with your paint program, it helps create a sharper image.If you are just planning to take close up pictures of your face or something, it's a good camera, but if you wanted to take pictures of vacations, or scenary, you will not like this, and I suggest you wait a few months until you can afford a better camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funflash 640 is no fun at all","review":"Less than 1 megapixel, you can't fit it in your pocket and no slot for a memory card.

I'd recommend with the better technology these days to save up and invest in at least 3 megaxpixel and higher. You will not only get better technology, but the newer cameras are better looking and don't have the cheap feel to it, and more than likely it will fit into your pocket and feel better in your hands for sure.

We sent it back for a refund, since the first one we got was dead on arrival, the box was beaten up, etc. The manufacturers are close to having a great product, but still need to do some more road testing and better packing for shipping. Bummer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice bike","review":"Nice little dirt bike. My son wishes it was a little faster, but he is 12. We don't have anywhere for him to ride a real dirt bike, so this will do for now. He did smash the front tire and wheel while riding through the empty lots in our subdivision...he was going full speed, hit a divot made from the rain runoff, he didn't see it coming. Replacement parts were easy to get though :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirt bike DUD!!","review":"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son and after putting it together it didn't work. I bought it early as a Christmas present so the warranty ran out by the time winter was over and he was ready to use it. After putting it together there was a disconnected wire in the throttle which I had to find a razor dealer to repair. Brand new, never used and already an extra $40.00 charge. After that it ran for a while and now it will not hold a charge. I read other reviews and decided I will not go through the exercise of buying a new battery which is about $90.00 without tax. I highly recommend not buying this dirt bike!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy","review":"It sounds like I am not the onl;y one has had issues with this and Razor certainly doesnt stand behind it. Worked great for awhile then it seemed like it wouldnt charge. Checked battery with a meter and the battery was good and when checking throttle it was sending right amount of volts to motor. Motor done in less than 6 months. Had another Razor scooter a few years before and within a year the motor on that went as well. If you want it to work for just a short time it is a great product. But dont expect anything over 6-9 nmonths out of it. I have purchased my last Razor product. I understand things happen but when they have happened on both Razor products I have purchased and Razor was willing to do nothing about it well that to me says it all. Garbage Product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rear wheel is a problem","review":"We bought this for our 10 year old son for Christmas and it has already broken after riding it a dozen or so times. My son only weighs 75 pounds and he rode it on the street and on grass. Now the back gear is stripped and the rear wheel will not move. I wish I had read the reviews by others about the rear wheel problem. This is a very common problem and yet Razor will not replace it once you are out of the 90 day warranty period. The rear wheel costs $50 to replace, so if you buy this product plan on replacing the rear wheel assembly."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!","review":"This is the best bike I've ever had! It goes really fast, and can go up short hills with lots of incline (60 ft incline on a 500 ft. Hill.)!It actually goes up to 19 mph. on flat ground (checked speed with handheld GPS that is very accurate)The only problems I've ever had with this is the stock brake pads wear out FAST. I mean the razor ones only lasted <6 months. Easily fixed with new 3rd party non stock pads. I also had the same problem with the brake pads on my Razor E100. Both easily fixed.Also, the battery meter only says low (if it is) if you twist the throttle fully.Battery life= Great! Lasts long enough for me to go to my friends' houses (about 1/4 mile away) and back, and the battery is still not low.(also on a very steep hill)Definetly a GREAT BUY!If you want maybe buy some extra break pads (good ones are at monsterscooterparts.com).BTW I'm 13, ride it every day, and it's awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent little bike!","review":"This is the perfect bike for kids to ride around the yard, my boys have loved it so much that we are going to have to buy another one.

Two weeks later the kit came in and I replaced it. Still didn't work.

At first, it was a great bike and a lot of fun. Then the bike stopped running. First we had to buy a new rear wheel that cost $50. It was easy to put on. Then we had to replace a control module. It was not so easy. I thought that maybe everything would be fine, but today it has stopped running again. And once again the problem is the rear wheel. I have already put almost as much money into the bike that I originally spent on it. So, it is not worth buying another rear wheel. Not to mention, what is the point in buying another part that will eventually break again. I think that the Razor company needs to acknowledge that the rear wheel assembly is defective and fix it. I will not waste my money on a Razor MX500 again until they do. BUYER BEWARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Electric Toy","review":"Hi...maybe we were UNLUCKY!! But the first Razor Motorcycle we got from Amazon had broken gears. We would give it some 'gas' and the rear sprocket would just spin, as if the gears were not engaging with the sprocket/chain. So we returned that first bike, and Amazon sent us a new one at no charge (which was great). Unfotunately the SECOND bike wasn't much better. The battery on the second bike didn't hold a charge. We followed the directions for how to charge it initially, which we did, but now the yellow like on the throttle always shows \\"lit\\" meaning that it needs a charge, eventhough we had it on the chareger for several hours.

The bike arrived on September 21, 2011. The bike was 90% assembled out of the box and it only took about 30 minutes to complete the handlebar and wheel assemble. I then charged the bike's batteries and presented it to my grandson on September 23, 2011. Jackson loved the bike but after only two weeks of use it quit running. We went through all the troubleshooting techniques listed in the manual and online but it still wouldn't run. We called Razor directly and they said a part was bad and they are going to send us a new part. The bike only comes with a 90 day warranty (very short for an item that cost $340) so it's important to get it fixed right away. Very disappointed the electric dirt bike didn't hold up longer but I guess we'll find out how good Razor's service and warranty department are. Jury's still out on this product but I'm starting to feel like I've wasted my money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another rear wheel defect - x2!!!!","review":"This is ridiculous and we are completely frustrated.

It is so easy to assemble, about 20 min and it is pretty fast, about 15-17 miles like is reads on description. On a hill, forget it, it goes even faster, so I definitely suggest a helmet at all times. The charging time is great and my son and his friends go on it all day without the charging light indicater, which turns yellow, going on. I am not sure why I read bad reviews on it, but this bike is amazing. I even went on it and I am about 165lbs (the max recommended weight is 175lbs).

Bubba J's 'segment' comes off sounding more like Peanut's character, Jose doesn't get nearly as funny lines as he has in the past, etc... so we didn't laugh as much as with his earlier material, but we did laugh. Our son loved the whole set up and the little intro \\"film\\" segments, but says only Walter was funny (though we all loved Peanut and Achmed's costumes)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun movie","review":"If you are a fan of Jeff, this is a great addition to your collection.

Jeff jokes about everyday things as well as his own life.Jeff starts with approximately 15 mins of his stand up comedy then about 15 mins with each 4 of his famous companions.His show was well worth going to and his DVD's are even more worth the purchase price.Enjoy &#9786;"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeff Dunham: Minding the Monsters","review":"Jeff is awesome and funny.

I have loved all of his earlier works but the Minding the Monsters show was all about hating the ex-wife. He's said some very typical ex-wife stuff before but not to this level. The shows staging was very cool and Peanuts entrance was the best. But that was the show. I remember laughing out loud just once. He definitely needs to go back to the beginnings when he was funny. I hope he turns it around. Glad I did not purchase the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Boring.......","review":"Sorry Jeff. I am a Huge fan and have the greatest respect for you. IMO you are the best Ventriloquist there has ever been. All the previous shows you have done was fantastic, could not stop laughing. This show was painful to watch it was Boring and you seemed to be reaching to get laughs with all the body part and filthy or racist jokes. I always thought the best comedians ever are the ones who don't have to be filthy to get a laugh. I may have laughed once this whole show, even my wife who watches the most stupidest filipino shows ever (ones that reminded me of Banana split or H.R. Pufnstuf type) told me she thought it was boring. That's saying alot.

Jeff is an excellent ventriloquist and generally great comedian. However, there was no spark in this particular act.His show in 2007, \\"Spark of Insansity\\" was his best yet and this performance is subpar in comparison. I'll still give this 2 stars out of respect. Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like at all.","review":"This is way downhill in funny and decency from his earlier shows.

The georgous brother seemed a bit challenged as well.This book lacked total content. The red head, I even forget her name already, could Hailey North have stressed how much of a beautiful body she had anymore? I got to page 70 and said...good bye!Don't waste your time with this one!

I gladly pass on those paranormal romance novels.And a 34 y.o. hero with gray hair? Did I say \\"yuck\\" already, and long hair at that, give me break. And the heroine was hideous.

There was another reviewer who expressed my sentiments exactly about the \\"hero\\", Alistair. Who wants a seventies hippie type hero??? Birkenstocks??? Please! - Yuck! Gray hair? No...sorry...uh uh...not doing anything for me. And Lauren, the \\"heroine\\", seemed really, really immature. Not to mention airheaded, fickle, frigid, naive, and God knows what all else (but none of it very good). Did I mention immature?

In addition, Mr. Woodward includes reprints of articles from the AMA's magazine and some other things I've seen elsewhere.If you lack the time, inclination, or patience to do a little research on your own, or if you're just too lazy to do so, this may be the book for you.Otherwise, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"New rotor cracked after 3 weeks","review":"Installed 3 weeks ago, car has been in easy use.

Here are the things I like about this product:1) The DVD lets you choose from four difficulty levels, or watch them combined. I really liked working my way through the levels so the same workout remained challenging. If I'm having a bad day and am too stiff, I can scale back to a lower level for that day.2) I am a musician and am picky about background music. The Gaiam series of yoga tapes that I've purchased all have pleasant evocative, well performed music that doesn't annoy or distract me, but supports the ambience I'm wanting.3.) I appreciate yoga and the culture that developed it, but I prefer to imbue the experience with my own spirituality, so I appreciate a workout that doesn't push any belief system too heavily.4.)

Not only was the art bad, but they seem to have tried to compress every episode of the series into one uber-story with no sense of pacing or cohesive plot. Furthermore, and this is the worst in my opinion, they RUINED the characters! Haruko is no longer a charismatic wildchild but now just a sleazy con-artist with the worst sense of humor this side of the Prime Meridian. Mamimi is shunted off to the side and Ninamori floats around with the thing from ep. 3 the whole book. And, I don't mean to spoil this for you, but Haruko actually shacks up with Naota's dad and Naota really actually kills him. Which leads to the one funny joke in the book, but still!

I purchased it to bootleg concerts because I go to about 30 shows a year. It does everything as advertised. However, you will need an external mic for stealthy concert recording. Built in mic is great too. I use it record myself playing the guitar and it produces amazingly clear recordings. Records phone calls on speakerphone very well too. I have a 4gb SDHD Card from QMemory in there. With that I can record like at least 4 hours in 16 bit wav. Great battery life too so far. A three hour concert barely puts a dent in some fresh rechargeables.The item I ordered \\"new\\" actually came in a used condition. The screen was all scratched up. But it worked fine and still does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great - BUT automatic gain control not good","review":"I'm charmed with this little gem, which I will use mainly for taping meetings. But the advertised automatic gain control does not work as advertised. It does limit high intensity sounds so the recording doesn't overload, but it does not automatically boost low level sounds. Indeed as soon as you switch in automatic gain control, the microphone sensitivity is lowered so you are less likely to pick up softer sounds. It's still great in many other ways, but they would have better advertised the R-09 as having limiting circuits, not as automatic gain control....I thought at first that I had a defective unit, but Edirol tech support tells me this is the normal way the unit operates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recorded Sound Quality is Great --- Easy to Copy Recorded Sound Files to CD With Media Player","review":"This Recorder performs as advertised. The internal Microphone quality is excellent. Transfer of audio files to PC is easy for copying to CD's with Microsoft Media Player.

Finally I stumbled upon the Edirol R-09. Having used it for about two months, I can say that the quality of both in-line (which few MP3 recorders have) and the live microphone recordings are top-notch. I use the device to record our church services, and can pop out the SD card and transfer the recording to my computer to edit.The unit has easy-to-use controls, seems well-made, runs on either AC or regular AA batteries, and while expensive, is highly recommended for live recording or connecting to an audio system."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY HANDY","review":"RECORDS GREAT.THE NEW OPERATING SYSTEM WILL USE A 4 GB CLASS 2 SD CARD.GREAT FOR REHEARSALS ,TALKS ETC.

Also, I am very average when it comes to dealing with electronics. That said, I highly recommend this for home recording. I have a very nice piano (Yamaha C-7) and it is in tune. Reading the instructions took about an hour. When I finished, I said to myself -- \\"It works just like a typical tape player.\\" I had expected some electronic rigmarole, but there was none. We have a good microphone, but I chose to use the internal mic. Turned it on, played for about five minutes and did a playback through headphones. It captured the sound perfectly, no strange echoes, nothing. Wow. That was simple.If you order one of these, you'll want to order a couple of 2GB or 4GB memory cards also.

I immediately went online and found it was him. I listened to a couple of samples and took a chance on him, and WOW! I love his voice. When he sings, I find myself nodding my head saying, \\"Sing boy!\\" One can tell if the artist trully feels what their singing. And I really admire that about him. He draws you into his story.

Right away I got pulled into the main character's (Charlotte) life and a certain mood came over me. First of all, I am very much like Charlotte and I feel for her. But this book also is adventuresome - even though they stay in one town - and the friendships that gradually occur are remarkably written. Also, the setting is perfect - a small tourist town in Massachusats. I urge everyone to go to their library to find this book. Most of you won't regret it!

As far as I'm concerned, Hobb writes better than Tad Williams or Robert Jordan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding","review":"Fitz' story is magnificent. I have not yet finished the trilogy, but so far it is superb. My only disappointment is that Fitz simply gave up on everything at the end of the book--I would have thought he had more strength than that. And I also didn't like how he was willing to risk so much for his wolf when Burrich was trusting him as a friend. But the story itself is wonderful. A must-read. Fitz is a man, not a god, and certainly not the smartest man alive, and that's what makes the book fabulous."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's nice to read a book when the Good guys suffer sometime!","review":"Ms Hobbs continues to amaze me with were she's going with Fitz and this tale. I'm committed now to see this out to the end in the \\"Asses Quest\\" book 3. Without Burrich, Chade, or the Fool, Young Fitz would no doubt be truly dead long by now. He has so much potential but can be pretty stupid at times (many times). Makes for an unlikely hero which is o.k. by me. Royal Ass is an excellent follow-up to Ass apprentice. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good plot, not so great story or writing","review":"I loved the plot. The concept is excellent, the writing is okay, but the story, in particular the character interaction, leaves much to be desired. I finished it because I wanted to know what happened to the characters, so obviously there's some worth to it.

In assasins apprentice Fitz is trained in the arts of the assasin, and is also involed in the inner fight betweem the two princes. I assumed that in this book, Fitz would get a quest, to kill someone important or something like that. But the book is really only about politics at the court. Fitz does do some assasination, but these are only told of briefly. All in all a boring book that is not worth reading, you will only get irritated at the extremly slow pace and boring plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent epic tale","review":"A fast-paced story which nevertheless plumbs the depths of the sub-plots, with excitement and surprises in every turn of the tale. The author writes for intelligent readers, neither giving too much away when describing characters and situations, nor putting in unnecessary explanations of motive--yet still weaves a rich tale full of emotion and adventure, giving life to the characters and depth to the kingdoms they inhabit. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good writer, story could be better","review":"Without a doubt, Robin Hobb is a great writer. She made me feel the events and emotions that were portrayed in this book. I couldn't put it down, and yet I was not happy with the way the story was going. I think it takes a great writer to do that. The ending depressed me, but it certainly left me wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first book (not that the first was bad!)","review":"I enjoyed this second book much more than the first in the series. The world that Hobb has created really gained a lot of depth in this book. The characters have really taken off and he's given them great development. Just in case you didn't grasp this from the other 40 reviews, this is quite the book and comes highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"*Not* Your Typical Read","review":"There are few books which capturedmy admiration and respect as much as this,along with it's sequel, _Assassin's Apprentice_.The reason I like the series so much is the way in which it plays with the reader's notion of \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\". Hobb shows the reader a shade of grey. The main character is an assassin, a character who is generally portrayed as evil, yet Fitz's struggle to turn his talents to good makes the reader both love and respect him. The reader is also made to feel his torment when forced to choose between his sworn duty to the King and Prince he loves, and the woman he adores. I would sincerely recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful writer, enjoyable read","review":"I'm no literary critic but I know what I like and I like Robin Hobb's writing style enough that I've read six books.

At least one might hope that the main character would stop wallowing in self pity and actually DO SOMETHING. Instead the author maintains her interest in having her protagonist be railroaded by contrived circumstances and then complain about them for over six hundred pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious","review":"Although a competetantly written, the story lacks tension and drive besides the gray tedium of portending doom.

So much so, perhaps my expectations were too high for the 2nd... regardless, I have tried to finish it several times but have been unsuccessful. I keep putting it down.

On the recommendation of a respected work colleague I have been reading George Martin and now Robin Hobb. I am really enjoying this trilogy - I'm half way through the second book.

She paints this world with such realism that you easily slip into the pages and inhabit her creation.If fantasy is your bag then you will enjoy this writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"It keeps you on your toes and you cannot predict the future for the characters.

And i guess thats just up to you ehh?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Assassin's Apprentice.","review":"Robin Hobb takes myriad characters and plot lines and blends them coherently, seamlessly, together. Even those plots that could easily have been nothing more than another literary cliche seem to be seen here for only the first time. The stories of the ailing king, and the evil, youngest, too ambitious son are good examples of this. She also has a wonderful way of making Fitz trials, failures and his few victories completely believable. At the opening of the first novel I didn't care for her first person narration, but it's very well done throughout. I can't wait to pick up Assassin's Quest."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book could have been 100 pages shorter.","review":"I rarely say a book I am getting enjoyment out of should be shorter, but that is most certainly the case with this one.The first thing that should have been left out is about 60 pages of self loathing and uncertainty. In this book, the main character is hardly an assassin, which makes the title misleading in the extreme. He is more of a professional whiner, which begins to grate on you.But other people have mentioned that in their reviews, the one thing I haven't seen voiced is that the other 40 or so pages that could have been left out were the love story. Molly, the love interest of the main character, has no redeeming qualities at all. She is the least appealing love interest I have ever come across. She is paranoid, rude, surly, illogical and totally unreasonable. It's not a crime to write an unappealing love interest, but it seems evident that we are supposed to feel bad for Fitz when he loses the girl. I just felt relief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn back now","review":"Book 1 of Farseer was full, complete, and plot driven. With each book beyond (and I've read all the Fitz books through the second series) there's more feminized men, irritating plot twists, pages beyond count of sopratic whining, and anticlimactic endings than anyone need bother with. The world is creative and the characters have some complexity but Fitz and his snivelling for pages and pages about old pieces of story are murderous. I found myself skimming frequently and honestly if I hadn't bought so many at once I'd have stopped at this book midway through. Hobb has talent but needs editing and some direction to keep her plot moving. Personally I hate protagonists that are stupid and/or whiners and Fitz becomes both. Enjoy the warm fuzzy from her first book and imagine it stands alone. Nothing more to see here... move along."},{"rating":"2","title":"captivating, well written, interesting plot, ie.a great book","review":"This book is definitely the greatest book within the Farseer Trilogy - the first was too short, and the third became a bit far-fetched and strange at the end. This book really is brilliant and it DOES keep you turning the pages - you find yourself really sympathising with Fitz and every thing he suffers you suffer too - this may sound stupid, but it is true, and it is all too rare in writing these days. The first-person perspective makes the story-telling extremely personal, and especially at the end of this book and the beginning of the next is the use of first-person perspective brilliant. I cannot stress how great this book really is - it is an unbelievable read, and although not Shakespeare, it is certainly a lot of fun. Much deeper than Eddings and more captivating than Raymond E. Feist or Tolkien, get this book now."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst I've read","review":"The first book in the series was decent. Not good, but not bad enough that I stopped there. This book is something else. It really is one of the few worst books I've ever read.***Vague spoilers follow***Everyone in it is unbelievably and unfathomably stupid at all points of the story. They allow friends and family to be killed and the kingdom basically ruined because, well, what, they're supposed to do something about the villain they know to be evil and bent on killing them and who lives in their power?The plotting was so bad and the characters so stupid (as a necessity for the terrible plot to work), I was angry with the book by the time I was a third or so of the way though. Probably less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"Not really much words for this book. It was ok I guess, a bit slow at times, didn't really like the characters, wasn't all that interested in the story. That's just me though. A disappointing sequel to a promising book... oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up there with the best of fantasy","review":"To be honest, I can't remember where this book started or stopped. The series is so good throughout the three books I basically read it from beginning to end as one story. It's not very often an author can keep readers totally engaged for that long.Fitz matures but keeps learning lessons the hard way. We get to know his mentors better and see the story develope more. But you'd have to be crazy to stop all the way to the finish line. Hobb doesn't let up with gritty action sequences, surprises and the story's momentum.Hobb is now my third favorite fantasy author behind Tolkein and George RR Martin. If you like the latter, I think you'll love this series - and you can finish while you wait for Martin's fourth book to get published!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Id have to agree with evertone who gave this book 5 stars it was amazing and I really enjoyed this book.

For instance, I though Sister was the one who was raped and killed her infant but now I see it was really Sapphire."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's in their blood","review":"Sapphire's grave was shallow. Years after her demise, she comes back to visit Sister, her posterity, in the form of visions and feverish hallucinations. Reliving the torturous vignettes of Sapphire's life, Sister's own persona changes dramatically - from a passive wife to a strong daughter. The story continues with the daughters of Sapphire, spanning time frame of over 100 years. Never tiring, instead, hypnotizing, this journey through time is finely crafted through Gurley-Highgate's depiction of daughters and lovers. Almost melodious, her prose sings to the reader of the inheritance Sapphire leaves for her progeny.Sapphire's Grave was a book that buried me deep. I was entranced by the immortal legacy of a slave woman who passed gifts and burdens to her daughters, foreordaining them to her unrest.Reviewed by CandaceK"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry!","review":"I could not finish reading this book, just not my cup of tea.

In 10 minutes, with no tools...it was ready. The push mower works well for me on a weekly basis with ankle length grass. My 4 year old likes to mow our 20' by 100' foot yard and I do a quick clean up job when he's done. It's a 20 minute job at most. If you can push a shopping cart, this mower will work for you.A push mower slices the grass smoothly compared to chopping it violently with a regular(rotary)lawn mower or weed wacker. In time, this push mower will improve your lawn and save you a whole lot of money at the same time. There is no oil or gas, no power cords or batteries, no pollution and it keeps you active. It will always start, there is no motor. $70 push mower + $60 yearly service ($130) OR $200 gas mower + $60 yearly service + Gas $ ($275). I spent the money i saved on a wall mural, and i enjoy doing lawncare with my son, who is not allowed near a gas mower."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LoVe This Lawn Mower!!","review":"I had no idea that I would like this mower as much as I do.

Why do certain lures appeal to certain types of fish? How does the physical make-up of a type of fish affect its hunting strategy? Do fish learn to avoid lures and hooks?While this book tends to focus a little more on the behavior of bass vs. other species, it surveys most everything, and most behavior can then be related to fish of similar biologies. While it may not be a book that says 'fish here with this lure at this time', it is a book that will give the reader a better understanding of why the fish is doing what its doing.

At the very least I was hoping for a small amount of build up or a bit of creepiness. Both were lacking. The suspense and climax is thin in this movie.

I thought everything was far fetched. I can't imagine real people living like this. It certainly did not inspire my faith one iota. I read it for book club and most of the women in the group enjoyed the book, but felt the situations were all a little contrived. No other reviewer has mentioned the fact that the mother kills herself in the book. How can that make it a great book? Of course that part of the book was very realistic. I must be honest and say that I was very depressed after losing my mother very suddenly, so I read the book with a heavy heart. I loved Ms. Nichols book \\"At the Scent of Water\\" and have sent my copy to friends out of state. Therefore, I know she is a great writer. This one just didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"This book was amazing. It gives you hope and reminds you to have faith.

I was uncertain if I could cope with the life of the girl in the story. The author held my interest and I soon was involved with the other characters. Tied up nicely and neatly. Good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshingly different.","review":"I'm not a big romance reader. But this book caught my eye and something told me to give it a chance.I'm glad I did. It truly was a memorable story. The most striking part of it all to me was the starkly poignant way the author tackled the issue of human-reliance. She showed how dangerous it is to rely on a mere person for your happiness. People always fail people. We were made to love each other, not to hang on each other. No one is strong enough to carry both their issues and your issues on their shoulders, no matter how sure they may be of the otherwise.Yup... a pretty neat story... and a potentially life-saving lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great meaningful read","review":"Wonderfully written main character, while I am not overly religious, I still felt that the story help up on it's own merits. A very well written, story with great pacing. Also very emotional. If you were on the fence, like I was, about the religious aspects of the story I would say to give it a try anyway. It does not beat you over the head with it and for that I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic religion...","review":"Nichols does a great job of creating characters with realistic lives and views on religion. It's refreshing to read a Christian romance novel that has imperfect characters. Real life is imperfect and religion is a daily quest. Nichols draws you into the lives of her characters and lets you become a part of their world.In this story, Mary is running from the sins of her past and Alasdair is holding onto his. These two are brought together because of one little girl... Putting her foot in the door by being their nanny, Mary is drawn into the MacPherson family. Will Mary be able to help this family when she can't seem to help herself? Is their going to be any help for her once her past catches up to her?This is a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was ok","review":"The story starts out strong, The old lady praying, then moves to the drug ring and introduces the main character Bridie, but then they lost me. I had a hard time being hooked into this story. It switched view points, which generally like dual views, but it just jumbled this story for me. I did not particularly like the characters of the family- especially Alasdair. I felt like I was suppose to like him or feel bad for him, but I just didn't. A part of me liked Bridie and I really did like the relationship that was formed between her and the kids. But otherwise I was just uninterested. The story was predictable and I wasn't that excited to go back to reading it. There is good symbolism in the story and I felt that it was building up to something great at the end, that simply never came. Good potential, but it never came.I received this book free from Bethany House Publishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not falling for it'","review":"There is no way I could get through this book , the first 3 chapters including the prologue skip around like someone with poison ivy. Generally it's easier to start the story with the main character then bring in other characters to cross that story. I was just exhausted weighing through everything else to see where the characters would meet . Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grace","review":"I couldn't put this book down. I found myself caring deeply for each character and hoping only for the best for them. This book is about God's grace and love, and the freedom of forgiveness.

I so enjoy a book that I just can't put down, NOT A SPARROW was one of those books. Forgiveness, redemption, and a God of second chances fill these pages.

They didn't just set up and start wailing. Disc two contains some excellent songs (yes a little tuneful in places). I agree that the drummers are the strong point on this set. Bailey has never fully convinced me nad Metheny seems to be following a little too much, I would have liked to see his personality shine through like on SOng X or the better moments of Zero Tolerance. All of these guys have better material available but the variety and price of this set makes it worth picking up."},{"rating":"2","title":"insane","review":"this is definately not for everybody, probly for only like 5 people, but this is one of the coolest things i've ever heard. i usually like the \\"noise\\" albums, and am a fan of pretty much everything that bailey and metheny have done. bailey is just so out there, the only metheny album i have is bright size life, and hearing him do somethin like this is just incredible, bendian and wertico sound awesome, but bein a guitar player and not a drummer, i have no idea what i'm talkin about. i listen to this a lot, but unless u know what it is, i wouldn't recommend getting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Something Please Explain This To Me?","review":"The fact that I loved Stll Life (talking) explains why I had the misfortune of purchasing The Sign of Four.

Personally, I'm glad Mr. Metheny likes to experiment with his music... but he should warn those of us who have more sedate tastes what he is up to."},{"rating":"1","title":"An heroic endeavor","review":"When does 'atonal improvisation' become unpleasant noise? Buy these CDs and you'll be asking yourself this question; repeatedly.

Leaves you with the same feeling as a cartoon character who's had his head stuck in a metal garbage can whilst someone beat the outside with a baseball bat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible","review":"This is NOT the Pat Metheny we all know and love. This music(?) is pure screeching, as Pat would once in a blue moon do in concert. Pat and company are the best in jazz. Their 'usual' music is simply the best in the business. Stick to the Letter from Home, First Circle, Offramp, The Road to You, etc. CD's. Only buy this if you are doing so to complete your collection of Pat's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"disturbing and agitating","review":"I tried very hard to give these three albums a fair listen and all I can say is, see a doctor before listening to this one and be ready to dial 911 in case you pass out in sheer shock. On the other hand if you like listening to hours of continuous havoc than this is the album for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"People, People, People!!!!!!","review":"This 3-CD cacophonous collection makes me want to wring the neck of anyone who complained about some of Jaco Pastorius's bewildering musical forays onstage. Jaco, at least, had clearly definable medical and mental problems that steered him in the directions he occasionally pursued. Folks, this is not an exciting new form of musical expression designed to enlighten us about the uncharted waters of musical directions yet to be explored and appreciated. Nor is it the catharsis of a tortured soul with the inability to control inner demons. It is ego gone wild as Mr. Metheny assumes his fan base will purchase and find fascination with anything he elects to offer in recorded form. This is not music? to slap on the headphones and soak in. It is neither appropriate in the background of a social occasion. But, for trashing a hotel room or fighting with your wife, this is the perfect soundtrack!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The emperor's new music","review":"The most interesting of the earlier reviews of these cds encouraged future listeners to NOT come to the music with a pre-conceived notion of what 'Metheny' music should be like. I assume then that the optimal listening situation would be one in which the listener doesn't know who is playing. Does this mean that if a group of junior high beginners made 3 cds of random playing that occasionally bordered on melody, they would recieve the same accolades? I doubt it. I contend that it is ONLY because Metheny and some other big names are on these recordings that anyone raves about them at all. This is yet another out-working of the post-modern version of the Empereror's new clothes. If you can't understand the music, you must be an uninitiated philistine, and not one of elite few who can properly interpret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"Don't confuse this CD with actual music. Sounds like several musicians warming up like they are getting ready to play something, but never do. Maybe I'm just not sophisticated enough to appreciate this CD, but I doubt it.

Sober, full of common sense and intelligence, the reader instantly takes a liking for the main character and narrator of this historical novel by Robert Graves, author of well-known novels like \\"I, Claudius\\" and \\"Claudius the God\\". Our likeable sergeant tells the story of his fascinating adventures during the first stages of the American uprising, giving the fresh perspective of an common Englishman to these events. Graves is a master in capturing the reader's attention and interest and this is one of those books that makes for the pure reading fun every reader is always looking for.Remco Groeneveld"},{"rating":"2","title":"Geir Jennsen's first album for R&S label, Apollo","review":"Mixing ambient textures with driving beats, techno rhythms and swirling atmospherics, Jennsen creates a beautiful album. This is the early part of his career before he decided to dispense with the beats and concentrate on total ambient music. If you're unsure of buying a completely ambient album then get this first, but trust me all of his albums, beats or not, are brilliant.Deleted in many countries, get it now while you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"He knows the moon. He knows the stars. He knows the Milky Way.\\"","review":"Geir Jenssen's debut album under his critically acclaimed Biosphere alias has managed to always strike a different chord when it comes to ambient. Whilst the later works of Substrata and afterwards have managed to utilize a more minimalist, ambient schematic, Microgravity has managed to be relatively upbeat and submersed in darkness.Every track is phenomenal on its own, and whilst the beginning track \\"Microgravity\\" is far more laid back than what would follow, it only prepares for what is to come, utilizing atmospheric loops layered properly to set its dreamlike nature. While the tempo may be a bit more upbeat, by no means does it distract the dark, overwhelming atmosphere provided throughout this album.This is a completely entrancing experience that must be witnessed and can never be duplicated."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Lampoons Goliath","review":"I found this book delightful as David Dvorkin lampoons just about everything Holmesian or Sherlockian as well as a smattering of Victorian, modern, post-modern and yes even future and extra-planetary sensibilities. I laughed my way through the first 50 pages and then got interested in the story line. This is a reminiscence so I do not understand the complaints about slowness. David does a superb job of capturing the anomie of perpetual existence over a period of 200+ years. He also does some mind bending and numbing conceptual gymnastics. \\"Time For Sherlock Holmes\\" has a rollicking good ending too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fabulous Sci-Fi Romp","review":"Time for Sherlock Holmes places the unforgettable characters of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in a science fiction time travel adventure in the tradition of H.G.

It will alter the taste of your tea which may or may not be a bad thing according to you own personal preference. I was looking for an alternative to Teavana's rock sugar and this one is not it. We do enjoy it with some teas but stick to the rock sugar for others. Overall a great supplement in my tea cabinet."},{"rating":"1","title":"HE'S THAWING FAST","review":"Miles is frozen and brought back to life 10 years later. He is cold and heartless. His own dog barks at him. Why? Because dogs are known to be \\"soul detectors.\\" They can sniff out if a person has a soul or not. Apparently when you die and come back, your soul opts not to make the return trip. Having been frozen and thawed many times (first time was by accident) I can tell you that is not the case, although it is not good for the arthritis.For some reason people without souls are stereotyped into the category of people with souls who behave badly, i.e. Peeping Toms have no soul.The transfer quality of the film is very bad. Seriously, is this the best copy they had lying around? Even if it was a good copy, the film doesn't translate well into the 21st century. Pretty much a waste of time to watch it.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stuff is the stuff!","review":"I'm somewhat new to caulking but needed to weather-proof a 100 year old craftsman after our first winter in it proved a little on the chilly side.

I figure if it saves us even 5% on the utility bills we saw last year it will be well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for this one","review":"BE WARNED: First of all, I suggest you notice that this book is published by the author himself and not by any reputable publishing firm. Secondly, notice how all the other reviews of this book look eerily similar to each other and were all issued on the same day. I suspect the author of this book is trying to exaggerate its popularity by writing his own editorials and therefore bolster sales for his own publishing house. That being said...This book does cover a lot of very useful information but it only glosses over the material and has plenty of errors or omissions. It's too brief to be useful to a real professional or dedicated student and too technical for a beginner. It is most certainly not worth $20 for such a thin paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected it to be better...","review":"This was one of the hardest books for me to finish. The characters are not likable and I really did not care to find out what happened to any of them in the end. Some of the plots seemed thrown in and made little use of once they were presented.For a book that is supposed to bring \\"Sex and the City\\" and Jane Austen together, it did not even attempt to do it. I love both \\"SATC\\" and Jane Austen's writings but this book should not even be compared to either one.It is not the worst book I have ever read but I would not recommend this to other readers. If you want anything dealing with Jane Austen, stick to her books or try some of the other \\"inspired by Jane\\" novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched","review":"I don't mind sexy fluff. It can be great fun. The trouble is, this book is unsexy, unfunny and abysmally stupid.Invoking Jane Austen can be tricky because it obliges the author to at least take a stab at insight and wit. Santini's leaden novel features characters supposedly yearning for civility in the modern world.Unfortunately, the characters are uniformly vulgar, shallow, self-involved and stupider than a box of rocks. It took three horrible chapters before I realized Santini wasn't satirizing her vapid navel-gazers. Their sexual antics, designer angst and near incoherent blatherings (the 'heroine' is always \\"VEREE\\" something) are supposed to be taken at face value.I don't like panning books and am not a hardcore Austenite but this book is just plain bad, bad, bad for even a fun fluffy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful book","review":"With all due respect, I must differ from the excellent reviews given to this book on this site. To me, it is a badly written attempt to cash in on the current popularity of Jane Austen, with whom this book has almost nothing to do. Instead of characters, it features caricatures working their way through one of the silliest plots I have encountered. The narrator, supposedly a smart and talented film review writer, uses language that is alternately cutesy and lewd, and makes Bridget Jones, whose stories this book obviously imitates, seem like a genius. In all, I felt as if I were reading a comic book without pictures. Read the Bridget Jones books instead, or try The Jane Austen Book Club, which is a masterpiece in comparison to Sex and Sensibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vereee bad!!!!!!","review":"Ugh....I never write Amazon reviews, but this book truly deserves a bad one. I can't believe other ppl gave it such great reviews. The characters are shallow and moronic to say the very least, Lizzy being one of the worst characters in the piece, and unfortunately the protagonist. And I totally agree the use of \\"vereee\\" constantly got on my nerves, and so did all the brit slang used by these \\"Americans\\" (???). I did not like one character in this book! What a disappointment...I was looking fwd to a nice fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear, oh Dear!","review":"Sex and Sensibility: the adventures of a Jane Austen addict is a hilarious book with a soulful message.Sex is everywhere in Manhattan. It's a city where everyone cheats, and honesty is a handicap. What do you do, however, when you are honest, especially in the treacherous game of love? If you're Lizzie Parsons, heroine of Rosemarie Santini's hilarious new book, you use wit and common sense to confront, and to conquer.In her quest to become an \\"authentic\\" woman, Lizzie has many guides: how-to bestsellers, quirky friends, a feminist mother, and a sexually progressive grandmother. These guides, however, fail. Her relationship with her oh-so-British bad boy, Harry, continues to falter.Lizzie has to reach further back, to another century, where rules reigned. With help from Jane Austen, Lizzie finds that a true heart and a wicked tongue cut through the dishonesty of any time, any place. Honesty, with a lot of humor, is a strength.When you travel with Lizzie, you get a fun guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bjork - It's Oh So Quiet","review":"This CD is excellent.

It is great background music and is dynamic enough from track to track to keep the mood in motion. I love the \\"talking drums\\" tune as well as the more experimental creations. Ambient may be the overriding theme but this younger than new age compilation mantains diversity and energy throughout the chill-out vibe. I intially bought the album because it features my favorites DJ Spooky, DJ Olive, and Wisdom Tooth. The beauty of a compilation CD is the opportunity you are given to become familiar with more artists without investing in blind purchases.

However, in it's defense, it does give me a different selection of font sizeswhich are nice to change when 'editing' Christian literature and having to look up verses.

Other than that it deals with tuning in Drop D, power chords in Drop D, how to play open chords in Drop D, and how to drop the standard tuning down two steps to achieve a heavier sound.

It certainly was a drastic departure from the content and tone of her first book.Imagine, if you will, expecting a light hearted romp of southern foibles, and then reading, in order, about rape, suicide, and then the murder of hamsters in a grisly fashion.

Relatives of mine report significant weight loss; the jury is out with me. But to be able to eat some carbs in moderation would indeed be nice.

It doesn't ask you to starve yourself nor are you denied certain foods (and the ones we enjoy the most) for the rest of your life. It doesn't require additional excercise (though it helps). It changes your blood chemistry and since it is a cardiologist that developed the diet, it is heart healthy. Also, it does allow some carbs and unlike Atkins requires that you eat until full, but still in moderation. There are a lists of good foods and foods to avoid as well as meal plans and recipes for all three stages of the diet (stage one lasts only a couple of weeks; stage two until you reach your ideal weight; stage three after you reach your ideal weight). It looks good, but since I've just read the book, it is still to early to tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is \\"Atkins for Dummies\\"","review":"Believe me, it is a waste of your time and money.

Explanations on how to do certain steps (which are important to beginners) are missing in some recipes, a number of the recipes really don't work (as others have said and should be changed or eliminated), most need additional flavors/spice to be acceptable and fair portion are really good (Kudos)- suggest you only use as guideline and add herbs, spices and cooking styles accordingly.

While the plan seemed somewhat sensible, it really bothered me that this book never says anything about restrictions. For example, pregnant or nursing mothers are given no guidelines one way or the other. In the glycemic index chart, I'm supposed to believe that brown rice (whole grain) has a higher glycemic index than instant rice? Or that a PB sandwich is not healthy under any circumstances. The testimonials throughout the book were also a bit obsessive. Most of them were too scared of food to go off the phase 1 diet.

His point of view as a heart doctor who was just trying to save his patients lives, not to create a popular diet, was refreshing - even if he did overdo it a bit. Apparently, however, he has gotten over any qualms he might have had about being part of the \\"diet industry\\" - with the over $20 per month web site membership and the endorsements of new \\"South Beach\\" Kraft products. (Why would Agatston want to partner with the maker of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese Dinner and Kool-Aid? What's next - South Beach Twinkies?) My faith is somewhat undermined.

After a year, I still watch what I eat. Yes, I eat ice cream and all the fun things; but in a more healthier way. Do I ever go outside of what South Beach recommends; yes--but not daily. I don't think it is about imprisoning yourself but about knowledge and guidelines to a healthier eating style. I like it and it definitely has improved my eating style and my weight. The great thing is my weight hasn't increased. I highly recommend South Beach. Today, I use wisdom and incorporate the concept of South Beach into my food purchase AND WHAT I EAT.

Also, you cannot drink caffeine for the first 2 weeks and I'm a BIG coffee drinker. Switching to decaf wasn't that bad at first, but around the 3rd day or so, I started to get some pretty bad caffeine headaches. They don't really warn you about that. And not drinking ANY alcohol for 2 weeks? How realistic is that?! I'm no alcoholic, but at the end of a stressful day, I like to have a nice glass of wine.

And of course, sugar.Small drawback: In this economy, this is not the diet to go on if you are on a fixed income. My grocery bill doubled during Phase 1 weeks, from having to buy so many exotic vegetables (okay, so eggplants and artichokes were exotic to me...) nuts, olive oil and spices. The bonus is, that with the varied foods, you never really want to binge because the food TASTES great. You feel full, and you even get desserts each day.

Anyone can lose weight eating shrubbery and calorie-free genetic defect-inducing sugar - no book necessary. Do yourself a favor and avoid the freaky 10-calorie sugar-fee gelatin \\"snack\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"When all else fails, read something that makes sense!","review":"Due to age and health concerns my doctor recommended the South Beach Diet. I've tried them all, did fairly well with Atkins but after a time that too, passed! I bought this in both versions, one for my Kindle and then the \\"real\\" book. Easier to flip back and forth for references etc. This diet I can deal with and I see no problem with following the regimen. I quit smoking after 50+ years of it and did it cold turkey. If I can do that then I can follow this diet. It's the first one I've seen that doesn't promise you that you'll look like a Goddess after 2 weeks. You won't sleep the fat away, you won't \\"flush\\" it away, you won't have to wear a hazmat suit and eat what you want and still just sweat it away. Common sense. It will work."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Go To Cookbook and Diet Guide","review":"I bought this one to replace the first one I bought that I absolutely wore out in a few years time.

There is no way that I have the time to cook London Broil and Flank steak when I come in from work. If you are a person who does not arrive home until after nine at night then the diet will be hard for you to follow. Just thinking about when to prepare the foods is just so difficult. If the diet was something similar to Weight Watchers, then it would be easier. There is just too, much preparation and if you do not have time to prepare your food then this diet will not work. Please, don't even think about eating some of these dishes at the restaurant because it will cost you an arm, a leg, and a lung. The food sounds good, but it is not for a busy person."},{"rating":"1","title":"How About: Eating Less, and Working Out?","review":"Jeepers, America has become the land of fat people who buy tons of diet books.

I've tried many other diets, like the weight watchers diet and it was a real pain to keep having to record what I ate.

People noticed the change in just a couple weeks and I wasn't even overweight to begin with.This isn't an easy diet to start, the first week is absolute hell. You'll probably feel terrible. This requires a lot of discipline and will control for the first week or two. However, once you get past phase 1, maintaining a simple, healthy diet becomes effortless. You'll have 0 cravings and will actually find yourself turning down sweets and junk food in favor of fresh foods and vegetables. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A diet I can live with!","review":"At last, a diet that makes sense, is healthy, and is easy to follow.Yes, the diet is low in carbs, but, after the first 2 weeks, you add in fruit and high-fiber carbs. You don't go crazy on fatty foods, so this seems much more medically sound than the Atkins diet. I'm finding it very easy to be on the South Beach Diet, and it is extremely satisfying.There are also a number of excellent recipes in the book, but you don't have to cook to stay on the diet. It's not difficult to eat out on this diet at most types of restaurants.All I can say is that I love the book, and think I can stay on a program like this for the rest of my life. At least I hope so."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent life changing meal plan","review":"I bought this book knowing little about the diet. I wanted a guide to loose some weight but also learn to eat better. And I accomplished both! I lost 7 lbs in the first two weeks, the book says you will loose 8-13 lbs in the first two weeks. I followed the meal plans to the Tee. It's been 7 weeks and I've lost 14 lbs.I am still following the phase 2 plan which limits carbs and sugar and plan to continue for a while yet. The great thing about this diet is that you can eventually eat the foods you ate before in moderation and it will be OK. You can always go back to cutting them out completely for a while to get back on track. I never thought I could stay with it, but it really hasn't been hard. I hate to say it was easy, but it sort of has been. I eat a lot of veggies now that I never did before. And I like them! I hardly miss the potatoes and white bread!

Eating 5-6 times a day has kept me in the game. I used to white knuckle between meals and not any longer.

I have tried several diets and they never worked because you couldn't stay on them long plus I stayed hungry all the time. I counted calories and exercised for two years and only lost 20 pounds and then stopped losing for months. With this diet, I have lost 27 pounds in 6 weeks and am still losing. The best part is that I can see myself doing this the rest of my life. The first few days is a little hard but you get excited because you will be amazed at how little you get hungry. I ate three large meals a day plus two snacks. I definitely had plenty to eat. Best part is that although I occasionaly have dessert, I don't crave them!

In order to simplify the cooking, my husband agreed to participate, and he's very pleased too -- lost between 10 and 15 pounds but more importantly he's really lost his cravings for food between meals and after dinner.

Yes, you do need to plan your day but it's not a big deal. I truly like the no pressure of measuring at first - eat until you're satisfied - not stuffed so you're not stressing out about ounces.

(I didn't need the fee-based official site.) For example, the book lists food that is \\"banned\\" for phase 1, but then listed as an ingredient in some of the phase 1 recipies. Is it ok for me to use in my own recipies? Also, a large part of the book is the section with recipies, but these are from restaurants and are too much trouble for me to make when I just want to grab a snack.Bottom line -- good food plan, but the book isn't worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. White","review":"I started this diet more than a year ago and lost 30 pounds, went from a size 12 to a size 4/6.

I lost the cravings & blood sugar highs/lows. It is not a low carb diet, but a RIGHT CARB diet. You don't limit carbs and eat a bunch of fat and protein. You eat complex carbs with fiber, no processed carbs. You go by a list of foods for each phase, so it is easy. No counting. It simply teaches healthy eating habits that will be beneficial to your cardiovascular system and digestive system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it and used it with great results","review":"This book has changed my life.

I couldn't believe what Dr. Agatston wrote about not having cravings after the first two weeks, but that is very accurate.

I am enjoying the freedom from sugar addiction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Befuddled","review":"I felt limited in my food choice with this book. I know that you give up most all carbs for the first two weeks, however, I would have liked to have a glycemic index guideline that I could follow. This would have allowed me a greater range of foods that would still be \\"allowable\\" during Phase I. Also, I found a LOT of conflicting information. For example, you cannot have carrots during phase I, but at least one recipe in Phase I calls for carrots! Also, some of the portions are confusing. For example it lists 20 peanuts as a food to enjoy during Phase I. Does this mean limit yourself to no more than 20 peanuts a day, a meal or a week? I just feel a little more information on the diet itself is needed. The explanations of good carbs vs. bad carbs are good, but more time needs to be expended on the plan itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"When All Else Fails.....","review":"I've never been a big fan of \\"Diet Books\\" and have never really tried to follow a \\"diet book\\" plan but I give this one 2 thumbs up!

Those that crave carbs obviously don't get the program, it's about changing how you eat, what you eat and how you treat food. Carbs aren't out of the question; they just have to be eaten in moderation-and evil carbs such as white bread, white rice, and white potatoes should be avoided on a regular basis (basically, stay away from anything that's been milled so much it has the nutritional value of a boot). There are great whole grain options out there, as well as wonderful modifications to traditional recipes.

Yes, probably the first several pounds is water loss but it does the ego good. Stick with it and by the third and fourth week you really don't feel hungry and more often than not don't finish what is on your plate or what your allowed for the day. It gets very slow so it's imperative to keep looking at everything you put in your mouth and ask the question? Will this turn into sugar as soon as it gets in my mouth? This visual is very helpful!

It was a book called \\"Flip The Switch\\" by Jim Karas. I read an old article about him in Oprah's magazine (he helped her pal Gayle King lose like 20 pounds) and decided to give his program a try.

It just lets you have less saturated fat in the first week (Atkins switches to healthier fats as you move later into the program) and allows fruits and breads a little bit sooner.

Happy with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip all three phases","review":"I haven't started this program and I'm not sure I'm going to,but I had to see what all the fuss was about, so I bought it.The first problem I have with this is that you have to read 110 pages before you get to the Phase One menu plan and while I like the conversational tone of the book, I didn't appreciate having to search for the plan itself. The other thing that puzzles me is all the eggs he has you eating; I thought the most a person should eat was maybe two or three a week, and spinach for breakfast?! under an egg? YUK! and VEGETABLE juice?! I don't know about most people, but I get up at 6am and eggs and vegetable juice that early turns my stomach.if you want to lose weight, eat less and exercise more..like mom might've said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but mostly water loss","review":"I am trying this diet. You might lose a few pounds at first due to dehydration and water loss. Side effects I experienced were: headaches, nausea and then constipation and heartburn. I subscribed to the web site hoping I'd get more assistance, but it seems to be run by a bunch of low-paid children who don't ever answer peoples' questions. Promised features and updates just don't happen. You find the ever-helpful volunteers who do their best, but no other staff in sight to assist. I think Prevention.com is the best answer to get further information on your South Beach Diet. There is an extensive archive of Dr. Agatston's question and answer (more than his own wimpy web site!) and a large message board forum of experienced Beachers. Along with the book, I'd advise going there. Bottom line-- if you have trouble with carbs and they are the key to your weight gain, this is great for you. If you are just \\"Joe Blow Dieter\\" then you might be disappointed by slower weight loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This And Buy \\"Flip The Switch\\" Instead","review":"I just finished reading the South Beach Diet and trying the diet. I bought it because I believed that I could lose 8-13 pounds in 2 weeks.Well, my two weeks are up and I am down only 2 pounds. This clearly does not work.I told my sister that I was disappointed in my results. She told me that I was crazy and the I should read the book \\"Flip The Switch\\" by Jim Karas.

The problem is, it's not friendly for people who work 12 hours a day. All the meals need an oven.

If you follow this program or Dr. Atkins, you will undoubtly be successful at both weight loss and improved health. There's a lot more information in Atkins New Diet Revolution, but few reviewers actually read the newer books and always refer to the earliest version - this author does that, too.

This epitomises the fervour and feeling (sometimes I think naieve when put into the context of modern writing and recording - though not a bad thing) of the post punk era, NOT Britney Spears, thats for sure. Even though the Birthday Party's last releases (Mutiny in Heaven et al) and the following album (Junkyard) are, to me, better in their fullfilment as albums, Prayers On Fire is a baptism by fire - brave, gregarious and terrifying, but nonetheless thought provoking on where music can take you.

This was a band to see live and gave me greater appreciation of this recording. I think their finest work and gives insite to the later work of Nick Cave.

Whether from my boat or kayak, I am in the sun and on the water a lot. I also have skin problems and take medication that makes me sensitive to the sun. With big hats and sunscreen, I still manage to get too much exposure on my face. With the Buff and a hat, I can totally protect my face from the sun and do not have to use greasy sunscreens. Yes, I look silly but at least I wont have to waste good fishing days in the dermatologists office getting cancer dug out of my face. A few of the other reviews mentioned thier sunglasses fogging up. I have found that if I make sure the edge of the buff is tucked under the edge of the sunglasses, they will not fog. Putting the edge over the glasses allows a passage for you breath to flow up to them and cause the fogging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"I bought the Mossy Oak Duckblind pattern for one reason: to prevent sunburn on my neck/face without stinking up my hands with sunscreen. I use it in coastal South Carolina in 100*F weather and it stays cool. I use it during fishing and hunting (dove, duck, deer, turkey).It is a versatile facemask that doesn't restrict and is seamless (so no itching). It also doesn't fog up your glasses if you wear it right (make a fold right under your nose so your exhaled breath goes through the fabric, rather than saying inside it). Since I want to maintain the camouflage, I line-dry it after washing. Also, put it in a delicates bag when washing to avoid snags (bra clasps, zippers, velcro bibs, etc.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"UV Buff","review":"These are awesome!

The picture and my previous experience said this would be a very brown/tan colored item. It is actually more of a \\"Multicam Pixel\\" color. There is a lot more green, which is greener than any in the pictures, on this product. Basically, if you took the multicam colors, faded them and added a tan in there, then digitized that, this is what you get. It will not match any desert digital gear you have, which is what I bought it for.

These songs have been redecorated with the gracious elan that we have come to expect from this charismatic chanteuse. New installations of drum-and-bass textures, orchestral arrangements, trip-hop beats and hip-hop samples are overlaid on the songs from POST, building upon their subtle post-modern beauty.The Brodksy Quartet offers a modern-classical intepretation of \\"Hyperballad.\\" \\"You're Flirting Again\\" gains a lush orchestration. \\"Headphones,\\" by contrast, now features a sparse, tundra-like soundscape. The one new song, \\"My Spine,\\" features Bjork crooning over a primitive backdrop of mystical chimes and bells, creating an organic incantationthat sounds miles away from any territory that pop music has traversed thus far."},{"rating":"1","title":"From ho-hum to irritating","review":"Like some other disappointed reviewers, I'm a long time Bjork fan (since the Sugarcubes) but have a hard time listening to this album. The remixes vary in style from sparse ambient to frenetic dance. This in itself is irritating because it means the album has no flow or cohesion. But it's the remixes themselves that drive me nuts. Overworked and trying too hard to 'do something different' with perfectly good songs, they just end up mangling them for the most part. I think you'd have to be a fan of remixes, rather than a fan of Bjork's, to enjoy this album. The only redeeming feature is the inclusion of some songs not available on other albums, such as 'My Spine'. I'd advise you to listen to all the samples before making this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool","review":"Well I was introduced to her with this remix album (along with Homogenic) and at 1st I was like whoa what the hell is this? Bjork's music is the type that demands multiple listens for you to be in love with it. So I had to listen to this a few more times and I found that all of the songs are good to listen to (I have to be in the mood for certain ones). My fav tracks are Army of me, Hyperballad, Cover me, I miss you and that cute lil song My Spine. If your a Bjorkhead I think that you will love this album if your just starting out, maybe it's not the best intro to her music I would recommend Debut or Post, but it wouldn't hurt to give it a listen. After all it's a remix album, not one of her \\"full on\\" albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remix record? More like a new one!","review":"More often than not, record companies release remix record to milk consumers dry of whatever money they were prepared to fork out for their favorite artists. But Telegram is one remix CD you will pay and not be the least bit disappointed. Because the arrangements are vastly different from the original, it might have been mistaken for a new full-length album! Recommended tracks include the Broadsky Quartet remix of Hyperballad with luscious string arrangements and the Dobie Sunshine remix of I Miss You with the strong hip-hop flavor. Totally cool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A reconstruction of a deconstruction","review":"I'll be perfectly honest. Before getting this I was never a Bjork fan. Apart from Army of Me which I thought was great I wasn't sure what to think about her. And to any DJ who played It's Oh So Quiet just made me sick - that was a song that should never have been released but then it fitted with popular demand didn't itI came across this CD when in Germany and noticed in the booklet it said that she was very happy that the mixers used her songs as \\" ingredients \\" for their mixing desks. And I thought I might as well give it a go. I was hoping they would destroy her songs into pieces and make it completely unrecognizable from what it was. And I'm pretty sure that's what I got in some cases - so much so that it frightened me!Now I don't know whether this'll make me a diehard Bjork fan but I could happily enjoy this album for all it's worth and it's recommended to both fans and the interested parties"},{"rating":"2","title":"meets my expectations","review":"This shop manual provides the information required to perform repairs and skips maintenance information which is in the Operators manual.

Despite the flexibility with configuration that Thrustmaster provides, there is no way (that I've been able to find) to redefine the right stick to work with this game. Perhaps EA will make the '09 version compatible, because they have coordinated with Thrustmaster in the past. On the other hand, EA doesn't tend to fix software problems very quickly...

I need to treat my patient. And why would anyone want to fastforward the time in the game? It was hard for me to walk around in my house or whatever too.

This game is very repetitive. Basically, all you do is give flea baths or flu and worm meds. Some people even bring their pet to you complaining that it's ugly, and you have to dress them up in a bumblebee costume or a tux and top hat. Creating your own meal was an interesting addition, but also got old quickly. There are no relationships in the game. You can only leave your house/office to go to the park to interact with other people and their pets, which means nothing because, again, there are no relationships in this game. Also your day is done at 5pm when your vet office closes, so no leisure time after work. Fortunately, after being incredibly disappointed with Sims 2 for DS, I decided to rent this one before buying it, and I'm glad I did. I'll stick with the Sims on PC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring !

But then, I love caring for animals and making them better when they aren't well, also. True, it can be viewed as repetive by some, I admit that. Also true is that some view repetition as boring. But I get a kick out of the different animals and breeds, and moving up the success ladder as a vet. I make contests with myself over how large a bonus I can rack up and how quickly I can upgrade to a new home, new equipment. For me, this game is great. My daughter also enjoys playing it.But then, I can't stand regular Sims games with all the whining and childish behavior of the \\"people\\". So maybe that's the difference.The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because I wish you could add to the yard area of your home.

Unfortunately, I have found it to be extremely boring and repetitive. There's no sense of working towards a worthwhile goal in the game, the tasks are boring (curing pets of the flu, fleas, worms, dressing them in inane costumes). The creativity of the PC Sims game is completely missing (after you create your doctor and choose your pet). As another reviewer noted, cooking can be amusing. It's kind of like Cookin' Mama. Otherwise, it became so tedious that by the second day of owning the game, I stopped playing. The time passage is also problematic as you are forced to sleep when the clinic closes so there's no development of your sim or relationships.

Although it started fine the first or second time, it quickly became difficult to start, wouldn't come up to operating speed, and had no power. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT. Based on this experience I won't consider a Troy-Bilt product again. I'm going to have to replace this piece of (new) junk - but this time I'm going to go to my local lawn equipment dealer who also services the products that they sell.

According to my research they are disposable pieces of $#&!. I'm going to take the sawzall to it and trash it. The carb doesn't have adjustment so I guess they're meant to work one year and Troybilt doesn't care about reputation. Now I have to go to spend money on a new one if I want to do yard work.

One repairman informed me that it was not worth it for them to repair the unit and that it was just not a quality piece of machinery.

I've used it with the cultivator attachment and it proved to be quite powerful.For the Fall, I've followed the instruction for storage, let it runs dry . . .Took it out for the second season, started up, and it worked for five minutes before it died in the same fashion as the first one.Thought I might have done something wrong.

Of course it wasn't.So I contacted the parts agent (Troy Bilt does not sell part for their products, instead outsources to another company).

The plot lines are simple and unsurprising. Then to top it off you barely would know the setting was KW, there such a lack of sense of place. If James Lee Burke is a 10, Leslie is a 2.

However, if you like his older movies then you will probably like the way he writes the short stories. The plays were, I thought, much more clever. They were still silly (of course) but they had more continuity than the short stories.

The publishing company was handing out hundreds of books to whoever would take them.This book seriously has to be one of the worst novels I have ever read. It is just incredibly cheesy. For example, here are a few lines from a random spot in the book:\\"Dangerous.\\" Harvey made a wary face.\\"I've heard that.\\" Ransom's eyes sparkled with daring.\\"Except the North Crater.\\" Harvey gave him a testing look.Who would want to spend their time reading that crap?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really hated this story","review":"As stated above\\"Shapero unwisely uses the prologue of his debut novel to divulge the ending, so the remaining 300 pages do little more than track one man's tedious journey toward acid-induced madness.\\"Says it all for me. As I knew the end before i started, it was a real struggle to wade through this book. I suppose I was irritated by the main character, and his selfish drug taking and mis use of his girlfriend.I only perservered as I wanted to see how he got to his fate at the end/beginning.A book I was happy to release into the wild. I was glad to be rid of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book.","review":"This book started out ok but got old very fast. Shapero needs to hire an editor or stop writing. The scenes about acid got boring fast and so did his character Sam's antics where he dressed up like a goat. Shapero ruins his book by giving away the ending in the prologe. I got my copy for free, otherwise I would not have paid for this book and you should not either. I thought this book would get better as it went on but Shapero's characters were flat, not real, and I didn't care about any of them.

Regardless of how fast you read you will never be able to get that part of your life back, and you will hate yourself for the incredible waste of time. This is without a doubt the absolute worst book I have ever read. I'm embarrased that I finished it but I just kept thinking, \\"It's got to get better. There has to a point to this drivel.\\" But no. The book is just awful. The drug-addled main character is so self absorbed and unsympathetic that no one could relate to him. The writing is very choppy, written in short sentences. It just doesn't flow.The only good thing I can say about the experience is that I didn't spend any money on it.

Very confusing to a reader. It is hard to sympathise with the main character, who just seems crazy.Other reviewers have noted that copies of this book were also given away in other cities. Not necessarily a good sign for its prospects. Sounds closer to vanity printing, when you have this going on. Ideally, a book should spread by word of mouth about its value. Not by mass giveaways."},{"rating":"1","title":"wild animus","review":"i was given this book for free on the street as a promotion. i started the book with much interest and realized that it truely was one of the worst books i ever read. i left it at a coffee shop about half way through, i could not bear to read any more. do not waste your money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it's printed on","review":"This novel is filled with flowery language polluted with pseudo-psychobabble and redundant geological metaphors. It is a quasi-fictional delusion of grandeur dealing with a drug-dependent, over-educated schizophrenic who comes from a dysfunctional home. After being tear-gassed at a college riot, he finds the younger, less schizophrenic version of himself. The two flee to the Northwest, where their pathetic plight to achieve a primal enlightenment ends in a leap of false-faith. A perfect example of a bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever? Probably.","review":"Wild Animus is likely the worst book I have ever read. While the basic idea is good, and what drew me to read it in the first place, it gets lost under a lot of pseudo-intellectual nonsense blathered by the singularly unconvincing characters. Much of it is preachy drug-addled nonsense, and its treatment of the honorable practice of shamanism is deplorable. Lindy couldn't be more of a caricature if she tried.At best it's mildly interesting, and at worst it's overwritten, navel-gazing nostalgia for something that never happened. I'm honestly surprised a real publisher picked this thing up, instead forcing the author to publish it by vanity press, where it would be in good company with volumes of messages from angels and the memoirs of alien abductees.I wouldn't recommend it to a single soul, and the only reason I can see for purchasing it would be to prop up a wobbly table, though it might also be useful for lighting a fire at your next barbeque."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toilet Paper","review":"This is the worst book I have ever come across in my life. I received this book for free while leaving the state fair and my immediate response was, wow, it must be really horrible if they have to give it away. Now, I really don't consider myself as an ultra-intellectual but I can confidently say that this book is not well written, creative or groundbreaking in anyway. It seemed to me that this guy was a man with a lot of money or some kind of \\"in\\" and got this book published by mistake. My roommates and me actually use this book as bathroom entertainment and highlight passages that we find comical. So if you happen to come across this book, take it, by all means, but if you are going to read it, you might get more enjoyment out of it if you look at it as if it were meant to be comedic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-indulgent drug ramblings","review":"Needless to say I didn't care for this book one bit.

So much money and time spent on a book of no value... is this what the world is coming to?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond tedious","review":"Probably the first novel I've ever given up on...

The sad part is, it could have been better-a decent premise that just lagged on and on to a known conclusion (\\"Why won't he die already?!\\"). Same goes for the characters, unused potential. It has discouraged me from dropping Acid, though. I give it 1.5 stars, 2 maximum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wild Vomitus","review":"I was the unwitting beneficiary of one of this book's advance reading copies. Since reluctantly receiving my copy, I have noticed (with no small amazement) that \\"advance reading copies\\" continue to appear ... in at least four different cover designs. Excuse me, but I always thought the advance reading copies were a limited run to hand out to editors and retail houses to see if this is something that should go into print. Oh well, when you are your own publishing company, you can do what you like, I guess.Anyhow, now onto the bad news. The book stunk, and it took me two copies to find that out. I barfed way too many times on the first copy for the last 80 chapters to be readable.

His writing style is refreshing and flows well, he really drew me into his characters thoughts and feelings. Ransom is complicated and a bit idealistic, while Lindy seems just to play off the love and stand by him. Women who have read this say they don't like her very much, but I think that it keeps the focus on Ransom and his connection to nature, while remaining accurate to the time period, late 60s/early 70s. I would recommend this book for something new and interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a waste of time","review":"Once you realize the guy is suffering from drug induced schizophenia,and has a ever-reliable co-dependent girlfriend to assist him in his delusional death wish, his ultimate end is elementary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Somehow I managed to read this book from cover to cover.

Otherwise it's totally ridiculous. It made me think about all the losers I knew in the 60's and 70's. I wonder if this is more about Shapero's real life as he left college instead of just a story.

It never should have been published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Read This Book!","review":"Please note that before you read any more of this review that it does contain a spoiler this is done for a very good reason to save you the effort of reading this book all together. This book is about a man who gets high on drugs then he dresses like a Mountain Goat from head to foot (yes I said Mountain Goat) and goes into the wilderness where he gets eaten by a pack of wolves. From what I can tell the author of this book was trying to portray the power of the wilderness but it was lost in the stupor of a dug induced banter that made no sense at all. Please do not read this book do not recommend it to friends and if you happen upon it walk away quickly so that you are not tempted to even pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wildly Bad","review":"For a book that seemingly was meant to be something moving and thought-provokingI found it quite dull and dry.If you were to take The Room and instead make it a story about an LSD-addicted man who thinks he's a ram and have it take place in the frigid realm of the arctics then you would have Wild Animus. However, unlike The Room that is \\"so bad it's good\\", this book has nothing to reach that status of \\"bad\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the Mark","review":"This book wants to be about man's search for God, or God's search for man. Shapero writes lyrically, with unrepentant paganism, of the natural world and of the god who permeates it, but he never reconciles the two faces of animus - the spirit which brings life, and deep-seated resentment and hostility.His protagonist is either the first Messiah of the New Millenium, or a brain-burned Berkely dropout whose self-centered journey toward shamanism ends up destroying not only himself but all those who love him and trust him and believe in him. I tend to lean toward the latter. Bob Dylan told us a long time ago - a saviour's a nuisance to live with at home.Sam becomes Ransom - and a ransom is something you pay, something you surrender, to redeem that which is precious to you. Sam becomes Ransom - a ransom, *the* ransom -- but what does he redeem? Shapero never manages to make that clear -- and that's the failure of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"Truly unreadable, sprawling, rambling garbage. Once the first italicized paragraph hits, the reader is in for it. Like everyone else in America, I got this book for free on a street corner. What the author tries to do is admirable, but Wild Animus is just choked with god-awful metaphors and flowery prose poetry. If you can wade through them, maybe you'll find a story worth reading, but I'm not sure the chore was worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"i had to open the car window; it stunk so bad!!","review":"Luckily I received a copy for free during the Art on the Green festival. Author Shapero should invest in psychotherapy or at the very least a dictionary. He seems to be permanently lost in metaphorville. His strange mixture of opposing adjectives and adverbs has left me confuzzled (direct quote)! Mr. Shapero's prose would be better served in art critiques. In short, it was simply baa - aa - dd ram writing! You really do get what you paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Free book\\" does not equal \\"good book\\"","review":"The fact that this book was published (and given out for free all over the US - I got mine in Boulder) is an insult to talented writers everywhere who are not published.

The one star is simple there because I could not go any lower or leave it blank. The characters are annoying and pathetic; the story line weird and sad, but not in a cool way. I got this book for free (that should have told me something)and have yet to see a \\"good\\" review. To paraphrase GK Chesterton, \\"a good book reveils the truth about the character, a bad one reveils the truth about the author.\\" Dear Mr. Shapero, I think the truth is that you were not meant to be a writer. But to end on a positive, the description of the Dahl sheep was accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"Like everyone other review, I agree this book is awful. It was sitting on my bookshelf for 2 years before I read it. It was free and I had read all the other books I own. II managed to finish it, and when I was done, I threw it at the wall.

I seldom have trouble finishing books, even when I don't like them, but this one was tough. Clearly the author is trying to convey his vision of enlightenment, but his vision is so bizarre and the writting so stilted that I find it simply impossible to grasp the author's message or sympathize with his characters. The drug induced \\"vision\\" sequences are especially difficult to read, and they drag the entire narrative to a crawl. I wish I could find something good to say about this book, as I'm sympathetic to the struggles of a new author, but I simply can't find anything I liked about this book.This review is based on a pre-publication Advanced Reading Copy (ARC) of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"an insult to the mind and earth","review":"Stopped reading after less than 100 pages; agree w/other reviewers that I have never before read such trash, let alone such self-indulgent trash. The author should be required to purchase carbon credits to replenish the earth after having actually felled trees and used water to produce paper on which to print such garbage. The next best thing would be to compost it! I wanted to give it 0 stars, but you have to award at least one to be able to post a review. This author should not be allowed to so totally waste any resources, regardless of whether he's using his own, on such efforts, ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross","review":"I, like many others, received this book for free.

Amateurishly written, the money spent in pushing this book and all the other add-on items that go along with it would have been better spent providing textbooks to Afghani schoolchildren, or even little Nellie down the street.You know how they say about books \\"I couldn't put it down?\\" Well, after about a dozen pages of this drivel, I definitely HAD to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"It can't be denied: This book is terrible!","review":"Like everyone else, I got this book for free and I regret accepting it. This trash is so wordy that it is impossible to read. There are rediculous metaphores, bland dialogue, and bombastic description galor. It seems like Shapero tried to show off his vocabulary, but that ended up exacerbating the problem because now you'll need college text-books to understand some of the stuff they're talking about. How awful. I really tried to get through it. Really, I did! But I just couldn't get any farther than chapter 7 (There really is no point in reading this book because the story is ruined on the first two pages!!!!!). Rich Shapero must be quite the fool.If you want to have anything to do with this book, I suggest reading the amazon.com reviews.

I would honestly like to speak to Mr. Shapero about his infantile views on truth and consequence. If you read the liner notes about the author, the book seems to be a bit of an autobiography.The main character, \\"Ransom,\\" is an emotional infant. His complete disconnection from reality causes him to treat others with complete disregard, searching only to fulfill some drug-induced vision. He forces his girlfriend, Lindy, to work as a waitress so that he doesn't have to work, becoming abrasive when she questions him.Part of me wonders why there were other characters in the book to begin with. They do not have personalities, and are not even foils to the main character. I think this book began as a promising tale, but just regressed into the absurd. Perhaps the author could use a better editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is terrible.","review":"I receiving a copy of this book for free, luckily, otherwise I would feel I had wasted my money.This book follows a young man in his early 20s, Sam Altman, in his quest to find his place in the world. He becomes obsessed with becoming a ram (Dall's Sheep, not your typical barnyard variety) and drags his overly devoted girlfriend, Lindy, about the country in his pursuit of his dream.The main character, Sam, comes across as being psychotic rather than a man who follows his beliefs to find himself, which is what seems like the author was attempting to do. He is not particularly likable, and becomes less so as the novel progresses. The excerpts from the novel he's writing are dry and sometimes religiously fanatical.There is nothing redeeming about this book. Save your money and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish they had something less than 1 star as an option","review":"Horrible. They were handing this book out for free on street corners in Chicago a couple of summers ago. I paid too much. I actually warned other people from accepting the free book. The energy expended to carry it was too high of a price. I tried to be open minded and give the book a chance. I made it about half way through and I could not force myself to read more than a single page at a sitting.Here are the basics of the book. Some guy does a lot, and I mean a lot of acid.

As bad as it was, at least the characters could have taken peyote or mushrooms, something besides acid! I think the author (probably not his real name) is a corporate executive (from a business you would probably recognize) who thinks this is the way people act when they take acid, obviously clueless to what really happens. It's probably propaganda to make people think that if they take chemically-made mind-altering drugs, they will want to do really stupid stuff.

When I was done I have never been so angry to have read a book to the end! But having read many of the reviews, I pose the question, is the author a narcissist? He was clearly very full of himself and I think he needs medications. I would recommend avoiding this book, but I have to wonder if maybe his intent was to provoke us. That is the only justification I can make of this insane story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, terrible execution","review":"All in all, the plot in this story was interesting--a quest to find the inner self that ends in self-destruction in Alaska... It could have been made good, except that it was so BAD!Shapero's writing style reminds me of a horrible dime-store romance novel, in which he tells us rather than shows us, and leaves nothing up to us to debate about. His characters are cheesey and unrealistic, and his main female character is inconsistent and offensive to women. I did not read the prologue (I guess I didn't see it), so the ending wasn't completely ruined for me, but I went back and read it after I finished, and it would have been much better as an epilogue.Truly bad bad writing. Although I think I will have to read it again... One reviewer suggested reading it imagining Sam/Ransom as Will Ferrell... that cracks me up...Overall, this book wasn't worth the nothing I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree - the worst book ever","review":"Sam/Ransom is a Berkeley grad with acid-fueled delusions of grandeur which he acts out by dressing up as a ram, screwing his girlfriend (\\"as they do\\"), and galavanting around mountain slopes in Alaska, until he does us all a favor by throwing himself into an active volcano. Parts of it reminded me of a movie about the dance Nijinsky that I saw 25 years ago. In one memorable scene, Nijinsky dances in costume as the faun and masturbates on stage.I read this because someone mistakenly gave this to my 9 1/2 year old son, thinking it was a novel about nature, and we were all largely stuck inside for a week of -10 degree weather in Western Minnesota."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Krakauer's \\"Into the Wild\\" Instead!","review":"I received this book for free. I read the whole book, and hated almost every minute of it. The plot idea is great, but Shapero drops it with unbelievable dialogue and impossibly bad poetry. There are so many good images in this book and idea of taking a mythopoetic journey into the spiritual world is fabulous, but it just doesn't come together. Shapero should hire a good editor to help him turn it into a publishable novel.I recommend Into the Wild by Jon Krakauer instead. It also treats the story of a young man who takes a solo journey into Alaska. This is a tragic true story. Please note that I am not normally a fan of non-fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it's written on...","review":"Like many others here, I got this book for free when I found it in a men's room.

Like many of the reviewers, I also got it for free... which is interesting since on the back it says: \\"All proceeds from the sale of this book will be dedicated to the conservation of strategic wilderness lands in Alaska.\\" Since they apparently gave out thousands of copies and nobody has liked it, and anyone else that has heard of it somehow and considered buying it will be put off by these reviews, I doubt the fundraising will get very far.All I can say is don't waste your money, not even the penny it's for sale for in the Used section. Bad writing, bad story telling (who gives away the ending in the prologue??), bad characters...just BAD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"I couldn't stand this book...

Only two of the reviews made sense to me: Gandalf's and explodingwhale2's. As a graduate student, I read non-fiction constantly and love it, but occasionally want to take a breather and just indulge my non-critical imagination. This book was one I felt especially compelling, this and Arthur Phillips \\"The Egyptologist.\\" Without passion, life isn't really interesting enough to put up with all the hassles. With passion, no obstacle, or delusion, however ridiculous to others, is insurmountable or without beauty and satisfaction. Curiosity killed the cat, but SATISFACTION brought it back. I'd say it is little more than sophomoric to insist on technical bravado or politically correct behavior all the time. That is truly passionless and probably accounts for the vitriol - acid better than bland nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful setting.","review":"Beautiful ring setting, but didn't like the stones, particularly the blue one.

They'd just vanish from the menu of scheduled recordings.A few weeks ago, it lost the titles of all of the shows that were stored on the hard disk. This should have been a hint.Last night, it corrupted its own hard disk while I was deleting programs and lost everything that was recorded on it.At least a VHS recorder can only destroy one tape at a time.On the other hand, when it works, it's really nice.

But this book does not even provide basic info and help!! It listed a lot of similar stories of people, without mentioning any scientific analysis and medical advice on any case. It just tells you how they find out they have POF--missing periods, then blood test lead to POF. 90% of the book described how depressed the victim become. It's a whining and depressive book. Another point is this book is out of date. It didn't include any recent research on finding and curing POF. It highly recommends HPT. But as we know, HRT becomes more and more controversial as the research develops.The book just repeats the same contents with different names with different ages.BTW, you only need to pay $10 at their website [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource of Stories","review":"The book shares stories of women with POF and it helps you feel like you are not the only one in the world who has this condition.

It did not meet any of those expectaions. It is merely poorly written notes written my women about their experiences with POF. None of the stories gave any real insight,information or hope.

Perfect for the home mechanic (as a matter of fact a friend of mine bought this after he borrowed mine) who is interested in how things work and not just how to replace it.Clearly written which is not a compliment I throw around lightly.

Bummer.Also, as it nears it's second year with us the motor makes strange noises and there is even a smell to go along with it if you leave it running for too long. Probably blow out my power on set ablaze if I did leave it on. It also leaks through to the base!

What a huge disappointment this is. First of all, I seriously doubt that this unit is 800 watts. This machine bogs down at the slightest resistance, such as bananas, and ice nearly stalls it. My little old machine crushed ice without a whimper and it was 350 watts. So don't believe the power claim. Also, the unit leaks. When you pour the contents of your blending into a glass, some of the contents come out thru the bottom ring.I consider this an expensive night lite for the kitchen.

After just a few uses, the blender failed and would not turn on. The manufacturer customer support is horrible.

They do not stand by their products; if they had, I would have accepted the replacement and assumed this failure was an exception.On a positive note, Amazon return was hassle-free, and they accepted responsibility and paid the return shipping.

The Bridge is a compelling story of a man in a coma. If the reader accepts this fact and understands that the guy telling the story is in the coma patient and in a land where the ramblings of his mind hold no bounds, then they will be able to enjoy it for what it is. This is not a conventional novel. It does not have a major plot and a big climatic ending. It is a wonderfully imaginative voyage of the human mind dealing with all its insane thoughts and wild inclinations. Expect sudden changes, chaotic dreams and be prepared to draw your own conclusions from the book. If you do this you will de fascinated by the unlimited imagination of Iain Bainks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Banks Builds a Bridge You Want to Travel On","review":"In this strong novel, Banks blends scenes of emotion with an almost \\"Brazil\\"-like world...The lead character is a man trapped in so many different ways, who takes you through an almost dream-state world that becomes more and more like a nightmare...except for the interesting lady who helps him through it. Shifts from one point of view to another in completely different existences are enjoyable, not confusing, and tie together wonderfully at the end.

I was forced to give up half way through (the first time I have ever given up a book) as the battle to try and comprehend the story was becoming extremely tiresome and unsatisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inventiveness is relative","review":"I'm an avid science fiction reader, which is how I came to read this non-science fictional book by Mr. Banks. Of course, since most of the action takes place in a highly unreal and allegorical world born of the mental difficulties experienced by the protagonist, it might easily be marketed as fantasy, if not science fiction.If you aren't used to the SF field, you may find the inventiveness here quite astounding. If you are familiar with SF, however, you may be looking for more than just inventiveness, and it is here that I think this book, like many others written by Banks and marketed in the regular fiction area fails miserably.I do in fact read non SF books, like those by Carver, Powers, and Pynchon, but the writing here does not measure up to these heavyweights, and as an SF book it is weak indeed.

Brilliant!","review":"I read this book when it came out a long time ago, after reading Wasp Factory. I couldn't wait. It is to this day the most involving and mind wrenching of love stories I've ever read. A mix of the brooding spaces of the English Patient, the never-quite-get-her-angst of John Le Carre, and the building adrenaline rush of early Robert Ludlum, oh, and add a big bucket of Italo Calvino, Philip K. Dick and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. I just can't think of anybody else that can twist it all together like Mr Banks. I can't look at the Forth Rail Bridge the same way again, it is now a big labyrinth built by Banks. This is a must buy book, if you like any of the above (well maybe not Ludlum...) go get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's one to keep you awake at night","review":"If you're mostly familiar with Banks' science fiction (the Culture novels, Feersum Endjinn, etc.), this novel will come as something of a surprise. It reads like science fiction -- sometimes. And sometimes a more mundane reality intrudes.It's the story of John Orr, rescued from the sea with no memory of who he is or where he comes from. He finds himself on the Bridge, a structure that apparently leads from nowhere to nowhere, and where everyone lives. It soon becomes apparent, however, that this fantastic reality is only part of the story.What is the dream, and what is the reality? What is memory, and what is imagined? As our protagonist searches his own dreams and memories for clues, the true quest emerges from the undercurrents. This is the major strength of every Banks novel I've ever read -- the reader makes her discoveries along with the protagonist. Even when you've figured out what's going on, Banks somehow manages to surprise you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Surreal!","review":"This was my introduction to Iain Banks and believe it or not I picked it up because I liked the cover. What greeted my inside, however, was much more brilliant. In retrospect (and its been two years or so since I read The Bridge), I have to credit Banks with my obsession for Scottish fiction.The Bridge is a unique work. Its very surreal and yet it remains compelling. It is simply hard not to read. As I've now learned after reading several of his other works, both science fiction and \\"regular\\" fiction, Banks likes to inject a moral lesson or two as well. The Bridge is no exception.Do yourself a favor and read The Bridge. Then buy all the Iain Banks you can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book had some real possibilities, but in the end it tied none of its loose ends together and the \\"real\\" story was very mundane.

This question immediately came to mind when I purchased this book. To my surprise, Joan Wink does not ever give a definition for this term, but instead uses real life stories and perspective from fellow teachers to give the reader a general feel for what critical pedagogy is. This in turn, allows the reader to develop their own meaning of what the relationship between teaching and learning means to them. This is a great book for beginning teachers. It provides a base of the fundamentals of teaching, strategies for providing children deep connections in learning, and three theories of teaching that any educator could easily pick up, all based on real life experiences. I highly recommended this book to any beginning teacher and anyone who wishes to define what teaching and learning means to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Critical Pedagogy","review":"Critical PedagogyWe all go into teaching in hopes that we make a profound impact on children's lives, right? This book provides insights to what actually takes place inside as well as outside of school walls. Pedagogy means an interaction between teaching and learning. Critical Pedagogy is to name, reflect, critically, and act it out in a way that is meaningful to you as well as to your students. The book discusses 3 big ideas of teaching and that each one has its own style or method.This book gave excellent examples of real life stories that are heartbreaking and you want to help each child that presents their problem. It was an easy book to read but had so much information that is given between these pages. It taught me the 3 big ideas and which way would be most beneficial for myself as well as my students.

Joan Wink's insight into the teaching world is informative to those of us going into the teaching profession. Dr. Wink's book followed along with many of the concepts that we were learning in our class.This is a textbook unlike any other. I was drawn in right from the very start. One of my favorite parts of the book is on the power of silence. This book should be a requirement for all teaching programs. I definitely recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Critical Pedagogy","review":"Joan Wink does an amazing job of describing what critical pedagogy means to her and other educators in this book. She manages to avoid defining the term itself, yet leaves the reader with a thorough understanding of what critical pedagogy is all about. The book was easy to read, as Dr. Wink wrote it in real-life context, which made every page very relatable.Many other books regarding education that I have read have been very intimidating and confusing. However, Dr. Wink writes this book in a way that allows the reader to see pedagogy in a softer, more realistic light. After having read this book, I feel as though I have a real understanding of what critical pedagogy means to me, and I know that this understanding will grow with my experiences in education, just as Dr. Wink has described. Overall, this is a fantastic, interesting read, and I would recommend it to anyone in education, and even to anyone who has children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Critical Pedagogy: Not as scary as it sounds.","review":"When first picking up Critical Pedagogy the reader may seem a little intimidated it was written by a professor and all. But this book is really nothing to stress about. Joan Wink is an intelligent writer that makes it her mission to intertwine experience with expertise. This type of writing make this book a very easy and enjoyable read for any person, want to be teacher or not.This book is full of techniques and hidden definitions to help a student or even a teacher understand the methods and reasoning behind teaching. Things that may seem simple to the untrained eyed, like popcorn, have hidden meanings that this reader wouldn't have known without diving into this book. The fact that Wink brings in her own experiences makes it easier for the reader to connect with the writing, to bring in their own experiences and to help bring understanding to the reading. Which seems to be one of the main points of Critical Pedagogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Critical Pedagogy: Notes from the Real World (3rd Edition)","review":"This is an amazing book! Joan Wink gets you to think and reflect on your own life experiences, while she in turn pours her own heart out on the line. As a future teacher, Wink's many examples really hit home for me. This book lets you know that what worked one year in a classroom may not work for the next year. Teachers may have to get rid of old teaching habits and relearn new strategies in order to allow for transformation in the classroom and in society.This is a great book for anyone who wants to go into the teaching profession."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wink's Review","review":"Critical Pedagogy is great book that is an easy read. Not only is it extremely relatable it is educational and eye opening. There are many things that I read that I realized I have experienced without even knowing it. The vocabulary is easy to follow as well as entertaining to read. She talks about real life experiences and things that she has learned and tried to unlearn along the way. I especially like Chapter 8 : Why in the World Does It Matter?, This chapter is useful for teachers, future teacher, or anyone that has kids or plans to have kids, basically everyone! It illustrates how important it is for teachers to care so that the students have the desire to care. This book creates many realistic ideas and perceptions that are incredibly useful! It is not like your typical college textbook that is rigid and boring... This book is relatable and easy to follow, you find yourself wanting to read more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Teachers need to learn too","review":"As an aspiring teacher, Critical Pedagogy: Notes from the Real World by Joan Wink gave me useful knowledge on how to make an affect on children and gave me a different perspective of myself as a teacher as well as a student. The book is written in a way where the reader is enaged in critical pedagogy and interacts with the text while \\"learning, relearning and unlearning\\" previous ideas.The aspect that impacted me the most is her emphasis on the learning process that teachers (not just students) go through. Through personal examples she stresses the things that both teachers and students can do by their conscientization and histories, rather than what they can't do. This gave me hope that when I step foot in my classroom I can affect the lives of my students, even if other teachers have written them off as failures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedagogical jargon","review":"Similar to the class this book was used for, \\"Critical Pedagogy\\" is full of pedagogical jargon. We are trying to teach students actual knowledge, not some far-fetched fantasy that only those in \\"higher education\\" will understand.How many times did Wink say that she cannot define \\"critical pedagogy\\"? Then why would she write a book about not being able to define it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for new and old teachers!","review":"The book Critical Pedagogy written by Joan Wink is a great book for future teachers to learn about the world of teaching. The book uses real life experiences to explain topics that relate to everyday teaching. First time teachers do not always realize that there are multiple ways of teaching students and that not all students can be taught in the same way. This book explains that there are many different paths that teachers can take to ensure that the students are all learning. The activities that are recommended in the book are great to incorporate in the classroom. Overall I loved the book. As a soon-to-be teacher I worry about if I am going to be enough for the students. The book allowed me to realize that in time I will. As long as I give it everything and try, I will be a successful teacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this was used in a university level class.","review":"I can't believe that this was used in a university level class.

It is boring and lifeless. What she covers in 8 chapters could easily have been covered in a well developed handout. I don't care for her repetitious writing nor her family experiences. It seems like a vain attempt to include her family in her writing instead of using real teachers in real classrooms (which she only does briefly). As I said, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unfortunate waste of time","review":"In an area of inquiry that desperately needs intelligent analysis, Wink engages in pedantic name-dropping and useless banter. Her research is questionable and her methodology is so powder-puff that it is nigh upon impossible to believe that her students take her any more seriously than we can as readers. This is abundantly obvious to me after five years of teaching. I was profoundly disappointed with this weak effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read for all teachers and future teachers","review":"Joan Wink wrote a book that is an interesting read that may change your view of the educational system and the students you teach. The book is an easy read because it is interesting and is full of personal experiences that help support what she discusses within the book. This book truly is about teaching all students and caring about each student as an individual. Wink doesn't force one perspective (her perspective) on the reader. Different philosophies are discussed and the reader can contemplate the information and learn based on the \\"Joan's real world experiences\\" as well as their own. This book is worth taking time to read and may change your view on education."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"As I was reading this book I really enjoyed all the real world examples. I have read a lot of textbooks in my career as a student and many just seem to ramble on about stuff. While reading this book if I wasn't totally sure about a concept it was usually explained within a mattter of paragraphs or a page later with a pratical example. I had read this book previously for one of my other classess and we were asked to discuss some of the principles from the book. I felt that based on the examples used in the book I was able to not only apply ideas but to then turn around and use my own examples. I feel without those examples and the way that that Dr.Wink explains them that many of the concepts would have been lost or not completely understood as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Student","review":"Dr. Wink is an amazing writer who relates critical pedagogy concepts to real world experiences. It is a fun read that gives the average student a break from the \\"normal\\" textbook. Through her teachings of how to handle real life situations all teachers will face in the future, Dr. Wink keeps the reader interested while teaching the reader at the same time. Critical Pedagogy educates teachers on how to handle life lessons they will face before they are actually face to face with the issue. It is a easy read that shows you how to apply what you have been taught in the credential program, reflect on your results, and improve for next time. All who are planning to be teachers or who already are teachers should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sky Is Falling","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I have read all of Sidney's books. I agree the main character was missing something. That is guts! Sidney's women characters are more empowered and not whimpy! From the start she was stupid and she did not catch on to any of the clues that was right in front of her. She did not get revenge which is not like Sidney characters. I felt like I had read this book before, it was very predictable. I hope Sidney's not loosing his touch. How many women do you think is going to let their boyfriend spend extensive time with their ex?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does fame allow you to get anything published?","review":"I have not read anything by Sidney Sheldon in a very long time.Maybe I have been fortunate for this was definitely a waste of time. Yes, much fiction is unrealistic but this can only be described as stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing","review":"I think this is one book you can't easily put it down (I didn't sleep till I finished it ) , the plot is tangled in a way you can never figure out the ending, which comes out beautifully and surprisingly, the settings are varied and exciting which adds more suspense and beauty to the events... the main character Dana has such a sensitive, curious, courageous spirit, personally I was touched with what she was doing to Kemal and her affection towards him ( maybe we could learn something or two from her 'human' feelings)..eventhough she easily trusted the new nanny and left her son for long periods of time.But I highly recommend it to everyone I know... you'll really have this feeling that the sky IS falling down..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sky is Falling","review":"As an ardent Sheldon fan, I pounced upon this book the moment is came out. And, woe is me, as I was incredibly disappointed! It took a mere 2 hours to read and I found the characters to be disjointed with far too many \\"sub-plots\\" along the way. I never really \\"cared\\" about one single character in this book. Characters that had minimal roles at the beginning of the story were brought in at the end to \\"neatly tie up the plot.\\" In the past, Sheldon has always managed unique plot twists that urge you to turn the pages rapidly, finish the book in one sitting and then sit back regretfully when you must close the cover. Not this time!! Has Sheldon lost the touch??? Avoid at all costs - and hope the next one is back to his old self."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sidney Seldom writes good books anymore","review":"To the people who gave this book one star, you were overly generous. I've always been intrigued by Sheldon's books but this one was obviously written by an impostor.The dialog was trite and ridiculous. We have a supposedly great anchorwoman who is known for her reporting skills flying all over the globe to share about 2 lines of conversation before going to the next city. She has no idea what she's looking for, does no investigative reporting and shows surprising naivete for someone so worldly. I found the whole book to be a big disappointment. Sorry Sid, your cookie cutter approach ain't cuttin' it no more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking","review":"This is a good book for sitting on the beach, a weekend alone, or any time you don't want to use any brain power......what so ever......yea....a good book for the brain dead. This little paperback uses such cheesy devices I think it might have been Sidney's first book, shockingly it isn't. Sidney Sheldon is a good writer, and I have nothing against mass production, BUT WHAT HAPPENED MAN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The author could not be Sidney Sheldon","review":"It is hard to believe that the author of the relentlessly suspenseful Rage of Angels and Bloodline could have written this book. I would not have finished it if I had not thought that it would get better. It didn't. The characters are poorly developed and unrealistic. The dialogue between the characters is sparse, trivial, and disjointed. It is as if the author used his cut and paste option on his word processor to put the dialogue together. There are several problems that make this book rate a one star. Die hard Sheldon fans that must read this book should borrow it from their public library or wait until the paperback comes out. Do not waste your money on the hardback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"Although this book has a somewhat interesting plot I feel the side stories weren't completely thought out. Mr. Sheldon could have made this a more interesting story than he did. Pick up one of his earlier works before this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Predictable","review":"Sidney Sheldon used to write good books. This one was too predictable and the smart TV newslady was in fact not. And I agree with one of the other reveiwers, people do not call everyone darling! If you want to read it, borrow it from a friend or the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"See Dick Throw the Ball to Spot","review":"The Dick & Jane books I first read in kindergarten were better written than this book. The dialog was exceedingly repetitious & unimaginative. The characters weren't developed. The book was a bore! Readers deserve the courtesy of an author putting forth some effort when writing. I definitely don't recommend wasting valuable time or money on this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, waste of time.","review":"I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. It was very unbelieveable. What, a news reporter playing detective, getting away from work, traveling all over the world, getting in to see high profile individuals and having them interested in her questions enough to take the time to talk with her about it. I don't think so. Written on a third grade reading level."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"What a disappointment from Sheldon. The children's story of Henny Penny is much more interesting and better written than this Sheldon novel. Boring! Could barely finish it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Least interesting Sheldon book I'd read so far","review":"I'd read about 7 of his works - Tell Me Your Dreams, Doomsday Conspiracy, Best Laid Plans, Master of the Game etc. - and this is without doubt, the least interesting among them all. A plain vanilla with a straightforward plot. What happened to the uniqueness? The story seemed so surreal and it just didn't 'connect' with me. Also, the twists and turns were lacking, and so is the storyline. The captivation I'd so anticipated just did not appear. Perhaps there had been too much hype built into this latest work. Would advice an avoid on this one. The word disappointing would sum my comments.But if you are a new reader, do listen to what some others had said and check out the older books - they truly are fascinating works. Sidney Sheldon is a great writer overall despite this not-up-to-the mark book. He's in his eighties now and that alone deserves much respect. I would say he's one of the best writers that'd lived the 20th century (and most of it too!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"If this book were written by a first time author it wouldn't have been published. Sydney Sheldon has too much talent for his editors to allow something as juvenile as this book to go to press. It's a major disappointment. The plot is telegraphed a mile out, the story itself is shallow, and there is no effort to develop the characters. This could have been the outline of an idea, but not a finished novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the next one","review":"This book has too many twists and turns. The book goes on and on, from country to country. Dana travels throughout the world, but the book never tells how she paid for it. Leaves her son and fiance to run after a killer that had absolutely nothing to do with her. I'm glad it's over!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I beg to differ . . .","review":"I beg to differ with the reviewer that described this work of fiction as being written on a third grade level - that is just plain mean-spirited. It was actually written on a fifth-grade level! I actually laughed aloud at the implausiblity of some of the situations - the one-dimensional characters, the coincidences and the fact that none of the other law enforcement agencies investigated any of the \\"accidents\\" incurred by the Winthrops is just ludicrous! And Dana's globetrotting at what must have been enormous expense when most of the questions could have been answered through a phone call. Earlier Sheldon works were so entertaining - he should probably hang it up if this is all he can manage at this stage in his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puh leez","review":"The review by Andrea says it best. The was one of the most far fetched adventures I've read in awhile. It always loses it's credibilty when our heroine jumps on plane after plane at a moment's notice and flies all over the world. Granted she was a war reporter, but give me a break don't these trips have to be planned? Also she must have kept a safe at the office or at home to leave town constantly and always have an endless supply of cash for shoddy hotels, taxis,etc. Why was she so surprised her Russian contact was silenced? she gave all the information over the phone that anyone could have monitored. What intrigue? I only paid [money] for this book and I am glad that's all, I'm just sorry I wasted my time reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid mistakes","review":"In standard form, the Police Chief (Wash, DC) is being pressured by politicians for action on a celebrity murder. His secretary tells him the Mayor is calling but he says he can't take the call because he is on the phone with the GOVERNOR. Of DC? Right! This is on page 46 and long before that the reader has discovered that logic and realistic basic information have NO place in this book. I read another 20 pages before tossing this one. A real dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"The Sky is Falling, the latest of Sidney Sheldon's books, is one of his worst. Sheldon found his formula for writing a best seller some books ago and...he's consistent. Sex, drama, wealth, power...and the shallowist of characters and most fantastic of motives. Then add some travel, an exotic place or two, and a heroine with enough money and a dearth of brainpower. Bingo! Another best seller.Don't fall for it. It's not a very good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sky fell","review":"Generally, a Sheldon novel has a good mix of drama and suspense. In \\"The Sky is Falling\\", it has neither. Also lacking is any depth of characters, there are many characters we hardly get to know. Sheldon has allowed some insight to Dana by printing her thoughts, and this adds depth to her. The plot is good, and really had the potential to make a captivating read, but unfortunately it failed. I kept reading thinking there would be a great ending to make up for the rest of the book, but that too, was ho-hum. All in all, disappointing to a Sheldon fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cool read","review":"I think this one was great, as most other Sheldon's books; one that I could not put down. As some of you may be aware, the main character, Dana Evans, has once appeared in previous Sheldon's work: The Best Laid Plans. I have to admit that this book is not my favourite from Sheldon, but you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"anonymous in Alabama","review":"I cannot believe Sidney Shelton wrote this book. I waited in anticipation for this book and was sorely disappointed. I think this is the worst book I have ever read by him."},{"rating":"1","title":"displeasure","review":"This book starts off fine with setting the plot and the story into the mmod, but as the story progresses, the all too perfect character who seems to be super-human with her intelligence learns some lessons in live. Then after the climax, he makes the story short, ands silly. He could have at least introducted more characters rather than generalizing everything in a few pages.He tries to keep the mystery unfolding, and right at the end, you figure that this is not a book to be in your collection. I have read all his books, but this caught me by surprise. I would have given 5 stars to most of his books, but this. no way."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sky Has Made a Crash Landing","review":"Oy... what to say... this book is by far not one of Sidney Sheldon's better productions. It is lame and entirely too predictable. I had to keep checking the cover to remind myself that this was written by Sidney Sheldon and not Mary Higgens Clark. Is this the same writer that penned Bloodline, Master of the Game and Rage of Angels? Uhm... in a word; no. I've been a fan of Sidney Sheldon's for years but this book is slow, tedious and as a side note to every writer over 50, people do not refer to each other as \\"darling\\", much less constantly!! Anyway, if you want to enjoy Sidney Sheldon at his best read one of the 3 aforementioned books, not this pedantic novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not his best!!","review":"Being a tried and true Sheldon fan I was terribly disappointed with this book. I am left wondering if he even wrote it. I thought the writing was very poor and the plot was very disjointed. Hopefully his next book will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHeldon is Losing It","review":"Sydney SHeldon is known as a GREAT storyteller and master plot twister. \\"The Sky Is Falling was a big disappointment for those who expect more from this author. The plot was sooooo predictable and rather trivial to boot. Wait for the paperback if you must satisfy your curiousity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turner","review":"As the other Sheldon's books, it's very easy to read. The facts run very fast and the chronology is perfect. I think The Best Laid Plans, where Dana Evans and Kemal first appear, is a little better than this one, but its a very good book with good story and characters. I recommend this book for those who like a good suspense thriller and for the Sidney Sheldon's style lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Sidney, what have you done??","review":"If you picked up \\"The Sky is Falling\\" because it was written by the famous Sidney Sheldon, you will be grossly disappointed in what you find between its covers. Like other reviews here it is: flat, tepid, and extremely predictable. It would not be so horrible if it were written by a first-time author but this is S. Sheldon, for Pete's sake, not a newcomer. The sad part about this read is that now I don't want to read another Sheldon book. I do realize that this is not fair to his ability. However, he set this piece of fluff in motion and William Morrow HarperCollins printed it. Where are the good editors when you need them? If an unknown author wrote this book, it would never have found a publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"it would be a waste of fire to burn this book...","review":"reads like it was written by an elementary schooler during recess and stereotypes every culture/character it tries to relate to the reader. insulting to the intelligence of its audience. possibly the most laughable piece of garbage ever put into hard cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"I finished this book and pretty much immediately forgot what it was about. Carboard characters and a lack of energy make this Sheldon novel one to pass on. Usually I read Sheldon on an airplane-- guaranteed to finish it before I land. And usually his stories are fun diversions. But his latest lacks his better touches-- a fast, twisty-curvy plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sky did fall","review":"I hope someone will set me straight. This is my first and may be my last sidney sheldon. I have heard many wonderful things about sheldon, but after reading \\"sky is falling\\" I will utter looking back. Who's who..is the downfall in this story.A paper and pen is needed to keep track of the very dull, bleed you dry characters I kept asking myself where's the glamour, where's the sex, the twists the turns?..As I reached quarter left of this book I realized I was outta luck. the story moves very fast. That Dale sure gets around!! Must be nice to have a job that lets you take that much time off!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"The story line may have been interesting, but the writing is horrible. The descriptions and the analogies are eye-rolling. The abridgement was halting and didn't make sense in some parts as if a vital part to the story was lost. But these are not the worst parts of this audiobook, it was the narration that was grossly inept and flat. It could not have been worse. Instead of sounding like a thriller, it sounded like a person on valium reading a bedtime story to a four-year old. A long cry from the Sidney Sheldon that I remembered"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"A well known anchorwoman turns into an international sleuth. It goes from the sublime to the ridiculous in it's super hero main character. It also goes past the improbable. Wasted space in her fiance's relationship with his ex-wife. It's so unbelievable it's almost laughable. The good thing is it's a very quick book to read....and forget"},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved this book!","review":"If by \\"loved\\" you mean \\"loathed\\" and if by \\"this book\\" you mean \\"this piece of garbage.\\" I would say the characterization comes off as flat, but that would be an insult to flat characterization. This book has NO characterization. None. Nada. Zilch. Zero. You don't give one rip about the characters or their lives. Ditto for the tepid plot. Ditto for the awkward, wooden dialogue. Ugh, it makes me hurt just thinking about it. I've read bad books before that nonetheless drew me in, affording the opportunity to at least suspend my disbelief even if the story still stunk in the end. The Sky Is Falling is not one of those novels. Buy this if you're a writer and need a primer on how NOT to craft your fiction. Otherwise, steer clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"She is hot on the trail","review":"We first meet Dana Evans, the feisty TV Anchorwoman in Sidney Sheldon's \\"The Best Laid Plan\\". In that book, Dana is on the trail of the President of the United States who might be guilty of murder. In \\"The Sky is Falling\\", Dana is racing the globe to find out who wiped out the entire Winthrop family. The digger she deeps, the more she is determined to prove that the fairy tale Winthrops were the target of a conspiracy.As with any Sidney Sheldon book, you get a lovely young women who is ready to take on the world. Most of his story lines are so unbelievable that you want to say \\"yeah right,,,\\" but that is the reason I buy his books. They are fast reads and no matter how many people are out to get the heroine, she is always one step ahead. Reading his books are akin to seeing an action suspense movie where almost 99% of the time you know the good guys will win."},{"rating":"1","title":"We want the ORIGINAL Sidney Sheldon back!","review":"There is absolutely no comparison to the earlier books that Sidney has authored. 'The Sky is Falling' leaves a lot to be desired and is nothing like 'Doomsday Conspiracy', 'Windmills of the Gods',... There is no thrill or suspense - everything is so obvious. Don't waste your money. Borrow it from your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read \\"If Tomorrow Comes\\" Instead....","review":"I have to agree with many others who have said that this is not one of Sidney Sheldon's best works. (Wish I had read the reviews first!) Disappointment is an understatement.The characters were superficial. The plot was boring. And, I guessed the ending right from the beginning. (Of course it wasn't that hard, since from the start Dana Evans thinks that the Winthrop's were murdered... and lo and behold, they were!)I'd recommend this book to someone stranded on a desert island with nothing else to read. I didn't even find it mildly entertaining. I only finished it because I am/was a Sidney Sheldon fan.It saddens me because he has written some good books in the past. This one just wasn't up to par."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheldon does it again!!!!!","review":"I have read everything Sidney Sheldon has written. I found this story to be interesting and provocative. A subject that is a bit different for Sheldon. Meeting old friends again ; Dana, Kemal and Jeff was fun. I could certainly see a spin-off of this plot, but in Sheldons style that would be far to predictable. The sky is falling wasn't my all time favorite, but a good can't put it down read. Thanks again Sidney Sheldon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupidly told fairy story","review":"Dana, the goody two shoes reporter is back in from \\"Best Laid Plans.\\" She's a goody-goody who adopts a boy with one arm and ends up in a relationship you could see from chapter 1.

These people are not interesting!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Master of Suspense does it again","review":"The Master of Suspense, Sidney Sheldon has done it again. I have read each of his novels at least five times and you would think I would be able to figure out where he is going with a plot. Wrong!! Every time he is able to hook me within the first two pages and keep me hooked throughout the entire novel. I read the book in two days and loved every minute of it. I highly reccomend this book and do not worry about being bored because it will not happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Great :o(","review":"i have only read three books by him. The others were terrific, but this one was just lacking something that is crucial to make it good. It was a page turner alright, but I was ready for it to end and still had half of the book to read.

If you have never read a book by this author I would skip this one and pick another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its Just Okay.","review":"This book is OKAY. I'm closer to 2.8 stars but not quite 3.

All in all its not bad if you are looking for a quick uncomplicated read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book although lacking in detail...","review":"As always, I loved reading Sidney Sheldons book. I have been hooked to his books since I was 15 years old. Mr.Sheldon writes great stories with lots of twists. 'The Sands of Time', 'Master of the Game'. Those were my favorites. 'The Sky is Falling' is a very good book and will hook the reader from start to finish, no doubt, however I just wish there was more detail to Dana Evans and other characters. However, its a great book and I hope Mr.Sheldon keeps on writing for a long time!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jennifer , Madison, Al.","review":"I am an avid book reader and a fan of Sidney Sheldon, but this has been the most difficult book to read.

His stlye of writing is unique to him alone. When I was reading, The Sky is Falling, I kept thinking that Mr. Sheldon must have had someone else write this book for him. The story is predictable and the characters are one dimensional. It almost reads as a diary for the character Dana Evans. I would definitly wait for the paperback!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I can't believe that Sidney Sheldon wrote this novel. I have read all of his novels, and enjoyed them, but I found myself skimming this one after I was only halfway done. The dialogue between the characters was lame and unbelievable.

It was too predictable and the story line flat. Usually he introduces and elaborates on more characters, whereas this book focuses on one main character who has a boyfriend with whom she communicates mainly via phone. (Why did she have that boyfriend anyway .. it was an unnecessary distraction in the book.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sky Is Falling","review":"This is unlike Sidney Sheldon's other novels. I found this flat and very predictable. A quick reading book, it left me with the feeling \\"is that all there is to it\\". I'm certainly glad this isn't the first Sidney Sheldon novel I've ever read or I may not have picked up any of his earlier novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total disappointment","review":"I used to be his fan, but this book really disappoints me. The plot has obvious holes and the only explanation I can find is that the author just wrote it, didn't bother to read it twice and published it. To give you an example in the book, the russia spy risked his life to show the American journalist the neclear secret and begged her to smugged him abroad. He was killed. But days later, his brother miraclously went to US and even bombed the bad guys out of the sky for revenge. Gee, why not asking his brother for help in the first place?Sheldon has other good books. Don't waste your money and time on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed with the pace of the book until it got about halfway through. What bothered me even more, as a tv journalist was the way Dana's bosses gave her carte blanche to go flitting around the world on the thin leads she had...and her half of a record-setting ratings newsteam! The other thing that bothered me was how she brought Kemal to the US from Sarajevo and seemed to ignore him until too late. I would think her \\"investigative skills\\" would've made her question why a usually hyperactive adolescent all of a sudden took afternoon naps! If Sidney thinks the reading public is this naive, maybe he should hang up his keyboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oversalted Broth","review":"Sheldon's latest serving comes up empty. His soupy tale is at best a broth, and way oversalted. It seems as if Mr. Sheldon kept trying to make his formula more interesting by adding more and more to it, but he left out the meat and potatoes. Don't waste 4 hours reading this if you are looking for anything substantial.The only reason I gave 1 star is because I was impressed with how he handled Rachel's relationship to Jeff.The lesson we should all learn from this book is heed the warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer Master of the Game","review":"As Master of the Game, Sidney Sheldon was unsurpassed as a fiction author - until now.

I must admit this is my first Sheldon novel. I'm a little disappointed in the brevity of his writing style. It reads somewhat like cliff notes. It is, no doubt, fast paced, but written in the summary style that it is, it would be hard to be slow paced. If you just want a fun read, and really quick, this is the book for you.Recommended...For younger readers and older readers who like thrills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheldon is falling!","review":"When we read the first work of an author and it is bad, we might throw away the book and simply forget about it. But when we read a bad book by an author whose work used to be good, we feel deeply offended and even angry. That is how I felt after I finished reading The Sky is falling. Does Mr. Sheldon think his readers are stupid? Superficiality is the bottom line of this book. Card board characters, banal events, a stupid heroin, catastrophic dialogues are a few of many negative points of this book. I read it to the end to see how worse it can get and in this one aspect, the book was a winner! It started bad, got worse and ended up to be the worst book I had ever read.Dear Mr. Sheldon, it is not the sky that is falling, it is YOU!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheldon is Slipping","review":"I'm not sure if it's age or what, but Sheldon is definitely slipping. I was appalled when I read this book. If it wasn't Sheldon who wrote it, it probably would've never got published. As the earlier reviewers said, the plot is thin and predictable. When I look back on my experience reading this book, I remember going through a series of disjointed paragraphs, as the scenarios are incredibly short. I've read all of Sheldon's books and have observed this gradual decline of the quality of his stories. Looks like it started with \\"Nothing Lasts Forever\\" and went downhill from there.

He would even wash them after using it while at school. Unfortunately, he recently lost the spoon so I'm buying another set. And since I now have a 2nd child, I'm getting her one too (different theme of course). Once I find out what a friend of mine is having, this will be added to her baby shower gift.

Frustrating.--SEVERAL leaps in logic: The book will (loosely) explain a concept. Then it will give an equation with no explanation as to how it was derived from the original concept. Sure, you can just memorize the equation, but without understanding WHY it works, it's awful hard to apply it to the real world. VERY frustrating.--Many concepts are glossed over.

He laughed and told me that I was doing the problems right but that the book was wrong and that he figured that about 8% of the answers in the book were just plain wrong. This is an awfully expensive book to be so riddled with errors. There is also the fact that this is the THIRD EDITION. Hello Harbin, you would think that after two tries he might get it right.

The coolest thing about it is that you can set the time, enter all appointments, holidays, anniversaries etc.... by using Outlook. There is an automatic import feature and reminder alarms. There are many features that I will never use. You can remove the unused features and customize the display order to suit your preferences.

The man knew how to get great sound from his guitar and was right up there with Clapton and Buddy Guy and Stevie. And his vocals were almost always filled with so much soul and feeling.The trouble with this album for me is consistency. Otis' guitar work is not up to his usual standard on this and his vocals are just ok, with some excessive screaming on \\"Every Day I Have the Blues\\" and \\"You're Gonna Need Me.\\" This was recorded live in the studio, and these all sound like 1st takes. Part of the problem is that the rhythm section and the keyboards are too loud. What ultimately does this in for me is poor production, lack of consistency on any one song, and certainly poor sound mixing and editing throughout.For better Rush albums, check out Right Place, Wrong Time, Ain't Enough Comin' In or his Cobra recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"This record should never have been released","review":"I agree totally with Scott Free's review. This is just a very bad session (Otis had to cancel his European tour imideately after) that should have remained in the can forever.

On this album he's largely off. There are some great moments, but on the whole, the bad moments ruin the performance. There are several times when Otis (or his back-up band) are so hopelessly off-key that you wonder how this ever made it to cd. For better OtisRush live, check out Tops.

It hit the garage sale the next time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Leapfrog...","review":"For some reason I thought that the train was motorized and would travel around the track but unfortunately, that is not the case. The child needs to push it by hand. While doing this, music will start to play and then some of the ABC buttons on the track will go off arbitrarily. It's rather confusing and not very rewarding. The track is not well designed as the child needs to lean over or sit on the track to reach the buttons. I bought this hoping to reinforce alphabet learning but this toy does not deliver. The only way to hear the letters is to press the buttons on the track but the stickers are not very interesting and so get ignored. It seems the most functional part of the toy is identifying the animals yet the animals are rather abstract looking. This toy is very disappointing and not very educational."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Designed","review":"My 17 month old received this toy as a Christmas gift.He was eager to play, but unfortunately, the toy is designed so that in order to play with the train station, the toddler must sit on and/or kick the train tracks. The toy's babble resulting from the toddler inadvertently activating the alphabet train track is annoying at best. At worst it prevents the toddler from realizing and enjoying the features he is actually activating.Another design flaw is in the folding action of the toy. I imagine they were going for better storage ability, but the train station can easily tip forward onto the toddler as he is trying to play. Not much fun.The animals resemblance to the creatures they are meant to represent may be a little too abstract (our toddler could not recognize any of them and he's an animal nut).I do not recommend this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suprised the train doesn't move.","review":"I thought great, a little train toy for my daughter.

The author was one of the first female judges in Iran, just before the Ayatollah's takeover. Rather than leaving Iran like so many of her friends, she stayed and risked her life defending the legal rights of others. However, American Treasury Department regulations nearly prevented her from writing and publishing this book for the outside world. She participated in a lawsuit in America and won. Random House be praised! This book is the result. Quite readable and insightful. A great choice for book clubs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fabulous Primer for the West","review":"Mrs. Ebadi's purpose in writing the book is to give Westerners an accurate and eye-opening account of the human rights struggle in Iran.

Ebadi tells the reader in her epilogue that her desire was not to explain and give motives to the political crises that Iran has faced over the past fifty years, but to present the historical legacy of upheavel in her country in a way that Americans can comprehend and understand clearly. If you want to learn about Persian politics and the influence of hard-line Islam on Iranian society, this is the book. If you want to learn about the struggle of women under the pressures of conservative Islam, this is the book. If you want to read a brief, quick biography, this is also the book.

Within a few days of careful use, one of the latches bent, a hinge broke off and a piece of the edge came unglued. It is a great idea, but needs better construction. On a positive note, my daughter loved it and would have spent hours drawing and creating with the tools inside if I let her. However, I had to take the box away so further damage does not occur before I can fix it. The drawers work fine. The problem is with the two doors on top that flip out. Note about drawers; Little plastic door knobs pop out. Need to be glued in."},{"rating":"1","title":"quality of box very disappointing","review":"Our son received this as a gift, and we sent it back. The box is made of inferior wood, and very poorly constructed. Not really \\"constructed\\" at all - rather just glued together, and not well, at that. Two of the corners were coming apart.Also, the lid opens in two parts. The drawback: when you open or close either side, the plastic trays on the inside that hold the crayons and pastels, fall out, as there is nothing securing them to the box. So, you have to try to hold the tray in place while closing either side.We can't comment on the supplies themselves, as we did not allow our son to try them, or else he would not have been able to return the item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter loves it...","review":"My daughter begged for this product so we got it for her as a birthday gift over a year ago.

I got them for my son's first birthday, and while he enjoyed the little carrying case they came in- the books wouldn't even hold his attention. He doesn't like that the book is done in under a minute (even with pointing at the pictures and talking about them.) There are only a few pages to each book with short little verses on each page- no real theme or rhyme scheme to speak of. For a newborn-6 months these would be okay, but anything over that is too old. My son had a much better time with Dr. Seuss and Eric Carle books. At least they were more verbally and visually stimulating.

Aside from the beautiful scenery (including a great moving shot of a locomotive) and carefully selected points of interest, we get to poke our noses into some corners that might otherwise go unnoticed. But the real highlight is joining Kirk ringside for the annual Albuquerque Balloon Festival. His coverage of this dazzling (and dizzying) event is as close as you can get to being there. As with his other videos, you don't have to be a motorcyclist to get your kicks with \\"Riding Route 66, New Mexico.\\" Buy it, experience it, then tell your friends about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a documentary of Route 66","review":"This video is not a documentary of Route 66 in New Mexico.

It ignores and does not cover the excellent portion of Route 66 going from Grants to the Arizona border (including all of Route 66 in colorful Gallup). It does show some nice shots of the Albuquerque balloon festival, along with a nice view of the City of Albuquerque from Sandia. I rate this video one star as a documentary of Route 66 in New Mexico and perhaps two stars if you're looking for a travel documentary. If you're looking for a motercycle travel documentary, then you might even give it three to four stars. However, don't expect to get an accurate or complete overview of Route 66 in New Mexico."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"This video covers a portion of route 66 in New Mexico. It also spends a lot of time on other things, like the Albuquerque Balloon Festival. I was very disappointed that more of route 66 was not covered. All of the old portion of route 66 to Santa Fe is excluded. There is a small amount of coverage about Highway 14, but only up to Sandia Peak for a view of Albuquerque. For some reason, the coverage of route 66 stops in Grants, eventhough Gallup and beyond provides some of the best route 66 views available. All in all, this video is like someone's home movie in both style and quality. You get to see where the producer had time to go, but you don't get the full picture of route 66. If you have never been to New Mexico and you have not traveled route 66, you might think this to be an informative video. If you want a true documentary video with a full overview of route 66 in New Mexico, this is certainly not it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy effort","review":"This book reveals a good intent that fell slightly short. The authors evidently know their stuff very well and describe many procedures with meticulousness. However, necessary details are missing on ocassion, like where to locate the vessel they recommend to inject. The illustations are satisfactory but sometimes insufficient. One wonders whether photographs could have been better in these cases. I missed some procedures that are common in veterinary clinics today like x-rays and some small surgery techniques that are common in a clinical setting. For examaple, I would have liked to find some pointers on how to operate an x-ray machine.

The recipes are well-written, reliable, and delicious.The term \\"everyday\\" may be misleading to some folks. These are not recipes you throw together to put a meal on the table at the end of the workday. They're more like simplified restaurant recipes that have been adapted to the home kitchen.Some of my favorite recipes: potato salad with green beans, corn quesadillas (addictive), and grilled fingerling potato salad. I made the tomato pizza with feta and lemon for some friends, and they swooned over it. (Then they went out and bought the cookbook.)This is also one of the most beautiful cookbooks on my shelf.

However, Bandits is clearly not one of Leonard's better works. Leonard claims that he never knows how his books will end, that he lets the characters lead him. In the case of Bandit's it they do not lead him to any strong finish. The characters are always the best part of any Leonard novel, and this cast is rather boring.In an earlier review, a reader commented that this was an \\"issue\\" book and cited both Pagan Babies and Cat Chaser as being in the same category. While Pagan Babies (an excellent read) and Cat Chaser (also good) may have both had issues or causes woven into the story, neither of these suffered from the boring cast of characters and slow moving plot that Bandits did. Fortunately this kind of disappointment is rare with Leonard's works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something here...?","review":"Drawn by the setting of New Orleans, I gave this one a shot. Decent refernces to businesses and landmarks, but HORRRIBLE plot line. (Unless, again, I'm missing something here...) Seems like Leonard had a gun to his head to finish this book, quickly! I've read Delillo, Pynchon, Sandford, etc...and recommend ANY of them over what I saw from Leonard here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A jazzy, character-driven Leonard novel.","review":"Sort of different than most Leonard books. The plot is pretty light. Very character-driven. Basically that just means that you're going to have to read through hundreds of pages where hardly anything happens. I couldn't stop laughing during and after the ending though. It was wild."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's How He Does It. . .","review":"Elmore Leonard has an ear for character. He usually starts with a bad good guy and immediately adds a 'good' and very desirable woman. Then we meet one or two really bad guys and a couple of less good good guys. There's usually a not-so-good desirable woman and one or two totally off-the-charts whackos.This is not to say that Leonard writes to a formula. It's just that he, like Jimmy Breslin and Vladimir Nabokov Walter Moseley and a few dozen others, returns to the people he loves.His characters in this book are well-drawn. Jack and Lucy are the heart of the matter-the bad good guy and the good hot woman. They are involved with sleazeleeches who are hustling American right-wingers for cash under pretext of fighting communists in Central America. The action is a bit slow, but the characters and the suspense make up for it.Lynn Hoffman, author of Bang Bang"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book by an (occassionally) hit or miss author","review":"Elmore leonard is a great writer who occassionally has a book that just doesn't fly.

But be warned...It is a character-driven novel and not a plot-driven novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much politics and religion","review":"The politics and religion are intrusive in a way that one doesn't expect from Elmore Leonard (who has written in a number of genres). I was reminded of Robert Stone's Flag for Sunrise which does the same politics and religion in Central America much better. I believe this was written a long time before Cat Chaser which covers the same political ground (but in the Dominican Republic, not Nicaragua).

Woods captures the difficult, labor-intensive, built-nature of architecture rather than the all too deceptive manipulation of marketable pixels demanded by minds obsessed with ROI spreadsheets. His drawings require close examination for appreciation and knowledge of his understanding of structures in harmful chaos to counter the comforting illusions of craven professional architecture and its vulgar masters the legal and financial industries.These works tell the truth of our worldwide tormenting and tormented environment in which there is no safety and security only misleading promises of building codes and oversight of owners and their designers. CAD lies by its nature, Woods does not.Woods' challenging visions should be essential continuing education for anybody licensed to savage the earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what i expected","review":"This small book by Lebbeus Woods( the size is a plus compared to other publications of his opus) isn't his best publication.Woods is a really interesting subject, both his texts and draftings, explore the limits of architecture, and the concept behind projecting architecture.This book does not show neither to a good extent.The text at the start is quite short, and the drawings... they look photocopied from some other anthologies already published.There are better books of Lebbeus Woods around, this one is forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it was possible, I would leave 1/10th of a star","review":"Pathetic, boring, waste-of -money, waste-of-time, horrible, terrible, not scary, bad script, bad producing, bad acting, dumb, low budget (no-budget).

The descriptions of the auction business is somewhat interesting. The author pulls a red herring on us that will make a tense but unsatisfactory movie climax. Too much of the book is devoted to describing gay sex. This book is more a curiosity than the great work many reviewers describe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gay porn and weak plot","review":"I feel that the rave reviews from media and readers are totally wrong, and it's not because I am against a gay hero. He is an unhappy auctioneer who goes for casual sex, but the story is weak (more a thriller than a whodunnit), improbably, and stumbles along.Along the way, the hero sees a young (man) in a window who longs to be seduced and goes up to his room. This is written in a *very* graphic way, and the boy does not appear anywhere else in the book. Hero Rile makes passes at another character, Derek, whose role in the book is also a big question mark.The story of hero Rilke finding snuff pictures of a girl and becoming so upset by them that he goes on a quest for the solution is not believable, and not well executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"full of holes.","review":"I thought this had a promising premise--a man from an auction house hired to sell the estate of a dead millionaire discovers \\"snuff\\" pictures--sounded interesting, albeit familiar to moviegoers who saw \\"8 mm\\". And the main character, the auctioneer, was unusual for this kind of novel: a middle-aged gay guy who prowls public parks.But the book was stronger on incident and character than it was on real plot and the twist at the end (I won't reveal it), was full of holes: think about it for a minute and it completely falls apart. And, in the end, the book relied on thematics in order to wrap up, in an unsatisfying way, what should have been wrapped up with good old fashioned storytelling.One final caveat: the book is set mainly in Scotland and the brogue sometimes appeared, at least to this American, to take the form of typos. It was occasionally distracting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic look ...","review":"Fantastic look into the dark side of life, from the point of view of Rilke an auctioneer, who is asked to clear out a dead man's house in a week. The dead guy has antiques and objects de art that the auction house is fairly slavering over. It will be the sale of the century. One tiny thing, the dead guy has amassed quite a collection of pornography, and not all of it entirely savory. His sister wants it destroyed, and it's up to Rilke to accede to his wishes or lose the collection. There were some out of character actions taken, presumably to advance the storyline. Overall this novel was a tight read. Interestingly enough this is a debut, I'm looking forward to more from this author. I was sucked in from the first couple of pages, and it made wonderful reading on the lengthy car trip to the inlaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"This book is absolutely breath taking,I can not praise it enough.

My trepidation won at on that one. Branaugh is all wrong for the character. It should have been played by Bian Cox. Branaugh is too healthy and way over the top; and the tone of the series is so bland, typified by the weathercaster delivery of the actress playing his daughter. Therefore, after reading the reviews for the Swedish version, I took the plunge and was joyfully surprised. I cannot say enough about the integrity of this series.

I done it only once and cannot recover already for three months and probably never will.

The graphics don't awe and even the colors seem overdone and corny. If you want a realistic, strategy sneak around and flip switches to solve the puzzles and then finally after dodging, ducking and hiding kill the 3 bad guys per level then this is not for you. This game requires almost no strategy and is probably easier than it should be, but it is just so fun. I highly recommend you get it. The story is completely cheesy but it is to be expected given the plot of the game.

Taylor can really wail when needed, but the best moments for me on this disc are when Taylor shows off his subtle jazz chops.

Most histories of the war concentrate on the Battle of the Bulge, which took place at about the same time, and simply ignore this action. The Eastern Front in the war is given short shrift in America, but it is quite important for us today to see how the modern map of Europe came to be. This is a well-written book, but I couldn't get my mouth around some of the Hungarian words, and the unknown street names confused me a bit. The maps were a bit too busy: more concise maps with larger details and less clutter would have been helpful. All in all, though, this is an important contribution to the story of the War in the East that we ignore, and it should be read for its insight into the Russian mindset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most disappointing book, whitewashing Hungarian cowardice & treachery","review":"If you think like I do that this is a book about the military history of the siege and fall of Budapest, you will be sorely disappointed as it covers the campaign mostly from a Hugarian perspective, though it sheds light on the cowardice, perfidy and treachery of Germany's last ally in the East, whoce soldiers and generals deserted en masse when the going gets tough, leaving the Germans to fight it out with the Russian hordes to save the frivolous citizens from the communist yoke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Direct Marketing for Dummies","review":"The internet section of this book is not at all useful. The techniques are very outdated. For instance, he describes (not in great enough detail to help at all) how to make ad banners.

He doesn't give any information about writing copy, or how to approach direct marketing on the internet. He does, however, have lots of \\"useful\\" information on how to \\"get started\\", none of which is really useful, since it is all common knowledge. If you've never been on the web before and haven't a clue about business or direct marketing, this book is for you. He gives a great introduction to the web.

However this book is great for both large and small businesses. In fact if you are a small business then this book may save you from wasting money on campaigns where you don't sufficient funds to get bang for your buck.The thing I liked most about the book, other than being easy to read, was that it contained loads of tips and techniques that I could use straight away in my business.My only criticism is that the book is too orientated toward physical mail campaigns.

He appreciates both sides of the question and has friends in both camps. I originally got this book because I had spent some time on Crete and wanted to recapture the feeling of being on such an island -- I got that beautifully in the first half of the book.

The subject may not matter to many (I consider it tragic, but no more than an hundred other areas of the world with similar problems), but the fact that this guy was on the ground there is brilliant.The book is so well written that I think most anyone will be absorbed by the narrative, and lack of knowledge or interest in this remote area will not affect the reading.I know this is all a little vague, but I'm not the writer Durrell is."},{"rating":"2","title":"glad to see someone still has life in the music industry !!","review":"vocals get it going big!!great song writeing,heavey but melodic just the same, this really gets the blood and all juices flowing, i feel alot of passion and excitement in radakka. i also like the intelligable lyrics GOTHIC AT ITS FINEST!!!!!!love you guys [lollar]"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album was a great disapointment","review":"After Radakka's 1st album Requiem of the Innocent I thought these guys need to make another album.

Didn't have any screws break, had one strip out, but that was my fault as I tightened it too far. Remember folks, you are dealing with soft wood here, so don't go crazy with your screwdriver. And DO NOT use a screw gun (power drill), you will defintely have problems.My 3 year old is using it right now and loves it.

I read it close to 10 years ago. I have just finished it the second time. I am just as enthralled as ever with this historical fantasy filled with enchantments and interlaced with tender romantic moments. I will always love Alfred, the innocent and beautiful elf monk, turned powerful elf lord after much struggles with his real true self. I will always appreciate Thea who loves him from the very beginning. Finally who could ever forget Alfred's encounter with Richard, the Lion Heart, Alfred's sorrows during the disastrous invasion of Constantinople and finally Alfred's torment in the last of the trilogy when he thought he has lost all those he loves. My only complaint is the seemingly rush writing towards the end. On the other end, it maybe I did not wish the tale of Alfred, Thea, their children and their elf kin to end. The Hound and the Falcon is definitely one of my favorites to be treasured always."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry, and not nearly as fun as some of Ms. Tarr's other works","review":"The Hound and the Falcon takes place in an alternate reality in which the kingdom of Rhiyana, somewhere in Europe alongside traditional countries, is inhabited by the faerie folk. The first part of this tome, The Isle of Glass, I read as a separate work. The latter two books bring Alf, our protagonist, first to Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade, and then back to Rhiyana and Italy as his heritage is threatened.This book was my nemesis for some time as it took me ages to finish. I was interested in the world Ms. Tarr created, but the story was quite dry and could not hold my attention for long."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gorgeous Book!!!","review":"I read this years ago, and loved it so much I had to have a copy. I can't say how many times I've reread it, but it's like an old friend now. The writing style is beautiful, almost lyrical, and the history is wonderful. Alfred makes a fascinating character, although book three is disappointing in that Tarr prevents any further books by writing her characters into a complete finale.

The majority of the tape is about doing things rather than seeing Tuscany. The narrative and the dialogue are superficial and at times silly. I didn't time it,but it seemed that only one fourth of the tape showed brief and inconclusive glimpses of Tuscany; the rest was of one lodging, talking at tables, a brief summary of a visit to a vineyard, driving \\"hot\\" Ferrraris, and a shopping expedition.

Were some of the early Nazi's gay? You bet! Ernst Roehm was one of a handful of gay men who led the early party. However, the overwhelming, uncontrovertable evidence is that gay men and women were victims of the Nazis even if a handful participated in the persecution.Pink Swastika may not be as outrageous as the Protocols of Zion, but it is from the same genre as Protocols.

It coincides with my own conclusions for my own book that publishers refused to handle. It is likely the Pink Swastika will be swamped by gay protests in the guise of criticism. This is how gay activists work! That is, they follow the fascist line and try to discredit or drown-out the facts about homosexuality. The main fact is that homosexuality is a perverse lifestyle that was used by both Nazis and communists to subvert society and remove any Christian influence on the family.

It makes the reader stop to wonder how people could be so hateful as to discredit victims of the Holocaust. It is well known and accepted not only by mainstream society but by academics, historians, and Holocaust victims themselves that homosexuals were persecuted by the Nazis. Not solely effeminate gay men as this book purports, but all. The idea that the Nazi party was formed in a gay bar as this book insists is also ridiculous.I hope that people will not choose to buy this book and give money to a group of people dedicated to revisionist hatred. If you are interested in an accurate account of the experiences of gay victims of the Holocaust, check out Richard Plant's \\"Pink Triangle: The Nazi War Against Homosexuals\\" or Heinz Heger's \\"Men With the Pink Triangle: The True, Life-and-Death Story of Homosexuals in the Nazi Death Camps\\". Both of these are excellent, fact based accounts of the atrocities committed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holocaust Denial","review":"This book is attempting to nullify an aspect of the holocaust that clearly occurred.

It would be like writing a book that exposes the founders of the Nazi party as men, and then condemning all members of the male gender worldwide as a result. Just because a few Nazi officials were homosexual doesn't erase the fact that the Nazi party clearly targetted homosexuals for extermination. The homophobia in Germany during WWII is well documented, as is the treatment of gays. This book attempts to use smoke and mirrors to trick unsuspecting or prejudiced readers into accepting a completely biased and blatantly revisionist version of history. As an educator who specializes in trauma writing (largely a product of the holocaust), I found this book to be a complete misrepresentation of the information that we know about this period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Research - Shocking Conclusions","review":"I am sure the homosexualist establishment wishes this well researched and thouroughly documented book was never published. It's conclusion that homoeroticism was at the core of the Nazi movement will shock \\"modern liberal\\" sensibilities. With deep insight and impeccable scholarship the authors expose the core values and behaviors which produced the horrors inflicted by the Nazi Machine. Coupled with G. E. Veiths book \\"Modern Fascism - Liquidating the Judeo Christian Ethic\\" one has a complete picture of the level of moral perversion and ethical failure necessary to prepare society for a \\"monumental eruption of evil\\" on the scale of the Third Reich.

Unfortuantely, rather than being an exploratory, unbiased account, this book serves as a fundametalist Christian propaganda piece to defame gay and lesbian people. This book seeks to link the Gay Rights Movement with fascism, which is an absurd lie.

The nazi's published books blaming everything on the Jews and here we are more than 80 years later with another hate group trying to blame the holocaust on homosexuals, at least they didn't try to pin it on the Jews I guess.This book belongs in the alternate history fiction section with Harry Turtledove and Robert Conroy(they aren't hateful monsters like the authors of this book, they just write alternate history fiction that is actually enjoyable to read)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nazis were irrefutably....","review":"If you guessed Christians you were right!

A corporal being escorted to Cairo to be tried for the murder of his commanding officer changes place with the military policeman guarding him when the latter dies of a heart attack.

Tony Iommi's guitar playing is still as menacing as ever. Geezer Butler's bass playing is superb & Vinny Appice's drum playing is outstanding.

And then \\"Falling off the Edge of the World\\" and \\"Over And Over\\" are the songs that are about solitude - the saddest songs beside Black Sabbath's \\"Solitude\\" and Alice in Chains' \\"Nutshell\\". \\"Over And Over\\" tells about being in Hell. You are doomed for eternity and you are spending time in the lake of fire. There's no hope anymore...and it goes over and over again...Hahhaha!

Remember that Dio made \\"Dehumanidizer\\" after this with Black Sabbath!Stars: The Mob Rules, Voodoo, Over And Over"},{"rating":"2","title":"sabbath with dio,s great second album!!!!mob rules.","review":"this record is the second helping of sabbath with dio..by the time this record was being recorded founding member drummer bill ward left and vinny appice joined sabbath...anyway mob rules contains some great stuff such as:turn up the night,sign of the southern cross,voodoo,mob rules,e5150..and falling of the edge of the world..all in all this a strong album get it play it loud!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mob Rules!","review":"Excellent album. It's better in general than Heaven and Hell, even though it lacks founding drummer Bill Ward. Vinnie Appice does a pretty decent job, and adds enough \\"thump\\" to make it one of Sabbath's more rythmic albums. The best songs are arguably \\"Voodoo,\\" \\"Turn up the Night,\\" and \\"Mob Rules.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard To Beat","review":"Certainly a staple in any metal/hard rock fan's catalog; A near perfect album on every front, from the powerful, legendary vocal style of Dio, the intricate basswork of Butler, the tasteful yet busy drumming of Appice, and some of the best guitarwork Iommi has done to date. 'Voodoo' has always been my personal favorite here, but every track is highly listenable, inspiring, and what Black Sabbath are all about. Who other than Dio can get away with singing \\"Bring me your children, they'll burn...\\" or \\"You were a fool, but that's cool, it's alright...\\" with such menace and emotion, as opposed to making those lyrics sound totally laughable? Classic stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall good with one killer song","review":"Although not as consistently great as Heaven and Hell, the track \\"Falling off the Edge of the World\\", tucked away near the end, is a hidden gem, an absolute stunner, with a classic quiet start leading into a hugely addictive riff, great bass work and climaxing in an astounding guitar solo, all in combination with Dio at his very best. By itself this track makes the album worthy of a 5 star rating. It's what the \\"Repeat\\" button was designed for :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mob the Stores if, After 19 Years, You Still Don't Have It!","review":"Go Dio! I never was a real fan of Ozzy, whom I consider someone with little talent and who makes up for it by \\"shock rocking\\" the world to gain notoriety. Ronnie James Dio is a much more talented singer (not screamer, mind you) than Ozzy can ever hope to be. His vocals strike a chord in my skull that Ozzy tries his best to split with that irritating banshee wail of his. Getting back to the music, the motley crew of Dio, Iommi, Butler, and Appice actually churn out a top-notch assault on your false sense of security by making you jump at shadows in the street (\\"Mob Rules\\"), or by making you want to harmonize with the lyrics on \\"Country Girl\\" or \\"Voodoo\\". Sadly, Dio left soon afterward, but all 3 albums he performed with the Sab bruisers will last until the final construction job of man crumbles. Hot picks \\"Turn Up the Night\\", \\"Mob Rules\\", and \\"Country Girl\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven & Hell for singles, Mob Rules for a more complete album","review":"Absolutely love Dio fronted Sabbath, not that I dont love Osbourne fronted Sabbath as well. Its just an entirely different sound, when Dio joined not only was the lyrics heavy but the whole sound finally changed into the heavy metal music we all know and love.

As it turned out, the reason not to buy is the limp, uninteresting songs, kind of like they took the WORST characteristics of all those bands (and a few others) and put them together. There was only one song on the disc I liked very much at all, \\"The Game\\" (including its goofy intro). One other tune, \\"The Other 90 Percent,\\" has a little potential in a fuzzy, J&MC kind of way. The artwork and packaging are also good, but who buys an album just for that?

Recorded while on a 1969 tour of Europe it is a true document to the enduring legacy of one of the great bluesmen of all time. Contemporary, yet timeless, Hooker's performance captures the authenticity which is the hallmark of his power and gift to the blues. Just Hooker, guitar and that tireless foot keeping the beat: singing, moaning and calling into that primeval darkness which is the veil that shrouds the greatest fears of man yet, also, the penultimate mystery of life. Few are those who have entered that darkness and translated its essence into human language and music. Such a man was Hooker.

I was not disappointed! This book has so many things in it.It provides you with a list of up-to-date names, along with their meanings and how to pronounce it, and--if you so wish--how to write it in Japanese. But that's not all!It also gives you a list of names to go with all seasons, and it provides names of well known Samurai and a brief story behind the legend. This, itself, was my favorite part. Especially since I bought this book to help with character naming in my book.The only downside to this book was that it wasn't long enough. I would love to have a book on Japanese names that was as thick as other name books, but I have yet to find one.

My partner and I watched it last night and kept glancing at each other and rolling our eyes every ten minutes or so. Why they chose to film this movie on a stage instead of in real settings is beyond me. That choice only serves to emphasize the unrealistic nature of the whole enterprise. It's not unrealistic in an imaginative or entertaining way, either. It's simply implausible with some laughably bad dialogue. I asked my partner who we should give it to since we'll never watch it again and he said, \\"Nobody.\\" Steer clear. If you're tempted to buy this film, get \\"Regular Guys\\" or \\"Km.0\\" instead.

I enjoyed the first couple of books but as I read more of the books in the series, I liked the series more and more. You get to know the characters well and there is a lot of humor and wisdom throughout each book. My favorite books were the last two: A Perfect Love and Hearts At Home. I could relate to Barbara & Russell's struggle on trying to get pregnant and I just loved the surprise development with Annie's character. The angels provide lots of insight into the character of God and I've learned a lot from these books and eagerly await the next book. And the parts on the little dog Tallulah had me laughing.

So I turned to this, the first in the Heavenly Daze series. Sadly, it'll likely be the last for me. If you've read the other reviews you'll know it's about a village in Maine whose residents are aided by angels. Well, for me the concept just didn't come together. The main stories -- Anne and Olympia De Cuvier's struggle to get along and pastor Winslow Wickam' insecurity about his lack of hair and charisma -- work really well as plotlines. Tossing the angels into it turns the book into a silly Disney movie-of-the-week. In the end, I found them annoying intrusions that zapped the credibility of the main stories. And then there's the stuff about Tallulah the dog. It could have been chopped right out and I wouldn't have noticed. Oh well.

The 'long distance call' track is rather another face of johnson which reflects a sarcastic view of a sad man who deals upright bravely with his conditions, which i think is what blues is all about.

The premise was good: Hunter was going to find out who the Love Doctor, an advice columnist for a newspaper, was because she wrote something about him he disagreed with and did so anonymously. The Love Doctor was the heroine, Daffodil Landry. But Ms. North left that premise and any tension it could cause at the door, but used it conveniently to neatly tie up the end of the book.

I think Fel Pro is upselling the steel core gaskets at four times the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rosenblat Does Superb Job At Reading","review":"I've been an audio book listener for over 10 years now and have come to realize that the reader is almost as important as the writer. In this story, Scottoline came up with a fairly predictable plot that was fun and easy to follow. You can easily identify with the main characters and end up putting yourself into their shoes from time-to-time. What really makes this audio book stand out is Rosenblat; she has a wonderful voice and acts out the characters much better then most readers. I especially liked the Pigeon Tony's lawyer's (Judy) closing statement. To avoid giving you the ending, I will say that Judy's words were poetry in a courtroom! Enjoy! 3 stars for the story, 5 stars for the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining legal caper","review":"This is more a caper novel that an thriller, but it's great fun. The humor is subtle and light, and the main characters have touching stories to tell. When I first heard the premise for this book, I thought \\"no way,\\" and in fact, it's not believable. But the book is less a legal drama (where believability does matter, to me) than a light-hearted escapade that manages to tell a meaningful story. The characters come alive on the page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vendetta Defense audio book, read by Kate Burton","review":"The seller sent me the wrong item. I ordered the Vendetta Defense by Lisa Scottoline, READ BY BARBARA ROSENBLATS for a cost of $55 plus S/H. The seller also had available the same book/author, but read by Kate Burton for $15 plus S/H. I specifically said in my notes to seller that I only wanted the version read by Barbara Rosenblats. What the seller did was to send me the one read by Kate Burton, but charged my credit card for the one read by Barbara Rosenblats, the more expensive one. They intentionally charged my credit card the higher amount as they stated that the one I ordered was not in stock. Why would they do that? It took weeks for them to refund me partially. They will not give me a total refund as I want to return the unwanted item. I will never buy from this person again! Can't trust them with my credit card. And I don't want the item I have, but do not have an address where to return. Extremely unhappy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe this was written by Scottline","review":"I was anxiously looking forward to L. Scottline's new book as I could not put down her previous stories. This story was so implausible, so boring, so predictable and tedious to read. I wanted to stop reading, but I figured it would get better, which it never did. Please bring back Bennie as the lead character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but I just didn't like it much","review":"From Scottolines first book through to Mistaken Identity, I really enjoyed her work, it was fast, fresh, suspenseful, and at times laugh out loud funny. Her last book was a dissapointment however, and I am sorry to say that this is an even bigger one. Maybe I am crazy, seeing as how it has been geting glowing reviews here, but I just didn't like it. I thought it was very slow paced, and not very suspenseful at all. I found myself constantly skimming ahead for the \\"good\\" parts. The characters were flat and pigeon Tony was annoying with his constant \\"I no murder him, I kill him!\\" There were snippets of humor, but nothing compared to some of her previous books. I hate writing such a negative review of an author I like, but that is how I feel. I will still read her next book, and hopefully it will go better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back on Track","review":"The last of Lisa Scottoline's novels which I read, \\"Rough Justice\\", was a big disappointment because its plot and her characters' actions defied the laws of nature and common sense. In \\"The Vendetta Defense\\" Ms. Scottoline, has taken full advantage of her literary license to develop an intriguing plot, with interesting, three dimensional characters, without resorting to the tactics which marred \\"Rough Justice\\". As an added bonus, the novel raises thought provoking questions about the meaning of justice and revenge. As usual the novel is a page turner and reflects Ms. Scottoline's gifts as a storyteller and her witticism. Without question, the best of her novels I have read so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to par","review":"I loved Scottoline's previous books. I found the stereotyping in this book just a little much and it felt 'cranked' out and underpolished."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Vendetta Defense","review":"So far this is my favorite book from the Rosato & Associate series. The characters are wonderful and her description of Italians was great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trial of allegedly murderer told in first person by Defense lawyer","review":"The Vendetta Defense by Lisa Scottoline:An interesting and well written ethnically slanted plot with colorful characters and witty asides, but containing too much detail in descriptions of Phila. neighborhoods, and not much suspense as to the outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Judy","review":"I'm a big Lisa Scottoline fan, but this book was my least favorite. Judy didn't interact with her colleagues at the firm, except marginally with Bennie and a phone call or two to Mary. Judy, in my opinion, isn't a strong enough character to carry a whole book. I did finish the book, but it was a bit of a struggle to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"This was a NY Times Best Seller? It's slow and predictable: A lawyer defends an old Italian man and finds out about past crimes. It's just your same old trial story that has a focus on odd topics: pigeons and revenge. Scottoline is pretty dry and her descriptive paragraphs are flat. If you're going to read this book, borrow it - don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Scottoline's standards","review":"I have enjoyed all of Lisa's Scottoline's books, except this one. And I should confess this review is only about the first half--I abandoned the book when I got to the midpoint and it still wasn't holding my interest. (I almost NEVER do that.) If this is your first Scottoline mystery, and you felt the way I did, please don't give up on her. Most of her books are lively, interesting, funny, and have characters worth spending time with."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Legal Thriller!","review":"As a legal thriller novelist myself, I found The Vendetta Defense to be a real page turner! Scottoline is indeed splendid with her characters and plots, leaving the reader wanting for more. I recommend this one to any true fan of the genre. -- from R.
