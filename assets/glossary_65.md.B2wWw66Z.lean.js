The BIGGEST problem, is coffee going ALL OVER your counter. This can happen 3 ways... either it over flows from the carafe because there is a block in the lid, or because it is not sitting in the machine correctly. OR because the door pops open that holds the ground beans. I came online just to write this review after having to clean up an entire counter and floor of coffee 3 times this past week. The only good thing to say is that it can grind your beans and brew at the same time. The bad thing is you can't set the timer to go off automatically when you are just waking up, because you risk it overlowing when you are still in bed. DO NOT BUY THIS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Take great beans and brew mediocre coffee!","review":"Yes, take great beans and brew mediocre coffee! Or possibly wake up to coffee flowing across your kitchen counter and down into the cabinets. Hard to clean and tiresome to look at, the Cuisinart grind and brew has finally lost its place in our house and this morning, after another disaster, our machine (after only seven months) is heading for the garbage can. It was hard to clean and never really made a great cup of coffee despite the best ingredients. Programming was tedious and assembly of the parts, water and coffee each evening was simply not what one wanted to do at bedtime. Its vaguely retro stainless steel veneer was impossible to maintain. So it's back to straightforward French coffee presses for this household - and (Joy!) finally a decent cup of coffee. We'll be skeptical about future Cuisinart purchases. And trust us, dear reader, you do not want the hassle of this imperfect machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Teeth Grinder Coffee Maker","review":"I grind my teeth everytime I use this Coffee Maker. I just recently recieved this coffee maker as a gift. It must of been from someone is extremely mad at me! I am taking it back today. Within the 2 weeks that I have had this THING, my coffee has over flowed, I couldn't get it open and the grinder is a royal pain. I love fresh grind coffee but this thing is a pain. You have to clean it everyday after every use. The plastic top gets filled up with steam and cakes the ground coffee to every little nook inside. This is one of the poorest made coffee makers I have ever used. Do yourself a favor and buy a separte grinder for you coffee!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, bad execution","review":"Coffee is good and stays hot for a while. Although I do agree with some others that the coffee is not as hot initially as it could be. The bean grinder does a good job for a medium grind, but the dust gets wet during the brew cycle and cakes onto everything. Lots of cleaning after every brew. This particularly stinks when serving multiple guests and another pot is necessary. As for the button-ejected basket... this is the killer. After one year the basket will randomly open during the brew cycle and flood my kitchen with coffee. No response from Cuisinart since I am past the 1 year warranty. Personally, I would steer clear from this pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"This machine is a great disappointment. The Grind & Brew concept is a design failure. As stated in another review, this machine requires extensive cleaning of 5 or 6 parts much more frequently than other coffee makers.

It finally died completely). Now I realize how much I struggled with this product. Most annoying was the cleaning process. As mentioned in earlier reviews, all brew components must be washed and completely dried before setting up subsequent brewing. The release latch for the brew basket malfunctions, randomly popping the door open, resulting in a river of coffee across the floor.The product brews good coffee but it's way over the top in terms of user effort to get there.I give it points for being a single process grind and brew and its reliable programming, but I will happily return to my coffee grinder -- which remains DRY -- paired with a simple, programmable coffee maker.I admit that I did use it for years, but I truly regret having purchased this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fundamental design flaws","review":"K... here's the deal. Putting a coffee grinder inside the same housing as the brewing takes place is just plain retarded. Every time you make a pot of coffee, your grinder gets all moist and you have to clean it out in between pots so your fresh beans don't stick to the sides like some sort of coffee paste. (I finally gave up using the grinder altogether). But, ironically, the carafe is too small to fit your hand into and a scrub brush isn't rigid enough, so the you can't clean the inside of the carafe! Then, the little springy thing that pushes in when you put the carafe into place that allows the coffee to flow into the carafe, and not out onto your countertop along with all of the coffee grinds, intermittently failed to push in. That was the last straw. I donated it and bought a Mr. Coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tremendous disappointment","review":"The thermal carafe is about the only thing I liked in this machine.It is huge and awkward and difficult to load. There are many pieces to assemble, and they become quickly caked with bean pulp which is messy and inconvenient to clean. The brew basket drain valve often becomes clogged, which simultaneously causes the basket to overflow from the backup while leaving the drain open if the carafe is removed.This morning, I mopped up its spewed hot coffee and grounds from my kitchen counter for the last irritating time. I'm going back to a low budget Mr. Coffee to remember the little pleasures of using a product the does something simple correctly.The only way this device would ever be worth $132 would be if you lived in a zone where you could pack the reservior with sufficient dynamite to blast the thing back to the architectural demon world which spawned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine makes great coffee","review":"I just bought the Cuisinart DGB-600BC one week ago, love it.

We bought two (one of us drinks decaf...). The carafe is POORLY INSULATED and coffee quickly cools off - having that carafe was one of the main reasons we bought this model. The carafe itself is not very ergonomic (you need to practically turn it upside down to let the coffee out). Also the gold basket filters coffee poorly so that grinds are in the coffee...the problem, I believe, is that the grinding process grinds too finely. There is no point having the gold basket (which came with the one we bought) if it is better to use filters - which we now do. We suggest to Cuisinart (if they are reading this review) to change the grinding time. In summary, we like the idea of the grind and brew idea but it needs to be re-engineered so the the carafe is better insulated and the grinds are not so fine (or a different gold basket filter design..)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much work for a pot of coffee","review":"There are way too many parts that you must clean after each pot of coffee.

I'm now in the market for a more reliable, and cheaper model. I didn't have these problems with my simple old Mr. Coffee machine. I wonder if they make a termal machine?? Anyway...

The carafe leaks at the top, and if you use already ground coffee you have to clean everything including the grinder. It's very time consuming. The carafe didn't keep the coffee as warm as I had hoped. I called cusinart several times and finally got through after waiting 45 min. They said they were aware of the carafe leaking. They don't have any parts for this piece yet so I needed to call back in a month or so.We paid a [alot of money] for a coffee pot that leaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"This will make you quit drinking coffee!!!!!","review":"Just got one of these for Christmas.

Please notice that the negative reviews all corroborate each other and my experience was identical to what those reviwers said: weak coffee, complicated cleanup, loud grinder, quickly-cooling carafe, etc. Some of the things might be forgiveable if this thing made good coffee. I tried everything to get a full-bodied brew before I returned the unit: different beans, doubling up on the amount of beans, bypassing the grinder, etc. Nothing worked. This is a badly designed unit. I went back to my old $15 Mr. Coffee and it makes much better coffee. The only good thing about the Cuisinart is that it looks nice. Beware if you are a real lover of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice, doesn't make good coffee","review":"After convincing a new boss that freshly ground coffee beans makes a better tasting coffee, I purchased this Cuisinart Grind & Brew machine.

I thought it was just the one machine - returned it to the place of purchase for a new one - but it's the same.

Once we got used to the differences we found that we love it. It makes excellent coffee and as far as the clean-up, well, there's always some clean up with coffee makers. If not cleaned regularly the taste of your coffee will be affected. The other thing we like is it starts with fresh cold water each time.

I can't believe Cuisinart made a piece of junk like this. Here are a few cons:1. The built in coffee grinder doesn't let you grind enough beans to make 10 cups of strong coffee. Either you have to grind it separately, defeating the whole purpose of this model, or you can only make 6-8 cups.2. The steam from the coffee soaks the grinder, turning it into a muddy mess you have to clean every time you make coffee.3. The grinder often leaves whole beans inside, clogging up the spout.4. When you pour the coffee, the carafe leaks, dripping a puddle of coffee onto your counter top.5. On several occasions I've set the timer only to wake up to coffee all over my kitchen floor! Yes, you read right. The coffee often doesn't even make it into the carafe. Rather, it leaks over the lid and ends up all over you counter top and kitchen floor.

This one is a lemon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Design Flaws","review":"This machine was a huge disappointment. I am amazed that it was brought to market with its signifcant engineering problems. I returned it for the following reasons:1: Steam- When you brew a pot, the ENTIRE machine- grinder, bean hopper, etc. fills with steam. The unground beans get wet, and the residual grinds turn to paste. It's a huge mess every time you make a pot.2: Carafe- leaks. It is impossible to pour out the final 2 cups without spilling half on the counter.3: Weak coffee- The grinder will only take enough beans to make about half a pot of decent coffee. If you use the max amount of beans and try to make a full pot, you get brown water.4: There are a bunch of little plastic parts that you have to clean and replace every time you set it up.On the plus side, it looks pretty cool and makes excellent coffee (in small amounts)- probably thanks to the charcoal water filter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands up over time","review":"I have had this for FIVE YEARS!

The best things about it are the grinder and the wire basket it comes with which makes the coffee taste great. It's also compact enough to fit in my apartment kitchen, and saves me from having to have a coffee grinder on the counter too.The only thing I don't like is the noise of the grinder. It is way louder than my old coffee grinder. It kind of sounds like a cross between a jet and a police siren.

After a year of observing, I can report that when it swings open during grinding, you get a coffeepot covered with grinds. When it swings open during the brew cycle, you get a counterful of coffee stains to mop up. There is no cutoff device to stop the machine when these mishaps take place.

At 5'3\\", I am too short to pour coffee into the reservoir without spilling it all over the --standard height--counter. So, I set up the rest of the coffee and my husband pours it. Idiotic! Pouring coffee is a pain, too--you can pour it with lid on, but it pours REALLY slowly. Remove lid and pour and coffee spills all over. Cleanup is also a pain with all the parts. The coffee tastes fine, however. The other day I put beans in and the machine began to beep out of nowhere. I had to unplug it for awhile, then reprogram. What a pain! Finally, when setting timer, not that PM comes up first--completely counter intuitive if you ask me--so you must cycle through to AM.

When I make a full pot of coffee I fill up the cup with beans and also use ground coffee in the filter.

Yummiiii. I use Melitta coffee, it grinds perfectly, ok there is some steam building up in the grinder basket, but I have 2 healthy hands and for sure 5 seconds of my precious time left over to easily dismantle the parts, clean them and add them together again. You want a fancy tool????? You need to invest some time!!! It's worth it!!! It is a little morning ritual and I love it. I enjoy this machine. It's perfect and the smell of the grinded beans makes me start the day with joy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"The grinder is outrageously loud (like and air-raid siren!). So, don't even think about using this in the morning, which is, unfortunately, when most people want to use a coffee maker. Even if you don't use the grind feature you still have to clean 7 pieces every time you make coffee! What a pain! And if you forget (or don't have time) to clean it, when you realize it at bedtime, setting it up for the morning, you have to clean AND dry all seven pieces before you can even start to set it up. I returned mine and got a Capresso MT500 (Consumer Reports recommended) It costs less, has the thermal carafe and makes excellent coffee with almost no clean-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice","review":"I purchased a DGB-600BC grind and brew about a year ago and wish that I did not. While the overall performance, interms of coffee quality, etc. is good, the inconvenience of using this dwarfs the benefits.Key Shortcomings:1. With a full pot of coffee, carafe ALWAYS drips coffee down the side and onto the counter2. Moisture flows up into the grinder mechanism, meaning that it must be cleaned every time (failure to do so will mean a BIG mess3. When using pre-ground beans (not me preference), must be careful not to use more than 10 tbs of the water will overflow - makes it impossible to make strong coffee from pre-ground beans when making a full pot.Bottom line - you're MUCH better off with a good stand-alone grinder and quality coffeee maker than with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"SPILLS WATER & GROUNDS ALL OVER THE COUNTER","review":"Don't buy this coffee maker. I have one. It is awful. Water condenses in the top and makes the grinder clog, creating a big mess. The problem is compounded by the fact the pathway from the grinder to the filter is crooked, so the grounds accumulate there causing blockage. The mechanism that holds the coffee filter is spring loaded and sometimes comes unlatched, resulting in a GREAT BIG MESS OF WATER COFFEE GROUNDS RUNNING DOWN YOUR CABINET. If they'd let me rate this thing a zero star I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many cons","review":"This is a good looking machine with too many cons, however:1) 4-5 parts need to be cleaned after each use, no exception2) it uses way too much coffee (compared to my old Krups). The reaons: grinds too coarse and uses a basket type filter. Most new coffee makers use cone type filter that extract more flavor from the coffee.3)Grinder whines and works for about half a minute, regardlsee how much coffee it grinds. There is no control to shorten the grinding cycle.4) The carafe is nice , but very hard to pour from. You almost have to hold it up side down to get the last cup.There are few pros, however:1) Keeps coffee fresh and warm for hours2) Easy controlsIt is expensive but not idiot proof. If you forget to put the carafe in place, it will overflow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cusinart Coffee Grind and Brew","review":"I found this prodcut to be the best in it's class.

At first, it seemed to work fine, and I even wrote a very nice review here. But I have had it with this coffee maker. The Brew 'n Pause feature does not work. You remove the caraf, and it just keeps right on pouring. About every other time, it overflows the basket, spilling coffee and grounds all over the counter top. You have to watch it like a hawk right after you start brewing coffee in case this starts to happen. Kind of defeats the purpose of having a timer so coffee is ready when you wake up!Stay away from this overpriced piece of junk. It took me more than a year to accept this reality since I paid so much money, but I finally unplugged it today and said enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price or aggrevation","review":"Everyone save your money. We have own 3 of these cuisinart coffee pots and they are not worth the aggrevation. The first two of an older designed burned out. The last one is redesigned but be prepared to spend quality time with your brewer cleaning it. Coffee \\"gunk\\" builds up from the steam to keep the door from closing not to mention that there are several parts that have to be cleaned each day. The coffee is not any better then their less expensive brand without the grinder. Save yourself the aggrevation and buy a $10 grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible...the WORST Coffeemaker EVER","review":"Like everyone else, I was so excited to purchase this machine. What a tremendous disappointment ... to have the weakest, most plastic-tasting coffee ever. I hated everything about the machine. The design is awful in that you can't see how much water you are putting in unless you shine a light down inside the chamber. I won't address the cleaning/steam build-up issues, as everyone else has mentioned them. Bottom line, I took the coffeemaker back after trying for one month to make it live up to its brand name. I pulled my old faithful Braun out of storage, apologized to it, and am once again enjoying coffee (rather than lukewarm brown water). What was Cuisinart thinking??"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is my first review of a product","review":"This product created enormous messes!!!! Bad functional design, was probably NEVER prototyped.The grinder needs to be absolutely clean and dry even w/ steam (from brewing) gets all inside the grinder.

Neither my wife or I are mechanically inept, but, we never did get this thing to make a cup of coffee. Yes, we filled with water, plugged in, set time/date ground coffee read instructions umpteen times, closed doors 45 minutes later still no coffee. reboxed and going back asap.Looks great, works lousey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic, a pain to clean, good coffee and nice looking.","review":"This is the typical cheaply made plastic coffee maker, hardly worth the price unless you are more concerned with appearance than quality.There are no less than 7 parts to clean after every pot of coffee, what a pain!Makes better coffee than the Melita grind and brew even without the adjustable grind (but requires more beans). The Melita left a plastic taste for a year and promptly broke once the coffee started to taste good.Unit comes with a great thermal caraffe that keeps coffee warm for HOURS without getting too strong.Scott's Opinion - Go with a separate grinder and quality brewer, or get the Melita, suck it up for a year and be really careful with the fragile little plastic clips and catches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I accidentally dropped the carafe and broke the handle. I went to the Cuisinart replacement part website, but no handle available. I called customer service to find out if I could purchase just a handle, and they said they don't offer just handles. I would have to replace the entire pot--at a cost of $48.00. How convenient for them--they make a really cheap handle and don't offer it as a replacement part. This is the last Cuisinart product I will ever buy. In addition, it doesn't pour well--I have to remove the lid every time to pour a cup of coffee. Also, the grinder is a pain to clean--coffee gets into every nook and cranny."},{"rating":"1","title":"cuisinart decanter stinks","review":"The decanter for coffee is designed so poorly , that the coffee comes out extremely slow . There is an inside lip in the decanter that creates a 1 \\" rim that the coffee must travel over before coming out - thus a slow process. If the decanter was a normal one , I would give this coffee maker a 3 out of 5 stars . The other bad thing is it is a little time consuming to clean the grinder after each use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coffeemaker, but not entirely dishwasher safe","review":"We've had this coffeemaker for about 4 years now. We noticed recently that the carafe was no longer keeping heat very long at all, and recently had to purchase a replacement carafe. Do NOT put the carafe in the dishwasher, bottom line.This coffeemaker requires a little bit of effort. You have to clean all of the parts every day. But it's a lot less messy and a lot more accurate than measuring out the grounds and grinding them in a separate container. If you have to have freshly ground coffee, this coffeemaker is perfect for you.As for the carafe, it worked great for the first couple of years we had it. We're going to ignore the manufacturer's directions that it's dishwasher safe and hope that our (quite expensive at 1/3 the total cost fo the coffeemaker!) carafe is as good as the old one used to be if we don't destroy it in the dishwasher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly Complex Design","review":"Coffee makers with a built-in grinder are a good idea. I bought this one to replace a Toshiba model that served us well for many years and made great coffee. In the Toshiba the grinder was in the filter basket allowing you to control the coarsness of the grind by setting the grinding time with a little spring-loaded timer. This Cuisinart has separate grinder and filter basket so the grinder has to blow the ground coffee into the filter basket as well as grind it. Because of this, you have no control over the grind. You also have more parts to clean. Other pros and cons of this machine are well stated by other reviewers. Bottom line: It makes mediocre coffee. It's not worth the money. Buy a separate coffee grinder to use with your coffee maker if you have to. Back to the drawing board, Cuisinart. I want my Toshiba back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This was by far the worst coffee pot I have ever purchased. At first it made fabulous coffee. However, things just never worked correctly after 3 months. It wouldn't continuously brew a full pot of coffee for whatever reason. It was an arduous task to clean it. It was a great day when I got rid of this coffeemaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't judge this junky coffee maker by its beautiful cover","review":"Looks nice, great combination of features. That's how we all get conned into buying this piece of junk. Worst coffee ever - like it came from a vending machine. Flavor was poor no matter what I did, with beans or pre-ground. Coffee was not hot. Adding milk made it easy to immediately gulp without burning. It is the messiest thing. Steam and grounds everywhere - needs to be disassembled and cleaned each time. And the mechanism that holds the filter is clunky - it needs two hands to close, and it pops open like a jack-in-the-box. Coffee grounds splash over the filter and into the coffee pot - do you like grounds in your coffee? I don't. And forget about sliding it under your cabinet, it is way too tall. Oh, and the coffee pours out so slow you'll fall asleep waiting for your cup to fill. And you need to tip it upside down for the last 3 cups which is awkward and drips. Who designed this, Daffy Duck?"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW plus","review":"I would never own another machine. I was shocked to read the negative reviews. I got this item as a wedding present that I registered for here on Amazon.com. I love it. I make 2-3 pots of coffee a day. Yes, you do need to clean out all the parts between brews - but the perfect cup of freshly ground coffee is worth it.I did have a problem with the door. The door latch did fail and I came out to find coffee all over my counter. But it was after two years and approximately 800 brews!! But it has a three year warranty. Cuisinart fixed it and sent it back! Sometimes things just happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drink it fast - coffee does not stay hot","review":"Looks great, makes great coffee, the grind is really loud, but it just doesn't keep the coffee hot!! After 15 minutes the coffee is cold. The carafe is the only item which trys to keep the heat. There is no hot plate. They recommend to fill the carafe with hot water and let it sit to heat up the carafe then make your coffee. But I set a timer in the morning to not have to do steps like that. Horrible, I returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee","review":"This coffeemaker is well worth the money and the time spent on a bit of extra cleanup every day. It makes great, consistent coffee. It keeps it warm for a really long time. Get some Weiman Stainless Steel wipes and keep the outside looking great. Yes, you do have to wash and dry the interior components each day, but I think it's worth it. You can do everything at night before you go to bed, set the timer, and wake up to great coffee. The only issue I have is that it only makes 10 cups. Oh, and the grinder is pretty loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great coffee, but carafe leaks","review":"I loved Cuisineart's thermal coffemaker so much that I bought two more carafes. After two uses, they each leaked -- the gasket between the plastic handle/collar and metal pot failed. CUISINART REFUSED TO STAND BEHIND THEM, REFUSED REPLACEMENT, REFUSED REFUND! Two months later, the carafe that originally came with the coffemaker failed the same way. I have some very expensive useless junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't","review":"I would strongly advise to not buy a grind and brew machine. It is too loud, sounds like an airplane taking off, has way too many components and is difficult to clean, does not keep coffee warm enough and is hard to pour from the karafe.Just grind your beans where they are away from moisture and use a normal coffee pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy!","review":"This coffee brewer is a nightmare.

I used to think that Cuisinart was a great brand. But their grind are brew coffee makers are JUNK!!! My fourth one just broke a few days ago, I have had the same two problems with each one of them.

Terrible coffee. :-(","review":"Sleek, compact design with the built-in grinder and flat-bottomed coffee basket. Carafe is easy to use and unlike some thermal carafes works well keeping the coffee hot. My only design complaint is there's no external fill indicator, making one look inside the water resevoir to try and figure out how much water is there for partial-pots. Not very user-friendly... And when will someone in the coffeemaker design industry figure out that adding little glides or rollers on the botton of the unit would be a blessing for moving it in and out from underneath the overhead cabinets?!!HOWEVER, the point of a coffeemaker is coffee...and the coffee tastes terrible, very bitter and rather weak. I'm returning mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I have never spent this much on a coffee maker and I regret that I did not listen to the warnings in other reviews. During the first 3 weeks, the machine overflowed and leaked 3-4 times...including during a dinner party. The cleaning of multiple parts is an inconvenience and makes me think twice about making a pot....but this would be bearable if not for the unpredictability of the leaking. The pot needs to be set up PERFECTLY or you will have a mess. I like strong coffee but you cannot put too many scoops of beans in the grinder or it will overflow. This is a pain when making a full pot.I have a 12 cup Cuisinart and loved it but wanted a grinding machine so bought this one....big mistake. The coffee is decent when I make a partial pot, but I cant make it strong enough for a full pot or it will overflow. I am switching to the one cup Keurig system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst coffee pot I have ever owned","review":"Buy this one only if your hobby is cleaning up coffee grounds and spills for about 30 minutes a day. This morning, the front door popped open during the grind cycle and blew coffee grounds all over my white counter tops and floor. This is a regular occurrence. This also happened in spite of the duct tape wrapped around the machine to hold it closed. Avoid this coffee maker...run for the exits...call in the experts for an exorcism. (Need I say more?) I Have taped this Cuisinart to the top of my outside garbage can to serve as mute testimony of lousy workmanship and design. The garbage man may not even take it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great coffee, but the machine is a disaster in your kitchen","review":"We are on our second Grind & Brew machine because we love the taste of the coffee, but the product is a piece of crap.

The carafe will keep coffee lukewarm for six hours, and the coffee maker brews at a temperature a little hotter than lukewarm. So... if you enjoy stale, lukewarm coffee... this is the system for you! I drink my coffee fresh and hot, and it's not possible to get a hot cup of coffee with this system. At the price they charge, they should have made the brew temperature adjustable, but they didn't. I'm sure someone at Cuisinart thought he had the brew temperature right, but that is a matter of personal preference. For example, some people think America should be a Marxist nation, and I don't. Do you see how diferent people sometimes are from each other? Sadly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this coffee maker!","review":"HIGH maintainence!

Third, about once a week the door to the basket pops open and I wake up to coffee spewed all over the counter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pain to Clean and Lukewarm Coffee","review":"We got this coffeemaker as a wedding present and used it for a little over a year before I finally got fed up with it and got a new one. There are two major flaws. The first is that a lot of steam goes into the grinding compartment which means it has to be cleaned between each and every pot to keep it from getting all gunked up. Also if you don't use the grinding portion it still has to be occasionally cleaned because the steam collects in there and it will eventually mold and mildew if not cleaned. The other flaw is that it just doesn't get the coffee very hot. If you like cream in your coffee you will have to nuke it. The flavor of the coffee is fine, but the design is very poor. They need to redesign it so that the steam doesn't get into the grinding portion and ditch the thermal carafe for a standard glass one with a burner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is it now?

If you don't want alot of sugar for dessert, you make these in vanilla or chocolate and sprinkle powdered sugar or fresh fruit. Many desserts have so much sugar in their mixes but you make your batter, cook these up in no time at all and your craving for sweets is quite satisfied. I put ours on a cooling rake and then stack them up between wax paper in a tin when they are cool. They stay crisp and if you break a few, save the \\"crunchies\\" and layer some pudding and crunchies for a parfait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can you say easy as pizzelle","review":"This is my 2nd pizzelle press and I would recommend it anyone that wants to start making pizzelles.

Although the pizelles are small-ish (4 inches), but they're evenly baked on both sides.

For a slightly browner cookie I placed the setting on 3.5 and baked for 2.5 min. So far I am happy with the machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes good pizzelles","review":"This pizzelle maker is light years better than my 1940's model which had no heat regulator and was not non-stick.

They were horrible, not thin at all, very cakey. So I went to my tried and true recipe that I got from Mama Leone herself and I had used this recipe with her iron many many times for super thin crispy pizzelles. Not with this iron, they also came out thick. They are also smaller than what I am used to. Very disappointing and I am returning the iron. This may have something to do with the thickeness of the cookie but the latch can be hard to pop up when the cookie is done, very flimsy and I can see this breaking down the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go with the VillaWare","review":"I received this item as a gift and was super excited to use it.

Needless to say, I was disappointed and it's going back. Apparently the VillaWare is the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine melted","review":"Yes, melted. The clasp that closes it melted and I felt it was no longer safe to use. I wasn't using it an insane amount either.

I followed the directions exactly except I didn't brush the grills with oil or anything before I used it and it was great! Nothing sticks. It was kind of hard to judge in the beginning just how much batter to put on the grills but you'll bet the hang of it real quick. I love the small size of this little maker and how quickly it makes the cookies. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I'm not very happy with how cheaply they made the latch to close the lid. I was extra cautious when using it because I read another viewer who complained that it broke right off. I can see this happening if you're not extremely careful. Otherwise, I can't wait to try some of the other recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super easy hot off the griddle pizzelles!","review":"I love this little machine!

This DVD box set is great for the fans of the X-Men movie franchise. You get tons of extras, in addition to the two hit movies! You find over ten hours of behind-the-scenes and trailers to keep you busy!However if you truly want the complete package, then be wary, as while it's great, you may also want to pick up the first DVD prior to 'X-Men 1.5', as that DVD contains a hidden gag reel, preliminary designs for Beast and the Blob, in addition to the Fox special that was aired for the movie. This is if you need everything from the first movie!Also however for all buyers, be wary as there is still another movie in the works, with a possibility of an additional three after 'X3', so there will be more DVDs in the future, including possible re-issues of the movies with even more features, so buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most discs will be scratched.","review":"I give this movie 5 stars.

I actually found the 2nd movie to be better than the first. If you didn't grow up reading the comics, there may be more mutants than you can handle in these two movies. The story is pretty simple, mutants are at best mistrusted by humans. Some like Professer X want to find a way to live peacefully, while others like Magneto want to eliminate homo sapiens altogether.

Callaway sites the stories of millionaires, billionaires, and regular folk like you and me who are \\"so tired we can barely lace up our Velcro sneakers,\\" and shows what we are missing by running so fast. The cartoons by Mary Chambers are absolutely hilarious and the stories are perceptive, witty, and endearing. With lines like \\"even ants have time to attend picnics,\\" and advice on \\"how to live so the preacher doesn't have to lie at your funeral, this is the ideal gift for anyone who is stuck in an unending loop of busyness and fatigue. I couldn't recommend it more highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great supplemental tool","review":"I find these cards to be a wonderful and helpful supplemental teaching tool.

As would be expected they're noun-heavy and I question how common some of these words really are, although it's clear that someone made an effort to pick some of the most common words and that the words are tailored to the specific language (e.g. these French cards have the word for \\"veal\\").This is definitely a good vocab-builder that could fill some of the holes in a beginning learner's vocabulary."},{"rating":"2","title":"K&N Air Filter","review":"While servicing my 97 F250 Diesel I noticed the Air Filter housing was cracked at the base. This pretty much made it totally ineffective at removing any dust/dirt.Considering my options I purchased the K&N; air filter kit to replace the stock system.Installation instructions were well written and easy to follow.

For his subsequent releases, Tito would work very closely with the late Louie Ramirez (their musical partnership would result in some of Tito's best works). \\"Maldades\\" marked the start of Tito Allen's solo career and (along with his 1976 and 1979 releases \\"Feliz Y Dichoso\\" and \\"Untouchable\\") is indispensable for all his fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever Remembered","review":"Forever Remembered says it all.

I was excited to have that timer feature, so I could smell the coffee brewing while I was getting ready in the mornings . . . And imagine my disappointment -- no, horror! -- to discover that the spring-loaded basket that holds the ground beans has now decided to POP OUT while brewing! Meaning, that I now get to hear the coffee spilling onto the element and sizzling there (and I mean the whole darn amount), while dripping off the counter and into the floor.

I was very concerned about the comments regarding cleaning the grinding bay. You do have to clean it after every use but it can be rinsed and put in the dishwasher or just rinsed and dried. However, the effort it takes to clean the unit does not compare to the great coffee that you get.

I have not found a way to make coffee in this thing that I find acceptable.If I use the darkest roast of beans from Starbucks with a third the amount of water the manual of this thing suggests, I will get coffee that I find passable. What an expensive way to make coffee!I feel like it is a waste of money to use this thing, and I can't for the life of me figure out why it makes such weak coffee, but it sucks and I give up. I have started using my roommates french press to make coffee, since I threw away my old coffee maker (it cost about twenty bucks and lasted for several years).I could live with the fact that it is terribly loud and that it is a pain to clean, but to go through all that and have sub-par coffee? No, thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid design","review":"As already noted, you have to clean up the grinder after every pot of coffee. Why? Because steam is allowed into the grinder area during brewing and it becomes totally sopping wet. If you try to take the grinder out before this happens, then the coffee maker stops and beeps at you; some sort safety feature? Really dumb. I'm going to try to rewire the damn thing so the grinder can be removed as soon as it's done grinding, by jumpering out the interlock switch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FANTASTIC COFFEE MAKER","review":"We have had our coffee maker for about 4 years and it has worked perfectly all of this time. It was inexpensive and makes wonderful fresh brewed coffee from beans or pre ground. It turns itself on and shuts itself off. Easy to clean by putting parts in the dishwasher. No worries.The only thing is that it's a little tall for under the counter.We have been delighted with it and are about to buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"I saw some pretty bad reviews for this product after I bought it but I like it. Yes, you need to clean the grinder, the filter container and the pot but you would need to clean that on any grinding coffee pot anyway. Yes, the grinder is loud, but aren't all grinders. There isn't a way to control the consistancy of the grounds but they have always been very fine and produced good coffee.If anything its a bit too fine. I want to buy a permanent filter for it but I am worried the grounds may go through it. Has anyone come across this problem?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart DGB500BK Grind and Brew, Black","review":"Several of us have purchased this coffee grinder/brewer. Some prefer the carafe, but we like the hot plate with the pot. That is personal preference. Either way, the grinder/brewer has been wonderful and we have enjoyed the product and found no pitfalls thus far!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Design Flaw - 300 model better","review":"My main problem with this product is that after about a little less than a year, no matter how often you wash it, some of the ground up coffee somehow works its way into the sliding mechanism that lets you take out the filter. The result is having to pry the thing open careflully each time to try to get the filter out, and because it is flimsily made, you are very likely to break something in the process. We even completely cleaned out the \\"coffee sludge\\" from out of the sliding mechinism so it slid freely again only to have it stick on the very next brew.Do yourself a favor and purchase the DGB-300 model. The design is much better. There is no gap between the grinder part and the filter because it is one piece. Much better. We were very happy with the 300 model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Coffee Maker","review":"I was given this coffee maker as a gift land thought it was great until I had to clean it. But the worst part of the product is it won't last much more than a couple years. First one refused to work after 2 years. Being STUPID I bought a second one because I like fresh ground coffee. This one was a different design than the first but they haven't improved the cleaning process or the technology because here it is two years later and it quit grinding again and I am looking for another coffee pot and I guarantee it will not be another Cuisinart!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst coffee maker ever to CLEAN almost impossible","review":"This is worst coffee maker I ever saw to clean CAN Not take apart to clean.

Would never buy one like this again not for this amount of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cheap product under a quality name","review":"This coffee maker would not command the price if it were not marketed under the Cuisinart name. I would not buy it again.Several design flaws:- No temperature control on the warming plate. The coffee cooks after a fairly short preriod.- no sight glass to judge water in the brew chamber. One must look over the top of the device into a dark chamber to see water level, which is not easy if you are under six foot tall.- Maker is too tall to fit under normal cupoards. It is noisy as well.Beside the design flaws, it is cheaply made. Light weight plastic parts and poor tolerance control make me feel it is not a long-lasting appliance.It does make a decent cup of coffee, and it is fun to grind whole beans and brew in one step. Too bad Cuisinart has chosen to market a product unworthy of the name."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"We were really excited when we discovered this coffee maker and couldn't wait to try the first cup of freshly brewed coffee. What a disappointment! After following all the directions and anxiously waiting for our first sip we were disappointed to find that the coffee tasted like hot, brown water. No flavor at all. We then tried to double the amount of beans with the result of a weak flavored coffee. We even bought the strongest beans, still no luck. The basket wasn't big enough to put in the amount of beans required for 8 cups of decent coffee. After calling Cuisinart and getting no help we decided to return the coffee maker. It was really too bad as we really wanted the maker to work. We liked everything about it, except that it couldn't make coffee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic at first, but...","review":"...after two months, a piece of the filter broke off. After 3 months, the carafe cracked and sent coffee and glass spilling everywhere.

No thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cleaning nightmare","review":"A normal coffee maker requires a quick rinse; this machine requires a wash, rinse and a thorough drying of the grinding unit. You can't just rinse the grinding unit because the fine coffee grounds need to be washed out.If it wasn't for the fact that we spent nearly $100 for this unit, I would throw it away.SAVE YOUR MONEY - DON'T BUY IT"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst coffee machine I've ever purchased","review":"This coffee machine brews the weakest coffee I've ever had- doesn't grindthe beans well and to clean it makes you wan't to store it in the garbagecan.

The first one lasted about a year and a half, and the others well, we are a little under 6 months. I have to replace this one AGAIN because the flip top lid where you fill the water chamber and put the coffee beans in completely broke off, and I now have to hold the lid down until the pot is brewed. The last 2 we had, after a few months (and several deep cleanings I might add) would take almost and hour to brew a pot. My parents also used to have one, and theirs completely overflowed and spilled all over their counter and onto their hardwood floors!!!! I am buying the Capresso Luxe which is more expensive, but if it lasts longer, and it is easier to clean, then it is worth it. Please don't waste you money because this product WILL NOT last more than a year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Electrical Problems - pain to clean","review":"I enjoy this coffee-maker but didn't realize how much trouble it is to clean it. You've got to clean out the coffee-grinder, gold filter, filter top, filter container, and caraffee after each brew of cofee. The idea of freshly ground, freshly brewed coffee is nice but I don't think it makes the coffee taste that much better.The worst part about this is that it keeps breaking. We've alrady sent it back a few times and it keeps shorting out. It will smoke, overheat, and stop working. Cuisinart makes you pay for shipping both ways.I recommend getting something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"ULTIMATE DISAPPOINTMENT !","review":"After three mornings of inferior coffee, I will be boxing up my new purchase and returning it. The coffee is weak. I have increased the amount of beans and that has helped only slightly. I love hot coffee (nickname....asbestos mouth) but the coffee remaining in the glass carafe becomes so hot, as to be scalding. If you pre-program to have coffee ready when you get up in the morning you will not need an alarm clock! The grinder is so loud that it woke us with a start and sent the cat running. I agree with the other reviewers who did not like the mess in the grinder (damp grounds)and the many parts to be washed and dried. Modern technology should make our mornings easier. I thought this was the answer.......but it was the ULTIMATE DISAPPOINTMENT."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had been a happy DGB300 customer for 3 years, BUT...","review":"When my DGB300 finally broke down (electronics stopped working) and the warranty was over, I was happy to find out that Cuisinart had come out with a \\"new\\" model. I assumed everything would be better. Unfortunately - I have been very un happy. First off - I can never see the water level. The internal marker is never visible early in the morning when I am trying to make coffee. Secondly, I had hoped that the new coffee maker would be \\"quieter\\"! Did not happen. Thirdly, I miss the \\"set-temp\\" feature. The 500 coffee is just not as hot as the 300. Lastly, and most importantly it is a mess to clean. There are so many nooks and cranny's that you just can't get to.I am not a happy customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOATHE this machine","review":"I had owned the old Grind & Brew (twice!), and my husband thought the new one might be better (we both didn't like the cleaning). This one is EVEN WORSE. I completely agree with the other reviewers that it's a true SOB to clean...and the coffee isn't good enough to justify the time spent doing so. A maid in my own kitchen, indeed! For the $$ they charge for this piece of junk, Cuisinart really should do some SERIOUS R&D on how to make a Grind & Brew machine that can be dismantled to clean all the crap that gets stuck on the little shelf below and behind the brew basket, not to mention the toxic-looking waste that gums up beneath the grinder. Gimme my old Grind & Brew ANYDAY! But, I think I'm going to jump on the vacuum pot bandwagon - America's Test Kitchens said they were great, and that's enough for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Design Nightmare","review":"I have owned two of these things [I know, my fault, but I thought the first one was a fluke basied on Cuisinart's reutation]. The first one laste a year befre the grinder just quit working over night. I had to go 20 miles to their recommended repair people to fnd out thaat Cuisinart doesn't make parts for this, so it was landfill. Bought another because I liked the concept o 2-in-1. The ground coffee often doesn't make it into the basket. The grinder NEVER gets all of the coffee out, so I have to use extra. It has to be cleaned every other day to function at all (I don't have to do that with my regular grinder). And the button that lets you pull out the pot in the middle of brewing often sticks open and the coffee goeas all ovver the countertop. Never again! And I'm questioning ever buying any other Cuisinart product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisinart Crapfest","review":"The Grind-n-Brew is for you if you literally have nothing else to do but make coffee, and you enjoy getting dirty. If you are a negative person, and you need something to get you off on the right foot, so you can feel miserable all day, the Grind-n-Brew is for you. If it were not for the fact that it is cheaply made and over-priced, it would be a fine coffee maker for people who do not mind taking 20 minutes out of their morning to clean (that's right you have to dismantle it and clean it EVERY time you use it) their coffee maker BEFORE getting a cup of coffee. However, on top of being poorly engineered, it is poorly built. Maybe that's an up-side. I can't wait for mine to break. It comes dangerously close everytime I need to interact with it. Oh, and as an aside, it makes crappy coffee. The place you put the beans is so small, you'd better plan on using espresso roast if you want to taste coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible coffee","review":"After about 4 months, the coffee maker did not work correctly. Some days it works, some days it spits grinds all over the place, some days the filter door won't close. The pieces don't fit well together, thus sometimes it dribbles coffee all over the counter. Cleaning it properly is a chore. Avoid this Cuisinart and buy a Braun instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"One major flaw","review":"This coffee maker is a great concept, but really poor design. As others have said, the major flaw is that the steam gets backed up into the grinder forming a sludge that is difficult to clean. And you can forget about making back to back pots of coffee unless you take it apart and clean the grinder chamber and filter basket each time. And then you have to COMPLETELY dry the grinder parts so that the beans won't get wet when grinding.The coffee does taste good, but there is no choice for grinder setting and I like a course ground. The caraffe on the glass model is great. It's big and does not drip. The coffee temperature is also good, nice and hot and I like the 1-4 cup feature to make it extra hot. Unfortunately I am returning the pot because it is not worth the extra time and effort for cleanup. I wanted something automatic to be time saving and this pot is the opposite."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"HAVEN'T LOST ENOUGH MONEY IN THE STOCK MARKET?

The whole unit gets all gooped up with old grounds and sludge from the steam the whole unit needs to be able to be put in a dish water or dunked under water to clean right. unless you like to live with the gunk that builds up everywhere even after one brew, i guess you are ok then. It brews an average pot of coffee and now the pump quit working and have to restart it 6 times to brew a whole pot. I am going to buy a different type of grind and brew this time. I love coffee but don't feel like paying a maid to clean this thing everytime. detailing a car takes less time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say \\"high maintenance\\"?","review":"This seems like a wonderful idea. Program your coffeemaker to grind and brew, wake up to fresh coffee. What could be better? Not much (at least to me when I'm stumbling out of bed.)BUT...while I love the idea of this coffeemaker, the reality's a little different. It's a fussy, tempermental little machine. First of all, it's impossible to keep clean. I have the black model, and gooey coffee gunk disappears into the crevices. You can remove some, but not all of the parts -- so cleaning this sucker requires a strong will, cleverness and time.The other frustrating thing is that this coffee machine is incredibly sensitive. God forbid you don't place the filter in the EXACT right position -- you'll end up with grounds everywhere or hot coffee all over the counter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good coffee pot, but...","review":"I have owned this coffee pot for a few years now. Overall it is good. The biggest problem is that the grinding is so loud, that it will wake the dead. If you live in an apartment, condo or townhome, you probably do not want to get one of these. It will wake up your neighbor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied customer","review":"I bought this coffee maker about 6 months ago in spite of reading the review about the difficulty of cleaning. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it's no big deal. There are four pieces besides the carafe: the grinder basket, its lid, the brewing basket and its lid. To wash them, I rinse them in water and then every few times, throw them in the dishwasher. I got the same results when I soaked them for an hour in dishwasher detergent and water. As far as the recent review which mentions the electrical problems, I haven't seen anything like that. The only problem I have with the machine is that it is too tall to fit under my upper cabinets, so I have to move it when I want to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"I read all the reviews and I just don't get it. Takes a few seconds of your time to clean, haven't had the carafe leak, coffee is hot.......I had the first Cuisinart Grind and Brew and I think this one is a improvement. Easier to clean, pause and brew feature is better as the old one had a very flimsy mechanism. As for using the gold tone filter, I've never seen one on any machine that does the work of a paper filter. Didn't even bother trying it. I admit adding water to the old one was easier as far as seeing how much but it's not as if if it's difficult to add the right amount.Every coffee machine needs to be played with until you get the right strength. I like mine fairly strong and the first few times it was too weak for me. Never had the plastic taste some reviewers referred to but I cleaned the machine before using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good coffee, Bad coffeemaker","review":"We have used the Cuisinart grind and brew for two years and it has been a terrible disappointment. It has so many parts to clean daily that it takes 20-30 minutes of cleaning if you use the grinder. Everything is wet and coffee grounds cover all the parts, which won't work properly if you don't clean them after each use. I called customer service re leaking and the door to the basket compartment not opening and closing - what a waste of my time!! I have never been treated so rudely by customer service anywhere prior to my experience with Cuisinart. Don't bother!! And of course the great three- year warranty is worthless unless you follow their stringent cleaning and filter-changing guidelines every 60 uses, so forget that!! We went back to using our handy, cheap grinder so we don't have to take the entire thing apart after every use. If you have no life, go for it - otherwise, find a better grind and brew machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"getting a 2nd chance","review":"I have had this machine for quite sometime and after days of reading reviews and checking on other coffee machines I have decided to go w/ another of the same. I have been reading the reviews of the unfortunate for this machine and have never heard so many babies in my life. I truly appreciate the fact that everyone \\"loves a full flavored, hot cup of coffee\\". However it sounds as though as a child everyones mother did all the cleaning and they never learned how to clean anything. Everyone has to clean once and a while....You can't just pour water into the machine and say presto, put a little work into it and stop all the whining already you all sound like children. I like my machine and will buy another one.....it as with anything has flaws, but with all the pros and few cons I like this machine.

I even brushed off my concerns when it started acting \\"wonky\\" a months after we got it. If it didn't run properly, I assumed I forgot to turn on the timer. If it stopped halfway through brewing I thought maybe I didn't fill it properly. I kept making excuses for the erratic behavior until it abandoned me about 16 months after our love affair began. After the initial feeing of mourning, anger set in. There is no way a coffee maker that cost this much should die so soon! (over $100 on sale in 2004!) NO MORE over priced gadgets that are all flash and no substance. I went back to the store and bought the Bunn coffee maker that has been faithfully brewing my morning coffee for over two years without a hitch - and cost about the same!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Coffee Lover","review":"Dear Cuisinart,Great Concept, Great Look but why can't this wonderful idea deliver DEEP, RICH, HOT, GREAT QUALITY coffee? It is amazing that you would put so much time and design ideas into a coffee maker without thinking about WHY YOUR CUSTOMER WOULD DECIDE TO BUY THIS UNIT: I grind high quality beans in order to enjoy a rich high quality cup of coffee at home. This coffeemaker delivers weak, warm but not hot coffee. Clean up is not as bad as most are saying and the grinder is not that loud, but we want great (not average) coffee from your coffee maker. Unfortunately, the Braun flavor select unit I used to own for years does not grind it's own beans, but I am returning the Cuisinart for the Braun today. (PS: You never answered my email or call regarding these issues.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing coffeemaker","review":"I received this coffemaker as a Christmas present last year, and the quality of the coffee is just disappointing. It seems weak and always has a burned smell/taste to it, even the first cup but especially after it's been in the pot for more than a few minutes. I've tried using more beans, less beans, ground coffee, filtered water, bottled water, tap water, wire filter, white paper filters, brown paper filters.....but I've never hit on a combination that give me a cup of coffee without the burned taste and smell.As for cleanup, it's not a big deal unless you're making multiple pots of coffee. Just pop the parts in the dishwasher. I've never had the filter door pop open while brewing as others have. The grinder is VERY noisy.Overall, it's just a disappointment for the money.

This doesn't seem like such a big deal until you realize you've just spent 10 minutes cleaning the whole entire machine in order to set up coffee to be made in the morning, then going to bed smelling like old coffee grounds...We're taking this machine back and getting the Capresso CoffeeTeam w/ Burr Grinder, as the reviewers say you don't have to clean the grinder.We have the version with the stainless steel thermal carafe, which looks great and doesn't burn the coffee, but you also don't walk into the room and get that fresh-made coffee smell that makes getting up at 6:30am worth it.

Actually, \\"Hated,\\" is a little strong, as it did make a fine cup of coffee. \\"Irritated,\\" is probably a better word to describe my reaction. Making coffee is not that difficult, except for having to push some needless buttons to open the thing, but clean-up was a hassle. The grinder, (Two parts), and the brew basket, (Three parts), have to be completely clean and dry to make another pot. As coffee is about the only vice I have left, I drink a lot of coffee, and on weekends make multiple pots.

In fact, I can't make the same pot of coffee twice!!! I have been using the same beans every time and sometimes it is weak and other times it is strong!! The cleanup is not so bad, considering it grinds too, but the condensation from the hot water makes the coffee grinder a little messier than a separate grinder. I am ready to junk this one and buy a plain jane coffee maker and go back to my regular old grounds. It is too unpredictable and it's a little embarrassing when you have company....it looks like I don't know how to make a good cup of coffee. One last thing is that even though it is a 12 cup coffee maker, the amount of beans that you would need is more than fits in the grinder!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess!","review":"If you ever like to brew a pot after one is finished, don't buy this coffee maker! It is a complete mess to clean up. Each time I brew a pot I have to wash and thoroughly dry two pieces to the grinder, the carafe, and three pieces to the basket! How inconvenient is that? When the maker is brewing the coffee, moisture gets into the grinder, so you cannot simply \\"clean it every once in a while\\" as another reviewer commented. It has to be cleaned every time as it gets wet inside every time.Don't buy it - I'm returning for a refund and going back to a separate grinder and brewer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it ...","review":"We've been looking for a grind & brew with timer forever and thought this was the answer...Unfortunately, water condensation causes the beans to become sticky and clog up the channel to the filter.

It doesnt matter if you bought it 4 months ago as I did, and have problems, there is nothing they will do for you. And let me tell this I have contacted Cuisinart 4 times the first 2 months after I bought it, it has leaked water constantly out the bottom of the unit itself, they will do nothing, why because it was manufactured 4 years ago. I paid 100 for mine, the cheap 20 dollar makers, brew better coffee than this one, and last longer than 2 months. I gave it one star only because I had to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This coffeemaker has a decibel level which seems to approach SST-level. We have a one story ranch house with the bedroom on the other end of the house from the kitchen. When I used this product, it woke my wife up when it was grinding the coffee. This was replacing a Melitta Mill and Brew which did not wake my wife up.The other disappointment is the inability to adjust the coarseness of the grind. Thus, you need to vary the amount of coffee beans or water to adjust. This is not very efficient.The Melitta let you adjust the grind level.The Cuisinart is now on its way back to the seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"good cup of coffee","review":"longest lasting coffee maker we have had - just replaced first one as it was knocked off the counter while painting - no fault of it's own :-) Only drawback is the grinding chamber must be cleaned after every use so more up-keep required than other makers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks and Runied My Tile Countertop","review":"I have owned two of the Cuisinart Grind and Brew Coffee Makers, the first one was actually better than the last, DGB500BK, it leaked all the time and ruined my tile countertop and had to have it completely regrouted.

I take careful precaution to make sure the basket and caraffe are properly in place but three times I have woken up to coffee and grinds spilled out all over my kitchen counter and floor because sometime during the grinding session, the basket was wiggled loose and opened.Not only that, it is a mess to clean, as you have to take off about 6 parts and clean them extensively, especially the grinder (even when you don't use it, you have to clean it because it fills up with condensation).Never again will I buy a grinder/coffee maker. It's better to grind your own and just fill it with grounds. Trust me, it's not worth the dissappointment and frustration of waking up with a huge mess to clean and no coffee to drink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor performer in the realm of flavor...& that's everything w/coffee eh?","review":"I know exactly why this unit gets consistent 3 star reviews...the water is rushed thru the filter basket too fast to leech the optimum flavor from the coffee grounds. I beta-tested/compared to my KRUPS unit, which allows the water to swim in the bean much longer. Temperature-wise the CUISINART DGB500 wins by 10 degrees, but that doesn't matter, the coffee still tasted like tea unless I put about 35% more bean than a regular coffee maker. Great idea, but using that much more bean over a long haul means you might as well head to McCoffee for the $1.70 cup of GOLD COAST every day. You'll spend a lot less time cleaning parts that way too! Face it, it's all about the flavor if you're a serious coffee drinker...this unit will only frustrate the serious java-lover's palette. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"complicated & difficult to clean","review":"Picked this up instead of the Melitta Grind & Brew. After two years our previous Melitta had pretty much fallen apart, so I was looking for something better assembled.The Cuisinart boasts easier cleaning and a 12 cup capacity. Both are, IMHO, not true. The machine has more parts than the Melitta, and gets dirty *inside* the machine as well. Brutal. Furthermore, while the caraffe can hold 12 cups, the grinding chamber can barely hold 6 heaping scoops of coffee. So, unless you like your coffee to look like tea, you *ain't* gettin' 12 cups of coffee out of this puppy.Finally, forget ever accurately measuring the water - the fill chamber is an ergonomic disaster.So, we're back to the Melitta Grind & Brew, and will stick with it for the foreseeable future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"My family is a Notre Dame Family so I purchased this book for my mom.

Okay, it'll grill sandwiches and toast them quickly but as others have noticed there are a few issues:1. Most bread is too big and will hang out the side. This isn't a big deal as you can just put it in the middle of the sandwich maker, and you won't get that picture perfect diagonal cut but then you can only make 1 sandwich at a time.2. If you want to make a sandwich with many toppings - cheese, meat, tomato, cucumber, etc. The lid won't close, and you'll have to hold it shut.Other than those two main issues it's a pretty great little machine.

The Grill works fine but I find that the plates are too small for regular slice bread. My daughter likes to make grilled cheese on this and she usually adds tomatoes and sometimes other ingredients as well. Since the plates are so small the bread hangs on the sides of the grill and if she uses more than one slice of cheese it melts all over the machine. Especially the back where its hard to get it clean. This would have been perfect if it had larger plates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy,Messy","review":"Thought this would be good for my teenager to make grilled cheese sandwiches for herself but apparently 1 slice of cheese is too much, this overflowed everywhere and made a huge mess.

I used it only rarely, then discovered I could make quesadillas with it (as long as the tortilla is folded in half) and began using it regularly.

But, all of a sudden, large flakes of teflon began coming off. I reported this to Cuisinart, asking if I could purchase replacement plates. The answer was no. They also didn't offer to replace the unit. So, I threw it away. I generally like Cuisinart products.

It looks the same. But noooo! The wells for the meat filling are so deep that when the sandwich bread is put in the space, it falls over the center ridge spilling the contents out the sides. It toasts very unevenly (I should have paid attention to a previous review.) And worst of all, it only \\"seals\\" the sandwich in the middle instead of all sides. You end up with four triangle sandwiches sealed on one side only. My Snakmaster gave me a triangle pocket sandwich, sealed all the way around. I expected more from Cuisinart. Sigh....."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to use and clean","review":"I thought this would be a great substitute for grilling sandwiches on the stove, but there are two serious drawbacks: the grill is divided into sections which are smaller than any normal piece of bread, so you have to cut up the bread to fit ; cleaning it is a bear because there are so many ridges and hard-to-reach areas.

I've made sandwiches with no glitches several times over the past couple of weeks, and I've enjoyed adding pickles, smoked ham and salsa to the basic \\"slice o' cheese\\" to please more adult palates.

Personally, I did not like the book that much and the author's style of writing did not help me to enjoy it. Mariano Azuela had a very unique writing style. Sometimes it became confusing because he would change verb tense for a few pages. He never seems to stay in one place for that long of a time and that also makes the book very confusing.In some places in the book, he has too many details and it makes it hard to see the big picture. But, in other places, he has too few details and it makes the big picture too confusing and hard to understand. But, in many places, he just tries to use verbiage I think in order to make the book longer, which I would certainly not do.

It is, by no means, \\"just another war-filled history story.\\" It's an easy read, I finished it cover to cover in just a day and a half, and there's an actual story-line to follow, unlike with so many history tales which are merely accounts of battle.

I Focal Point, Tracy shows you to identify what your focal point is in each area of your life and then asks you to direct all of your energies with laser like focus. Focus is like a laser beam. Just like a laser beam can cut through steel when properly focused and directed, focus as descibed in Focal Point can help you cut through barriers that have been holding you back to achieving your goals.I have a lot of books that I have read and given away. I keep all of Brian Tracy's book and Focal Point is one that I refer to again and again.Good, no, excellent work Mr. Tracy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Read","review":"This book is a very easy read and helps you re-focus.

Like the title beastie....this sucks! Hank would have been particularly mortified."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Campy, Not Scary Just Stupid","review":"While there were a few decent \\"Jaws\\" rip-off's (Joe Dante's \\"Piranha\\" for one), this is certainly not one of them. This film fails despite its Cast of American Film Royalty. I've read accounts of how late-in-life John Huston needed the money, that Shelley Winters took any role she was offered, and that Bo Hopkins was dying to be a leading man. But Henry Fonda, for God's sake, what was he thinking ? Probably the same thing that the Screenwriters were thinking - nothing. The premise of a giant octopus gone mad by an evil corporation's greed is as old as dirt but the conclusion of Shamu enjoying squid for supper was, to say the least, unique. This dud joins such other infamous 1970's \\"Creature Features\\" as \\"Frogs,\\" \\"The Swarm,\\" and \\"Barracuda\\" as cinematic chum that is best avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie Review","review":"Both of these movies were made in the 1970's. The 'Ants' video has pretty good special effects and a decent story. 'Tentacles' is about the same. It is a good movie if you like \\"B\\" type movies, and if you don't spend too much money on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real big embarassment","review":"Like one of the other reviewers, I had just finished watching this on AMC, and I came back with a big stomach ache. This movie is a total disgrace. John Huston, Shelley Winters, etc. really embarass themselves big time with the horrible acting. The special effects are really bad Hollywood style. It's obvious that this film was made on a low budget, but I have seen my share of low budget films that are much better than this. Tentacles also suffers from a complete lack of originality. The maker of this film had this idea that if Jaws did so well in the theatres, lets rip off that film, and instead of a shark that goes on a killing rampage, make it an octopus, and hope that the theatres will be just as jam-packed, but instead the theatres were half-empty. Never watch this film unless you can find a paper bag in handy. And if you're wondering of another movie that should have been made fun of by Tom Servo, Crow & Co. on Mystery Science Theater 3000, it should be Tentacles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Worth It for One Nightmarish Scene","review":"If you've read the other reviews, you already know how bad this \\"movie\\" is.The only really scary moment is when the sole survivor of a nighttime encounter with said monster aboard a yacht or cabin cruiser is twisted around & lifted into the air by the octopus, as if she were a trophy. This one scene is very disturbing / frightening.I don't know how they got the actress to do this incredibly creepy scene.That was one really pissed-off octopus!This one scene should have been saved for a \\"real reel\\" feature, and the rest should have been burned up forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Jaws\\" with eight arms","review":"Just as the hoopla of \\"Jaws\\" was dying down, we got \\"Tentacles\\". Great cast - Henry Fonda, Shelly Winters, Bo Hopkins, Claude Akins, and John Huston. A San Diego community is terrorized by a giant octopus, and it's passable fare for those who aren't too critical. Could have been much better, but the trouble is that most of the story (and most of the scenes) try to ape \\"Jaws\\", instead of trying to create a story of it's own. As a result I have a hard time trying to get into a movie that draws heavily on another one. I was a bit disappointed that Shelly Winters didn't have a heroic underwater scene like in \\"The Poseidon Adventure.\\" That might have enlightened things a little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, even by Drive In standards","review":"I definitely have fonder memories of what was going on in my car at the drive-in than what was going on up on the movie screen. I believe my date's name was Jody and the movie (second on the bill) was TENTACLES.The only thing I remember were the puppet killer whales tearing a real octopus apart for the finale (a dead octopus, from what I've read--but this was a European film, right?).The only reason I'm writing a review for this movie--in the off-chance that you'll actually watch it--is to share some trivia: all of Henry Fonda's scenes were shot in his backyard. He agreed to do this piece of crap as long as they paid him and HE DIDN'T HAVE TO LEAVE HOME! Is that hilarious? He just walked out to his backyard, shot all his scenes on his own lawn furniture (most on a dummy phone, as I recall), and picked up a check.You're going to put more effort into watching this movie than Henry Fonda did APPEARING in it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"JAWS\\" rip-off from the director of an \\"EXORCIST\\" rip-off.","review":"A miserable sea pest that leaves its victims as skeletons washed up on the shore turns out to be none other than a giant octopus. This unintentionally funny suspense melodrama was meant to cash in on the success of JAWS, but it didn't quite duplicate the success of that film, despite the presence of four gifted Hollywood veterans: John Huston, Henry Fonda, Shelley Winters, and Bo Hopkins. Surprisingly, the quartet manages to maintain their dignity. With all of its deficiencies, TENTACLES is still not a total waste, and does, in fact, manage to produce a certain amount of entertainment, even if it is the wrong kind. A camp lovers delight. At any rate, it's better than director Hellman's notorious EXORCIST/ROSEMARY'S BABY rip-off, BEYOND THE DOOR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Garbage","review":"In 1978, my dad, a USAF Major and WC-130 pilot, was given orders to report for duty at Andersen AFB in Guam. Once we got situated, we noticed that there were three movie theaters on base, two indoor and one outdoor with amphitheater seating. At the time I was 8 years old and was really excited to see this movie at the outdoor base theater which at the time I thought was the greatest thing to come out on the cinema screen since \\"Star Wars.\\" A few years ago, I saw this \\"film\\" (using the term rather loosely) on AMC and thought to myself, \\"what was I thinking back then?\\" The acting was horrible, the effects were at best Jr High Schoolish, and overall wasted about two hours of my life watching this garbage .

This time when I took them out of the box I immediately dabbed some super glue on the connection between the chord and the jack. This solved that problem.

What was interesting is I pulled up taxiation data from Mellon's time, Kennedy, Reagan and George W. Bush. In every instance revenues went up. The unfortunate side was that often spending then rose faster. In the last year and 1/2 of Bush's presidency revenues were decreasing. It should be noted that we were sliding into a significant recession; the result of which people are still parcelling out blame.

A pain to clean --there is no filter--good for environment, but one must scoop wet grounds out with hand. I tried pulling the stopper to loosen grounds but worse, the grounds all came flying out. The pot does not stay on long enough. I land up drinking cool coffee after 30 minutes. I am impatient and think it took too long to brew (my Delonghi percolater was fastest). Too pricey for not being perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fifth Horsemen sticks to your hand like a cat's claws","review":"This book reads fast. I specially liked how Gregg Gonzalez blends history with fiction. My compliments to the author for his painstaking research. I felt that as I was reading the book I was also reading a history book. The book is rich in detail, making it easy to actually hear the horse hoofs passing by and hard to drop the book until you find out.... This is exactly why I say that this book clings to your hand like a Cat's claws. The plot of the story makes non-belivers in legends into true belivers. I also liked the many twists of the story making second guessing the author virtually impossible. I definetely recommend this book for anyone who likes adventure, fiction, and a good frightening story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Humor and Chills!","review":"When I first bought a copy of this book I expected it to be a horror story-which it is-but it has an added bonus...it's also very funny! Don't get me wrong now, it's a very dark kind of humor, but nothing too corny or too bloodthirsty. I'd give it a PG-13 rating in terms of adult content, although it certainly has its very weird and freaky moments. The Headless Horseman is very wicked, and the characters who try to hunt him down are a peanut gallery, ranging from wacky professors and priests to college drop-outs and trigger-happy cops. The plot is excellently twisted and then unwound at a lightening pace at the end. You'll need to catch your breath at the conclusion of this one - I felt like the Headless Horseman had just chased me down the street."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Miserable Result of Classic Meets D-Movie","review":"A seemingly intelligent reevaluation of Irving's classic short story, this well-begun adventure into what appears to be an elaborate string of murders quickly decomposes into a schizophrenic puree of mystery, zombie fiction, scifi, and slasher horror. Rather than develop a sensible plot, this revolting adaptation relies on every horror movie cliche to propel its quickly sinking storyline. When every last miserable detail is shoved under the door, no room is left for sensibility, a simple multi-dimensional, freezing of time excuse is given for why this plot makes absolutely no sense. Read the first two thirds and then put it on the shelf. Whatever ending you create in your mind will invariably be more intriguing than the sloppy, campy conclusion of this pedestrian deflowering of a brilliant member of the American canon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne B. Real DVD Review","review":"Although the DVD does works fine, it is not exactly what I was looking foe to show in my classroom. It started off slow and I am afraid I would lose my students attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here","review":"This is basically a video of Oxford record store owners talking about their memories of Radiohead. In between, these memories are gaps in voice over filled with unconnected scenes of Oxford. I didn't notice any Radiohead music. And there was very little interview with band members. If you have done enough reading about the band to know that they were originally called \\"On a Friday\\" then you won't learn anything new here. This video suffers because of the \\"Unauthorized\\" Lable."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 words","review":"i have 4 words to sum up this documentary. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY...Just to give you a heads up, there is not one Raiohead song played throughout the whole DVD. You will see one guy with bad achne talking about the band the whole time, and a bunch of pictures and film shots of people walking around the cities of UK...Please, dont bother with this..i am a very dedicated Radiohead fan, and i was very sad that i spent the money i did on this DVD (which doesnt even have a menu)...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly disappointed","review":"Ick, I wanted to turn it off within the first 5 mins.

It's unofficial, so there are no interviews with the band, Radiohead is not even on the soundtrack...nothing even remotely worthwhile. Do not waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I was not really satisfied with this DVD. Just the whole fact that it was unauthorized basically ruined the whole thing. You don't hear any Radiohead music once the whole documentary. Also, there is only a few footage of Radiohead actually talking. Its basically just a bunch of pictures of the band, with other music to it. There really isn't too much stuff in here either that i did not already know about the band, and they dont even go into the albums in depth. Unless you are a crazed Radiohead fan like myself, there really is no need to own this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good instruction","review":"It gives realistic tips for someone just getting into long range shooting.

Bites the big one ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreeing with Mr. Sonnenberg","review":"I have to agree with Mr. Sonnenberg's review of this book. I think it's geared mainly for the beginner shooter. I also think it's over-priced since half the book consists of ballistic tables that I will never use. A serious shooter other than a beginner should already have their own ballistic charts for their rifles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Almost half of this book is balistics tables, probably for cartridge and bullet combinations you are not shooting.The rest of the book is mostly geared to the beginning shooter, but the information is not very good. For instance, the authors suggest using scope bases with the built in windage adjustments. The authors must have about zero experience with these bases, which are known for unintentionally allowing your zero to shift. I don't know of any military or lawenforcment tactical shooter, or any civilian long range shooter using the scope bases and rings suggested in the book. The best shooters are using solid steel bases secured to the rifle with over sized screws.Also, there is no up to date information on long range rifles, gunsmithing, or modern cartridge and bullet design.A waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jim Sonnenberg's 99% right","review":"Jim has (almost) hit the nail on the head - for the \\"not so experienced\\" long range shooter there are however one or two pearls contained in the text. Would I buy this again? maybe, but not at this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Basic","review":"Very very basic book, most of the book is ballistic info for rounds but its not nearly complete. youll be much happier buying a book for long range shooting, this book barely goes into detail. this was a rushed cookie cutter publication, theres way better books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Both and educational and critical look at what it takes to both get on, and stay on target at long range, would recommend to those looking to get started in long range shooting, however keep in mind that it can be done on a cheaper budget than this book suggests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply the worst Star Trek movie made","review":"This was simply the worst of the Trek films. Aside from the horrible effects, the \\"God\\" complex that seems to grip the crew, unbelievable acting, and poor character development,the whole movie had a \\"Nimoy did it so why can't I\\" attitude. As a long time Trek fan I only have this video to complete my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"This bomb was a dud!","review":"Stupid, patronizing, poorly directed exploitation of Star Trek fans. The 'coming attractions' was the best part of this particular visit to the theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately one for the true Trekie!","review":"Everyone seems to like to dog this movie, but I actually think it's pretty good. Just like II, V has the feel of an episode from the original series. For those who don't know, this movie, much like Wrath of Kahn, is derived from an original series episode. The episode that it derives the story from is \\"The Way to Eden\\", arguably one of the worst of the original series. However, unlike the original episode, this version actually has some direction and quality. You may not like this one the first time through, but watch it again a few more times and you'll probably start to like it. Sure, the plot is a little far fetched, but hey it's a science fiction movie. Let your imagination do the driving the movie will be much more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good compared to the others.","review":"I am a big trek fan. But this movie was a mistake. I like what Leonard Nimoy said about it though. In \\"I AM SPOCK\\" he basically tells everybody not to blame Bill Shatner for it, because he believes Bill is a great director, but that the fault lies in the very weak storyline. Well who am I to argue with Leonard Nimoy? This is a very lame storyline if there ever was one, I won't waste anyone's time running over it. (But I do agree with the people who said that Bill shouldn't have directed. This was definatly an ego issue for him.) I will say that you should go rent this movie before you buy it. IF you are a die hard trekkie and you find you must have it just to say you have it, that's fine, but I wouldn't cry in my cheerioes if I couldn't get it tomorrow. It's really not a very good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Plan 9\\" of Star Trek Movies","review":"This movie is the be-all, end-all proof of the odd-numbered Star Trek movie jinx. This movie started out bad, and just got worse. We can assume that this is in part due to Shatner's total inability to direct. Then again, the fact that Shatner's so bad at directing at least gives some degree of symmetry to his acting and singing skills. This movie was obviously made in order to advance the series from the good (but too-cute) Star Trek IV to the great (but Montalban-free) Star Trek VI. If there's going to be one Star Trek movie that's truly worthy of overripe fruit, this is the one. Buy this one to prove to your friends that you don't like anything with a Star Trek title. Buy this one to keep your drinks glasses from leaving rings on the table. Buy this one to prove that something did come between IV and VI."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this movie! Even if Shatner did write it","review":"Maybe I'm too much of a Star Trek geek for my own good, but I must admit that the Final Frontier has always been one of my personal favorites. First we find out that Spock has a half brother, and this selfsame half brother is trying to take over the Enterprise in search of God. The outer reaches of space never seemed so dark or mysterous as the crew battles their own personal inner demons on the way to helping Sybok destroy his own.Yes the romance between Scotty and Uhura seems rather sudden, but I found it rather charming, its time someone apreciated her.The banter is as humerous as ever as the holy Trinity (Spock, McCoy and Kirk) start of the movie sitting around a campfire, introducing Spock to Whisky and song. Row Row your boat for that matter, while Spock synthesizes marshellow's to roast.In short, I guess what I'm trying to say that this movie is wonderful, and a definate must see.Let it take you into realms where no man has gone before"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"I liked the interaction between Kirk, Spock, and Bones. It was a refreshing and thought provoking look into some age old questions. It really showed how Star Trek can bring out the best in humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"The more the better","review":"The more that I see this film the better I enjoy it. Many reviews have been written which detail its strengths and weaknesses. I found that, by means of a subtle sense of humor, it demonstrates the value of human friendship, and I believe that its most valuable contribution, in the Star Trek genre, is that it attempts, in what I consider a serious way, to deal with the mystery of human suffering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trek V-A Satisfying Entry in the Series","review":"There is nothing like a Trek big screen film that begins with a prologue.(Trivia:There was an original prologue that was cut from Generations where we see Kirk skkydiving, and then being informed of the christening of the latest Enterprise!)Laurence Luckinbull is fun to watch as Spock half-brother.People complain about the effects of this film.I don't see the problem with them.They serve the film as the effects in any Trek flick would! This film is fun, mainly, because there are a lot of scenes involving the trio(you know who I mean too!)Scene where Nichols sings is outstanding(that is a thrill back to the series when she did that on occasion-remember Charlie X episode).This film caught a lot of flack, but it is just as fun to watch as Wrath of Khan if you ask me."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOLDLY GO WHERE NO ONE HAS GONE BEFORE","review":"William Shatner takes over the director's chair for this, the 5th installment in the 'TREK' series. This movie explores 'SPOCK'S' relationship with his brother 'SYBOK' and man's religious beliefs and fraility. 5 STARS to this film and to director Shatner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twelve more beers and I'll appreciate this movie","review":"This movie was so ridiculously bad. Shatner attempts to be philosophical, writing a script in which the crew of the Enterprise visits \\"God\\", who, for some reason, confines himself in some forsaken region of the galaxy. At one point \\"God\\" asks the crew if he could borrow the spacecraft so he could leave the forsaken place. The crew are suspicious, \\"What would GOD want to do with a spaceship?\\". That's how deep this movie is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Trek V","review":"Star Trek V: The Final FrontierVideo was a total waste of money on my part because when I tried to play it a notice came up that it couldn't be played in my area for some reason, so I would like my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"This is one of my favorite Trek films, second only to The Motion Picture. Everyone thought it has really cheap effects, but this film was released in the summer of '89, in which more films were squeezed into theatres than ever before, which meant ILM had tons of films to give special effects to, and they couldn't be first rate for Star Trek V. So, they had to recycle effects shots from the other 4 films as much as possible. Shatner still did a superb job directing it. It has a great plot, and he made the film very reminiscent to the series, such as Spock, Bones, and Kirk going down to investigate the planet they are orbiting, in this case, Sha Ka Ree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite the worst...","review":"This movie is not quite as bad as The Motion Picture, but doesn't come close to The Wrath of Khan or First Contact. Only real ST fans should watch this. P.S At the end of the movie both Kirk and spock make a stupid mistake. Kirk says \\"I lost a brother once, I was lucky to get him back\\"(refering to Spock in ST2 and ST3), but he DID lose his elder brother at the end of the first season of TOS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Possibly the Worst Movie Ever Made","review":"I have been a devoted Trekkie ever since the very first show was broadcast in 1966 and even I despise this film!

Ptui!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I've seen all the Star Trek movies, and many of the original series, TNG, DS9, and Voyager episodes. You could call me a Trekkie. This movie has made it into my collection only because it is a Star Trek movie, not because I liked it. It is horrible and I only watch it so I know what it is about for any Trekkie Trivia questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Boldly Go Into Mediocrity","review":"The Starship Enterprise goes on a spiritual quest in this lackluster fifth installment. An infamous William Shatner vanity project, \\"The Final Frontier\\" (1989) is plagued by the actor's directorial inexperience and a poorly developed script. At least the camera stays in focus. Despite its $28 million budget, \\"Star Trek V\\" plays like a mediocre TV episode and, therefore, fares better on the small screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny as hell!","review":"Shatner directed this movie and his dry humor is obvious. The story line could be stronger, but the little touches of humor make it a real treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"This was, by far, the worst of the Star Trek movies. As a \\"die hard\\" Trekkie, I was completely disappointed with the story, the writing, the acting. The special effects were okay. The only credit to this film was the introduction of the new type II phaser. Shame on you guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain lousy...","review":"Easily the worst of the six movies, much worse than the first one. Stupid plot, very silly dialogue.It is not true that only die-hard Trek fans can watch this movie. I am such a fan, and I will never watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe not the worst ST movie, but it's close!","review":"Both this movie and ST:TMP had one or two redeeming moments. The rest was just abysmal. Every one of my friends in the local Star Trek fan club agrees that you have to be a total Trek nut to like this movie, because it is truly awful. There are several excellent Trek movies and episodes available on DVD; invest your money in one of them, not this piece of trash. In case you're not getting the message, let me put it this way: I own every Trek DVD release and would recommend every one as an enjoyable experience - except this one. This one is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Star Trek Movie","review":"This is by far the worst Star Trek movie I have ever seen. It is even among the very worst movies of any kind that I have seen. Ouch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Three Stooges in Space\\"","review":"I still remember my friend's one-line review of this movie as we left the theater. She was reacting to the final scene with Spock, McCoy and Kirk singing (off key) around a camp fire, one of many pathetic and ineffectual attempts at humor. About a dozen of us had ditched work to see Star Trek V when it came out and, boy, were we disappointed. What an embarrassement!This movie has little offer non-fans. If possible, it is even more annoying to life-long Trekkers, such as myself, with its violations of the canon with regard to Sybock, the renegade Vulcan (I won't spoil it, if you are determined to watch it) and out-of-character behavior by Spock and others.The movie that confirmed the odd-numbered Star Trek movie curse. Watch II, IV, VI or First Contact (VIII) again, instead of wasting your time on this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts well and then falls away.An idea for Paramount .","review":"\\"Every man hides a secret pain\\"says Star Trek 5.I'm sure that women would wonder what happened to them in this little piece of philosophy.Seriously,Paramount should redo the effects of this film.Even the current tv show has better effects so it wouldn't cost much to redo them.And one really good idea:get the supporting cast-Nichell Nichols,James Doohan,George Takei and Walter Koenig to sit down and do a commentary on the Star Trek films.What great stories they could tell!And what a great marketing ploy it would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not properly thought out","review":"This movie was not properly thought out.The campfire scene is too long and the special effects are poor for a movie that cost $33 million.Bill Shatner took a lot of flack for this and he deserved every bit of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain and simple: this movie was worse than Star Trek I.","review":"William Shatner is the worst director that Star Trek (and most other movies, mind you) has ever seen. Thank god he didn't think he could direct Star Trek VI as well..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the Star Trek movies.","review":"This is a movie that starts off well, but after the beginning it progressively gets worse. The opening scene showing Kirk, Spock, and McCoy on shore leave in Earth's Yosemite Park was, in my opinion, the best part of an otherwise worthless movie. After the opening scene on Earth, the plot became so unbelievably stupid that I felt like I was watching one of the more crappy Star Trek episodes instead of a Star Trek movie. After seeing this movie, I sort of got the feeling that it was a movie that was made just for the sake of being made, and not much more. Unless you're a die hard Star Trek fan, don't buy this movie. This one is barely rentable."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is STILL better than the first movie.....","review":"After hearing the story as to why this movie went down the tubes, I can appreciate what they were able to do just to make it watchable. Half way through the movie making, their budget was slashed dramatically, thereby not allowing them to get all the stuff into it that they wanted. In essence, they had to cut corners. I am not saying it is a good movie, but I don't believe it is worse than one. I will watch V twice before I watch One again."},{"rating":"2","title":"About as inconsistant as America's foreign policy","review":"Star Trek V:The Final Frontier is, not the best Trek film by a longshot, but it isn't as bad as say, Episode 1 The Phantom Menace. It starts out pretty good but there are some inconsitances in the story which leave more to be desired. I have also heard that the deleted scenes probably would've answered questions like, who was the thing that claimed to be God and why did it zap Kirk, Spock and what the Hell happened to Sybock?! The film isn't a total loss though, since Laurence Luckinbill had an awesome performance as Spock's half-brother and the film was pretty exciting. The only thing wrong are the inconsistances in the story. It ends with still many questions to be answered and a lot to be desired, but it is still worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"I asked my girlfriend what her favorite part was ...","review":"... and she said,\\"The end.\\"Boy, did this stink.

Shatner needs to stay away from directing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the Love Of Sybok!","review":"Whoa, hold on there... Come on guys,This isn't that bad of a movie!I just watched the DVD (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition) of \\"The Final Frontier,\\" and actually enjoyed it.Now, I admit I was one of the disappointed movie-goers back in 1989, but it has aged nicely.EXCEPT, for the exterior spaceship special effects.What Star Trek V really needs now, is the Remastered treatment that The Original Series is enjoying. I think some new digital spaceships, a little clean up and you'll have a dandy Star Trek epic.I think Shatner should demand a new Director's Edition with remastered effects. His instincts for directing Star Trek V were pretty good. Shows he was paying attention all these years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic Star Trek!","review":"I like Star Trek but this movie was sad and pathetic. I wanted to stop watching after the first 20 minutes but I kept thinking (and hoping)it would get better.

I would only buy this if I was really drunk and wanted a good luagh."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could this have been greenlighted into production?","review":"I won't take long, because I do not want to waste my time on this horrible film. It is very boring, and very slow, the script is stupid, and the plot about a Great Barrier, is, well, dumb. I thought it took decades to reach the end of the galaxy at warp speed? either the Voyager creators didn't care about the Barrier phenomonon, or this film makes no sense. I go for the latter. William Shatner was not good in this, his ego should though in every scene. Please stay away from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is awful","review":"Every criticism of Trek comes to life!

True, It was not the best, but it was very good. It was entertaining as they always are when this cast gets together. I see it many times over, and I have added it to my collection. To make fun of William Shatner is a terrible thing. Why don't you try to direct a full length film and see how you do. After, it's only fantasy, have a good time when you see these things instead of picking them apart.

Yeah, you just figured out what's wrong with this film.STAR TREK V is the worst Trek ever. Control was transferred to Shatner because of a contractual obligation. That's not a good reason to make someone producer, director, writer.At one time, STAR TREK was about the story of the voyages of the Starship Enterprise and a wonderful mission to push out the boundaries of human knowledge and wisdom. This flick is to show off Shatner as a horseman and a climber of rocks. Jeez, James T. Kirk was NEVER that kind.Come on, retire this tired old cast.

It has some very cute and short sentimental moments in it and a great senic opening of Yosemite National Park, plus a gorgeously wonderful score by my favorite composer Jerry Goldsmith - but - overall, no story, no story, no story. Did I mention no story?Shatner should have not let the producers take over. When I read his memorars about the shooting of this film, Shatner says the movie was completely different. It was budget cuts and studio pressures made it into something it was never intened to be.If that's true, then cudos to Shatner, but as a film....\\"The Muppet Movie\\" was much, much, much more entertaining.

At that time I read all three books in quick succesion and loved them. Thinking about all the fond memories I had about the books, I decided to reread the series and see how they fared on a second perusal.In the end, I found Shadowdale to be the best book of the three. It had a lot of action, a grand adventure, and good character development. Unfortunately, this book is much better than the other two. They pretty much stop the character development and focus more on carrying out predictable stories based on the excellent foundation created in the first book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tsr Book","review":"A great set of books if you can get your hands on them, this one in perticular starts off the trilogy & is quite hard to find, but this good company here had it, I recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Fricking Awful","review":"One word: Ugh. I remember reading this book when I was about fifteen. It was hideous then, and I can't imagine it's gotten any better with age. Maybe it's just me, but anytime an author refers to his characters as heroes BEFORE THEY'VE DONE ANYTHING HEROIC, I think there's a problem.Don't get me wrong, I like to wind down and read braincandy just like any neo-plebeian, but this is just BAD. Really bad. Like, \\"How did they ever publish this?\\" bad and, \\"How has this stayed in print?\\" bad. The answer is: Because the strength of the book rests entirely on it being set in a D&D universe, not its story, characters, and writing.If this is a classic of anything, it's a classic \\"TSR Book Shaped Object\\" -- things that are shaped like books, look like books, and smell like books, but read like they were written by a three year old.

After just finishing the last of R.A Salvatore's books I picked up the first book in the Avatar trilogy expecting it to be up to par. It wasn't! If you are a fan of fantasy novels I recommend passing this one by in the Library or the book store. The plot was ill-conceived and the characters were bad. It was torture for me just to finish it.

I guess you can read it and see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Bad Writing","review":"If this is an example of books that TSR release, then theyshould just stick to role-playing games. This book is filled withliterary cliches one after another. The characters are flat. The descriptions are bad.

It was an absolute chore to read this book, so much so that I never finished it and never read the other two books in the series even though I foolishly bought all three at the same time.Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing idea marred by bad writing","review":"The Avatar Trilogy is often entertaining, but the quality of the writing is shaky at best. The authors employ too many literary cliches, and the text is blemished by a number of technical mistakes which any decent copy editor ought to have caught. I did enjoy the authors' uncommon characterization of the gods as petty and meddlesome -- this idea, reminiscent of the ancient Greek pantheon, is curiously absent in most of today's fantasy literature. Overall, the books earn a marginal thumbs-down from me. My advice: read the trilogy if you have a chance, but don't buy; borrow instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"Whiting is a pretty well known writer who has churned out a number of bios on WWII people. However, his bio of Heydrich falls short mainly because he spends too much of the book writing about other people. He spends numerous pages describing the people who planned and exectued the assassination of Heydrich rather than discussing Heydrich. Too much of his work seems to be conjecture and speculation also. While Heydrich is one of the most hated and fascinating people of WWII and the Nazi party, this book is not the best to learn about him. Unfortunately, there are few bios on this important person. One interesting thing about this book is Whiting's contention that the economic system set up by Heydrich in the 1930s and early 40s is the same one being used today by the European Union. Other than that, not too good."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't work","review":"Like other reviewers, I thought this was going to be a unique, fresh indie film with gay themes.

The third night I plugged it in prior to putting water in and there was a poof of steam and voila - the death of the Bodum. I am not advocating turning on a device without water, but isn't that what the automatic turnoffs are supposed to be for??? So here am I online searching for a more reliable product...."},{"rating":"1","title":"OW OW OW OW","review":"OW MY THUMB I JUST BURNED MY THUMB BECAUSE STEAM VENTS OUT THE BACK WHEN YOUR POUR IT WHY WAS THAT A GOOD IDEA OW OW OW...I really did just burn myself not 60 seconds ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine Just Didn't Work","review":"I followed the instructions to the letter. The kettle did not work at all. See that black switch sticking out on the right hand side below the handle? When you press that switch down, it's supposed to turn on the heating element, stay down until the water boils, and then pop up. On my unit, the switch seemed to be defective. When I pressed it down to start the heating, it kept popping up and would not stay down. The teakettle was totally incapable of heating water. I recommend this product only to those who need an unsightly [] paperweight. I exchanged it for a T-Fal (model \\"78541 7-cup Vitesse High Speed Kettle\\"). The T-Fal works perfectly, looks a lot better, holds more, heats quickly, and easily lifts off its base to move about without its power cord. The T-Fal shows its water level. It can be filled through its spout. When you fill through the spout, it filters your water. I cannot imagine an electric teakettle better than the T-Fal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something wrong with a water kettle that can't get even a little wet","review":"I bought this less than a year ago.

It does everything I need - including chopping a ton of veggies for soups in no time! The included spatula is very helpful and also gets a lot of use. I have mostly just used the traditional blade, but I have no doubt I will be using the dough blade often as well. It has a very powerful motor, which is useful for quickly dispatching veggies. I have found that everything except the base is dishwasher safe, but is easy to clean by hand in a pinch, if necessary. I have not had any problems with the safety latches at all.I took off one star because, when full, the top of the unit can leak. It is not ideal for large quantities of soup to be smoothed out.

I recommendation to anyone is to NOT buy this horrible version of \\"Love Affair\\". One really odd thing about the cover is the leads are not named. Four people who hold minor roles in \\"Love Affair\\" are listed. In addition, no mention is made of any of the actors in \\"The Last Time I Saw Paris\\". I did not watch \\"The Last Time I Saw Paris\\" and can not say anything about that.

The last 3 books by Mrs. Steel have all been very boring, there is nothing to make you want to read and read, she does not grab you anymore.

I give her 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same plot, different names.","review":"I quit reading Danielle Steele a long time ago, when her books became too much alike. The last good book I think she wrote was \\"Crossings\\". Anyway, I read this one, because I heard it was so-o-o good. I disagree. Once again, we have a \\"beautiful\\" woman in a bad relationship, who meets her Prince Charming. It's always, all too perfect. Always beautiful friends, family, lots of money. It was ok for a rainy day. I am just glad I got it from the Library and did not buy it.

She is one of my favorite authors. This book was true D. Steele Style with lots of love a good lesson on life and it's problems. I love when a book gets me interested from the very first page and this book was captivating. I recommend it highly. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring story and annoying characters","review":"I read most of DS books and like many of them but Wedding is not one of the her best work. Story is so incredibly trite and boring. I couldn't stand main character Allegra who is so weak and whiny and has so many issues that would make your head spin. And most of them, she created herself, I might add. Her father hated and abandoned her, told her how she wasn't his dauther anymore because he was an ass and Allegra still feel obligation to have him walk her down the aisle? Geez, I just wanted to throw up. All the bad things that happened, I could see coming from a mile away-her stepfather's affair, her fiance's mother issues, her own insecurities, all very predictable.Her relationship with Jeff was described endlessly until I was flipping pages-yes, he was great and he loves her and we all know how much they love each other, can we move on please to something else?If you are DSteel fan, you maybe dissapointed with this book. I know I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, short, easy read!","review":"This book was a great book! It is a nice, short read that you can read in a few days or a week. It is a heartwarming story that leaves you with a warm feeling. It isn't a book you will remember for 10-20 years, but wonderful while your in it. I would reccomend to any women that loves a warm story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful book","review":"I thought that this book was one of her worst. Danielle Steel's character Allegra was awful. She was judgemental and narrow-minded. I think that Jeff's mother wasn't portrayed well at all. Instead of thinking of all that his mother had been through, Allegra could only think about herself and all that his mother had put Her through. It seemed that Allegra was also selfish and she blamed Jeff for their one fight which most married couples have before their wedding. I don't understand what Jeff saw in her at all. She also seemed to think of the wedding as more of a burden than the happiest day of her life. I can understand the stress yet Allegra seemed to think the wedding was more of a nuisance than anything. The book didn't go into depth at times and seemed to move slowly. I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her most boring book","review":"I am a real Steel fan but this was the most boring, name dropping book of all her books. My thoughts were that now that she runs in wealthy circles, she has to name drop. I know that she writes about what she is experiencing a lot of the times but I thought this was excessively needless and did not add to the book. There are other authors who do that and a few with panache but it really stopped the flow of the story for me. Hope the next is back to her old form."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wedding","review":"I have read most of Danielle Steels books and usually can't put them down. I was disappointed with this one. She kept repeating the same things over and over again as if she expected us to forget and there was not much depth to any of the characters. Her books usually make me feel like I am part of the characters and I laugh and cry with them. This book did not cause me to feel that way. I would not recommend this book to my friends. My mother-in-law also read this book and agreed with me. This is not one on Danielle Steels' better books."},{"rating":"2","title":"from hollywood to the jungle","review":"A friend had recommended this book. I borrowed her copy, brought it to the Costa Rican jungle while on vacation, and discovered they already had a copy in their three-shelf \\"library\\", much to my surprise!This was an excellent source of distraction and amusement. Steele does an excellent job in transporting the reader to snowy New York, the Golden Globes and Malibu, not to mention the quick trip to Las Vegas.The main character, Allegra, is strong and weak at the same time and evokes the reader to be her cheering section when life becomes arduous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Nice\\" book for summer reading.","review":"I too, was pleased with Danielle Steels \\"come back\\" from her earlier \\"bombs\\". I agree that it was slow in the beginning, but once you get into it, it flows along beautifully. I wonder though if all \\"beautiful\\" people feel they don't deserve any better than they get. Brandon was a jerk! Why didn't she see that. Why did she feel she was worthy of \\"scraps\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not One of Danielle Steel's Better Novels","review":"I didn't like this DS novel very much. I know this is fiction, but why should a woman, abandoned by her birth father, then allow the bum to co-walk her down the aisle on her wedding day with the stepfather who raised her? The plot twists and angles that sent the character in this direction were less than convincing.Also, the plot filler about the troubled lives of Allegra's clients - screwed up rock stars and emotionally troubled musicians - was boring and irrelevant. I also wasn't emotionally caught up in the angst of her mother and sister, whose personal angst created plot filler but nothing particularly interesting or memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I cheated... I listened","review":"I listened to the book (unabridged on ausio cassette). This is my first venture into Danielle Steel and I really enjoyed it.

All of her stories are basically the same, set in basically the same locales, and with basically the same plot, time after time after time.

If you havent read most of them, then your missing out, so stop reading this boring passage, and get into a book of hers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true-to-life love story","review":"I've always loved Danielle Steel's novels and this was not an exception. What I especially love about her stories is the way she brings her characters to life.This story is very true to life - combining a wedding preparation with a real tough job.I really liked Allegra's personality and courage, the way she realized what Brandon was doing to her and how she dealt with it. She's portrayed as a human being who is in love and kidding herself about the man she loves but who, in the end, finds a man who wants to love her for the rest of her life and protect her, and that is the most beautiful thing that can happen to a person!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dime Store Trash","review":"I've been called a literary \\"snob\\" for my reading selections (Hemingway, Irving, Faulkner); So I figured I'd give this romance writer a shot before spouting off.

Come on! Lawyers are not ethically permited to post bail for their clients. Do some research Danielle, like the rest of the authors do... don't rely on what you see on television. No lawyer would ever give out their home number, let alone answer calls in the middle of the night.And I am sick and tired of this obsession this author has with thinness. A size 10 is fat?

But the parts of Simon and Blair were very much lacking.

I found this to be lacking in a lot of areas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boringest book you'll ever find","review":"Danielle Steel is the boringest writer I have ever encountered in my entire life. This is the very LAST book by her I'll ever read. I've given her too many chances. Not one book that I've read by her wasn't boring. I love to read, and I appreciate good books, but Danielle Steel is way overrated. She is boring, prolific, uses the same story line, and worries about quantity not quality. I have many favorite authors, but Danielle Steel is not one of them. She is the worst author ever. ALL her books are the boringest books you'll ever find. Do NOT waste your time reading this book or any of her other books.

The voice quality is clear enough, the screen is decent for me, I like the ringtones. I don't need fancy, so it's good enough. I don't know if others have had this problem, but the one thing that I hate about this phone is that it redials in my pocket even with the phone closed and the keyguard on! As far as I can tell, the keyguard only protects the side buttons since the \\"flip\\" should protect the inner ones. If I'm driving or have to do something that compresses the phone a bit in my pocket, the speaker button gets pressed though it is an inner button, and if that happens twice it not only redials but turns on the speaker which broadcasts the call to everyone in listening range. I can't find any way to stop this except to use some kind of bulky holster. If I had known about this, I wouldn't have bought this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this phone!","review":"I had this phone for less than 4 months.

I was told the internal wires were corroded by \\"liquid damage\\" most likely caused by condensation. When I called customer service I was told that temperature changes (i.e., going in and out of the house or using the phone outside)were the most likely cause of the condensation. Yet since it wasn't a manufacturer's defect, they refused to replace the phone. This phone cannot hold up to everyday use!

Reader would be better off buying the Power of Your Subconscious Mind since these books are very much alike. If you have read the Power of Your Subconscious Mind, and want to save your money -- don't buy this book. Rather buy telephysics by Dr. Joseph Murphy.However, if you want to learn more about Dr. Murphy's techniques and life. This book is certainly worth of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"read the original version instead","review":"If you're a fan of Dr. Joseph Murphy and his wisdom, read an original copy of this book and NOT this revised edition. The original book, published in 1965, is beautifully written and timeless. Many of Murphy's books, including this one, have been \\"revised\\" and \\"updated\\" with a co-author in an attempt to appeal to a modern audience of spiritual seekers. But in his lifetime, Murphy never needed or used a \\"co-author,\\" as his books were (and still are) perfect just as they were originally written.Although this book is 40 years old, it doesn't need to be revised or changed in any way. Dr. Murphy had a beautiful and unique way of expressing his wisdom. These revised editions are watered-down and lack the original flavor. They are essentially no different than any other modern self-help book. Read the original instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you ready to change your life?","review":"I have read three books from this author. About a year ago, I came across with a book \\"The Power of Your Subconscious Mind\\". Everafter I have been interested in Joseph Murphy's books. Joseph Murphy explains you some of the most amazing laws of cosmic mind power that will help you on your path to success. He has written carefully 15 chapters on some of the most profound areas of the life.It has been my dream to move to the States, and become a police officer there. I believe that Joseph Murphy's books will help me to achieve my goals, and help others to help themselves.I promise that this book will reveal a whole \\"new you\\" to you. However, I gave it only 4 stars as something is missing from this book. It is simple, and a reader who is looking for very advanced hints won't find many of them. This book is a good and basic resource for creating success.. but I would still recommend you to read to read The Powermind System and Power Pause.I wish you the best success!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The content of this book is excellent but the editing of McMahan is awful!!","review":"How can McMahan dare rewrite many parts of Joseph Murphy's book when the original text is very easily understandable by even a beginner of English?More, he changed at many places stories involving men with women!!!! More crazy than that, it is not possible!And he wrote quotes that are not even from the author.For this vital, very important book, you only want the exact (word-for-word) content of the original book, nothing else. Stay away from expanded or revised editions!! What you really want is an edition that has NOT been revised or edited in any way!!So, make sure you get that with another version of this title. So far, I cannot find one version of this title for which I can be 100% sure that it is the original copy of this title!!! If you know such a version, please leave a comment.

This EP is really good, but doesn't do the band justice. It was recorded as rough demos in their living room, but still manages to rock. New Drug is an amazing song that opens with a strokes like riff before going completely heavy in the chorus. \\"Over the edge\\" is a lesson in American rock -n- roll, with a killer hook. And...the beauty of \\"half a world away\\" cannot be put into words. The vocals are exceptional, the musicianship as good as any band out there. I just can't wait to hear the final album versions recorded in a real studio. Although there is room for improvement on the production side....this band is ready to soar to the next level.

Some excellent information on unit structure and the various unifroms worn by the Japanese soldiers of this period that is hard to come by in english language references. A previous reviewer criticized the book for spending too much time on the \\"minutia\\" of Japanese military uniforms and not enough on tactics. This is, however, akin to complaining that an apple does not taste like an orange; these books are not meant to discuss tactics or campaigns, but are intended to focus on the \\"minutia\\" of uniforms and personal equipment. The brief format does not really allow the subject matter to range too far.

The cable doesn't plug especially well into my Treo650, but it does the job.I am expecting the connectors to break fairly quickly. When that happens I'll look for a higher quality charger.If I had it to do over again, I'd have spent more money to get a higher quality item.Update: The Treo end of the connector broke all of three days after I received it.

It's the implementation that really falls short. The materials used in the wires are too stiff, and the connectors are ill-fitting. I was able to use this about 4 times in my car before the connector simply stopped connecting. Since the connector from the car unit to the device and the wall unit to device is shared, this is suddenly completely unusable.I have other chargers and connectors that work just fine: the one that came with the Treo, and a ZipLinq retractable. Avoid this one if you are looking for an accessory that lasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment with Travel Kit","review":"I liked the idea of a multi-purpose charger for my Treo, however, the connector on the end of the cable that plugs into the phone broke after only being used a couple of times.

If you are a follower of LS (as I am), this book is marginal at best. The characters just seemed to exist. I never fell in love with any other them, except for the tennis playing cab driver. The first chapter or two was written in his usual entertaining style, but then something went very wrong. Laurence Shames seemed to disappear.

Hardly.","review":"Although I read voraciously (154 books this year so far) and check out Amazon's editorial and customer reviews on an almost daily basis, this is the first time I've been motivated to write a review. This is the most disappointing book I've read in years, most likely because I was excited about a new book by Shames. His early works are among my favorites, with offbeat characters and laugh-out-loud moments. I hate to kick an author when he's down but, sad to say, this one's as dead as the rodents Pete Amsterdam finds in his hot tub. Skip this, and read his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Naked Detective needs a coverup","review":"I read \\"The Naked Detective\\" because it was recommended by Amazon.com. under crime fiction books. The author apparently has written other crime fiction books which were well-received. This one is sort of hard to believe. His characters are not well enough fleshed out to be believable. His love of music and wine are apparent, but in Key West? The plot itself is forced and the premise that anyone this laid back and self absorbed could be a credible PI is hard to believe.

When it arrived I was surprised at how short it was. As I read it, I found it hard to care about Pete Amsterdam. The whole reluctant detective theme didn't work for me. The other characters were all familiar that we have seen in John MacDonald, Carl Hiaasen and Tom Corcoran. I am not drawing comparisons to these three authors (certainly the best in this genre) as that would be unfair.

The Naked Detective wasn't even on the same planet as the enjoyment I was expecting.Amsterdam (central character) is unbearably neurotic and so sexually obsessed it sometimes seems like the whole story is being told from the point of view of his penis.There is no character development whatsoever, for which, given the nature of the characters, perhaps the reader can be grateful.Shames, next time you're desperate for money (the only reason I can imagine you submitting this to a publisher), pass the hat among those of us who've enjoyed your earlier books.

Building an addition.\\" - You're putting in an office.\\") he nevertheless gets drawn into a real mystery. One where people die and where his life expectency is in some jeopardy. In trying to sort things out he attracts the interest of the daughter of the recently deceased local crime boss, Lefty Ortega. Lydia Ortega is a temptress with a penchant for strong drink and weak men (\\"You don't toy with Lydia. Lydia toys with you!\\".

Flash is a quirky and complicated program, and there are times I would have liked more explanations. But I am so happy that the useful information in this book is not buried in pages of useless examples. This is not a book of samples, ready for you to copy. Nor does it cover advanced scripting topics very well - these could easily double the size of the book.

The book doesnt cover the more advanced features of Flash, so if you've already aquired most of the basics, you might wanna look elsewhere. If you do get lost at the last few chapters about assigning actions, a good online primer on Javascript can help you grasp the concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not see any change between Flash 4 book to Flash 5 book","review":"I read the Both books (flash 4 and flash 5) and the taking the same a example and the same pictures and the same words.In short it's the same book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too plain, need some exercises","review":"It is a book for beginners who know little about computer graphic.

Example: in telling you how to do a shape tween (p. 304), it neglects to tell you to select \\"create tween\\", something a beginner would not know. It tells you to get a certain tool, or go to a certain window, but does not tell you where it is or how to get to it (and some are hidden quite well in Flash) This book leaves out a lot of important steps that are unique to Flash, but goes into lengthy detail about things that anyone could figure out, like how to draw a circle with the circle tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Don't buy this book, not only does it leave you frustrated because of the lack of explanation it also gives you no idea's on actionscripting, all you will do with this book is read over and over the steps wondering where you are going wrong because the explanations are wrong, they might as well just pasted a 5 over the old 4 books and sold it as a new one, I can't wait for the 6 version, I'm sure that will be a repackaged 4 as well !!!SAVE YOUR MONEY-get some other book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"For the life of me, I can't figure out why this book was published. Anything you want to know about overall Flash functioning was already covered in the Flash 4 Quickstart Guide. What's worse is that the Flash 5 guide doesn't focus on ActionScripting--which is the heart of the Flash 5 program. The publishers really didn't seem to bother with producing a new book.

The title track has a vicious rhythm, and most of the other songs also are very solid. Yet, there are still some ballads in the Donovan tradition, such as \\"Happiness Runs\\". There is more variety here than many of his other albums, with comic songs such as \\"I Love my Shirt\\" and \\"Pamela Jo\\", and of course \\"Atlantis\\". A real departure for Donovan, not so psychedelic, and not Dylan-influenced."},{"rating":"2","title":"He did it again!","review":"Donovan has once again made music that is audible.

I have made quite a few of the recipes in this book and they all have been whole family pleasers. Some are a bit rich for me, but my children and husband like them that way.

The best part is you don't make them all yourself, but your freezer is full of variety on a moments notice. Have friends stopping by? Pull out an dinner, appetizer and/oror dessert from the freezer! Have a fun day outside planned...no time to cook...pull out a meal from your freezer! This book explains it all from A to Z and is very easy to follow.

The main character is NOTHING like the real Gein. The story is so inaccurate that it isn't even funny. If you truly want a more accurate movie on the life of Gein, rent the 2001 version.

I know some about the real Mr. Gein, and this is nothing like him. They created him (in the film) as a towering mass of brutality. Almost like a Jason...or Michael Myers?If you are interested in a film that depicts more of the real Ed, then try \\"Ed Gein\\", or \\"Deranged\\". However, \\"Deranged\\" has a B rated goofy quality to it. However, it still beats this version of Gein's life. Ed Gein Butcher of Plainfield is something you might want to watch if you have no interest in the real Gein? To be honest, I tried watching it twice. The first time \\"booooo\\", the second I tried approaching it in a non-judgemental way. No matter how you look at it the movie is not good :( The acting stinks, script stinks, It's boring all the way around itself. If you want an original movie (with out Gein) try \\"Trick r Treat\\".

It was basically a love story with Officer McStudly dating Princess Blondie with sprinkles of a very loosely based version of Ed Gein. This is not a true crime film.The woman (Adrienne Frantz) playing the female love interest was completely unbelievable in her role and I found myself disappointed at the end when she didn't get killed. She was that terrible. She delivered some sort of high pitched whiny monologue at the end about how Ed didn't have the right to decide when people died - only god did. The guy playing Ed Gein was the only believable actor portraying real emotions in the movie. As such, he was the only one you could empathize with in the film. Everyone else was one dimensional and unbelievably stupid.This isn't even a movie for people who like bad horror. I like bad horror - this was just a bad love story. If you want a good recent horror film, get Trailer Park of Terror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not true to story of Gein","review":"Warning may contain spoilers. Very vague spoilers ahead...When I first heard that Kane Hodder was playing Ed Gein, I became excited. I thought he would be a very scary Gein. However I was very very wrong, This movie was okay, but it was not accurate in the portrayal of Ed Gein. First off, he did not have an accomplice that helped him rob graves who he later killed because he wanted to stop. They never caught him with a live girl and the cops did not chase him through the woods and put a gun to his head, only to be talked out of shooting him by the very girl he had kidnapped.

It ruled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Kane,but Railsback blows you away.","review":"This movie stinks to high heaven.What the hell is Kane Hodder doing,playing as Ed Gein? Kane Hodder is a big dude,and he's a great Jason,don't get me wrong.But Ed Gein,HE IS NOT.Ed Gein was a smaller guy.Not big like Hodder is.If you wanna see a really good movie about Mr.Ed Gein,then pick up the original \\"Ed Gein\\" dvd with Steve Railsback.Now THAT'S how Ed Gein SHOULD be played."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much \\"poetic license\\" here","review":"Like other reviewers, I could not accept Hodder as Ed Gein. He's just too big, strong and scary. He looks like a killer. Nothing like the real Ed Gein.I also didn't expect the gore. If you like bloody body parts movies, you might like this one--it's pretty graphic and sadistic.From what I know about Gein, he was crazy, not sadistic. He was trying to recreate his mother, not terrorize and torture other women.The real story of Ed Gein is one of sadness and insanity, not of pleasure killing and meanness. I was hoping to find out more about Gein--particularly his prior life--he doesn't fit the typical serial killer profile, but is one of the most notorious serial killers. I expected this movie would help unlock some of the mystery, and it fell really short. In fact, it added more myth than anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"They tell little to nothing about Ed and the movie moves incredibly slow, horrible acting. It is creepy and at times some good violence but that's about it. And Kane proves why he's a stuntman and not a true actor.

I stayed up to 1am because I couldn't turn it off, and I've needed more coffee from lack of sleep today to make up for it, but no regrets. Some people might think Kane Hodder would be an odd choice to play Ed Gein, too, since Gein was a slight fellow - but Kane plays the \\"inner Gein\\" so perfectly that you simply don't think about the difference between them physically. And for true fans of this man, it's also fun to actually see and hear him - instead of silence and latex 24/7.

Col. Applegate utilizes practical, effective and efficient tactics and techniques with the handgun and knife for close combat encounters of a lethal nature. The point shooting technique is a reactive and reflexive method of a spontaneous shooting response, which has been scientifically proven as the natural response by a person under life endangering stress, a technique Fairbairn, Sykes, and Applegate knew 58 years ago.

It works sometimes, but I have to restart recording whenever the static problem occurs, and that seems to occur every 10 minutes or so, so it is VERY frustrating.

If you don't mind a writing style comparable to a Police Report, than you'll really enjoy this. I'm not a Zodiac expert (I read this after I saw an excellent \\"Nash Bridges\\" episode on a Zodiac copy-cat), but I can't imagine a more detailed analysis of those crimes and, since Graysmith was close to the action, his opinions carry weight. From what I can tell, this is the best account available of these crimes and I would recommend this book highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have you heard of tunnel vision?","review":"This book is very disappointing. I was even appalled at the nerve of the author to re-release this book and identify the man he THINKS is the Zodiac killer after the man's death. The author actually demonstrates how an investigation can get botched with tunnel vision. A prime suspect is the sole focus and evidence is distorted any way it can be to \\"prove\\" this suspect is the Zodiac killer. There were other possible leads and suspects that were discounted by the author.By the time you reach the middle of the book, you'll see it is already obvious who the author THINKS is the Zodiac killer. The rest of the book discounts other leads and suspects and focuses on \\"evidence\\" that \\"proves\\" the author has identified the Zodiac Killer. Very disheartening.It should be noted the author is not an investigator and the identity of the Zodiac killer remains a mystery to this day. The author has NOT proven his \\"identification\\" of the Zodiac killer. This book is a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice to read but why would you.","review":"While highly entertaining, this doesn't actually focus much on the truth.

Not just by people who \\"didn't like his book\\", but by fingerprints and DNA evidence. Graysmith will still try to sell you on Starr (aka Allen) as a viable suspect but can not do so with facts. I'm hoping the upcoming movie wont be quite as fictional but it most likely will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary--real life horror movie","review":"The author was intimately involved in the investigation of the Zodiac killer and this is his dissertation. Real life being more scary than fiction, this book was hard to put down and made it hard to sleep as well. The author does a good job of laying out the facts of the case, the details, and the main suspects. If you like suspense, thrillers, or murder mysteries, this real life drama surpasses all the fiction. Here's to hoping this case actually is solved one day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zodiac: The Best Source For the Zodiac Killings!!!!","review":"Graysmith takes the real killer and puts him in your mind clear as the day it happened. The book is a great scare! He makes so real that you'll be scared to walk alone at night, be young, or go on a date. He also explains some of the suspects and the possible ways they tried to catch some of them.

I mean, it's absolutely teeming with information... But not all of the information is true. Graysmith writes that after the murder of Stine, police actually stopped the killer asking him if they had seen anyone matching the (false) description they had of the suspect. However, there's no record of this except for in Graysmith's book. He puts himself into it too much, adding unnecessary lines and chapters about his own personal search for the killer, such as the line (when he's being led out to the Lake Berryessa crime scene), \\"'Watch out for snakes,' he told me.\\" Lines such as these seem to serve only as a way for Graysmith to brag about is involvement. Interesting stuff; horrible writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kat's Meow!","review":"Since I wrote a lousy short review about Zodiac Unmasked, in all fairness, I thought I'd say that I personally thought this book ZODIAC is excellent. Its an easier read than Zodiac Unmasked. I bought it when it first came out and have read it 5 times. Yes, it scared me. I have been interested in the Z since I was a teen living in Marin county CA at the time of the killings. Last year my step son asked if he could borrow this book. I said NO WAY! This copy doesn't leave my house. If you are new to the Zodiac, read this book. If you want to be frightened, read this book. Every time I go through Vallejo, I think of the Z. As a teen he invaded my thoughts. My friends and I were afraid of him and the subject came up a lot. Once, in 1971, I was riding my horse with a friend and we saw someone in a white, or light-color car acting totally nuts. Who do you think we thought of? For those of us who have been obsessed and haunted by the Z, this book meets our desires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as suspenseful as other true crime books","review":"I have read some really chilling true crime books as \\"Mindhunter\\", which is probably one of the best. However, this one cites a lot from police reports and is thus rather sterile than suspenseful. Graysmith names the chapters after the murdered victims and tries to weave a thrilling story around the facts, but unfortunately fails in trying.It might be ok to get well-informed about the case (although other reviewers here say that graysmith is ill-informed), but I cannot recommend it as a \\"cant-put-it-down\\" novel.Read Mindhunter instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best true crime stories I've read!","review":"In a time span of 1968 and into the late 1970s, the San Francisco Bay area was haunted by a hooded psychopath calling himself Zodiac. Claiming six in his murderous trek, the real count could be Zodiac's claimed thirty-seven. Or it could be fifty.They never caught the Zodiac.Bob Graysmith writes a true crime horror story that is intriguing and frightening since the guy got away. In this book, you will read the complete text of the killer's letters, hundreds of little known facts, and Graysmith's theory of who the Zodiac is. This is a must read for any true crime buff; it is meticulously detailed and I have been unable to put it down.P.S. The 1971 film DIRTY HARRY with Clint Eastwood molded this story to film: a hooded killer terrorizing the city sends bizarre letters filled with demands. It's not exact, but it's still close. It does have an ending I wished for reality: The Killer gets blasted away by Clint's gun."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have read this book several times and will read it again.","review":"Very interesting book.

In response to the US Marine's single star rating I would say that this program just gets you in the door to the real training and the USMC bootcamp has no such gate.

Her manner motivates me to do the exercises, and she clearly shows how the exercises should be done.I would also recommend this DVD for people who are struggling to move due to their body weight, as it is a nice form of exercise to try, even if you have limited mobility due to weight. It can be a starter DVD, and then when your weight starts to decrease, you can move on to other activities. I still use this DVD, even while doing other activites, as it is so easy and nice to do.

The story is definitely exciting -- in the same way that a Tom Clancy story is riveting, but Tom Clancy gets his details straight and Lahaye and Jenkins disappoint.

I keep in mind these books were written by men, so don't expect alot of touchy-feely stuff, expect more action, thought patterns and sequential events. The dialogue of Eli and Moishe was awesome. Not being a theologian, I can't say whether their interpretation of Revelations is 100% accurate, but generally, it's true enough.

My only question is this: Where is all this rapture baloney in the bible? LaHaye and Jenkins will have us believe they found it in the book of Revelation. It's not there. I've looked. In fact, any review I've read of these books by scholarly Catholics, Protesants, or Evangelicals, states that these books are intellectual shabby, and theologically unsound. The Rapture? The End Times? You want a good book about the end times? Try the bible. This dispensationalist blather will only make you paranoid. And trust me, LaHaye and Jenkins don't need the money. Use the internet. Research the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something better to read","review":"I highly recommend reading \\"End Times Fiction A Biblical Consideration Of The Left Behind Theology\\" by Gary DeMar, instead of anything having to do with this series or with any notion of a theological thinking that was never part of the early church. In this book, DeMar demonstrates the flawed interpretation of pretribulational/premillennialism and instead lets the biblical text speak for itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apocalyptic Vision at it's Ignorant Worst","review":"Folks, do you understand what it's like to be a Christian of reasonable intellect in America? Not only am I latently asked to dismiss any intelligent belief I might have about culture, economic theory, science, and global diplomacy, I'm expected to fill the void with the painfully banal brand of Pop Armageddonism pervasive in the \\"Left Behind\\" series. How absurd is this? The puppet regime that is the U.N. one day decides to take over the world and set up shop in(ahem)Iraq?? Don't get me wrong, I believe the Bible's warnings about the end times. I believe Christ will indeed arrive like a \\"thief in the night\\"; i.e. when the low-brow middle class theorists who buy into this garbage least expect it. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad","review":"This book is poorly written, with hollow characters and little imagination. I stopped reading half way through because I was so offended by the level of writing. And because of the general fear tactic used by the authors to convince the population that they should convert to Christianity immediately or be \\"Left Behind\\" to face Armageddon.As a theologian I was indeed curious about this popular series. What I see is warped interpretation of the book of Revelation, and a sad attempt to capitalize on the public's fear of the unknown. While one camp may argue that the authors are trying to reach the masses with the Word, they are in fact only offering a fear inspired fast food interpretation and making a great deal of money in doing so. That anyone would buy into this kind of capitalistic theology or say that it is inspired is really sad.There are many books that do a wonderful job of spreading the loving word of God. This is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truth? Who knows besides God?","review":"Although this book was very entertaining, it cannot be proved factual. The rapture is a highly debated topic among Christians. The truth is,until Christ has returned, we cannot tell what is going to happen. It is my belief that people won't come to Christ and stay in Him if their only motivation is not wanting to be \\"left behind\\". What kind of love is that? That is not what the Bible describes as a personal relationship with Christ. If you want to try to save someone, don't scare them, inspire them."},{"rating":"1","title":"living proof!","review":"This novel, speaking of the first one of the series, is living proof that interesting ideas do not necessarily make a great novel.

I just disliked this one. His impeccable credentials (Oxford) and his usual penchant for exhaustive scholarly research (The Intellectuals, History of the Jews, History of Christianity, etc.) were surprisingly absent. This book is thoroughly Catholic - not necessarily a bad thing mind you. It's just that the book title had nothing to do with the book. This was no \\"Quest\\", no grappling with doubt or faith or pain. Just a Catholic Catecism - a celebration of one man's faith, not the Quest or personal pilgrimage of a man searching for God. It appears that Johnson has found God, neatly and conveniently inside the cathedral. That's O.K. for him. I just was hoping he would help me turn over a few more stones."},{"rating":"2","title":"a thoughtful meditation based on a serious life","review":"I was quite surprised by some of the reviews. Some discount him as a dogmatic Catholic; others don't seem to like his politics; still others deride it for weak apologetics. I am not a Catholic, I don't care about the politics of someone reporting his or her spiritual journey, and I did not see the book as an exercise in apologetics. It is, as I read it, a personal report of one man's spiritual quest. I found it honest, serious, thoughtful, and insightful. I think that is the test of a spiritual memoir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strict Catholicism","review":"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Johnson's _Modern Times_ and _Intellectuals_, I browsed on amazon for more of his work and found this. I was so excited -- any spiritual autobiography is usually of interest to me, and here was one by an excellent writer, and an educated scholar to boot. I couldn't wait to read it. When I did -- what a shock. I could hardly believe it was the same person. The book is an elaboration of and argument for Catholicism -- but a quest? Although the religious impulse is alive in him, it travels in extremely narrow channels. Unless you are yourself a dyed-in-the-wool Catholic (or a non-Catholic who readily accepts that, as a non-believer, you will surely wind up in hell, which is a real place, and will be excruciatingly and imaginatively tortured forever after), you may find the smugness and condecension hard to swallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preposterous!","review":"This book's line of argument would have seemed musty enough had it been written in 1910 -- to still advance these views at the present day smacks of wilful refusal to think. Johnson dismisses all objections to Catholic doctrine with an airy insouciance that would make Chesterton blush. Can he really believe in papal infallibility, the virgin birth, and all the rest of it? Can he really believe that God the Invisible Headmaster is lurking at his back, ready to give him six of the best when he gets out of line? Apparently, he can.For me, the last straw came when Johnson approvingly quoted President McKinley's statement to the effect that, during the Philippine crisis, he \\"got down on [his] knees and prayed to God,\\" and that God told him to annex the country and civilize the natives. Close to a million of those natives died in the ensuing war. Virtually all serious historians regard McKinley's statement as disingenuous or hypocritical; Johnson takes it at face value. Need I say more?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Profound Disappointment","review":"I am always interested in spiritual autobiographies. Works that explain how an individual grappled with the problems of existence and came to an appreciation of their faith. Unfortunately, there is no sense here that Mr. Johnson ever challenged anything relating to his faith. The book also includes several severely homophobic comments. Mr. Johnson's previous works were solid, if conservative. I expected more from him."},{"rating":"1","title":"The food was dodgy, I won't be eating here again","review":"Sorry, once was enough. I've read this guy's work in the Daily Mail (fool that I am). This is more of the same. Amazing how so obviously intelligent a man can be so blinded by faith and dogma that he turns into a sub-fascist apologist for virtually any entity that would take away human rights. Why can't Richard Dawkins turn his brilliant mind loose on this dinosaur ? He'd make chutney of him."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's no Theologian","review":"Johnson is a historian, the darling of conservatives like Wm. Buckley. He is, however, no theologian. That is apparent at once. And his bigoted rantings against gays severely diminish a book which is supposed to be, after all, about finding God. You would think that a man who is concerned with weighty and important matters would be above such pettiness.You'd be much better off picking up a copy of Abraham Heschel's \\"Man's Quest for God\\".

I loved this movie just as much. For anyone who wants to see this movie, don't watch the trailer - it gives too much away. Regardless, the film is a well-paced story with a plot you can't guess, and with a lot of heart as well. (Unlike, say, What Lies Beneath, which had thrills but you didn't so much care about the characters.) I loved Demi Moore in this and all the other actors. And the setting was gorgeous.

Her acting, if you can call it that, was akin to Eeyore in a high school play. She wasn't the least bit believable--and I don't think her heart was in it.Naturally, I can't say that I blame her too much.

The story is not all that compelling, the acting is not all that great, and the \\"twist\\" is not particularly shocking or unique. Most of the characters are one-dimensional stereotypes.

I stumbled on this movie by accident. I hadn't even heard of it. Did it ever make the movies? It should have! Like Passion of Mind, Demi Moore touched our hearts as a mother loving her child and trying to cope after he drowns. I can't even fatham the grief someone feels in loosing a 5 year old child (or any age of a child). Then you throw in a ghost story with a murder plot and you have a great story. I have watched this a couple of dozen times and each time I walk away with some thing different left in my heart. Movies like this I usually buy a back up copy just incase I wear it out.

At times I felt the makers of this film were just trying to fill the running time in any way they could. Also...the dialogue? Bleh.

I really liked this film from start to finish - the main character was not a victim, there was a real reason she saw what she did and it all ended neatly. WELL DONE DEMI MOORE. I would watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iffy","review":"I rarely write reviews, but I thought I'd say a couple words. The plot was okay... nothing too original or surprising. I almost turned it off about 1/3 of the way through....it was so slow. I love Demi movies, but this one bugged me. And her teeth...my goodness...drove me crazy all the way through. The music was pretty much the same throughout. Not one I'd watch again or recommend, but it wasn't the worst I've ever seen either. The middle picked up and was kind of exciting and suspenseful. The setting was beautiful and it was a nice change of scenery from the typical American film."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"GHOST\\"","review":"I love a good creepy ghost story, and that's what this is. Its not a real deep story, some of the plot twists are a little predictable, others aren't. And I would have liked it to go a bit further and expose a bit more, but all in all it was worth the money for a watch. I really enjoyed it. Demi Moore is her usual easily watchable self, and puts you on her characters side early on. She also still looks great in a pair of Levi's. The scenery alone is entertaining to look at, although the one scene where they CGI'd the light in the lighthouse was I think unnecessary but all in all the scenery made the movie watchable too. Again I wish it had been longer. It reminded me a bit of Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford in \\"What Lies Beneath\\". I don't think this one went as far as What Lies Beneath but it was still creepy, spooky and kept my attention throughout the movie. If you liked \\"What Lies Beneath\\" or movies along that genre then you'll probably like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Half Light","review":"I happened across this as a rental and after my wife and I watched it I immediatley ordered it. This is an excellent thriller with Demi Moore and the rest the cast turning in fine performances. Absolutely gorgeous scenery and great camera work make it like a work of art. Wonderful melancholy music adds to the overall theme of the movie. The story centers around a writer that loses her son by drowning. When she moves to a rural town by the ocean to try and move beyond it and write she is haunted by strange occurences and visions of her son. She meets a man from the lighthouse and finds a kindred spirit in him. When odd things start becoming more frequent she is not sure if she is being haunted by her sons ghost or if something else is transpiring. I highly recommend you at least rent it if you love a good ghost story, mystery, or thriller. If you enjoyed it be sure to catchDead of Winter.CA Luster"},{"rating":"1","title":"I DON'T THINK SO","review":"I liked the cinematography but the movie as a whole, in my opinion, is just another Demi Moore stinker. As a mother myself I was appalled at the lack of emotion the mother (Ms. Moore) demonstrated at the loss of her only son. And to get into a love relationship shortly thereafter? A real mother in the same situation would be completely immobilized. The devastation from losing a child would be heart-breaking and of long duration. It would rule your every waking moment for years. I felt none of this from Demi Moore's character or the movie. In a film, it is difficult to successfully combine the plot of the loss of a child with sex and suspense. In \\"Halflight\\" it certainly doesn't work.Demi Moore is quite pretty in the film and the scenery is charming. It's an interesting little film about intrigue, but it disappointed me on the one important level. Because of that I found Demi Moore's character to be unsympathetic and unbelievable.Rent, don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"half light half baked","review":"Hard to believe this movie is averaging 3.5 stars. The story was interesting but it is hard to watch a \\"plastic\\" forty something romancing this your man. I thought demi's acting in the scary scenes seemed wooden and not very interesting. She is another of the gaunt actresses looking like they have protein calorie malnutrition. This movie was definitely a replay TV skip mode movie.

The one positive to this movie was the location seemed quite beautiful, I often found my mind drifting and thinking about how this movie should be at the bottom of this serene ocean in the United Kingdom. With my feelings put aside, this movie is about a novelist (Demi Moore) who lives in London and tragically looses her son in an drowning accident. To cope with her grieve she moves to a remote Island to learn more about Light Houses which is featured in her upcoming novel.

To break this awkward silence and to open a minefield of discussion, he proposes to them. He is on the brink of falling into this trap again and that is where the book begins.

Of course, the heroine is not much better. However, the story was well-written and I can understand some of the conflict. But the hero can be downright nasty sometimes, and I found myself wondering how Erin could ever have fallen in love with him, with all his nastiness. Not to mention that he is physically violent also. But he is a Viking, and that was their way. The ending was wonderful, and the book, itself, enjoyable. A little less marital violence and bickering would have made this book a 5 star in my view."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable romantic read...","review":"This mixture of romance, history, and war turned out to be a very good historical romance. The two main characters, Erin and Olaf, are both strong-willed, proud and stubborn which made for some interesting feuding from the very beginning. The author fleshed them out enough to make you care about them, and like them both.Aside from the romance, which was very good, there were also some pretty interesting battle scenes as war raged on between the Vikings and the Irish. (Don't worry, these scenes aren't overlong.) The author did a good job of conveying the pride and dignity of both sides in the warring.I must admit I was slightly irritated by a few things Erin did, but I quickly overcame my irritation because of the interesting way that the situations were resolved. This irritation was also overshadowed by some of the admirable actions that Olaf took.In sum, if you like historical romances, this is a book worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the non-Dreddd edition","review":"This book was first published in 1994 as a Judge Dredd novel, but Dredd was removed from the 2003 edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreadlock Rock - Official Trailer","review":"Here is a 5 minute short film which is the official trailer forDREADLOCK ROCK : THE STORY OF REGGAE MUSIC dvd[...]Link to the DREADLOCK ROCK dvdDreadlock Rock : the Story of Reggae MusicLink to the DREADLOCK ROCK SOUND TRACK CDDreadlock RockLink to the DREADLOCK ROCK DUB CDDreadlock Rock Dub"},{"rating":"1","title":"squirell trap","review":"trap arrived in good shape--but the trip plate was so that that the squirrels could walk on it and not set if off--every day the bait was eaten and no squirrels in the trap--had to do some bending and adjusting to catch any at all--all in all--it is poorly made or adjusted"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Works Defective Item","review":"Bought this item for one purpose to catch some squirels, but whoever build this cage didnt test it properly they would eat the bait and then just vanish.

Late in the 2nd day I noticed that the unit had triggered with nothing in it. I found that the cable that holds the trap door open had pulled out of the weight that holds the trap door down. It appears to be 18 gauge stainless braided cable. I requested a replacement from Amazon and it arrived in 3 days. Since then I'm averaging a squirrel a day (4 more as of today). I really like the unit and with the exception of the broken cable it has performed great. I'm still holding my breath on the cable issue as it appears to be a bit of a weak link.

A fellow officer asks him how he does that. Puh-lease.... No one but Keough not only knows *any* police procedure (if you're a regular mystery reader you know more than these St. Louis cops do) but no one else possesses any common sense either. And of course Keough comes up with all of the patterns and motives of the criminal out of thin air and anticipates his moves with the accuracy of a psychic.This was a truly ridiculous book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a so-so book.","review":"The book reads OK. There is little character development and not really much interesting about the main character. Keough is pretty lonely and boring. He doesnt do any great detective work that would make the book stand out. The serial killer is an idiot who makes a lot of mistakes and really isnt very difficult to catch. The book reads like watching a OK episode of Law and Order. Also, like another reviewer wrote, the descriptions and actions of the St Louis police force seem a little unbelievable. They seem bumbling in comparison to his \\"normal\\" activity. This also takes away from the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Related or Illiterate","review":"Skip this one. Anyone who finds any part of this book even remotely believable is either related to the author or cannot read. His bumbling St. Louis police force is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the shadow of Joe's amazing hunches.","review":"The main character, Joe Keough, does very little (if any) actual detective work in this rather tepid novel.Amazingly, both the multiple murder investigation and the events surrounding little Brady Sanders manage to solve themselves with minimal input from Detective Keough. Joe is simply there to act on his outlandish hunches and pick up all the credit. This comes even at the cost of a fellow officer. But hey, it was the one detective on the force that all the men and women didn't really care for anyway, so what's the big deal, right?In reality, all Joe Keough has in this story are his hunches. He even goes so far as to tell this to his superiors and the FBI.The supporting cast of officers are ineffectual, as is the story's villain. It is for these reasons that I cannot in good conscience recommend this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The QUINTESSENTIAL Kauai guide book -- topped by no other","review":"All other books pale by comparison. Harriet and Andrew (as I've come to know them on my trip) have written a book that surpasses all others on this fabulous gem of an Island. I only wish I knew about their other book about the Big Island before it was too late. The advice in this book is excellent, precise and funny (although a bit corny), and the layout is superb -- with color and pictures that bring Kauai to life even before you get there. One word of advice for the 4th edition however would be an alphabetical index of cities and locations that correspond to a grid on the large map in the inside back cover. The only remaining question for me is whether these two authors are married, engaged, or otherwise to eachother . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book--but be careful","review":"Lots of helpful tips, but be careful of some of them-- Queen's Bath, labeled in the book as a 'hidden gem' can be hazardous to your health! The book doesn't warn you about the dangers-- You can get big waves in this rock pool sometimes, and one guy drowned there last November, which we learned about from local people. You need to know more about some of the off-track places--otherwise a good book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Out dated terrible book","review":"The reviews and comments in this book have not changed in 13 years don't waste your money....and if you already purchased it demand your money back!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a gem of a book about Kauai!","review":"This cost me 1 cent (+ postage) for a great guide book on Kauai, Hawaii, USA.

This was our 3rd Maui trip and we found things missed on earlier visits. The accomodations reviews are very to the point and honest. If it's bad they say so. My only negative comments were the description of problems with swimming along the Kihei area, subsequently corrected on the website, a little more research here before we make sure major claims. If I had to bring only one book to Maui, this would be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives up to its name","review":"This really is one of the best guidebooks I've ever used. Very easy to use layout and the maps are beyond compare. It went everywhere with us on Kauai while the Lonely Planet sat on the coffee table back at the condo. One bit of advice, check with local surf shops concerning swimming and snorkeling conditions, even some of the so-called \\"safe\\" beaches can be dangerous at times.Buy this book, you will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It guides you for the MOST part","review":"Just got back and used the new 3rd edition. Steered me to some great places(and unfortunately he was correct about the rundown accommodations at the Pono Kai Resort), though it's a bit frustrating when the restaurants/resorts are not in the index nor are their addresses given! Also, if you are into hiking get a separate book; I found this one a bit sparse and confusing. But thanks to the guide, I found a great beach (Hideaways in Princeville--bring snorkeling equipment!) and the wonderful Air Kauai helicopter tour of the island. Oh, he forgets to warn you about the lousy interisland air carrier Aloha Airlines. They are the black smudge on a beautiful state."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated information","review":"This book, 3rd edition was published in 1999. It is NOT current.

This book isnt the last word on Kauai."},{"rating":"1","title":"ultimate guide to Kauai","review":"Well this book must be selling, because I live across the street from one of the secluded waterfall trails, and every obnoxious tourist on the island hops out of the car with it, walks up to my front door or just yells from the street, and then asks, \\"Is this the way to the waterfalls, can we use your telephone (hose, get a drink of water, etc)?\\" After a million questions and loud noises and tossed garbage from those who stop there, they decide to turn around in my driveway or drive on my plants. I think the writer of this book should mention a little something about respecting the residents of these places he's so proud to spread the word about."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Choice","review":"I have to agree with the reader from California (December 3): \\"Ultimately\\" a waste of money (and time, I might add). On our recent vacation to Kauai, we were sorely disappointed with the advice and biases in this book. A poor choice indeed, for which we have no one to blame but ourselves. But here's some advice for fellow travelers: definitely avoid this book (and some of the other disorganized ones as well), and get the free brochures that are so readily available all over the island. Also, buy the University of Hawaii maps: an excellent value if you are exploring the island on your own (not on an organized tour). By the way, Kauai is a beautiful island, the experience of which you should not dilute with the \\"Ultimatelies\\" of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Poor Advice","review":"\\"Ultimately\\" a poor use of money. Advice on activities (especially helicopter tours aka Air Kauai) was dead wrong. Book did not warn us of dangers at its \\"real gems\\" and was way off on the friendliness of the people (I lost track of how many haole comments I heard behind my back). Maybe this is more of a commentary on my displeasure with Kauai but this book had really convinced me that it was a great place. My advice: stick with Maui."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's going to destroy Hawaii?","review":"Which naturalist was it said, \\"I love the mountains, that's why I never go there...\\" ? Well Doughty and Friedman may have found a fun way to fund their fun, but publishing a book enticing more people to rent cars in a place where cars ought to be restricted, and visit places that can't support a great deal of visitation is irresponsible. They love Kaui? Then they ought to stay away from it and not encourage hundreds of thousands of others to go to places with an ecology that can't support their tourism."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's no pricetag for detail","review":"My wife and I just returned from Kauai on 5/30/01 and had a great time, much of that due to this book. The detailed directions to the hiking trails were amazing! Without these directions some of the hidden trails (\\"The Jungle Trail\\") we hiked would have been lost. The detail continued to all other aspects of the book helping us feel like seasoned veterans of the island rather than bumbling tourists. The reason for 4 stars VS 5 is due to some of the inaccurate restaurant ratings. I agree with another reviewer when they stated this probably couldn't be helped due to the constant changing of management. But in all fairness to the restaurants that have changed their ways for the better I would like to mention to the new readers to assess the establishment before shrugging it off. We found one in particular our last day in haste that the book frowned upon that was quite excellent. Overall....GREAT BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily the best(most candid/honest)guide book I've ever read","review":"If you are going to Kauai, this is the only guidebook you need. The authors are incredibly honest about their experiences and quite thorough in their description of restaurants, hotels, activities, etc. A MUST if you plan on doing any exploring, beach-hopping, swimming, diving, snorkeling or sight-seeing while on the island."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Kauai is such a wonderful destiniation. I had a great vacation, but I was disappointed in this book as it failed to lead me to the best restaurants on the island. When I visit a new location, in this case Kauai, I like to experience the great cuisine that such new location has to offer. This book failed to lead me in the right direction as far as restaurants were concerned. The only way that I was able to find my favorite dining destinations was through the recommendations of the consierge of the Princeville Hotel. The consierge also let me borrow a copy of his Kauai Underground Guide - which he says is the most accurate book on the island and which he loans to guests who ask for advice on restaurants, beaches and adventures. He was right on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely outstanding!!!!!","review":"This is truly the best guidebook for Kaua'i!! We took it everywhere with us and found the maps to be very accurate and easy to read. All of the reviews of restaurants and activities were right on the money.

It is indispensable!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Theres No Substitute","review":"To be honest, buy the Ultimate Kauai Guidebook and the only thing missing is a kauai hiking guide and detailed street maps of Lihue to find restaurants with confidence!

I was disappointed. My primary concern is that, as described in the book, the Glycemic Index Values are determined by far too small a sample, and with rather vague criteria. I also disliked the style of the book, which seemed to promise a cure for everything from obeisity to hangnails. In the end, I didn't finish the book, but am keeping it in hopes that the values in the back, although questionable, might be useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read.","review":"I read this book at the recommendation of my doctor to try to get a handle on high glycemic foods in my diet.

This is a MAJOR drawback. If your eyesight isn't great and/or you simply want too look up a food quickly without having to scans many pages you're out of luck.

The only real updating as far as I can tell is the addition of footnotes here and there explaining that some of the specific advice for certain situations may not be valid for the modern double blind structure. This book has a lot of very worthwhile ideas, but most of them are better explained in more detail in Sklansky/Malmuth's Hold'em Poker for Advanced Players, which I highly recommend. Another awesome Sklansky et al book is Small Stakes Hold'em, which I find extremely useful since I don't play in the big leagues.

Why not just re-write parts and print new editions?Second, while I have no doubt the book is chuck full of great poker theory, it is hard to understand the way he presents it. I had read a few reviews above expressing this opinion and purchased this book anyway.

The information was poorly presented. I estimate that I read this book three times actually, when you consider the amount of time I spent re-reading the passages trying to understand them. The editor took a month off, I think.The most frustrating aspect was the conflicting information that was presented. Often times Sklansky would teach you a certain way to do things, but then offer alternative scenarios which require the opposite tactic. All this information would be contained in one paragraph. So I was never really sure what the actual advice was.I did, however, also happen to have a copy of Sklansky's \\"Theory of Poker\\" which I found to be very easy to read, well-arranged, and organized.

Most of the information still holds up to today's Hold 'Em games but for No Limit some of the strategy has to be changed. Towards the end of the book, it contains information on how to read hands.

That said, despite moments of searing truths, the film only treats it's subject matter superficially. To my mind it never gets to the root causes of institutionalized racism. The makers seem to slough it off to class resentment between blacks and the white underclass who are depicted here as wild eyed yahoos, none worse than an over-the-top Richard Widmark. Never mind that real power is wielded by the elites like the industrialists, the medical profession, and the film industry. Despite these quibbles there is alot to recommend here, not least of all a towering performance by a young Sidney Poitier as the intern caught in the middle of the racial maelstrom.

As neither pure science nor pure spirituality can cover the whole spectrum of the human subjectivity field, both are required to understand the nature and the working of the human mind. Science analyzes, reasons, and is limited by its very rationality and consistency requirements. Any single-minded spirituality on the other hand cannot capture the whole range of possible subjective approaches of reality as seen by every human being. Overall, this book provides quite interesting insight and experience as seen from a professional psychologist who is deeply interested in understanding the mind, not just describing as are most blind scientists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convenient but flawed","review":"The form factor is great for use in the car but note that you'll need a cassette player you can feed the Digisette's power cord into (the result is just like a \\"cassette adaptor\\" for a CD player). When the battery dies while playing, the unit remembers where you were when you *started* playing. This would not be an issue if it were not for the Digisette's other problem, when playing audio books the fast-forward and reverse controls are completely useless: they send you to either the start of the program or one chapter from the end (when they change the program at all). This makes using the unit tedious because you can't rewind a little when you miss something.The bundled software is also pretty lame in that it offers little help for figuring out how much more music you can fit in the remaining space and it has issues detecting the device.The hardware is fairly cool but it's let down by indifferent software both in the unit and on the PC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish It Worked Better","review":"I have had this product since April 2001.

It's already helped me on a number of issues, including covering why SECTIONs exist (something not even my compiler vendor manuals tackle, and I've certainly never seen anywhere else).I've seen a few typos, but they were obvious (again, you need to be a programmer already to spot this stuff).The CD-ROM has several demo compilers and the code examples from the book.

I thought the Japanese bondage and torture was cool, I thought showing pictures of pre-pubescent Japanese girls urinating was art. I thought seeing severed body parts in a ditch in the ground was neat. Now I realize that all these images paint a picture of a very mentally disturbed man. One can only imagine the activities Zorn has gotten himself into over in Japan. What set me off was buying \\"The Gift\\". Having downloaded some tracks and listened to a few on Amazon, I thought \\"wow Zorn has chilled out and is actually using his musical talents to make good music\\". So of course I buy the CD and as soon as I open it I have to look at pre-pubescent Japanese girls being tortured and urinating. I hope Zorn has never hurt or traumatized any pre-pubescent Japanese girls in real life, however, at this point I think that is almost a foregone conclusion.Zorn, I hope you get caught."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-have Zorn! Really great, and melodic","review":"I've got about 30 Zorn albums, and this is on my must-have list. It's Zorn at some of his most listenable--good lovemaking music for weird nights. There are lots of moods, but all of them inviting.You may not like this if you just go for the hardcore side of Zorn, but this is a beautiful and interesting recording. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pretty","review":"As others have previously (and better!)pointed out, this CD is John Zorn's take (partly) on surf guitar (marc Ribot plays)but it is also much much more.

OK, the artwork is in questionalble taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad there's not a zero star option","review":"Isn't it great to have INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC that critiques 50s American culture?

From the kiddie-porn art to the mind-numbing \\"music,\\" this disc is one of the worst ever made.

I have already read Piepers two books on the virtures (four cardinal and three theological virtues). Had I not already read those books this book would have been almost impossible to read. This books brevity is due to Pieper assuming that you already understand the virtues, not because it is simple.All the aside, this book is awesome.

The author's passion for flyfishing is evident thoughout the text. Flyfishing, however, is not the only dimension to this book. Michael Checchio also has a keen sense of place, and shares interesting bits of history, people he meets, and natural settings he visited during his flyfishing junket through the Western United States. It reads similar to a travel journal, so it will appeal to readers who want to know more about the western states.And of course, its biggest appeal will be to those of us with a passion for flyfishing. To that extent, the book can even serve as basic guidebook to fishing places such as Yellowstone, Henry's Fork, and steelhead waters in Northern California and Oregon. Aftering reading the book, you'll understand why the author quit his well-paid job in New Jersy and moved west."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turtle, turtle","review":"Looks like the picture. Sturdy. Only thing is I never got to use it! The weather started cooling off and we closed our pool. I cannot wait to use it next year. I mainly got it so I could lounge in the pool.

I can tell that this float will be a lot better for suntanning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super great...super fun!","review":"I ordered this float/island for our above ground Intex pool and it's great.

No defects or holes and easy to inflate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one!","review":"Purchased this to go floating on the river. It lasted about 1 hour before it went completely flat in the middle and kept filling with water. We looked for a small holes or air leaks but couldnt see any reason for it going flat! needless to say it stayed at the river. It was okay to lay on but sitting on it was very uncomfortable. Not very big, I was able to lay on it and put my towel and sunblock next to me but there was no room for anyone else. One of my friends tried to just sit on the side but it was very unstable and became a juggling act just to get on and off the thing! not fun at all!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Turtle Island Pool Float","review":"Excellent sturdy pool float, is large and will hold 2 people easily.

It was fun for the short time it lasted, but I am very disappointed with the quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, just beautiful.","review":"As a hardcore salsa fan, one could say this does not live up to your expectations. I as a fan of various types and sounds of music can say this album is a really nice one, although is does not have the amount of salsa I would have liked. Please note this before you purchase, it has a usual mix of Palmieri's latin jazz and some salsa. What stood out on this album was the amount of piano solos it had. Let me say that Palmieri plays absolutely beautiful piano music on this album. \\"Lisa\\" is entirely just that, piano. The album is beautiful in itself. Not the same flavor as his others, but still good."},{"rating":"2","title":"All of Mahler is here","review":"Infinite nonsense has been written by critics about this recording and -amongst other things- the Japanese chorus that Maestro Sinopoli used. Yet it remains one of the best, if not the best recording available, which neither Chailly, nor Jurowski, Haitink or Ratlle can match (perhaps the only exception to this is Pierre Boulez.)Only Sinopoli had the ear to understand the complexities and intricacies of the score and he manages to keep a perfect balance between the orchestra and the chorus (which Chailly for example blatantly fails to do), whilst bringing out the wonderful sonorities of Mahler's music.Backed by a star cast of singers, Sinopoli, his soloists, the chorus and the orchestra deliver a performance that literally brings chills down my spine every time I listen to it. All of Mahler is here.Not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Mayall's version is best","review":"Walter Trout is a great blues guitarist and this album is good. The story is that John Mayall fell ill on tour and the band filled in with out him and the Walter Trout band was formed.

I have taken some really nie crisp photos with it. I would say the only complaint I really have about it is how noisy the autofocus is. But that is why I am working on my manual focusing skills.

I just open the lens and fix it myself, works fine.However, the story did not end there. Just yesterday, during some test shots at home, the lens would not focus and the motor is trying but could not move. I switch to Manual but the focusing ring would not stay at M mode and I can turn the ring freely and it won't adjust the focus (in AF mode, the ring supposed to have resistence from the motor gear and you should not try to adjust manually).If you are thinking of buying this lens, make sure to buy it with warranty or better yet extended warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving Music for the Soul","review":"I think this is Olivia Newton John's best CD to date.

I suffer with stomach problems, and my long drive to work has been challenging and anxiety provoking. The day I first played this album I was feeling sorry for myself, and struggling to cope. The songs were so uplifting that I soon forgot my anxiety, and realized what a blessing my life truly is. Everyone has their own challenges to meet, and this truly spiritual work has helped me to deal with mine. I especially appreciated the multicultural approach she took, as I am Jewish and often spiritual works leave me feeling left out. Olivia has shown that spirituality is universal and everyone will feel uplifted with this cd. Bless you, and thank you, Olivia, from the bottom of my heart for saving me every day on my long commute.

Her 2007 Body, Heart And Spirit tour featured only one or two songs from Grace And Gratitude, so I did not buy this until recently - where the clearance price prompted me to do so.Olivia is largely known for sexy pop rock (Physical) and country stuff (Have You Never Been Mellow?), so this new agey album was totally refreshing.Wistful, tender, slightly melancholic and optimistic - Grace And Gratitude will interest those who like Govi, Chris Spheeris and Windham Hill stuff.There is a re- released version called Grace And Gratitude Renewed which features reworked songs. Also available is a pink edition with two bonus tracks - new recordings of Physical and Magic.Olivia's intention is to heal the heart and help people connect with each other. Grace And Gratitude is indeed soothing balm for the wounded soul. Just close your eyes and relax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing grace and gratitude from Olivia","review":"My wife and I stayed home on a Sunday morning, and for the first time we put on Olivia's masterpiece, \\"Grace and Gratitude.\\" I gave my wife a professional massage for the entire length of this awesome album. It was better than going to church and certainly a more spiritual experience. I wept during the entire session and I was giving the massage! (I'm a professional massage therapist who doesn't usually weep during my sessions.) My wife was wowed by the music (and by the massage, because I was so inspired!) Olivia's heartfelt work is profound; I can say with ease that it is her best performance and one of the top ten albums I would take on a vacation anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luba with gratitude","review":"Olivia's CD speaks and sings to my heart and soul! So sweet and angelic, her voice transcends all the doing-ness gently into just being-ness (without being swarmy. Because you understand that her journey through cancer inspired this.)

Once Amorphis's episode of \\"behind the music\\" airs on VH-1 we can talk.With that being said, Amorphis have released one of the best albums of 2001. Anyone who enjoys their previous release, \\"Tuonela\\" will appreciate and enjoy \\"Am Universum\\". That does not mean \\"Am Universum\\" is a continuation of \\"tuonela\\", rather \\"am universum\\" has its' own sound. The music is moody and laid-back. Emotion pours out of every note.And you know what......... Amorphis deserve their own episode of \\"behind the music\\" and deserve to be on the cover of Rolling Stone.... they've earned all of their success and rewards."},{"rating":"2","title":"a pleasant surprise","review":"ok, so maybe im going against the grain of the die hard amorphis fans, but guess what? who cares. this is a fine piece of musicianship. the songs are well crafted and colorful, the lyrics are a thing of beauty, and the songs have the perfect amount of catchy-ness. Maybe their older albums were more ground-breaking, but this is still quite good. oh, and dont be fooled by other reviews. this album isnt as soft and poppy as many reviews state. while the songs dont grind, they still have a good amount of heavy riffs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downhill","review":"I am usually willing to give Amorphis the benefit of the doubt because they have proven themselves in the past. I didn't like Elegy at first but i stuck with it and now think it is easily their second best work (Tales) and is not far from the top. There is no question Amorphis has, well, morphed since the early days. I have no problem with that in it self, but the thing is, this album isn't good. The songs sound the same for the most part and the instrumental work mushes together and competes instead of complements. it isn't really melodic, more like chaotic. I don't think the saxophone helps at all. pasi's voice seems out of place here. The only highlight of this album is the first track, Alone, which is a very good song. The vocals are excellent and the song moves slowly. If you encounter this album in a used CD store for about 2$, you might check it out for that song. Otherwise stick with early Amorphis work."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened!?!","review":"Amorphis had embarked on the direction towards being total sellouts back on Tuonela but this album dissapoints me even more! Not only is there absolutely any sign of metal within these songs, but even got rid of the northern \\"Elf Melodies\\" (as I like to call them) that I used to love this band for. All that's left is something that sounds like what you'd hear on a Top 40 radio station. Why would one of the best melodic death metal bands sell out soooooo bad!?!! My favorite Amorphis album and their musical and creative peak had to have been Elegy. After that they must have gotten some money waved infront of their faces and they decided to sell out! Perhaps if you're a fan of Alternative rock you might want to get this but if not do not waste your time or money, because it is nothing like the Melodic metal masterpieces they used to write."},{"rating":"1","title":"bland","review":"If you didn't like Tuonela, well, this is more of the same, so stay away by all means. I bought this CD for $3, and it certainly wasn't even worth that. I'm a fan of the Metal band Amorphis once was. All these songs sound the same to me. What are these guys doing? The last good song they made was \\"greed\\". Amorphis has Metallicitis; they reek of a band that should just quit."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Album, NOT.","review":"I've always heard that Amorphis was a good band. When I heard this one, I wasn't sure if I was listening to the same band. At first I thought this band's music got mixed up with some ambient album. Sadly, I was wrong. Not only that, but someone tried to compare this to Blue Oyster Cult. HOW DARE YOU! B.O.C. are actually talented. I know, I saw them live! Also, I don't care what anyone thinks of this, at least Metallica (ugh) stayed metal somewhat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Garbage!","review":"This album is absolute junk! These guys make Metallica's newer albums seem like classics! I'm not just saying this with a close mind here, I've heard it (or at least as much as my poor soul could handle). For crying out loud, its not even metal at all! I hate to say it, but I think they've gone goth here. Beleive me, I feel like I am giving this thing far too much creadit by giving it 1 star.

I've tried everything and this stuff is still disgusting! It does NOT dissolve, no matter now much you blend, shake, let sit, etc. There will always be clumps. More importantly, you can ALWAYS taste the off-spoiled milk taste of this product. Even in shakes, it makes the shakes extra foamy and is hard to swallow. The ONLY luck I've had using this is putting it in pancake batter (beware, as it makes the pancakes burn, as it changes the property of the batter). Very disappointing.

She blends this all with a little romance, and all together they make for an enjoyable book. Sarah Brandt always manages to find herself enmeshed in a mystery, and then she calls upon her friend, Frank Malloy to help her out. In this one Sarah becomes embroiled with a Christian mission that helps young girls escape from lives of poverty, despair and inevitable prostitution. Who is killing girls from this mission? You can bet Sarah just has to find out. These books are quite fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"MURDER ON MULBERRY BEND","review":"A captivating read that keeps the pages turning to the end!

If you really think this hair spray has a different chemical to bond to the toppik better then purchase it. I would compare this hair spray with any other strong hold hair spray you can buy anywhere. I don't want to burst your bubble and say Santa don't exist. I was one of those guys dooped thinking this hair spray was different. Save your money and just use your existing hair spray. Honestly, I want my money back but I already paid for the dumb shipping and handling fee so I'm stuck with it. Anyone want a buy a used Toppik Hairspray?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Toppik Fiberhold Spray stinks","review":"I just bought the Toppik fibers and spray today and used for the first time. I am a woman with thinning hair, and I must say that I am very pleased with the results. BUT, the spray STINKS!!! It has such an overwhelmingly strong smell that I don't plan on using it again - I don't understand why the manufacturer found it necessary to make it scented at all . . . I can't believe that men use this and can tolerate it (or that their girlfriends/wives can stand it!).Unfortunately, the company website has no way of contacting them via email, and since I can't call them while I'm at work, I'm stuck making my comments on this review.I won't be buying the spray again, and will just use my regular unscented hairspray to hold the fibers in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"First off, the Toppik Fibers are a great product and I couldn't be more satisfied. However, the \\"Fiberhold Spray\\" is just like any other strong hairspray. I'm a guy with long hair, so it's somewhat inconvenient for me to use hairspray (I normally leave it natural). I found that the moisture of the hairspray made the fibers actually clump more, so I stopped using it after a week and I've had no problems with the fibers. The most disappointing aspect of this product is it's alcohol-based, which can dry the shafts out and make your hair break easier (not to mention it burns my sensitive scalp). Hairspray would be good for activities where you'll sweat, but I'd recommend using a non-alcohol spray ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This is no better than any other hair spray.

The Toppik fibers, hair fattener and pump attachment are really good products."},{"rating":"2","title":"good hair spray for natural toppik fiber","review":"I used this before, it has good effect on holding the special Toppik made hair fiber. The only thing is it's like selling medicines at pharmacy store, moderately high price at above $30 for just a small bottle of spray. Would be a good thing if this can be sold as ordinary merchant products on the shelf of many supermarkets so price can be more competitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"God bless Martina","review":"I am especially excited about this new DVD of Martina McBride's because it includes the video for \\"Concrete Angel,\\" a superb song that was not included in the \\"Greatest Hits\\" DVD.

She has a beautiful voice and a lot of class; she is not afraid to sing about things like faith, hope, and prayer, and she will go far with that.This DVD is available at a great price and for a singer with this much talent, it is well worth every penny.

It would play only some DVDs and music CDs. And after a year, it doesn't play anything at all.The sound is not that great as they tell you either. Ok, if you stand at a specific distance from your speakers, and you place them so that they ALL face you... Then you hear ok. But just move a few centimeters from this blessed spot and it doesn't sound better than my laptop speakers.

One is the remote control design - intermittent at best. Another is the tray design. It misaligns itself, and scrapes up the disks inside. Do not buy this product.

The manual is very difficult to use. It gives you a million little buttons to push on the remote which makes a million different things pop up in one or more of several possible display areas. It is nice that it tells you what button makes what thing pop up on the screen but very little to no explaination of how that function is supposed to enhance your listening experience.

You can put daily stuff use items in there for easy access. Also, you can put towels or other small items in upper area since it has addition space with zippers to keep it close.

I've watched them for about 4 years now and I'm afraid they may be getting a little too big (I know I sound like a bitter \\"original\\" fan).

No matter how many times I've listened to this album, none of the tracks really grab me. I love the lyrics (especially in \\"Human\\"), I give you that. But his voice kind of drones on, and doesn't seem to have the right amount of soul required for such brilliant lyrics. Although, I have to admit some of REM's stuff once did this same thing, until I got used to it...but none of the songs are as classic and original as any of their stuff.And I can understand the comparisons to Semisonic lyricwise, but John Mayer? no.

Every track has something catchy in it, which is one of the things I also liked about Angie Aparo's \\"The American,\\" and the songs don't all sound alike, either. You can enjoy this in the car with all your friends regardless of what their musical tastes may be; it's not weird enough to offend people with mainstream tastes, while at the same time possessing a level of songcraft and attention to detail sufficient to satisfy those who demand more depth in their music. You'd be forgiven for taking the title \\"Useful Music\\" ironically, but after giving the disc a fair listen you'll agree it's simply an honest assessment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lyrics Great Music","review":"The title \\"Useful Music\\" sums up this album nicely. This record is a great piece of work that is just plain fun to listen to.

So I took up to the lady asked for a listen & then immediately bought it put it in my Cd player & played it to a few friends of mine at uni who also really liked it & asked for the name of the group.

The other tracks are well-produced and studio quality, but none is really memorable, there being in my view no distinctive \\"Josh Joplin\\" motif and no endearing liveliness in song (the exception being Camera One).Perhaps the songs will grow on me over time.

There are a few preachy lyrical moments, but the quality of the music is so good that I could care less. Wally Farkas (guitar, production) has really helped take this band to the next level, and Jerry Gaskill (King's X drummer) sounds right at home with the band.It is a monumental injustice that this band has been ignored by mainstream radio, and its terribly disappointing to have learned that GC has broken up.

I regret that i wasted money on this book, if all you beginners out there want a good book get, Mastering Witchcraft or A Modern witche's guide to magic and spells."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rediculous","review":"The title is so misleading. Complete guide? Bah. The author doesnt understand any of the material and the book is a waste of money. It only talks of old ways and black magick and Satan and the devil. It talks more about satanism than witchcraft. Dont buy this. The only good part about it is the herb listings. I would give this 0 starts but unfortunately, thats not possible. Dont waste your time on this, its a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Satanic and Evil","review":"If you want to get a general idea of this book, look at the cover for a minute. Notice that there is a pentagram on the front, not a pentacle. Anyone who knows anything about witchcraft will know what this means. I advise everyone to stay clear of this book, for your own good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Witchcraft is about balance","review":"Now I dont know whats worse the fluffy bunnies or the people that only want to work with the darkside because they think it is more cool. Witchcraft is about balance. Not all dark and not all light. This book isnt about balance it is about what Christians think of witches. It is also about Satan and Lucifer,etc. The spells in here and nasty,come one eating a spider for strength. You want physical strength exercise. Know yes the old witches did curse,but they cursed when someone was a threat to them or their own,not just because someone looked at them wrong. So grow up."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Should Be In The \\"Comedy\\" Section!","review":"This book is complete and utter nonsense for a true Wiccan seeker, but if your looking for a few hearty chuckles, buy this book! Really, this is just an embarassment to modern Wicca and I'm ashamed that the word \\"Witchcraft\\" was even on the cover. This book was probably written either buy a crazed Christian or some guy out to make an extra buck. This book is, as a previous reviewer stated: \\"A complete waste of time and paper\\"Buttom line:If you want Wicca, read \\"Wicca:A Guide For The Solitary Practicioner\\". If you want to add some humor to your day, read this!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"This book is not really all that bad as the reviews may imply. I do not currently own this revised edition, but I own the first edition, so they might of changed it or not but hear me out. NOT ALL MAGIC IS AIRY FAIRY. How many times do I have to yell that out? A good witch or magician knows and practices both aspects of light and dark magic. (Not with a friggin' K!)The spells contained herein are from various grimoires and books. Some are for historical use and shows what magic was back in the day. It was not always light and fluffy. Also, sometimes a lot of lies were often written in grimores to confuse the non-magician.Overall, this is not a bad read. Its interesting and would be a good book to read on historical witchcraft and magic. It may suprise you, read the words and look past what's written.J.R."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHUT UP WICCANS","review":"This is NOT a book about the neo modern religion of wicca. Wicca is from gerald gardner and popularized by the idiot scott cunningham. This is a book of WITCHCRAFT which is seperate and apart from wicca. This book is not for fluffy bunnies who believe in karma, which is an eastern hindu concept. A witch is a witch,and witches have backbone. This book contains rituals and incantations along with spells and potions for a witch to add to her practice. I reccomend this book to those who favor Paul Huson's great work MASTERING WITCHCRAFT. Paul Huson's mastering witchcraft is an excelent place to get started and this book is an excelent continuation. I would strongly reccomend people stay away from anything and everything written by scott cunningham and as a general rule it is probably best to avoid any Llewyllyn Publication."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty vague","review":"This was my first witchcraft book, and doing the spells were numerous and complicated. A certain spell that I cast to make it rain was done about fifteen times because I wanted to make sure I had done it right. It did rain, however. It took one week of building and one week of storm. I also did an impotence spell for my sister who had gotten \\"accidentally\\" pregnant...she had a miscarriage 2 nights later. These spells are very powerful, but you have to have patience and concentration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Weak","review":"This is by far, the funniest book that I've read on witchcraft.

If you are looking for a concise guide to witchcraft this book will be a welcome addition to anyone's library.This book contains some source material from ancient grimoires, so be warned some of the spells and incantations may not be to everyone's taste/style of practice.However the later material on stones, herbs, and folk magick are quite useful and interesting. I also liked the info on talismans and planetary magick.Since the book can be bought for a incrediably cheap price, pick up a copy and check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad!","review":"Hey, listen you guys. The spells, potions, and incantations of this book are merely compiled from other sources. It isn't the author's fault that some of the spells are disgusting or dangerous, that's just how they are. It is a very interesting read and is a good reference for its herbs, animals, and stones section. This book has good historical info and references to other books on the topic of magic(k)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A competent manual for the black witch","review":"While I do not agree with the morals or virtues within this book, I cannot deem it useless or fake. No, it is not a guide to contemporary white magic and spirituality (as Wicca), but for a Satanic witch or a black witch it is indeed a valuable resource. I respect the author for daring to write books on such a topic.Even if you do not ally yourself with the ideals, it is still an interesting piece of literature if only for entertainment purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be nice... if it worked","review":"In the few weeks I have had this product, I 1) have yet to get it working, 2) have yet to successfully access the Audible.com promo offer the Digisette comes with (their website insists I've already done so), and 3) have yet to get either company to respond to repeated attempts to get support.

Everything from her husband's inability to start a fire in the fireplace to her own inability to cope with turning 40, nothing is sacred or forbidden when Erma writes about her life.This book is funny, witty, relevant, and an easy read.

These papers are considered to be definitive in the mind of the editor. If you need a complete guide to the analysis of power electronic circuits and drives, this is not the book.

On the plus side, the characters in the story seem believable for the most part and the story does unfold in a reasonably cohesive manner, something that is not always the case with this genre.

The author presents his opinions, often without adequate doumentation. He simply presents something as \\"fact\\" by stating that \\"that is how it must have been\\". End of argument. For a \\"beginner\\" on CW history, I can see this book's appeal, since it tells things simply and confirms all of the popular myths. But the more well-read CW buff should come away shaking his head.

The story begins with the lead character, Amanda, as a little girl and follows her life through middle age as she searches for herself, her child and her passions.

Sally Fields gives a credible performance as a self-absorbed, \\"champion of truth\\" journalist who's oblivious to the impact of her stories on people's lives and livelihood. Wilford Brimley is at his best when he \\"reads the riot act\\" to each one of the \\"culprits\\" in the climactic confrontation scene, and, in doing so, ties together the loose ends of the film's storyline.While the movie lacks the action (and pace) of many popular films today, it rewards the thoughtful, patient viewer who appreciates watching a carefully executed revenge. It's one of my all-time favorites. I've seen this film about a half dozen times over a period of years and still enjoy it as much today as I did when I first saw it on the big screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Lew Harper, Please Stand Up.","review":"As a private citizen turned detective and \\"Sting\\" artist after being targeted by a government inquiry, Paul Newman puts in a performance second to none, together with a good script and fine supporting cast.

I guess apparently the freedom to voice one's dislike of this film and doing a review of it can land you in hot water,What is my problem with the movie, except for Beautiful Miami as a backdrop,the story,the intrigue all is to naught.And the Length of the movie with the predictable plot stays the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozefest","review":"Wilford Brimley is very good in this film but that is about all it has going for it.

The secondary roles are also well written and interesting. The movie belongs to the category of moral movies and tries to defend these two ideas :- Things and people are not always what or who they seem to be.- The newspapers should have the duty to verify their sources before printing anything.The treatment of the subject is well done, the screenplay being sometimes too weak.

It is a very powerful story about how the press can ruin peoples lives without being absolutely sure they are printing the truth and how they can be manipulated into furthering someone elses agenda regardless of how accurate the story they have been fed really is.

Most bad movies and that is most American films could and should be made for TV or not at all.

I utilized the 'Look inside' feature and the book was displayed as being in Italian. I was extremely disappointed with this product from Amazon and their representation of it. This mistake greatly delayed me from receiving the correct book. I also went to a different website to order the correct Italian version of the book.

Then the motor quit. I finally quit messing with it and dropped it off at Goodwill.Save your money. Buy a real chainsaw. I had the opportunity more than once to be cutting firewood with friends who used Sthils and Huskys.

It only gets occasional use throughout the year. I have never had any real issues with it. Still runs strong. The pull cord does stick every once in awhile, but a sharp tap to the side frees it. It's a little finecky when at idle (stalls sometimes), but other than that I've cut more than my fair share of wood over the years for the $150 I paid for it.

I have had the same issue of constantly having to adjust the chain. In order to have the proper tightness of the chain, the bar literally has to hit the clutch drum sprocket. And the chain brake is just stupid. The clutch never disengages. The drum is held \\"tight\\" by a tension ring. This bogs the motor down and makes the saw shut off when the brake is engaged. If you know any thing about chainsaw safety you know that the brake should be on anytime you are not making a cut. Oh, and the brake doesn't even hold after you've used the saw for a few months.

And if you pay for this Poulan \\"Wild Thing\\" you are buying frustration and little else. This saw cuts well . . . when you can start it and keep it running. Just don't try to restart it when it is warm. You have to wait a couple hours until it cools down completely. The choke won't stay in place. The idle screw does not hold - I have to continuously adjust the idle. The chain/bar oil plug vibrated loose. I lost the plug, oil spilled all over my pants leg and boot. The replacement plug I ordered from Poulan cost a fortune. The fuel tank only holds enough gasoline for, at most, 15 minutes of cutting (if you can get the saw started in the first place) and then you have to wait a couple hours until the engine completely cools before you can restart it.

I keep having to adjust the chain, put the chain back on, etc... This last weekend, I somehow jammed up the cylinder so the sprocket won't even turn.

But if you may need to use it more, turn your nose up at it. This is the second one I've had, because I thougt the first one was just a piece. They are mostly plastic, the chain oil tank is just a cavity between the two halves of the plastic body, prone to leak. The engine is ok, but the carbuerator is a cheap chinese made piece of junk (zama brand) that has to be rebuilt or adjusted with a special tool almost every time it is used. The caps for fuel and oil are course plastic threaded so after removing them a couple of times they rag out and need to be removed and put on with a pair of pliers, the magneto is held in with screws that go through plastic so they rag out...

I spoke to Nintendo, and they're having dozens of calls a day with the same problem, even erasing all memory from accumulated games. Even if you stop using the light, the Gameboy is corrupted.

Highly recommended for any Gameboy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darn thing broke","review":"After about two days of using this thing, the wire inside it snapped. I never got it to work again. It wasnt much good while it worked anyway, the light was so bright that it reflected off the screen and made it very hard to see. Very unfortunate because it would be nice to be able to see my game boy in the dark.

I would not reccomend this product to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good way to get a headache","review":"The bulb's glare on the screen is unavoidable, thus it's difficult to play games.

I have high standards, you should too. The manufacturer brags about the patented \\"white light\\" used for this item. Since when can you patent white light?? What next, patented oxygen?? Deceptive advertising here. The effect of the light is akin to shining a minature keychain flashlight onto your lcd screen. Yes, it is better than other game boy lights out there, but still isn't worth a measley 10 bucks. If you use the light, you will notice that the light will concentrate heavily on a specific area of the screen, no matter how you adjust it. Very bad for your eyes"},{"rating":"2","title":"No more sitting next to lamps with this light!","review":"The Nyko WormLight is a must for gameboy color users!

He did fraud on us"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, but save your money!","review":"While I have enjoyed my Game Boy a great deal, I cannot help wondering how they could have made it with such a hard to see, glare-prone screen. So of course I thought this light would be a great idea. Was I wrong! Don't get me wrong, the light works ok, but then, holding the Game Boy in bright light at the proper angle is also OK and costs no money. The light casts an horrendous glare that almost negates its usefullness and really does not light up the screen very well at any angle.

Matthew can think of nothing else but to make Pet his even at her expense.If you loved Tamora Pierce's work, but also enjoy more intense romance you will love this book!

I couldn't put it down. Some stories are not very erotic, they are mostly romantic, but which woman doesn't like romanticism, specially, about those fairy tales we heard as young girls. I read the book faster than I would've want to and so I was left with the desire of the next book. Also, this book can be read at any time because it's not a vulgar erotic. I truly recommend this book to any woman who is true to herself and like a little spice in her life without embarrassment. Beauty and the Beast was the best.The 2nd book I like, but don't love... see review for Enchanted Again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written","review":"The anthology is a good idea, albeit one done before, but the problem is that the stories are simply badly written. For example, the first story, a retelling of Beauty & The Beast, reads like a lawyer wrote it. The language reads very clinical. It feels like reading stereo instructions and when it does leap into more erotic story telling, the prose is juvenile. I found that most of the stories are this way- at least unsophisticated.I did not find any of the stories \\"erotic.\\" I thought the authors were too worried about their stories being \\"porn\\" that they forgot to make it sexy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanted: Erotic Bedtime Stories for Women","review":"I purchased this for my wife for Valentine's Day based on posted reviews. As others have noted, it is a well-written twist on some familiar (and not-so-familiar) fairy tales, erotic without being crude. It plays to some interesting fantasies, and I enjoyed reading it to her. The only downside was a bit of preachy feminism in a few of the tales - still, a worthwhile purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God I didnt take \\"I can't believe this\\"'s advice.","review":"I feel sorry for that woman for thinking that sexuality is something to be ashamed of.I almost didnt purchase this wonderful book of erotic short stories because I thought the person who wrote that knew what they were talking about , and purchased this solely because I wanted to see what she was so pissed about , and everyone else seemed to enjoy so much.Not only is it tastefully written, it touches upon fantasies and things that alot of women seem to be ashamed of because of society.

I was outraged that this is being sold as truly what women fantasize about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible message","review":"I bought this book because I was hoping for a sex positive book for females. I was definitely wrong. Tons of the short stories were of women being taken advantage of. For example, take Goldy Locks and the Three Bears. Instead of bears it was three men. When they found Goldy Locks in their house they surrounded her and started taking off her clothes. It sounded more like rape than sexy to me. Every story the female didn't like what was happening, but then suddenly she was fine with it.To me this was not a female positive book at all. It was just suggesting the idea that women like being raped."},{"rating":"2","title":"She knows what women want","review":"Maybe the reviewers who dissed Madore's subject matter are the exception to the rule--or maybe they are in denial about their own urges---but women love submission mixed with love. We love it, we want it, we fantasize about it.I thought these stories hit the mark and the book started off strong. But then it became a teensy bit repetitive in the sex scenes.Also, some of the later chapters had appalling typos! Who edited this book? \\"Fairing\\" for \\"faring\\"? A \\"dear\\" caught in headlights. Good grief! People do not like to pay money for a product with flaws in its quality. Right?

It was very bland, and not what I expected at all. I thought it would be more along the lines of Sleepy Beauty triology, i.e. fairy tales with a nice, erotic twist. These stories were so boring and some of them were disturbing in general. I'm not sure what this book should be classified, but it's not erotica. Rather than moving a woman forward in her sexuality, it seems to promote demeaning them. I would recommend Lora Leigh, Shayla Black, or the Sleeping Beauty triology rather than this book. It could have been so much better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"This book is full of stories where the woman has to be coerced into pleasure.

Too many stories - not enough character development. Some of it is just plain disturbing and uncomfortable. Not enough romance and love. Just kinda yuck.

I'm sorry to say that I had to skip-through the first 2/3 of the first story in this book -- Wedding in White. It was not as sensual or gripping as some of her better works. Only the last 1/3 of the story was gripping, and I would give about 2.5 stars for this story....What was worse was the second story in this book -- Circle of Gold. It just didn't make any kind of sense!

This is a difficult role and friends of Gounod thought it was unsingable for a purely lyric voice of the first Mireille.I love Vanzo and he does not disappoint here.

He may be a great story-teller in person however this does not come through in this book. There are many things he says are funny before relating a particular anecdote, but I can't really remember laughing once during this book. All the stories seemed to fizzle out and the punch-line seemed to leave the anecdote unfinished. You all know the type of thing I mean. Think of the last party you went to that had the guy who couldn't tell a joke to save his life.Mr. Kennedy does give some insight into the business of movie-making, and this is interesting, but not enough so to save this effort. I have to wonder after reading some of the other reviews if we all read the same book...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more","review":"Burt Kennedy has written excellent screenplays for Budd Boetticher, but it does not show here. Perhaps he wrote this small book during two or three evenings. He did not care to check facts. There is no plot, just some stories in no particular order. Some are fairly interesting, but the whole is not good. I expected more stories about Scott and Boetticher. If you want a good book about film-making, buy Harry Carey's book. There is a good filmography, but one can get it from IMBD, too. It is again interesting to observe, how differently one can experience a book or a film. Some liked this book very much, some didn't. These kind of ratings are not very helpful. But I did read it, though, but expected much more. I liked his honest evaluations of some some poor films. For me one of those poor ones is the Train Robbers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus' beliefs","review":"This is slow going, but if you want to know what Jesus Himself actually said, as opposed to what the Gospel writers said, this is well worth the time. It is meticulously researched. What is interesting is that it places both Jesus and John the Baptist in their cultual and religious setting. Both of them were Jews, and neither said he was starting a new religion. Instead, they were exhorting other Jews to get ready for the End Times. This is called an eschatological view of religion, and, in Jesus' time, Jews were convinced that the End Times were close. Vermes also places Jesus in the context of several other known traveling rabbis of the time, which is interesting. He also shows that Jesus was not an Essene, one of the sect that left us the Dead Sea Scrolls."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wild Blue Yonder","review":"Weird, will definitely be a cult favorite.

And today, I'm on this site because I will be recommending this book to my adult nephew, who is recovering from losing a job that was a complete mismatch to his strengths and personality.If your work life is just plain hard and you can't figure out why, this book may just be your lifesaver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used book","review":"I ordered a new book. The book I recieved had underlining in it and some of the lessons had been filled in. It is hard to do the lessons when you are looking at someone else's answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, I didn't like it","review":"I don't understand what all the fuss is about. It's not that good. Things you don't care about, like who started what and how things were done in the old days, are carefully explained. This is great information if you want to hang out over a couple of brewskies and B.S. with the guys. But the actual step-by-step techniques leave out so many steps they are unusable. In other words, it's a great book if you know so much you don't need it. If you do need it, you've just wasted your money on this one. My hunch is that they got their considerably huge group of scruffy, over 50 geek buddies with pony tails and bald spots to write these reviews for them. You'll be pulling your hair out trying to \\"grok\\" this one. Besides, they tell you this is the only place to get these \\"secrets\\". Not in 2001 it aint."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about LAYERS?","review":"As the book title suggests, channels are the main event here. The problem is that with the introduction of layers in Photoshop, many of the techniques discussed in the book are now much more easily done in layers, making the book out-of-date. The authors suggest that channels are still a valid way to do the work, but why make your work harder than it needs to be?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectrum Review - David Duberman","review":"David Biedny and Bert Monroy are a couple of Photoshop gurus, and in this book, they team up with Nathan Moody to bring you the definitive book on using the venerable program's channel operations. An entertaining and educational introduction by Biedny discusses pre-digital compositing technology, a history of Photoshop, and includes sections entitled Why Are You Reading This? and Monkeys Push Buttons, Humans Push Their Brains. The chapters proper cover channels, alpha channels, layers, calculations (Biedny hates what Adobe did to calculations in version 4, so uses a hypothetical Calculations box for part of the chapter), paths and blue screen/green screen. At 226 pages, it doesn't seem very long, but it's got more good stuff than many books twice as long, including lots of groovy color illustrations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big mistake","review":"I bought this version by mistake. This version has it's moments, but is no comparison to the James Stewart version. Harry Anderson as Dowd had potential at first, but the movie is ruined for the most part by certain actors trying too hard to act, and some too little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry","review":"Harvey is one of my all time favorite movies and this remake should have never happened. It has none of the richness of the original, and the changes made to it created a choppy story that was unbearable to watch. I so wanted this to work as I enjoy Harry Anderson but the original Harvey still stands strong--don't touch the classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Author's First Novel Earns Its Stripes","review":"In this compelling first novel, author JB Hamland brings the 1970s to life and plops the reader right down in the middle of an Air Force base, with its rigid rules and melting pot of personalities that have been thrown together for better or worse. The characters are vividly drawn and brought to life by each of their distinctive personalities, and like the novel's two female protagonists, we are stuck with them all, even the ones we don't like. The author uses setting to great effect, especially in one of the standout scenes in which an act of nature takes center stage. Another interesting thing about the book is how the author depicts so much emotional chaos taking place within the rigid structure of the military community. The setting highlights the fact that human relationships can be pretty messy, but the payoff for getting your hands dirty is true love...if you're lucky. A great first novel by a promising author."},{"rating":"1","title":"A chatty story that becomes too self-indulgent.","review":"Jill Robinson's book starts out in a breezy, chatty style, with lots of name dropping of mostly old or dead Hollywood types from the 40's and 50's. Mid-way through the book, I really started to lose interest. I was expecting a more sophisticated, mature writing style, but her prose is very simple, with a surprising reptitiveness to it. Maybe that's because the story is about her memory loss, and the author forgets she uses similar descriptions over and over again. It's a very self-indulgent book, with sporadic attempts at academic credibility, as when she talks to doctors and scientists associated with memory studies. The whole thing felt disorganized and over-long. I think it would have worked better as a long magazine piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geez!","review":"I am still not finished because I don't want this book to end.

The Canadian jazz group that accompanies Patchen on these recordings play jazz standards that don't necessarily fit with the poetry. Plus, Patchen sounds lost, and his readings are surprisingly poor (even a little bizarre, the way he stretches out the vowels).The jazz/poetry album that Patchen recorded with Allyn Ferguson and the Chamber Jazz Sextet (now available on CD as \\"Rebel Poets of America\\") is vastly superior to this one. Patchen's readings on \\"Rebel Poets\\" are top-notch, and the jazz accompaniment (which consists of Ferguson's original compositions that he tailored for each individual poem) is also excellent.If you can find \\"Rebel Poets of America,\\" I'd say that's the one to own. \\"Kenneth Patchen Reads with Jazz in Canada\\" is for completists only.\`"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get It!","review":"Get It!

This is the one I use over and over. In fact, I'm replacing my original copy because I've worn it out.

This book helped me go beyond its recipes and start creating my own. P.S. I heartily recommend the scallion pancakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more looking through stains!","review":"This cookbook, as simple as the recipes are, is a good one. So good that our original copy had become heavily stained. The different cooking sauces concocted from the wonderful recipes were so thick in places that some pages could probably have been eaten on the spot!

Whether you believe Moses actually channeled the teachings he asserts is, quite truthfully, irrelevant. The truths that emerge irrespective are just that...truths...and some truths are absolute.The theme of what Moses (and/or Imperator, et al.) outlines in this book is, to me, one of those absolutes...and it's one of spiritual freedom and individual sovereignty...something that no man or institution (religious or otherwise) can take away from any of us.I truly love this book and have recommended it to everyone who has ever asked me about my favorite reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"This set started shutting itself off intermittently a week after I bought it.

Based on the Genesis account from the Holy Bible before the great flood of Noah's day when Satan and the fallen angels took for themselves as wives, the beautiful daughters of fleshly man.This book is supposedly a long lost diary of Aloma, or Seola, the wife of Noah's youngest son Japheth.This diary was found next to the bones of Two bodies in a hidden cave near Mt.Ararat. It was written on linen and neatly placed inside a cylinder that was untouched by oxygen and the elements for Thousands of years.What is revealed in this book is very thought provoking and leaves one wondering throughout the whole story; Is this real? This could of happened or, This is exactly the way it was in a pre-flood world.This is a must read and will leave you wondering; How could Mrs. J.G. Smith have thought this up.

I'd rather have him dealing with his pathology in the open like this than letting it stew in his psyche alone. He is giving all of the proceeds to groups that deal with rape and is offering himself in any way that others wish to discuss and try to understand why he did what he did. There's more to the book than the rape - but it's clear he cannot for a moment escape the consequenses of the harm he caused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbed Man on the Loose","review":"This \\"memoir\\" by Mr. Eisenberg is a disgusting display of self indulgence passing for some form of wisdom. His depraved life and behaviors,from the openning chapter where as a buddhist monk he rapes a woman, to the closing sentences indicating no self awareness at all, is an example of the worst of the '60s gone even worse. How Eisenberg is allowed to walk the planet unescorted is a testament to the depravity of amerika. And outing his own daughter?

You must be joking...","review":"The good: lots of big color pictures and plenty of stats.The bad: the recounting of each season is pitiful - every year up until VERY recent years (i.e.; the vast majority of the book) is glossed over in two or three paragraphs. Worse, each paragraphs is usually made up of one or two over-long, rambling and awkwardly written sentences. So yes, you see who won what when, but the color commentary is so useless it might as well not be included - pretty silly considering the amount of drama inherent in any given racing season.Honestly, I'd rather read one solid book about a single bad year than this poorly thought out book that purports to cover them all.

The album is well written and performed. Lead singer Dana Oxendine shines on this first release. Her vocals are strong and sultry. Guitar, bass, and drums are very tight. What really impressed me was the obvious effort put into the production and engineering of this cd. High quality prog that echoes Pink Floyd, Genesis, and Yes. Worthy of the collection!Bands like this are hard to come by. I can tell they really love to make music. Good music..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Star Talent - Three Star Production = ****","review":"The fact that Farpoint has a Cd is wild! They remind me of the Dixie Dregs when they released their first CD recorded in a garage or something. There are some tough moments here and there from the technical standpoint. But from the point of view of Art - this is a (very) beautiful and diverse collection of music. It is folky-prog...it is straight prog....it is tough as nails and soft as an Angels cheek. I suspect that in coming releases we will hear more of Dana Oxendine. Clark Boone has a wonderful voice that is so strong, it apparently challenged the mix down. This is common for first releases. If you like what you hear form Spock's Beard, TransAtlantic and the new wave of progressive - buy this CD - you will be in on the beginning of a new special sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Good Old Days....","review":"So I bought this because it was less than $5; well even at that price and with a free $5 promo from Amazon MP3 I still feel I got ripped off.

Hisses and all tinny. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nostalgic!","review":"OK, they didn't \\"digitally remaster\\" these recordings. They're exactly like you'd hear them on the \\"record player\\" at Christmas in the 60's. Very minor skips and cracks lend to the nostalgia. If you're looking for concert hall quality, skip this one, but for the true recordings by Bing Crosby, Rosemary Clooney, Frank Sinatra and others, just as you remember them, then you'll love this download! I'd give it a five star, except that they have Frank Sinatra's \\"Oh Come All Ye Faithful,\\" and several tracks later they have Bing Crosby's \\"Adeste Fideles.\\" Ummm...SAME SONG!!

The laser ball thing is kinda cool (though I dont have much need for it.) What I really need is a stud finder. This product is nice, compact, and cheap.

B) They covert quickly and easily from benches with backs to picnic tables with benches. C) Since it has a lifetime warranty and I used composite 2x4's (which have a lifetime warranty), these are the last benches/picnic tables I will have to build. (No rotting, no insect damage).Suggestions: Measure very carefully. Pre-drill holes. Use a screw gun. Use spacers (not provided), don't eyeball it. They go together quickly, but don't rush.

MANY SPILLS AND MUCH CLEAN UP!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unsteady top","review":"I bought two of these to use as a complete table. The instructions were easy to follow and it wasn't very difficult to assemble. As a bench, the product is sturdy and comfortable. As a table, or half a table, the product is unsatisfactory. There is no way to lock the table top in the upright postition so that it does not wobble.

This gives it a really unprofessional look, despite all the diagrams and the \\"easy to read style\\". The editors should take a course in spelling and typing. If they do not have the time to do so, they should consider spending a few minutes to find out how the spellcheck option works.

Hopefully the eighth edition will turn out to be a bit better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two romantic tales and one realistic tale","review":"The big mistake that is made about Flaubert is to classify him as a realist, when in fact he was a romantic. It is universally declared that the whole worth of this volume resides in 'A Simple Heart', the only realistic tale. My heretical take on this is that it is the romantic tales 'St Julian' and 'Herodias' which give this volume its worth. Far from being the best tale, I consider 'A Simple Heart' to be the least interesting tale, a boring tale that has been admired only because of its realism, as if realism were the be-all and end-all of literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy the Full-Price Title!","review":"This is a terrific CD but don't buy the full-price version of this title.

This game was rushed to the stores and is full of bugs. I pre-ordered it only to re-sell it after playing it once. The Show, 07 is hands down the best baseball game available.

At least it wasnt an offensive minded game like 2K6 for 360. You can actually play D in this game. I could easily score 10-15 runs on all-star in 2K6. That is why I gave a 3 for fun. The A.I. is very competitive, other than that please get MLB: The Show 07. I know it looks like a remake of last year's game, but it is worth the 10 extra dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"huge dissapointment","review":"Fans of EA's MLB 06 will be horribly dissapointed with this title. First of all, the loading times are ridiculous. The game frequently freezes midplay as if it can't catch up with the action. Also, there seems to be no logic to the game. Pitches that you may connect with well one time will just ground out the next. I have played about 7 games with this title since I bought it, and i cant help but emphasize frustration. The controls seem like they're on valium half the time, as sometimes you'll push a button with no recognizable response. The bottom line is, when I play this game, I feel like I'm running a brand new computer game on a five year old computer, with totally inconsistent controls. Like I said, frustrating, especially if you come from playing the great EA MLB series. Look elsewhere to satisfy your MLB hunger, or seriously, just rent this first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Awful","review":"This game is terrible. I was shocked to find my Minnesota Twins who won 96 games last year were ranked 24th overall, and the Yankees (with no more than a mediocre pitching staff coming into the season) had a perfect overall rating.

One thing I like is the complete updated rosters. The graphics are hidious. Every batter has the same batting stance, and every pitcher has the same windup! Corny!!

No Hammond B3 organ, nor trumpet added, even no electric saz (Turkish instrument). Yet we have three soloists; Shepik leaves plenty of room for drummer Tom Rainey and bass player Scott Colley to excel on their instrument.All songs are original (written by Shepik) except for the last track which is a Sundanes (Indonesia) traditional.Even though Rainey is a creative drummer I wonder how this CD would have sound like if Bill Stewart was on the drums..."},{"rating":"1","title":"dead beat watch","review":"I received the watch quickly and in good shape. It is big for a woman but it's ok. Like the other reviewer said the battery was dead. I had to replace it for $10 or mail it back to the company for about the same. It is also impossible to open. The Jeweler I used is an authorized Invicta dealer. It took him 10 minutes to unlock the band. He said the brand has varying levels of quality. This explaind why some are $130 and some are $1300. If I had to do it over again I honestly wouldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another dead EXPENSIVE battery","review":"After getting a non-working watch and wanting to write a review, I discovered other reviews indicating this is a common problem. So I went to my local store to get another battery, which usually costs around $5, only to find out the battery for this watch is different and costs $20! You'll be spending more for the watch than you planned. Also, the band is so huge that I could slip it on and off without unlatching it. I had to have 4 links removed to fit my average size wrist. While this is an attractive watch, I'm not confident in Invicta since this is the second defective Invicta watch I received, the other was a chronograph and the stop watch function didn't work so I ordered this one, a second dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constructing Questions for Interviews and Questionnaires","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It is very clearly written, and gives examples all the way through about the ways in which design of questions will influence the responses to them.

But Peanuts Treasury is much better than most of those-better than most of the \`60s collections, anyway. Not to say that the Classics books aren't good, but several of the books repeat strips, print the pages backwards, or even repeat stories (or parts of stories). But this collection doesn't do that. Not only that, but this book has about three times as many more pages AND there are more strips per page (five instead of two). A few of the stories aren't finished in this book either, but nevertheless it's a great collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry on the flute","review":"Loved it even more than the first one- really a great CDI love the new songs trios with the base shakuhachi- it has incredibly deep sounds that touch you deep inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Les Getrex keeps the spirit of the blues alive","review":"I saw Les perform at the Blues Club in New Orleans and then very happily bought this disk.

It conforms nicely to your hand and performs well to exfoliate places a normal back brush doesn't do well, such as arms, legs, etc.The problem is that if you leave it in your shower or bath caddy and it stays damp it turns colors in about a week. Also the glove had an earthy \\"hay\\" smell to it even after several uses. Natural/organic products are prone to natural processes. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it! Buy Month-By-Month Gardening in Georgia instead","review":"This book was pretty disappointing. The scope of the book was fairly small (one state) yet a surprising amount of plants are left out. The information it contains is ok, but you can get all that information and more in other sources. There is a lot of repeated information on soil amendment and not much information on the care of the individual plants. Often, 3/4 of a page is devoted to a description of the plant rather than it's care. Some references to varieties are given, but not nearly enough. Most planting explanations revolve around starting from seed, transplants are not often mentioned.I would buy Month-by-Month Gardening in Georgia instead. I got it after I bought this one and it contains all of the information here (sometimes verbatim), but also includes month-by-month tips on caring for the plants."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Thoroughly Enjoyed this....","review":"I felt the premise was credible, didn't find too many holes in the logic and they took their time telling the story (which accounts for the length).

I was quite disappointed with this album as it generally lacks the searing-hot salsa dance jams that made his subsequent albums so good. To hear and enjoy Bobby Valentin and his orchestra at their 1970s best buy the \\"Rompecabezas\\", \\"Soy Boricua\\" and \\"Rey Del Bajo\\" CDs from 1972, 1973 and 1974 respectively (all of which feature Frankie Hernandez and the unstoppable Marvin Santiago on lead vocals)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great potential never fulfilled","review":"When you watch a ghost story, you expect some spooks, chills and a few explanations about the backstory.What you get in Room 205 is a sometimes badly dubbed film that lacks any scare effect.Katrine is a troubled young woman who moves away from home after her mother's death. There, she discovers spiteful housemates who want to make her life hell after a bad hook up. During a rave, a ghost suddenly awakens and sets out to destroy them all.As I watched this film, I kept waiting for that AH-HA moment - the one that pulls everything together in an intriguing twist. I also expected a few scares. I got non of that. The plot was seriously underdeveloped. There were obvious directions it could have gone, but everything was just, well, very dull.Perhaps this works for European audiences, but it is not for the American horror fan. Save your cash for other Ghost House titles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very meat-y.","review":"This book could easily have been half the number of pages for several reasons. Besides using larger print (which is okay by me) and lots of b&w drawings, she only uses about 2/3 of the page for text, so there's quite a bit of blank space. Mainly though, I got tired of her repeating the same information. For example, when she talks about cabinets, she tells you the same stuff in the chapters on kitchens and home offices. She repeats the information about lighting in the bathroom and living room chapters. Also, she likes to decorate with white and often recommends that color scheme, which doesn't seem very practical to me. Overall, I learned a couple of things about decorating and picked up a few tips, but unless you really don't know anything at all about decorating, I would keep looking for a book with more depth and detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks!","review":"I ended up returning this very disappointing book.

I was disappointed that the first 7 chapters were nothing but fluff. There's a lot of religious references, biblical quotations, typos and statements like this: \\"The grand mechanisms thrusting themselves upon our lives and our birthing are merely a greater masking of the bleeding into the nuclei.\\" If you think that doesn't make sense simply because I took it out of context, think again. It's nothing but fluff. I was greatly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"VITAL reading for all mom's to be!","review":"This book was highly informative and interesting, while also being an easy read.

Save your money and read HypnoBirthing(R), a Celebration of Life and take the HypnoBirthing classes. It's much more simple, with much less fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time/money","review":"This book is more like a pamphlet (100 pages) and mainly consists of the notion that women harbor guilt and fear regarding birth (and life in general). She writes, \\"Some of the pain and fear of childbirth may stem from the severance woman has experienced (on an unconscience level) from God/self due to the internalization of the myth of original sin.\\" Wow, she both debunks and glorifies Christianity all in one sentence. Her \\"technique\\" consists of about 10 pages in the back of the book devoted to progressive relaxation. I gave birth without drugs or intervention by studying the Bradley method (and by believing in myself). I highly recommend Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way and Birthing from Within. Both books give better, more detailed methods of progressive relaxation and are great books for your partner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance in the New South Working Class","review":"I'm no book reviewer. I'm not even a romance novel fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading this tale of ill-fated love.The characters were believable and it was easy to care about the main characters. They seemed like people that you might know if you live around Greenville, SC. The plot has just enough twists and turns to make you angry, sympathetic and curious about how things will turn out.If you want an easy, down to earth romance novel without the raunchiness then this is an excellent choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek Design!!!!!","review":"I am a watch collector and I am constantly looking for unique designs and this one tops the list by far. At first it was a little unusual to read the time but you quickly became adjusted to this.

Hope you enjoy this watch like I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stunning watch","review":"This is not your every day run-of-the-mill watch, it's a wonderfully crafted, and surprisingly refined piece of art.

I like Dennis Quaid, and he complimented Cher's character. Were some of the antics in the movie unrealistic? Such as Quaid visiting the homeless people in the middle of the night? Or Cher throwing an object to her client to prove a point? Maybe, maybe not. Again, WHO CARES? A movie is supposed to be something that gets our minds off reality...an escape.

You see a lot of footage from the entire time period, a little of it unfamiliar to me, but don't really learn anything most of us don't already know. The writers avoided going very deeply into the scandal area and give the Diana/Dodi romance story a little too much credence in my view but on the whole a good program to watch and own, especially if you can't afford to have all of the videos out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound, with only a few tracks you havent heard 1000 times.","review":"Compilation with very poor sound quality on songs that have been released many times before, sounding much better.

It is an exact replica of Luis Miguel's 1991 bestseller \\"Romance\\" (with the songs appearing in the exact same sequence as on Luis Miguel's CD!). Real instruments were apparently replaced by electronic keyboards and synthesizers (for the most part) and the production has a very sterile and mechanical feel to it.

Although I believe that a couple of his knives are misidentified as Civil War era (specifically the knives featured on page 32). For the most part, this book gives the reader a chance to see knives carried by both the front line soldier and the officer.These are using knives,,,not the presentation for pomp knives often featured in similar guides.

No introduction, no footnotes or glosses--nothing at all to help students read this novel.But what is far more annoying are the deliberate OMISSIONS OF TEXT! A total of five chapters are missing, described as \\"tedious\\" and summarized briefly. Also, though Ann Radcliffe selected epigraphs for each chapter before the novel's 1791 publication, none of these are included, despite being rather interesting and insightful.All in all, this edition is ridiculously bad as a scholarly text and not much better as entertainment, since the missing chapters really DO contribute to the enjoyment of the plot and characterization!

It drains the battery from the GameBoy about 3 times than normal. There is a tremendous glare and the light only covers about half the screen when you change the angle to get rid of the glare. Like any other parent, they'd say it is very bad for your eyes. So when you run to the next room in Zelda, arrows are flying at you and you can't see where they're coming from. You change the angle, find the enemies then you can't find Link. Then you switch back to original angle and by the time you get close enough to the enemy, you're dead.

This is the only saxophone-less small group Davis ever led, his first meeting with Red Garland and Philly Joe Jones, right before Coltrane came on board. At this point in time Coltrane's concept was still sloppy and rough whereas Miles' playing was at its zenith, which is why Coltrane's not being on this record is more of a plus than a minus. Davis die-hards are provided the unique opportunity to hear Davis and more Davis, extended trumpet improvisations without anything else breaking up the sustained voodoo save the perfect foil of Garland's Ahmad-Jamalesque piano.\\"Musings\\" is a consolidation and coming to fruition of everything Davis was trying to do on his inconsistent recordings of the early \`50s--the first fully elaborated and definitive \`small group' statement of the original Davis/Mulligan/Evans \`Birth of the Cool' anti-bebop concept that had already had widespread influence."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best text I know of on the the topic","review":"This is an excellent textbook that has aged well and belongs close to the desk of anyone who is involved in managing forests and their contents.

The book is well written & I often find myself \\"coming to\\" seven or eight pages later after having pulled it off the shelf to look up one thing & then being drawn in to read more and more. My only complaint is that it IS a textbook, which affects the structure somewhat & more importantly affects the price.

I've bought AT&T phones before & liked them, but this one stinks.Most importantly, the ring detect on the phone isn't nearly sensitive enough. The phone doesn't ring on incomming calls to my house. I was told that the wires in my house were probably too long -- yet 2 other phones (from Sony & Siemens) work just fine. Additionally, the menu structure just isn't intuitive. There are too many keystrokes for most simple operations, and adding a phone directory is incredibly frustrating. The directory isn't even alphabetized -- the phone prompts you for the numerical 'slots' in the directory for the number you want -- stupid design.The only thing that saved this phone from a single star was the nice physical design.

On the other hand, if you're new to this kind of speculation then this book might be a good place to start (so add a star) as it covers a lot of ground without too much detail. The frequent references to science fiction (in particular Olaf Stapeldon's cosmological novels, of which the author is obviously a huge fan) in what initially appears to be quite an academic text is quite unusual, and could lead you to add a few titles to your wish list.

We also tied some \\"birdy kabobs\\" onto it in a couple of places and a bell we had from another toy he destroyed - and he loves it all the more. The plastic links that hang down the middle are surprisingly fascinating to him. This makes his playstand more interesting and acrobatic.

The music and the quality of her voice are first class all the way; then I read the loving liner notes by the woman who worked with her at the end and who put the album together, and I was even more moved and delighted. Laura has never sounded stronger and more beautiful than she does here--a great testimony to her talent and strength.

If you do, then this book by Eliane Marie Alphin is the right book for you. Unfortunately, I did not really like it. It is too hard to believe. Benjy Stark is a twelve year old boy who has no friends at all.This little boy has to go to his grandmother's house that he hasn't even seen before. He is not thrilled, but he goes anyway. But, on the other hand, his sister, Fran, does not want to go at all. She ends up having to go anyway. While they are there, Benjy goes on some pretty cool adventures after all.For example, Benjy finally meets a young boy named William Hugh McDowell. They get along great, but the weird thing is that William isn't a boy, he is a ghost. If you want to read more about Benjy and his adventures read this book.6th Grade Student from OHES"},{"rating":"1","title":"so thin I had to send it back","review":"I love the design, but the product is so thin I was embarrassed to give it to my mom.

Searching for the Spirituality of Sport\\", he tells how Zen buddhism allowed him to improve his skiing skills, after he spent a season with the great Japanese ski champion Yuichiro Miura, the first skier to have skied down the Everest in 1970. Within his team, he learnt how to move softly, play with gravity and control his gestures. Above all he noticed that Japanese ski beginners are not given any detailed instructions : designed for the brain, they produce disruption when one needs to apply them. On the opposite, learning is made by watching champions and imitating their moves. The movement goes straight from the eyes to the body, without being rationally interpreted by the brain.An essential reading for whoever wants to capture the essence of skiing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"There were so many errors in this book that I don't know where to begin.

Produced by Johnny Pacheco, the salseros of old will remember the radio hits Con Los Pobres Estoy, Las Brisas de mi Borinquen, and the classic charanga-style No Me Hagas Sombra, where The Apollo Sound mimics Orquesta Aragon. with Tito Cruz on lead vocals, this is a record at the heart of the music movement we know as salsa.

Both of these books approach weight loss the same way - figure out why you are eating, and then work at it from a psychological approach, rather than going on a specific diet.What I like about Evelyn's book is that it is for the individual to do by herself, whereas Susan's book is more for a group therapy approach. She also has some other interesting reasons about why I might be overweight, which made for very interesting reading.However, between the two books, I preferred Evelyn's because it gave more specific information to work with and let me do it by myself, rather than a full support group (as a stay-at-home mom with a 3-year-old, very important).I did appreciate both books though, because they emphasized the same thing - the overeating is not because of lack of willpower, but because of psychological reasons - and that makes lots of sense to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"See yourself as you should be, physically, emotionally, etc.","review":"I first read this book in 1978.

It explains in detail, step by step, how to measure and set up a four wheel alignment, as well as how to check your chassis for square. You will be able to set camber and toe at all four wheels using simple tools. I bought a camber guage from Racer Wholesale to confirm the settings but you will only need masons string or fishing line, a jack, a carpenters tape measurer and the patience to follow directions and measure with extreme exactness.

A very handy reference that comes off my shelf quite often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good explanations and information","review":"The book begins by explaining why your car handles the way that it does in the first couple of chapters. The author gets into a lot of physics formulas building up on everything as it goes. It feels a little dry after a while, but the explanations make a lot of sense.Then he gets into explaining how to tweak your car and modify the chassis. It's best to read the \\"whys\\" in chapter two before attempting to read the \\"hows\\" in the later chapters.

Yoga and Dance may be a creative mix but somewhat like mixing oil and water - yoga is meant to induce stillness and stretch the body/mind, dance is about movement - shifting from one pose to another itself in yoga should be done with care and with time/attention. Only very experienced dancers or yoga practitioners can just 'let loose' and wiggle body parts in combination with yoga poses thrown in.Shiva should have put in a warning at least or just made it a dance video, not mixing it like this for users of all experience levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dancing makes me feel stupid","review":"I agree with the other reviewer: the dancing segments made me feel stupid.

The video is so focused on being 'cool', that it totally fails to instruct, cue, or demonstrate poses. Anyone who has never done yoga would be totally lost.And as for the trance dance....I was not entranced. The problem was that Shiva was very tight and I didn't get a sense of freedom from her.

Many years ago, i watched and worked out with Richard Hittleman's PBS yoga show, and he emphasized working up to things slowly. None of that here. So I will find someone to give it to.

The thought of just dancing around, without instruction, moving from your spirit seemed alien to me. But when I started to actually do the DVD, after a few minutes, it was absolutely freeing. More so when I did not try to mimic the people on the tv screen. I didn't know my body could even move the way it was. Although this is not something I would do in public, because I'm sure I look ridiculous, it is very cathartic in my own home. The prana yoga sections are also both challenging and liberating. For days after the trance dance sections, I found myself moving to a silent beat even at my desk at work. I have been doing traditional yoga for about a year now and will continue to do so, but this DVD gives me the opportunity to express myself in other ways.

In the children's section of the library, most of the fictional kids did not shoot heroin.Of course, that's not at all what the book's actually about, and, although Kerr's novel does involve unemployment, class anxiety, suicide, mental illness, compulsive eating, and (scariest of all) a rabidly right-wing teenager...it's extremely endearing and funny.

Even on Chapter 1 the author discusses topics that I didnt know about. Name of the book is \\"Network Tutorial\\"; bad name. I would call it Networks Unleashed. It also seems a bit outdated to me, the latest edition was released in Jan/2003, yet there is too much talk about Windows 3.1, OS/2 and NT. Linux and XP are rarely mentioned.

Throughout every song, there is an audible, annoying hiss in the background. My old collection of 33 RPM disc's produces fresher sounds than this pathetic excuse of remastering. It's obvious they merely transfered the original mono recordings from vinyl to CD with no remastering or technical wizardry. It's a crying shame because Krupa's band is an underrated orchestra. Do yourself a favor and sample Krupa's music, but not from this poorly produced, shoddy CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent gentle exercise but NOT all sitting","review":"I am greatly benefiting from this very clear, very easy to follow exercise video and the included resistance bands - HOWEVER, contrary to the package description, many of the exercises can't be done sitting! About half the routine must be done standing up, though nearly all the standing exercises involve holding a chair back for balance and extra support. So if you can't stand this is not a very useful routine.The exercises are very clearly demonstrated and very clearly described. The exercise model is hardly a senior and she has an annoying fixed smile that never changes, but those are minor quibbles. She shows very clearly how to do each part of the routine, and for the parts that can be done sitting, nearly all include a little inset box showing the same routine standing.I recommend this for seniors and non-seniors who need a fairly easy routine to build some strength and flexibility - as long as you can stand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive description","review":"What you receive if you order this is quite different from what is described.This dvd came with only one resistance band. The video accompanying it does not explain how to use the resistance bands. Instead, it shows excercises that have to be performed standing up and that do not make use of a resistance band. There is no address on the packaging or on the Funcersice website to which a complaint or return can be sent.I am sure the exercises on the video are good for fully ambulatory young people. For seniors with arthritis who have trouble standing, the video is worthless. I guess I can figure out how to use the resistance bands, but there is nothing to show me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Too Aggressive for Senior Beginner","review":"I didn't even get halfway through and was too worn out to continue.

It is about two men and their cameraman (who you rarely see) who know little to nothing about making movies and who fool beautiful women into thinking they are stars in their production. Overall, the film is senseless; but in the chaos, it all adds up into something that takes another shape, one that makes sense.Throughout the movie, the two guys make this film funny by interspersing their commentary on cinema. The men act a little silly occasionally and even look a little goofy, which makes it hard not to find amusement in their antics. The women are hilarious because they take them serious.Without a doubt, \\"Kitsch\\" is funny. It is a goofy kind of humor, but it is loaded with it!

Many may find themselves comparing Lilitu to many European metal bands; to me there is no comparison. You can sense their European influences, yet they are an entity unto themselves. The album opens with a great force that later progresses to a more refined and melodious sound that, in the end, leaves you with a realization you have just listened to something exemplary. The music is layered, often adding an atmospheric hue with the addition of keyboards and additional vocals.

The Alarm just never quite got it together on record.Except this one. Ten songs, and though the lyrics never rise as far as they could, they never descend to anything as bad as their final album, \\"Raw.\\" I can still put on \\"Rain In the Summertime\\" and ride a blissful wave of many seasons at the beach. \\"Rescue Me\\" is the kind of plea for love's deliverance that anyone can relate to.

I wonder if my professor looks through it as well. Some of my class notes follow the book closely but that might be how everyone teachs it.

I don't think I'll be buying these again because if you hit these for an entire summer, then hit Titleists (which you can find cheap and used on Amazon too), it is VERY difficult to go back to Callaways because of how rock hard they are.

This album reminded me of Dylan, of about the time of \\"Don't Think Twice,\\" or Patrick Bruel, in the era of \\"Alors Regardes.\\" There is skillful use of gypsy dance rhtymn in one song; Arab music in another. At times, the voice of the singer is plaintive, in the style of Alain Souchon or Stephen Eicher. I noted from a sticker that the artist will be at The Olympia Music Hall the third week in March 2006.

The album has several great songs including a beautiful tribute to their Puerto Rican heritage with \\"Bandera.\\" Even though\\"La Timba\\" starts off with an annoying set of voices that seem like the mind of a delusional person, picks up very well and showcases Bobby Cruz' extremely powerful voice, as well as RIcardo Ray's masterful piano playing. Also worth mentioning is the drum playing on this track which is just fantastic. Overall, the album has some solid songs. On the downside it has swung and missed on a couple of tracks also such as in: \\"Le Llaman Jesus\\" (lyrically good, music style not so good) and \\"Mambo Jazz.\\" The use of female vocalists on the chorus is kind of skeptical in my opinion, maybe since they are not usually used in salsa. 3.5 stars as I am slightly inclined to like it more than not."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for those who know arabic and need the egyptian dialect","review":"Because of the difficulties of Arabic, I am unsure how this method would work with complete beginners.

Susan Hayward and Tyrone Power - who could ask for more. The movie is an adventure of the Dutch farmers who leave Cape Colony and cross the Val River into Southern Africa. They meet the Zulu nation coming down from the north with a bloody outcome ultimately triumphing over the Zulu and the wilderness. This film predates \\"Zulu\\" the movie about the battle at Rorke's Drift which was also an exciting film. Both are highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promises, but does not deliver","review":"From the stone walls of Ireland to the plains of South Africa, neither Susan Hayward nor Tyrone Power manage an appropriate accent between them, and thus fail to establish credibility at the outset. The story lacks historical context (the Boers were fighting against the British) and after a complicated series of events, resolves itself into a parody of an American Western.The Cinemascope was fine, but this story could just as easily have been shot in Montana for all the realism it conveyed.

At first listen, \\"All Things New\\" is not only new in every way, but at the same time familiar. Steven's passion for ministry is as strong as ever, and the songs are full of great hooks, melodies, and substance. Everything is different, but it's still SCC. Some people expect another \\"Speechless\\", or \\"Declaration\\", but as he grows, SCC also has a heart for freshness, which is the best word for this album, fresh. After about the third time through, every single song starts to shine through, and the message and melody stand out further with every listen. If you want another \\"Speechless\\", then buy another copy. If you want to hear a fresh new sound, great inspirational message, along with the traditional strengths that make SCC one of the greatest Christian singer-songwriters of all time, then run, don't walk, to your local store and pick up \\"All Things New\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT THE USUAL SCC","review":"This CD is different from the usual fare from Mr. Chapman in a couple of ways. First, it's more piano driven and acoustic than most of his CDs. Second, the songs are more substantial, both lyric-wise and content-wise. That's actually an improvement in that there's more depth in this CD than in any other he's done. And that's a good thing. Shows he's growing. Of course, the tunes have great \\"hooks\\", so you will remember. As always, his voice is in fine form, the instrumentation is excellent, and the production is stellar. Verdict: Better than \\"All About Love\\" and \\"Declaration,\\" and \\"Speechless\\" was better. Buy it? Oh, yes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No thanks","review":"I got this album for Christmas, and I must say I'm disappointed. It sounds much different from his earlier stuff, with a different-sounding of guitar, and a rather electronic sound through the whole album.The songs:In \\"All Things New\\", Steve's voice sounds like a poor imitation of Christine Dente/Out of the Grey.\\"Big Story\\" reminds me of Christine's \\"Bigger Story\\", and \\"Please Only You\\" is somewhat like Out of the Grey's \\"Better Way To Fall.\\" And besides that, they are just plain bad, nothing like Steven's other songs.\\"Coming Attractions\\" instantly brought to my mind Tobymac's song \\"What's Goin' Down\\" off his album \\"Momentum.\\" Sounds just like it.The other songs I don't care for much either, with three exceptions: \\"Much of You\\", \\"Treasure Of Jesus\\", and \\"Angels Wish.\\"Steven Curtis Chapman is my favorite artist, but on this album, he bombed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifetime favorite!","review":"If I could choose only one book that impacted my life, it would be Striped Ice Cream. I first read it in elementary school (30 years ago) and find myself reading it again every so often. The characters are so real, and you become involved in what they feel. The mother does a fantastic job of being a single parent to five children during a time (1960's?) when it was neither common or accepted. Inspite of difficult times, the family's strong ties to each other and their fine character would serve as excellent role models for any child today. The main story line is \\"peppered\\" with moments of humor and warmth of a close family. The main character Becky, is easy for 3rd & 4th graders to relate to. This would be an excellent story for any child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Memories","review":"I have long wished I still had this book and decided to search for it.

It's only held on by a small piece of plastic (approx. 1/8\\" in diameter), and it is easily broken during normal gameplay.I got more than 10 hours of use, but it definitely didn't last as long as I expected from a product from Microsoft.

While it uses some great instrumental samples, upbeat basslines, and nice vocals and breaks where it counts, it suffers from the indulgent monotony of most contemporary music of this genre, where it seems like the artist doesn't know how to end or \\"climax\\" a song. (3 stars for CD 1)However, CD 2 is definitely more interesting music, delving into dub stylings with a range of masterful toasters for the most part, along with some other fine midpace instrumental and female vocalist tracks. This bonus CD was a total surprise, and more than made up for the broken expectations of CD 1.CD 2 is worth the album price alone, as it's expressive of the production skills and range of this solid artist, and more stimulating music to listen to because of it. Maximum respect to the one like Big Bud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Wasn't disappointed at all.

The sound itself is astounding, featuring easily the best recording and mixing of any of their albums. Honestly, it's been years since I've heard something so meticulously crafted yet fresh and airy. Beautiful melodies and harmonies combine with intricate, lively playing for a thoroughly unique and refreshing listening experience. I hope it's not another 13 years until their next album, but if the next one is this good, it'll be worth the wait. Love Tractor deserves to be noticed. If you've liked their past releases, you're in for a real treat. If you've never heard of them before, today's your lucky day!

The second most annoying thing about these cds is the intrusive, unnecessary and unattractive trumpet at the beginning or ends of many poems. The third most annoying thing about these cds is the poor reading, which at times doesn't follow either prosody or normal voice in its pitch patterns and emphasis. Apart from these three annoyances, these are fair cds. They might be useful in educational settings, where the intros might be appropriate and the trumpet might keep students awake. I gave this two stars rather than one because the poetry presented is immortal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another emotionless runthrough by Norrington","review":"The use of \\"period\\" instruments produces some interesting sonorities, but Norrington's approach shows that he continually ignores the emotional aspect of music-making. I get the impression that I'm listening to an elaborate machine, a kind of synthesizer (anyone remember those experiments from the 1970s? Feed in the score and get a \\"perfect\\" reproduction of the music)--Norrington concentrates so hard on reproducing what's on paper that he doesn't communicate. You get \\"output\\", not a symphony.

His tenor playing sounds very captivating after a few listens, but strangely awkward initially. In other words, play it several times and don't believe the Penguin Jazz CD guide review. Chick Corea's piano playing is so \\"haunting\\" that at on at least two pieces it sounds like the soundtrack to the horrow classic, Phantasm.

Only then did I learn that Microsoft would no longer in any way support the original XBOX and after giving to Microsoft my very hard earned dollars for all that stuff, I was now expected to throw it all out and give them more money for an xbox360.

It takes forever. It extremely difficult to create a player and add him to your team. As for the game mode: there no radar gun for pitchers so you have no idea how hard your pitcher is throwing. The fielding controls are a joke. The batting is the one aspect that's not bad, but once you reach base its a pain in the but to steal a base.

This requires me to re-boot my computer to regain usage of HALF OF MY SYSTEM MEMORY. This is inconvenient, and utterly ridiculous for modern software.Unless you enjoy re-booting your computer everytime you use the Britannica, I advise you to NOT buy this software.

I don't know how many times I had been calling EB to release a DVD for the Mac with no avil. Being a diehard Mac user, I refused to buy into the Windows version.As you may imagine, I am extremely delighted that EB is finally going to release a DVD for the Mac after all these years...It is much more convenient to use just one DVD instead of swapping back and forth with two CD-ROMs. More audio and video on one DVD is another advantage of going DVD.Technology is GOOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Keeps Getting Better","review":"Clearly the top encyclopedia on the market.

I bought the book because it was quirky and pretty. While the pictures are still lovely, apparently they're all done in photoshop. There is no disclaimer on the book anywhere, and while I'm sort of glad that people aren't really painting cats, I can mock up pictures of painted cats in photoshop all on my own.

I ordered 2 copies for my cat-loving friends, but was most disappointed to discover the size of that edition was smaller than a postcard!

Some of these cats are really gorgeous, some are funny, some are silly, some are bizarre.But of course the best part of the book is the way it skewers some of the pretentions of the art establishment, adapting the jargon of the gallery world to this odd flight of fancy.Love this: \\". . . the cat's purple-colored tail becomes genitally implicated in what appears to be a quite unncircumscribed discussion of male assertiveness in the context of post-reunification Germany.\\"Or this: \\"This work is perhaps best understood in terms of Wittgenstein's concept of \\"seeing as\\", for unlike other peintures chat, Weiman's art is not based on any complacent liberalization that seeks to conceal the hunter-prey dichotomy.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful & Hysterical","review":"Silver and Busch have done it again! Their first book, \\"Why Cats Paint,\\" is the most hysterical art book I've ever seen and makes me chuckle to think about it.\\"Why Paint Cats\\" continues the put-on tradition even more, with the deadly serious tone of a true art book, and the hysterical premise of painting cats strange colors and designs. Yet as a book of cat photos, it is truly beautiful. I don't know how they actually got the great patterns on these cats (I suspect they are only in the photos), but the the effects are spectacular.This is a laugh-out-loud book for any art or cat fancier.

I can already guarantee it will be a better game then this. The controls for this game are awkward to say the least. You use the motion sensing to swing the bat which might sound cool but it's really not. Moving a controller forward to swing a bat isn't cool at all. It's like the people from 2k thought they were making this for the Wii. Also compared to other PS3 games the graphics on this aren't very good. There are aliasing problems all over this version. $60 is a lot to pay for a video game and when it turns out the way this one does you will have a case of buyer's remorse.

It is a older release and gives you a idea of how good the graphic processing stuff is on the ps3. This game here really puts the ps3 to a test, Including taking advantage of the sixaxis movement stuff. Get to push the controller foreward to swing the bat.

Czerniakow's diary is quite laconic -- many entries are just a few sentences long -- but provides many details of his efforts on the behalf of the Warsaw Jews.Obscure references are demystified in the footnotes. There are also some black and white photographs of ghetto scenes, an appendix of ghetto-related documents and letters, and two introductions totaling seventy pages which provide more information on the life and death of Czerniakow and the story of the Warsaw Ghetto.This is hardly a gripping read, but it is essential if you want to know the story of the Warsaw Jews.

It was awkward to put together, but we did accomplish that. The biggest thing is that the wheels don't work right. The front wheels won't swivel, every time the cart is pushed a bit the wheels turn sideways. So, on our first shopping venture with it, she couldn't steer it and it was hard to push because the front wheels turned sideways. I put a few things in the front figuring that with a little weight and traction they would work better. That didn't work. I turned them straight often, but they still turned sideways. Since I opened it and assembled it, I guess I can't return it. It's headed for the garbaage. We'll go to a store and buy a different one.

I decided to purchase this one, because it appeared sturdy enough without costing too much. However, after setting it up, I realized I should have purchased one a bit sturdier. The cart can't hold very much weight before it starts to sag. The wheels are plastic and have difficulty staying in place while pushing (the front wheels often are aligned perpendicular to the cart and so don't roll when being pushed). My daughter sometimes has to pick the cart up or pull it behind her during playtime.

It's shallow but large enough for mom or dad to sit in it also. It has a sunshade and is inflatable and therefore easy on the baby for crawling in and out. The only problem I had with this pool is that by the third time I inflated it, one of the seams on the sunshade split open. This was not a tear, nor was the pool being manipulate in a way that it would be forced open. This is strictly a manufacturer's lack of adhesive quality. The one saving grace is that I can cut off the sunshade if necessary and the pool can still be used. I do recommend this pool however, because all of the inflatable pools are bound to spring leaks. They're cheap. This pool is awesome, especially for only $25.

Dome is not removable, so had to keep reinflating in order to use pool at all. It fit her and her two cousins, sort of, but no way would an adult fit in there.

He has constructed a book that is helpful to beginning meditators while it is an inspiration to experienced meditators.

Simply but profoundly he describes the flow of thoughts and memories that inevitably discourage those who are seeking the empty mind. He encourages a \\"don't accept, don't reject\\" attitude that is grounded in compassion for ourselves that mirrors the compassion of God for us.Finley's style itself is meditative with sentences that parallel each other and lend themselves to thoughtful pauses.

If you're more oriented toward guidance than analytics, try \\"Christian Meditation - Your Daily Practice\\" by Laurence Freeman or \\"Four Doors to Meeting for Worship\\" by William Taber.

Some of the diagrams are good (not great) but the color pictures in the center of the book adds greatly to its attractiveness and does provide examples. This is more of a discussion than a guide. It does cover good topics and it would add to supplement anyones library of other such books with more detailed information.

Great idea but the product stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First time it loses charge, never charges again.","review":"I bought one of these a couple years ago and was excited to have a flashlight that \\"has no batteries to replace! just wind to charge\\". Unfortunately what I and many users have found, was that once the internal battery is discharged, no amount of cranking would ever charge it again. Yes you could crank it and it would light, but it would not hold a charge for more than a few seconds. If the internal batter should not be fully discharged, then there should have been circuitry to prevent that from happening. There are a number of reviews on various sites that complain about this issue. I don't know if newer models have fixed this or not.The emergency flasher is not very useful.The crank handle does not lock into the main body and tends to flop around.The unit seems to be made of fairly sturdy plastic and should not be damaged by normal wear including short drops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasts","review":"I enjoy no longer having to search for batteries to make the flashlight work.

I would suggest another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Battery Life","review":"Those who rated this flashlight so highly will have a VERY different opinion in time.

That is my experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too good to be true....it is.","review":"In the store this flashlight looked great; super bright white light. I couldn't believe how bright it was. Enjoy it while it lasts because you'll never see it super bright like that again.These come two in a package. I left one new and ran the other one down. Instructions say only one minute of cranking gets you charged back up. This is just not true. One minute of cranking will produce some light but that is not even close to the brightness of the flashlight fresh out of the package. I cranked for a full ten minutes, until my arm became tired, and the brightness only reached about a one-third of what it was in the store.This product is a fraud. Don't believe me? Try a pair yourself; just make sure you save the receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"very short battery life","review":"I agree with the person who wrote that this flashlight doesn't run as expected. My parents purchased this light maybe 3 or 4 years ago and it worked back then but we didn't use it. Currently it only works when I crank it which isn't the way it should work. I took it apart and inside is the basic gears + generator + lights + (1.5v watch battery). Now what is this battery doing here? I am thinking it powers the lights although the hand crank can also power the lights too. I don't think it was designed to hold a charge at least for very long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Capcity not Big Speed","review":"A good storage/money ratio.

Apparently this issue is not unique to the VS100. Several other Venta models with the ultra-sonic transducer experience the same issue after <1 year of use.

It's light-weight plastic and no more than 4in in diameter. This was the most expensive portable humidifier, which goes to show that you don't always get what you paid for.

The VENTA SonicS100 looked ideal:cool and warm mist, Ultrasonic, filter. The only problem is, they both stopped producing mist after 3 weeks. The filter went after 2 weeks (at $15 a pop, this can become one expensive humidifier). When the filter goes, the water does not drain properly and the unit shuts itself off. I thought maybe I did something wrong with the first one so I was very disciplined in cleaning the metal part in the unit every night. It would still get covered with particles from the filter as well as hard chunks around the rubber.

They obviously do not care about the consumers, or their reputation, or they would have done SOME kind of testing on this model before releasing it for sale.

The Venta worked well when it worked. However, it frequently stopped working for no apparent reason. You could jiggle the thing, and it would go on and off. We finally figured out that there was a defect in the little plunger on the bottom of the tank that controls the flow of water into the base. The water wasn't flowing properly, and the machine stopped (as it should) because there was no water. Took it back to the hardware store where we bought it, and the guy there said that lots of other people have had the same problem.

I have two Ventas, and before that had an Air-O-Swiss. All begin putting out white dust after just a couple of weeks on the water filter. (I'm using NYC water). The dust, which comes from minerals in the water, is very fine and likes electronics a lot, and is harder to remove than normal dust. Unfortunately, I've come to the conclusion that there still isn't a good humidifier solution on the market.

(You'd think the $15 filters would prevent that...) Then last month the oscilattor gave out. Took it apart and found a metal film from one pole of the oscilattor plate had cracked near a soldered connection. Didn't even make it through the winter.

I assumed I had broken the very sensitive oscilator and that it was my fault, so like a fool, I purchased a second. HA! Same problem.

My hope of discovering something was disappointed by the average to poor writing and disjointed reading experience. One would think two people could keep each other interesting but maybe the converse holds true. This genre seems to suffer from inbreeding. It's chock full of aspiring writers who consider themselves expert because they've read luminaries. They then strive to be writers, the drive is out of ambition, and they end up criticizing each other into monotony. Les Mediocres remain peripheral to talent as long as they spend too much time picking apart each other and the craft. The question that addresses the problem may be, where are the editors who keep this level of blah from congesting the shelves. I suppose it's all right that the sentences and puctuation are correct if you just want to engage your mind like being on a treadmill, ending up nowhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"First-Rate SF","review":"It's kind of odd that the first five books were called \\"Mageworlds\\" when actually the Mages were more or less the enemy, and the stories took place on the other side of the galaxy.

Add in the realistic detail on how military people think and work, and you've got great action as well. But that's not to say the story is one-dimensional shoot'em'up; there are insightful glimpses into human interaction, and traces of mysticism.Well worth the hardback price, because this is a keeper for years of rereading.

I just want to mention here some of my other favorites of Enescu's works: his Symphonies nos. 2 & 3, Vox Maris (Symphonic Poem) and his Suites nos. 1 & 3 for orchestra. No serious classical music collection would be complete without these. Finally, for those of you that want to find more about this great composer I want to mention a wonderful biography that I just got from England: \\"George Enescu - His Life and Music\\" by Noel Malcolm published by Toccata Press in UK.

There is no development of either the Sturm or Kitiara character, and for those hoping to see seeds of little Steele twinkling in their eyes will be sorely disappointed.

Most books of this type are so general that the practical utility is lessened. In this book, the topics that count are all there, and handled with detail and in many cases brilliantly. The writer uses humor to help you remember his points.

While none of the advice is wrong or bad, I didn't feel like any of it was earth-shattering, either. Most of what's in here is common sense to someone who has a decent shot of getting into a top business school. It's a catchy title, and you may pick up a few tidibits, but I've found other books to be more useful. Also, this version is longer than the previous one, but the additional content doesn't seem to justify the high price."},{"rating":"2","title":"B-School Admission Bible","review":"I am currently applying to business school and use this book to make the very time consuming application process much more manageable.

However, the majority of his 80's to present releases have been bland and sterile. This one is no exception, pointless and boring drivel, regardless of how good the playing is. I'm not expecting much of the new live DVD either. Why wait until the guy is 60 before releasing a DVD? I will admit the Another Days Blues album isn't too shabby, more blues and less of the lifeless banality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome to the \\"No Spin\\" Zone !","review":"I am a professional guitarist and have been a Trower fan since the 70's, but I'm gonna tell you the truth about this CD. I do not agree with other reviewers that say the old Robin Trower is back. All these songs are immediately forgettable. The problem is not with Trower's playing, or the band, or the production, but the songwriting. There is no \\"Day of the Eagle\\" here; no \\"Little Bit of Sympathy;\\" no \\"Too Rolling Stoned,\\"....NO ENERGY AT ALL! Most of the songs are slow, dreamy, and dirge-like. Where is the rhythm and blues influence that set apart Robin Trower's first several CD's? The last CD this group of musician's recorded...\\"Passion\\"...stood heads above this one. As Dick Cheney would say, \\"The fact of the matter is..Robin Trower needs a good songwriter. His music used to be more than just a showcase for his guitar skills. His songs used to make you smile and want to tap your feet and dance a bit and say \\"Yes!!\\" What's wrong with that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Far From His Best","review":"To me this CD has none of the brilliance most of Robin Trower's CDs have.There is a very long guitar solo on I Want To Take You With Me, but it is nothing special compared to the many other long solos Robin has blessed us with. In other words, just about any guitarist that doesn't have Robin's virtuosity could play it.Other solos are few and far between, which is a disappointment.You can't win them all but Robin wins on most - just not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trower on song","review":"If you don't have a copy of Bridge of Sighs you are missing an essential CD from your rock/blues collection. That's where the magic started. Since then there have been flashes of the same genius on Long Misty Days, and Victims of the Fury. The main ingredients were of course Trowers soaring guitar and Jimmy Dewars vocals.If you enjoyed those then this album is for you. Dave Bronze does an excellent job on vocals replacing the sadly departed Mr Dewar, and an added bonus is the recording quality is very good. I would only give a CD 5 stars if it's outstanding - e.g. Bridge of Sighs. Compared with that I give it 4 stars and recommend it strongly to Trower fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best List Of Tunes Yet!!","review":"Being a Robin Trower fan for many,many years.This has got to be the best list of songs on one album yet.

It's like a fine wine, the brilliance is realized when you are given the opportunity to discern the flavors and not overwhelmed by the taste. In music this comes by way of melodies, lyrics, orchestration and performance rather than the banality of a 'guitar hero' or the sex inspired possess of a Diva. The magic that pulls it all together is that you are left with the impression that the artist believes in their craft and that they have the talent to deliver. What makes this CD so good is that it offers all of that.Having listened to Robin's work of the 80's compared to that of the 70's, I had given up on him as I could not distinguish the flavors. With this release, he's back to believability, subtlety, music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Deft Touch","review":"When I was young, I hated Country music. Then I grew to appreciate it. I didnt care for jazz, now I live on Electronica and Lounge music.The point is, that we all have to grow with the music, and with the artist that makes it. In this CD, the man who can take a note, bend it around a fencepost and straighten it out before you know it, has grown to show the emotion that is inside. We have all seen the speed and ability, now we see the man. Lets hope we all hear the music, cause its very special Trower.I am happy to think that in this case at least, I have grown with Robin Trower enough to appreciate what he has done here and never have to look back to ask for what was.A strong buy recommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gait-Transfer Belt with Metal Buckle 60\\"","review":"Gait-Transfer Belt with Metal Buckle 60\\" is verry helpfull.Thank you.i would recommened it for others to use.at a good price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really pertaining to adoption","review":"The songs were mostly love songs and inappropriate to adoption. For example one of the songs regarding adoption is from Annastasia, where she sings about being a former princess, not exactly reality. Only one was really specific to adoption by Stephen Curtis Chapman, but if he wrote the song, I would prefer to hear him sing it, than the compiler of the CD. I was very disappointed and will not buy products from them again without closer scrutiny. If you want vague love songs that perhaps could be used for adoption; and if you don't really listen to the words, than this may be the CD for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I knew I loved you","review":"I bought this CD because it is the only one I could find with the song \\"I knew I loved you\\" but I am very dissappointed in the CD. It is not the original singers and the remake versions sound a lot like my own singing - and I cannot sing. I do not recommend this CD if you are looking for original music.

What I didn't realize was how good the Teen Kings were. I think ANY live tapes of real rockabilly music is worth listening to, and these guys were a real band. Roy's rather nervous, quirky rockabilly vocal style was unique, much different that the astonishly rich instrument it later proved to be, yet very effective on these live performances.

The picture was horrible and terribly fuzzy, and it skipped frames every fews seconds.

This time, Chip Hilton endures the frustrations of being sidelined by an injury as basketball season begins at the state university, but he finds opportunities to help others while he is recovering. Yet another interesting and cohesive plot with unexpected twists, great sports action scenes, and fine character development. Chip Hilton and his Christian friends are inspiring, but realistic as well; they do make mistakes and learn from them. Some of the 'villains' in the story, including a talented but spoiled basketball player and his over-indulgent father, also learn from their mistakes. All parents should read this book as well; a well-integrated subplot carries an effective warning about the bad consequences of parents' playing favorites with their children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Birthday Disappointment","review":"We bought this item for our daughter's birthday because she loves Schoolhouse Rock.

When you hit for power and you connect you are pretty much guaranteed to hit it out of the park. It doesn't seem to matter what the team is, who the batter is, or who the pitcher is, it is way too easy to hit a home run. There is very little fielding in this game because of this. I have even tried adjusting the difficulty settings, but that made no difference. The amount of homers completely ruins this game for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product in a shallow market","review":"Great game overall. A little buggy in spots.

The game offers multiple game-play choices, such as quick game, season, franchise, GM career, manager challenge, online multiplayer, and five different types of home run derby's. Children under 10 and Players with limited gaming experience will find it very difficult to even make contact with the ball in the first couple hours of playing the game. Pitching is slightly easier, but players will rarely \\"strike out\\" the computer if a pitch was not performed 100%.

The subtitle says it all: \\"A Singer's Art\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"drinking, sex and the mob, not enough about the art","review":"Summers dwells on and on about Sinatra's drinking, his women, his mob ties and his meanness. All very interesting, much of it new and revealing. One is left with a bitter, smarmy confusion about this icon of the American music scene. John Lahr once wrote a splendid piece about Sinatra's artistry of the singer in the New Yorker. Summers spends little space on the artistry of the singer and the significant contributions of Nelson Riddle. One wonders why not complete the portrait of Sinatra more than Summers did. the book would have been far more fulfilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sinatra, The Life","review":"A wonderful history, not only of Sinatra and his family, but America going way back to the early 1800s.

We bought this book (1 copy for us and 5 for family members) just before moving to the Big Island last month, because of how great the Doughty and Friedman Ultimate Kauai book was. After arriving here, we put it to use. It sure is lacking good places to eat and beaches, and is very negative. Perhaps my expectations were set too high by the fabulous Kauai book, or perhaps the authors couldn't expend the same effort as they did on the Kauai one. Looks like they ran out of steam. I will hunt for another, better book on the Big Island. Hope their new Maui Revealed isn't even worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Without a doubt, the best!","review":"After our visit to the Big Island in Jan '02, we planned another trip for Apr '02. Because we felt we had missed a lot, we searched Amazon for guide books and found \\"Hawaii, The Big Island Revealed\\" by Doughty & Friedman. It was amazing!Just to begin with, one of their suggestions about where to buy gas paid for the book! Twice!!A lot of their comments confirmed our feelings from the first trip so we knew they had great insight. After that, as we toured and decided on places to eat, places to visit, we used their guide and they never failed us! While driving down Hiway 11 and WE would look up places in the book to see what they said. It was a lot more than a guide book on shops and dining, but a guide to knowledge about the island and its hidden secret spots.I can recommend this book for even the most knowledgeable locals! I know you will enjoy it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"downright incredible!","review":"My husband and I used this guide book constantly on our week-long trip to the Big Island, from which we returned just 3 days ago. This books tells about all the little-known and out-of-the-way places that the tour busses don't or won't take you to.If you're the adventurous type, definitely rent a 4WD as the book suggests. There's a lot of wonderful places on the island that just can't be accessed without one.We found the book's accuracy to be nearly 100%, even though it's been out nearly 2 years now. It was so exciting to see and experiece all the things in real life that I first learned about through this book. Don't miss the snorkeling at Kealakekua Bay. It's beyond the imagination!The excellent restaurant reviews were also very helpful to us. 11/24/00"},{"rating":"2","title":"Da Kine Guide Book","review":"I purchased this book after looking through several at a bookstore, and I could not have been more pleased. The attention to detail is IMPECCABLE. I rarely had the book out of my hands when we were driving around the island. I've traveled to and lived in Hawaii, and this series of books by Doughty and Friedman are the best references you'll find. Their honesty regarding the hotels and restaurants is uncommon for travel guides, but should be the standard to which others aspire. I'm planning a trip to Kauai this year, and look forward to reading their insights. Do not travel to any of the islands without this book -- even if you think you've seen it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to get this book","review":"If you are travelling to the Hawaiin Islands you need to get one of the \\"revealed\\" books.

Nor is it made clear how values that dispense with any normative idea of doing G-d's will can be \\"Jewish values\\" in the first place.If you enjoy poetry, this is actually a pretty good book. But to package and market it as a book of _prayers_ is simply ludicrous - and very misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great resource for feminist spirituality","review":"Marcia Falk's book is a sensitive, poetic revisiting of Jewish liturgy. She's gone far beyond simply taking the male gender out of the liturgy--she's rethought the prayers and opened them up to embrace values of inclusiveness and interconnectedness. A poet in both English and Hebrew, and an impeccable scholar, Falk has created a treasure that not only enriches Judaism but offers prayers and poems that can work for many earth-based spiritual traditions. I also deeply appreciated the wealth of women's poetry translated from the Yiddish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational Prayer Book","review":"This is a wonderful book for finding alternative prayers. My son and I have been putting together a prayer book for his bar mitzvah and we used several of Marcia Falk's English readings. The Hebrew takes some getting used to because it is not traditional.

He dives straight into 'how-to' mode, decribing his own version of improv theater. This might be a little tedious for those not interested in licencing a \\"Theatersports\\" venue in their own town, but hang in there. He quickly gets to the meat of simply creating good improv, what behaviours and actions get you there, and how to sustain it. This is a book 100% designed to assist the improviser, both the individual, as well as the 'group'. He even goes so far as to provide shortcut lists in the appendix for use in performance! Keith Johnstone is a visonary, and I'm convinced that whatever theater will look like in the coming years, he will have inspired much of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the read","review":"Johnstone's new book Impro for Storytellers does pick up where his last book leaves off. He gives us a good picture of what 'his' Impro should look like. Then he give a huge amount of excersises and games to play. I give this book only 4 stars because I am fundamentally opposed to training actors in front of an audience. Had it not been for this prejudice and a few other idealogical differences I would have given it 5 stars. Once again, it is lucid, clear, and a necessary manual for any teacher of acting or improvisation.

He sleeps in it often, sometimes it's the only thing other than me that soothes him. (He's now almost a month old)The only negative I've found has been the music. Not the music itself just the duration. If you turn it on, you have to endure it for 15 minutes as there is no way to turn it off.

Swing speeds are all virtually the same even though they have 5 settings, you will never notice the difference. The tray, once snapped into place is impossible to undo without injuring yourself and when the baby is crying I have been forced to get her out without undoing the tray. The swing motor has already broken once and instead of paying to have the whole swing shipped to be fixed my husband fixed it himself. She had only used it for 2 months minimally. It is very hard to fold and that makes it very hard to manage. I am extemely unpleased, and have learned a hard lesson about reading reviews before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I purchased this junk heep because of good reviews.

However, once I got one, things were not as well. First, we had to return the first swing we received because one of the housings for the hanging arms of the swing was misaligned so we could not complete assembly. The second set had the same problem, but was able to fix it with a tap of a hammer (should this have to happen with a brand new product???).Then we ran into the problem one of the reviewers mentioned. The music cannot be turned off! You press the button once and music starts. Your press the button twice, sounds come off. But the music will not stop. You have to wait 15 mins for the concert to end! Anybody's heard of an off button at EB's? So, keep a screw driver handy so that you can turn off the music by removing the batteries. I'm scratching Eddie Bauer from my list of baby product suppliers..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Mom","review":"After waiting for 3 months, we finally laid down the cash to buy this cute swing. I was so excited, until my husband finished putting it together. Like so many other parents, we bought it for the wood look, which looks so nice in our wood floor living room. Also, I liked the fabric, which is perfect for both boys and girls. But we can't stand it!!The motor is SO NOISY, it just grinds and grinds. The music is loud and doesn't turn off without removing the batteries. There seems to be no difference between the 5 speeds and the lowest speed is quite fast, although my son doesn't seem to mind.After much anticipation, we have decided to return it and buy one of those bright colored plastic things."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!","review":"We bought this swing mostly for the looks knowing it would be parked in our family room, however I totally regret that. There is no difference between speeds 1 - 5 and ours goes super fast when our son is not in it and is so slow its not even like its swinging when he is in it. He's a big boy - 15.5 lbs at 9 weeks, but it has been like this since he was a newborn.

He loves the swing and we use it on the highest speed since we start him in it. The motor just failed on us. I would not buy this swing again. The straps are to hard to use and aren't removable for cleaning. We don't use the straps. It is bulky to take with you. The tray is ok. Nice looking but it needs to work. Shoddy workmanship on the motor.The music stops if you hold the button in, just like the swing button.

It is a beautiful swing so much nicer to look at than those ugly blue ones, and very easy to put together. Also folds up to take up less space, but i wish i would have bought the Papasan instead.My son is now 4 months and weighs 17lbs and the swing does not operate. i have to push him in it! The nature sounds were all i used because the music was aweful, but now the nature sounds are scarey sounding like screams. After a month of using it 2 times a day, i thought the batteries were running low so i replaced them and the motor just didn't run. I am going to call the company to complain, after a month of use and it breaks!!Great design, poor quality. My son loves the swing i wish the motor didn't stop running. I'll write back if the company does something for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Swing","review":"Son loves this swing. It was easy to put together, I did it myself at 9 months pregnant. Very sturdy, very high quality, nice music, 5 speeds to swing speed. Think you may be paying a tad more for the name then other swings but my main goal was to match the woods in his bedroom and this is natural colored so it worked out perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate this swing!!","review":"This swing sucks! My son hates it now that he is 3 months mainly because it doesn't recline enough. He still sits up and it just isn't comfy. I disagree with the other people who said its too fast - now that Gavin is 12.5 lbs, the fastest setting isn't fast enough because he weighs it down. The only reason we bought this swing was because it matched our living room! New moms, go for what works well no matter how ugly or mismatched it looks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eddie Bauer Classic Wooden Swing","review":"The swing is sturdy, attractive, and effective judging from the response of my granddaughter.

Im gonna see if i can return it for another one.Although it a beautiful swing its really not functional. the 5 speed are a little to fast for a newborn. and you can't ajust the volume for the music. I wouldn't recommend it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"This swing is not worth the money. My husband put it together so regarding ease to assemble it took him over an hour. The music was blaring and there is not a volume control. Also, the music keeps going and going and going. You can't turn it off. After five minutes I started getting a headache and I was in a different room.Another not so great thing about the swing is the slowest swinging option is really really fast. We put weight in the basket thinking that might slow it down...Yeah, not really. The poor baby that gets put into this will be flung to and fro and will probably have poor hearing from the LOUD music. Trust me....skip it. Not worth the cuteness of it being wood with the Eddie Bauer name. Yikes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted only 11 weeks","review":"My son loved this swing for 11 weeks, until the motor died. It is completely out of commission and we are returning it for a new brand. The tray is difficult to open and close, but easier to use if left closed. It took me 9 weeks to figure out that you can shut the music off by holding the music button down for a few seconds. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this swing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate for newborn baby","review":"We selected this swing without first consulting consumer reviews, where we quickly realized we made a mistake in purchasing the swing. The assembly would have been easier, had pre-drilled holes been accurately located. The base footprint of the swing is much larger than the picture on the box makes it appear. Worst of all is the electronic aspect of the swing: Instead of 10 songs, we can only get the swing to play two. Once you start the music, the only way to stop it is by taking the batteries out. The swing speed is unacceptably fast, almost violently fast and instead of 5 swing speeds, we can find no difference between speeds 1-5, it just goes fast. Eddie Bauer may not have designed it, but they ought to be careful what third party products they associate their name with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my son loves this swing","review":"I agree with some of the bad reviews on this item, but for the most part this swing is great. The belt on the swing is really difficult to deal with, especially if you have a crying baby that you are trying to get OUT of the thing. I learned though that you have to clasp both sides of the belt, and that makes un-clipping the belt much much easier. It can be very frustrating. The motor is kind of loud for a baby swing, but it is actually what puts my son to sleep most of the time, not the music. We have never had a problem with the motor. The music on this this is pretty annoying for my husband and myself, but the few times that we did turn it on my son did like it. My husband and I also have the high chair and baby bouncer that match the swing. It is a really good looking set. Bad things aside, I LOVE this swing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my genre","review":"This is one of the reasons why I do not like to read books that are written successively by many authors.

This particular DVD, however, found me challenged to list anything it had going for it -- other than the very good looking male yogis. Still, once you get beyond the buff bods and glistening sweat, there is absolutely no substance to this DVD. If Amazon allowed you to return DVDs after opening them, I'd definitely be returning this one. It is brief beyond belief, with nothing new -- no interesting posture variations, no instructions beyond the most rudimentary and no reason to add it to your collection.

Gorgeous though her voice is, I think Norman is miscast. It's interesting to hear her in something other than her more usual Mozart/Strauss/Wagner repetoire, and she does sing well, but for some reason just sounds out of place. My main problem, however, is with Caballe. This is not a particularly difficult role, or at least shouldn't be for someone accustomed to singing Norma, Puritani, etc. But here Caballe sounds tentative and awkward some of the time. And her lack of a real high range (at least at volume) is noticeable here also. However, Gardelli couldn't have conducted a bad Verdi performance if he tried, and the male roles are all just fine. If you like this opera, and I do, you'll want this performance (not that you have a lot of other choices)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality product","review":"I absolutely love having this lazy susan in my pantry.

She takes us on a true mystery trip...and fortunately ties everything up at the end with actual CONCLUSIONS by scientists, which is why I was reading about the subject in the first place. The book sticks to the story...it doesn't suddenly mention World War 1 and then branch off for page after page discussing the war, politics, etc...as the other book did. Sometimes you forgot where it had left off, and sometimes, it never returned from whence it left.This book is focused, clear, and exciting.

Instead of writing in an extremely technical, scientific tone, she presents the story in a tone that people can enjoy to read but still understand the general idea of what went on/is going on. The focus on individuals who worked towards finding the virus in recent years is interesting and somewhat different than other books that are on the same pandemic.The focus of the book is or Dr. Hultin, Dr. Taubenberger, and the work they did together to first find the virus, and then sequence it's genome. This story is particularly interesting, and it is the main reason I would recommend this book along with the fact that is rather enjoyable to read and understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"A science book--not a history book-- for English majors","review":"I thought this book was fascinating. Kolata never claimed that this was the definitive book on the flu in 1918, and mentioned Crosby all over the place. That's fine by me. The description of 1918 was so depressing I couldn't have kept reading it for much longer. What this book really is though is a history of 20th century science and politics. What resources did scientists have in the 1920s? The 1950s? Today? What does it mean for us? I stayed up late to finish this book, and admit that the ending left me aware of all that's unresolved. Maybe in a few years there would have been more info. Still, I enjoyed it very much. Others here have complained about excessive characterization of specific scientists, but to me that was the most compelling part. I want everything I read to help me think about how to live my life. I found the depictions of both courageous and cowardly bureaucrats, curious and smug scientists to be fascinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catchy title not related to book content.","review":"Not only were the survivors of the 1918 flu epidemic so traumatized that few would talk about it, apparently so was the author, Gina Kolata. This is an extremely well written book but other than the first chapter, it is not about the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic. I would look elsewhere for information on that subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a bad high school research paper...","review":"This book actually contains some information on the flu epidemic, but it is precious hard to sort out from all the totally irrelevant stuff. If you're interested in the interior decorating skills or love affairs of the scientists looking for the DNA of the 1918 flu virus, then by all means read this book. But if you want to know about the epidemic itself, there have *got* to be better sources of information. This book reads like a bad high school research paper-- a little actual information, and a whole lot of empty filler to meet the page requirement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best book for research","review":"This book is not very good. I am disappointed in the research done for this book and I find her idea that the German's spread the disease as propaganda. She does little to back up this idea. It does not flow well and I found to her thoughts to be disorganized. You might be better off finding another book to read on this amazing story of the Spanish flu."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just a story of Spanish Influenza","review":"I bought this book looking for information about Spanish Flu for a novel I was writing. I had already read other books on the subject and this one was a relief to read. It wasn't dry like much non-fiction tends to be. It was an interesting read. Though it wasn't a narrative non-fiction, it was filled with stories that accented the numbers and the big picture Kolata created about epidemic flu. Though I wasn't so interested in the history of disease and death chapter, most of the other ones were good. I found the human trials interesting. I am also fascinated by the cyclical jumps the flu seems to make between man, swine and birds. If you are interested in the study of influenza in general, this is a great start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"There are better books on the subject. This is written to turn a historical matter into a detective story. If you're going to do that then have a resolution. The build up for this story, which goes from Alaska to Norway to Hong Kong, leads nowhere. In the end, the author has some speculation on what caused the disease but nothing in the least bit concrete. There are hundreds of pages spent on the search for a frozen but living virus that leads to it being mapped. Does it tell us anything about the virus. Not really. If I need speculation I'll read John Case. That has the same story in a fiction novel with much of the same speculation.Meanwhile she tells us very little about the virus. A chapter is spent on what happened in 1918. That's it. Read Crosby's book. Everyone else mentioned in this did."},{"rating":"1","title":"amazingly superficial and disappointing","review":"In this book she covers what seems the entire history of influenza, which includes the greatest pandemic in history in 1918-1919, the swine flu scare in 1976-- she even goes into litigation over the vaccine-- attempts to dig up bodies killed by the 1918 virus and sequence its genome, none of it in depth. In all of the footnotes for this book, there is not a single one for a primary source regarding the pandemic itself. No diaries, no lab notes, no original letters. There's hardly a reference to a contemporary newspaper. In fact, her notes cite interviews with a historian who wrote about the pandemic. Gina Kolata is a reporter, and this is a glorified newspaper story, expanded. Too bad. The subject itself is of interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but shallow.","review":"I found this book to be disappointing.Given the rich material at the heart of the flu story (molecular biology, genetics, virology) I had hoped that this science would, albeit at a layman's level, be the center of the story. Instead the book is largely a collection of anecdotes about a subset of those who tried to reconstruct the virus. Such material could better have been dealt with, more briefly, in (for example) a New Yorker magazine article.One exception - the last 10 pages describe some of the scientist's insights into how this virus might have become so lethal. The too-brief discussion of these theories provides the reader with some food for thought. It is ashame that the author included so little material of this type.Summary - if your interest is with the people involved in this detective work, this book is worth a read. If your interest is in the underlying science this book will likely disappoint you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing - poorly written book","review":"I was so disappointed by this book that I'm actually writing a review here! This book feels like it was written in great haste. Kolata fails to find or depict compelling conflicts, personalities or science... and her writing comes close to being excruciating! For a great piece of recent science writing check out the _Baltimore Case_ instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative","review":"Kolata's book was very easy to read, depicting the phsyical, social, and political ramifications of the killer flu very well. This book doesn't deal with just this one particular virus. It goes on to explain, in detail, flu epidemics which followed the 1918 pandemic and the threat of a new killer strain. I thought the expeditions to retrieve lung tissue samples in Alaska and Norway were particularly interesting as well as frightening. Suppose those men had accidentally set the virus loose again by digging up those corpses?"},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting material, lame writing","review":"she should stick to writing for magazines and newspapers because her style of writing becomes tedious when streched out to the length of the book..i became interested in the influenza epidemic of 1918 after coming a reference of it in one of william oneil's books..i wanted to read more about an event that killed more people than either world wars..if i had to pick a book on the subject again, i think i would try Alfred Crosby's book on the subject..now, there's a real historian as opposed to a reporter trying to write books"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop history","review":"There is very little original research and not a highly academic endeavor. However, it is an easy read and may prove a good place to start for hobby epidemioloical history enthusiasts. From a scientific perspective, this may be the topic of the season, but it is still too soon to report on the research of epidemiologists working to unravel all of the pandemic's idiosyncracies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"The author most have been compensated based on the number of pages written. Sadly she had to wonder so far of course just to reach 300 pages. At least 100 good pages were mixed in with 200 bad ones. But the good aren't good enough. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly organized, mediocre writing","review":"As I writer myself I'll say 3 things about this book. One, it's poorly organized. It's clear she tacked on chapter after chapter at the end after discovering new material. Two, the writing is at best mediocre. And three, I read it to the end anyway. You'll learn a lot about epidemics and nasty flu bugs. But I have to wonder if the \\"other\\" book about the 1918 Pandemic isn't better written. And if you want a REAL read, get Ken Alibek's \\"Biohazard.\\" The vaccine-resistant smallpox developed in the former USSR is a lot more likely to kill you, or keep you up at night worrying, than even the worst influenza outbreak - or book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst kind of science writing","review":"There's about half a book on the influenza epidemic of 1918 here, the rest is cluttered up with meaningless information--the names of peoples' children, the colors of their eyes, the kinds of cars they drive, etc--who cares. This book could have used some serious editing. The history is cursory--there's actually very little described about the epidemic and its immediate and long term aftermath. The narrative is cluttered; the story moves along and then detours to describe the most irrelevant facts. The science is fairly light-weight, and not especially elucidating--you will learn very few facts about the flu in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre extended newspaper article, now dated","review":"This is not a book about 1918. This is an over-hyped and overlong newspaper story about digging up bodies and trying to recover the 1918 virus from them. It's now (June 2004) much dated, which is what happens to newspaper stories.If you want to read an actual book about the epidemic-- and about much more, including contemporary science, the virus, the interplay between politics and the disease-- then read The Great Influenza by Barry. Now THAT is worth picking up. I gave that 5 stars, and if I could give it more I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Eye-Opener","review":"It amazed me how thoroughly the 1918 epidemic penetrated American life but how quickly it was forgotten. I first heard about it on an PBS's American Experience, and was given the book shortly thereafter as a gift.\\"Flu\\" has all the scientific details you might expect to be included in such a study: how the disease spread, how it mutated, and how scientists went about identifying it. This is all done in a really interesting way and read like a detective story, which is what it was in fact.More interesting was the book's treatment of the human factor in the efforts to fight the disease. \\"Flu\\" shows how political concerns, personal experience of politician and scientist alike, and even interpersonal relationships still shape the odds of finding a cure.Overall, \\"Flu\\" is a fascinating study of a little-known episode in American history."},{"rating":"1","title":"i was not impressed","review":"The subject is fascinating, yes, but Gina Kolata did not do justice either to the history or to current science. (Incidentally, several reviewers in here have given her credit for writing The New Yorker article on digging up bodies; she did NOT write that article. Malcom Gladwell did.) In terms of the more distant history, she was superficial at best. Barely 25% of the book deals with the 1918 pandemic. In terms of her analysis even of the 1976 swine flu fiasco, she shows herselt to be a political naif. In terms of the writing, overwrought newspaperish journalism. The best part of the book, and even that is only decent, covers Jeff Taubenburg's work sequencing the genome, which he pulled off a pathology slide.Hopefully this book will not deter a good writer from addressing the same subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're educated, skip it.","review":"I'll admit that I may be biased being that I hold a degree in microbiology, but I found this book painful to read. This book took the essence of the 1918 flu pandemic and turned it into a tabloid. If you really want to learn about the subject then Crosby's book is where you should turn"},{"rating":"1","title":"this is junk; there are much better books out there on the subject","review":"Forget this over-blown newspaper story that does not really talk about either influenza as a disease or events of 1918 at all.Buy \\"The Great Influenza\\" instead, which does both, and more. Or Crosby's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginning to see what is lacking in NYT science coverage","review":"While the book is an interesting read, Gina Kolata, a science reporter for the NYT, unfortunately mischaracterizes some of the science as well as an excessive number of historical events. Ms Kolata also spends so much time on trivia (such as the details of the swine flu litigataion) and so ends the book too quickly. The book also could have used better editing -- people are frequently referred to before being introduced, and a few (like the obese Alaskan woman) are never introduced at all. If I were Dr. Duncan, btw, I wouldn't appreciate being depected a an bimbo, but I think Kolata managed to avoid libel by only citing other peoples quotes.I'm not sure that I gained new knowledge by reading this book, but I am sure its going to be sold to the used bookstore next week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccuracies sink this book","review":"One cannot believe anything stated in this book. The fact-checkers were out to lunch, and the 'facts' stated that fall within my field (veterinary medicine), were so blatantly incorrect, that I cannot believe anything else I read in this book. Science writing, although journalism, still requires the same attention to detail as the subject it purports to describe. This book is sloppy, and at times tedious. I felt annoyed that I had wasted so much time reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"read Crosby's book on this subject instead","review":"If you actually want to know about events in 1918, especially in the US, read Crosby's book (see link below), whom Kolata interviewed and cites as a source. It's a far better effort not only in terms of research but in depth and understanding. Kolata does do one thing Crosby doesn't: she relates events that are going on now in terms of finding samples of the virus and sequencing its genome. But since those invetsigations are still on-going, and since the crucial question about this virus remains unanswered-- i.e., why was it so much more deadly than other influenza viruses?-- Kolata can't provide satisfaction anyway, and a review of current work (which will soon be dated) is not enough to justify buying this derivative and superficial overblown newspaper story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historically flawed with little insight into the basics.","review":"You will get a lively tale including plenty of irrelevant journalistic chit-chat. But you will not understand why flu is a menace. The flu virus is so dangerous because it can undergo sudden and profound shifts in its makeup, rendering existing vaccines ineffective. These shifts occur by high frequency exchange and rearrangement of viral gene segments, a mechanism that was first suggested by F. M. Burnet and described by George Hirst. Burnet and Hirst were pioneers and giants in the influenza virus field. They are not even mentioned in this book. More balanced history could have made a far more insightful story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book Searching for a Story","review":"\\"Flu\\" is a quick, easy, read that skims over the 1918 Pandemic and introduces the reader to the current science of influenza.What I am most greatful for is the book's introducing me to Crosby's \\"America's Forgotten Pandemic\\".However, the book draws no solid conclusions, and has no real ending. It also leaves threads hanging at the conclusion. (We are never told from what virus strain (H?N?) the recovered RNA indicated the 1918 flu belonged. Finally, the chatty biographies of the books personalities were really annoying to have to wade through. (Does it really matter that Kirsty Duncan does Celtic dancing?)Pass this up and go straight to \\"America's Forgotten Pandemic\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is quite a mess","review":"You get the sense, after reading this book, that when Gina Kolata felt she had enough material to fill a three hundred page book, she just transcribed her index cards and let it go at that. The book is all over the place. It is cluttered, repetitious and badly written.The great flu epidemic of 1918 should be an interesting topic in the hands of the right writer. Someone who knows more about writing than I do will have to explain what it is about Kolata's writing style that makes it close to unbearable. Not just bad--unbearable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing book","review":"I purchased this book based on a radio interview with the author. The subject matter was fascinating to me. Unfortunately, the book was not. Having read some great authors (Stephen Ambrose for one), this book came across as shallow, hastily written, pulpy (a lot of filler), aimless, etc. It is the first time that I have felt compelled to write a negative review. I would definitely not recommend that anyone purchase this book. If you are curious, check it out at the library, and then be thankful that you did not buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reads like a mystery novel","review":"I was hooked on this book from the beginning.

I definitely recommend it especially if you're bored with the same old storylines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meandering","review":"This book reads like an over long movie. The plot is good, the characters interesting, but of the 306 pages in this book, a good 150 to 200 could have been excised. They relate at most only tangentially to the 1918 flu epidemic. The reader really needs to work at finding and keeping the focus. Perhaps a better title would have been Flu: a stream of consciousness essay on the Swine Flu of 1976, John Dalton and color blindness and by the way, the 1918 Flu pandemic.

I don't have alot of time on front of a fireplace to read. When I bought this book I wanted a rundown of the pandemic and history involved. This book delivers that but I had to weed it out painstakingly. This book mostly gives biographies of the scientists and pathologists who researched the virus with a bit of info given on the actual subject of the book weaved into it.

Both she and my 4 yr old have played with it a little bit, but it hasn't held their attention. The reason is because it's over their heads. They can use the pen to follow the story but the interaction demands too much of them (and my 6 yr old's no dummy!) For example, they're supposed to point out the grammatical mistakes early in the story. Later on there's a multiplaction table that shows everything from 1x1 to 9x9. (5x5=25, 5x6=30, etc). My 4 yr old had no idea what it was saying so she randomly pointed to numbers, got bored and walked away. We did sit with our 6 yr old and go through the bar graphs together. This was a good exercise for her. Because of the skills needed for other sections though I'm inclined to say this is aged appropriately.

Instead, all I experienced with this book was disappointment--so much so in fact, that I could not bring myself to even finish it.Clegg continuously leaps back and forth from past to present, from dream to reality; this begins to annoy about a third of the way in. The intertwining of different storylines gets a bit complex as characters are sprinkled into the mix along the way.I believed the story to have potential after the first few chapters, but it failed to keep me interested after about the half-way point.

Now the alien is back to finish what she started. If you can make it through the first half, (that's a big IF), the second half is a bit more interesting. Good Luck if you give this book a chance.

Starting from the Horace Tapscott composition, Isle of Celia, through to the burning Crisscraft, Criss is in complete command of his masterful jazz playing. His solo on Blues of My Heart is an excursion into the dark, blue side of his emotions which Sonny has always been honest enough to reveal, and his interpretation of the classic All Night Long is further proof of Criss's special abilties to capture the essence of a song, from the inside out. This recording, made just a few years prior to Sonny's untimely death in 1977, is further proof that Sonny Criss stands alone as the premier jazz alto saxophonist of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonsai: Its Art, Science, History and Philosophy by Deborah R.

If you want a full, well explained & illustrated account of all aspects of bonsai & want to read just one book then this in my opinion is the book. I like the fact that it covers the science as well as the art as when you understand why you do something it makes it easier to implement. If you are a beginner & have no other access to instruction you could learn the art of bonsai by just reading, understanding & implementing the information gleaned from this book.

Mr Asher keeps interrupting his narrative by persistent psychoanalysis of Lawrence as well as stories of his own exploits in the footsteps of his subject.

At times, the mixture of small (usually a boys choir) and Large choir combined with a full orchestra and Soloists is so diverse and at the same time seemless, tells the Christmas story with a flow and direction that is reminicent of the Great Bach Cantatas.

Though they do share some qualities, I think Anthony Wilson's trio stands by itself. Originality, creativity, swing-feel, repertoire, and \\"outness,\\" are all things that set Wilson's trio apart from Goldings'. This is not to say Goldings' trio does not do these things. Lord knows they do it as good, if not better than anyone, but the guys in Anthony's trio do the same things with their own spin. I also think Joe Bagg and Mark Ferber communicate to each other on their instruments as good as anyone in the business. This Groove Note release is a great example of some of the things this trio can do. As with most musicians, the experience is really felt when it is live! The same holds true for this amazing group, but their great sound is captured on this wonderful album. I thoroughly enjoyed it from front to back.

At less than one-hundred pages, The Punic Wars 264-146 BC can be read in one sitting, and I found little quarrel with the author's presentation of facts or take on the conflict.

Sean Connery, Lana Turner, and Glynis Johns are all superb. The story takes place in England during the waning days of WWII. This is a story of two women in love with the same man (who, ironically, is deceased). You cannot help but have a connection with the characters as you sit through this film. \\"Another Time, Another Place\\" gives the viewer a great feel for the period as well. I have owned the VHS copy for years. I just wish Paramount would release this one on DVD. Great film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid","review":"One of the worst movies that wasted Lana Turner's talent. I was not able to finish the movie - an abomination."},{"rating":"1","title":"....Same Old Lana","review":"Can't take credit for the title of this review, it's the NY TIMES TV listings capsule summary for the flick, but sidesplittingly true. This film's from Lana's mid-period; our girl's cast adrift from the haven of MGM, but still not sunk to the depths of THE BIG CUBE. She's carefully lacquered here, and has the opposite of chemistry with leading man Sean Connery, vital and attractive in an early film role. Their Forbidden Love Is Not To Be, as he has the good sense to die early on, leaving Lana to seek out his widow, Glynis Johns, so that she can -- oh, why bother? If you've seen more than three movies in your life, you're miles ahead of every plot turn.

Well after about the third page I realized I was sadly mistaken because instead of reading a book that sounded like it was supposed to inspire me it just depressed me.This book is not a story about a womans love of horses it is about a womans love of money.Any person that loves horses would not send them to the slaughterhouse because she deemed them to be so called useless or in other words basically not making her money. She mentions just a few pages into the book how much she loves money but funny enough did not mention once how much she loves horses well of course besides the false advertising she used on the book cover all this book was was just another way for her to exploit horses for money consistent of what she has done her whole life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Ab Workout","review":"I have several of Billy Blanks DVDs and I like them... some better than others.

I could not even finish it. I was bored and frustrated with the immature writing style as well as the characters.

Also read Scarlet Feather by Maeve Binchy, another good one by her."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life lesson","review":"Maeve Binchy has a way with not only story lines but her characters. The reader feels the love and pain each character experiences. Maeve introduces us into Ria's life at a tender age for Ria. The reader experiences Ria's dreams, gets to know her family and meets her first love. Ria's \\"too good to be true\\" true love turns out to be just that. Ria's love for Danny clouds her vision from the real world for too many years. I could have read into Ria's life forever. Maeve continues to write novel that capture your heart and sole in other book such as Circle of Friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depends What you like, pleasurable Read ! I enjoyed it !","review":"I enjoyed this book for the reason it was light, easy and full of gossip. I tend to go for mysterys, thillers and horrors, however this book kept catching my eye, once I started the pages kept turning, I became engrossed with the characters and felt the emotions they experienced, I hope their is a sequel, I would like to see a few charaters get their cumeuppance, Ria was definalty to soft ! Maeve obviously has a sense of humour, however it was only towards the end it was introduced which was dissapointing, shame, Annie and Brian had me in stitches. - If you want a good light read - IT'S A MUST ! - This is my first Maeve Binchy and I will read more."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"Tara Road is definitely not one of Binchy's best books. Although the storylines interact well as they usually do in her works, I care so little about most of the characters that I had to force myself to keep reading. Very drawn out in places, especially the early descriptions of home life in the Lynch household. The female characters are very static, especially Annie after she hits adolescence. All we see is her picking at her brother, and it gets very old after the 6th scene where she tells him to shut up. Ria, Rosemary, Gertie, Marilyn, Hilary, Nora, et al, none of them are people I would want to know. This is the first Binchy book I haven't been drawn into and thoroughly enjoyed, so I am really disappointed! The modern setting of the book doesn't help it either, and the introduction of the Internet feels forced.I am sorry I could not review this book more positively, but I really took a dislike to the whole effort and can't shake it."},{"rating":"2","title":"TARA ROAD","review":"I absolutely LOVED this book - I was so sad to have it end. I feel as if I'm in a personal relationship with the characters. Everyone I know that has read this book feels the same way.

And, not to omit,the reader Katherine Borowitz did a wonder fantastic job reading the audio version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dialogue not believable","review":"I have read everything by Maeve Binchy and was disappointed in Tara Road for several reasons. It is indeed an easy read but I found the plot too predictable (ie. I was just waiting to find out when Danny would leave Ria). All the hints were too obvious as to the outcome of the plot. I also was quite disappointed that the American dialogue was not researched. The American kids spoke like very well-schooled Irish children and one of the first things that Marilyn said was, \\"I'll ring you later.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I Have Read Better Binchey","review":"I found Tara Road a huge disappointment. The characters seemed to be made of cardboard, and they repeated themselves endlessly throughout the book. I had the distinct impression that Binchey was challenged to write a 500 page book and proved that she could. It was simply not interesting. I wonder how I managed to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book which demeans women","review":"I am a male in my late 40's and have come to rely on Oprah's suggestions since my experience with the books she recommends reveals those books to be well written with compelling stories. But this book was not only dull, it truly lends support to all the horrible stereotypes of women as gossipy, back-stabbing people who have little loyalty toward friends when it comes to \\"getting a man\\". Every character in the book except the \\"heroine\\" Ria was two-faced to family and close friends--and the principal \\"plot\\" of the book was to look aghast with horror upon Ria's adulterous husband. Frankly, the women characters came across worse than Ria's husband--and Ria's character was developed to show an extreme inadequacy in assessing the strengths and weaknesses of her husband and closest friend. I was very diappointed and could never consider spending any more of my money on books written by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I so enjoyed bits and pieces of this book. There was a lot of honesty about people's lives, how others let you down, how we rewrite our own histories sometimes. But overall it was vapid, detached, irregular, and depressing. You never felt part of their lives. It was extremely frustrating to me to have to read through in detail 280 pages to get to the point where you know on page 3 the story is going anyway. Ridiculous. But what blew my mind the most and let me down was the lack of closure. There simply was no feel-good ending, no happiness at the end. Just loss and a feeling of waste. No rejuvenation was I felt the story needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Inspection of the Tapestry of Life","review":"Maeve Binchy opens the window to the beauty and richness of the living of life. She has the gift of explicating the beauty, fullness, tragedy, glory of the lives lived all around. This is a warm, surprising, satisfying visit with people who are not saints or demons, but people you know -- or want to know -- and with whom you do find yourself feeling empathy and sympathy, and wishing all the best. RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pick, Oprah!","review":"This is one of Oprah's better picks. I am planning on reading more by Ms. Binchy. This was a story that pulled me in, couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another special story from a favourite author","review":"Maeve Binchy has a special way of making her characters become like old friends of her readers, and in Tara Road, this is true once again. I soon became engrossed in this tale of love, life and disappointment, with its rich cast of characters, likeable and not-so-likeable. This story is a testament to the healing powers of time, love and friendship. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I don't know which is worse; the book or the reviews of praise. Please remember, it's a novel.

Read it for a bookclub, otherwise I would have dropped it after the first 50 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice change of pace","review":"I picked up this book looking for a change in reading. The story line seemed a little boring but I thought I'd give it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised. The story of two women who's lives are in chaos and decide to change homes to get a grasp on life. Although the two women have never met there lives become extremely close learning about each other's troubles through friends and family. It is quite interesting to see how each can submerge into each other's life without knowing one another. The switch for both women was encouraging, rediscovering themselves and lives they never knew existed.I enjoyed this story because it moved me. It wasn't an adventure or a love story but about people and their search for self-fulfillment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Publisher must have needed a new title in a hurry","review":"When Maeve's novels are amongst one's \\"guilty pleasures,\\" one is quite accustomed to plowing through certain tedious sections, knowing they tend to have relevance, in unexpected ways, later. In this case, the wading is constant, and only literary quicksand ahead.Maeve often is brilliant in her characterisation, dialogue, and depiction of relationships. Not so here - the plot, such as it is, seems to go nowhere at all, and such relationships as are not totally contrived are far too puzzling."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"This book was sooo boring!

I shall give M.B. a wide berth in future...!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tara Road","review":"I thought this book was very well written. The character development throughout the book was excellent. I have to admit though, I was a little disappointed in the character of Ria. She was made out to be a clueless housewife who clung to the idea of being reunited with her adulterous husband. I wanted her character to become stronger in the end. Yes, she did travel to America but I felt as though her character did not triumph over her weaknesses. In fact I felt that Marilyn who had the terrible tragedy of losing her son was the stronger character of the two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from Maeve","review":"I've read all of Binchy's novels with delight (except for Firefly Summer which I hated)and this one was especially good. She is such a great storyteller and I was especially charmed by Ria and her children. The ending wasn't the strongest or most satisfying (hence 4, instead of 5, stars) but then again I was so sad to be leaving these new found friends that perhaps any ending would have disappointed me! There was a sequel for Light A Penny Candle...maybe for this one too?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good story.","review":"This was my first Maeve Binchy novel although I did see the movie version of Circle of Friends (Which I loved)I liked this story. I felt I could related to Ria especially in light of buying an old house in a great neighborhood and all that goes with fixing it up. I felt that the psychic lady was totally unneccessary to the plot and therefore the four star rating. Otherwise, I really got into all the characters and really enjoyed the house swapping idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overated!","review":"At first I was very interested in this book.

I will look for more books written by her to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, not the usual Maeve Binchy","review":"Like most people, I waited, with anticipation for this book, sadly, very disapointed. The characters are dull,totally lacking in depth, you almost wish to shake some life into them. Not Ms. Binchy best offering. Wait until it's out in paperback, it's not worth the money, even with Amazon's great prices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book in years","review":"It is amazing that this book is one of Oprah's picks. The dialogue is too corny and the characters are one-dimensional. This book was a total drag - from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!","review":"I love how the character's lives were woven together into a wonderful tapestry. And finally! An Oprah book blissfully divoid of foul language!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid plot with poor character development","review":"This was probably one of the worst books I have read in the last 5 years. None of the characters made sense or had any dimension, particularly the protagonist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Page-Turner","review":"This was one of the worst books I've read of Ms. Binchy. The main character was shallow with no backbone. I almost put the book down about ten times. All I kept thinking was, \\"Speed it up\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my type.","review":"This book was very hard to read, too many characters being introduced at one time and there were none I found interesting enough to want to keep reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Please!","review":"Don't waste your time reading this drivel. The storyline was trite; the characterizations were superficial. If you enjoy a book where you can predict exactly what will happen then this is the one for you (if you don't mind the drudgery of plodding through the pedestrian and tedious writing)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring and slow at the beginning, but gets a little better.","review":"The book starts out very slow and boring. Up to page 250 I found myself flipping the pages. There are at least 150 pages of this book that could be easily excluded from the book.The story is very typical, a housewife completely in love with her husband has absolutely no idea that he has been cheating on her for a long time, she is completely naive and stays that way till the end of the book, but in the end she discovers that she can survive the break up. There is absolutely nothing fresh or original about the story line, and more or less it feels like the same story you've read about before told by another author. However, the second half of the book is entertaining and funny at times, therefore I would recommend it for a long flight or few hours when you need to kill some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Binchy's more touching!!","review":"Maeve Binchy is my favorite author & I've read a lot of her books but this was very different from what she normally does. I was really suprised at how touching & emotional & personal Tara Road was. All of her books have that type of plot but she really showed the emotions the characters go through during the plot really rawly.She spent about the first 230 pages describing the plot very boringly & I didn't think I'd like this book very much due to that but ending up really enjoying it b/c I saw later the signifigance & reasoning for it. Maeve had to make a perfected existance for the character's family to show later how much it was really destroyed & how deeply the people were affected by it. I was astonished at this novel at how deep Binchy dug down to get those emotions & really make you feel it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic , complex story with great characters!","review":"I enjoyed Tara Road's intrigue, and intermingled characters and plot twists. Maeve Binchy is indeed a talented author, blending personalities and character traits in ways that the reader is kept quite busy with sorting it all out. The impacts that each of them have on each other, both known and unknown, keeps your mind guessing and we feel for Ria as much as we do for Marilyn, Rosemary and Gertie. I loved it and highly recommend the purchase of this book! You will want to read it again and again, and it is bound to become a classic piece of literature, like Gone with the Wind. The scenes Binchy paints of Tara Road in Ireland and summer in Connecticut make the reader feel that they are there with the characters! Amazing writing style, and you will love it. It is definitely at page-turner!! Get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Binchy not at her best","review":"I cannot put my finger on it but somehow I felt dissappointed with this book.I am a huge Binchy fan and had read and reread almost all of her books at least a thousand times but this one I left on the shelf after one read.It is not that I did not enjoy it,I simply felt it lacked that something special one uasually finds with her.Maybe Ria was too naive,or Danny got away with too much for too long,who knows?I just know it did not have that uasual spellbinding effect I had come to expect from her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"If you want to invest in reading about half of this weighty tome, you will find the more interesting characters. Otherwise, you will read only daily tedium about the main character.The plot is predictable, the characters not well sketched and the ending unsatisfactory."},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept waiting for it to move somewhere...","review":"...and it never quite did so.Those fond of the old cliche that a change of scene is the best thing on earth may find it forgivable that this tale is rather tiresome. The two major characters (one heartbroken because of her husband's departure, the other because of a child's death) are never quite developed, and the twists in the plot that seem to promise added depth lead to nothing.Maeve's forte in her best work is character development and relationships of all sorts. Tara Road reminded me more of conversations one may hear in a launderette such as character Gertie manages."},{"rating":"2","title":"True life at its best...or worst...","review":"I won't lie, I randomly found this book at work and only picked it up and started reading it because it had my name in the title. Once I started it, though, I couldn't put it down! Ms. Binchy's characters are realistic, as are their struggles. They are not all gorgeous people who are honorable and trustworthy--they have their share of faults, which gives this novel a wonderfully human quality. There were some parts that dragged along more than others, but all in all, I was impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Binchy!!","review":"This is definitely Maeve Binchy's best novel yet. The interlocking stories keep the reader entertained and wondering what will happen next. I was sad to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent book by Maeve Binchy.","review":"With Binchy's books, I never want them to end and Tara Road was no exception. The characters are so well drawn that they are old friends by the time you are half way through the book. There was a lot of realism in this story and the relationships ring true. Ria was a great character and so was her daughter. You could see her daughter's growth throughout the book. I wish that there weren't so many years between Binchy's books. They are always a rare treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tara Road is Binchy at her best.","review":"From the moment one opens the front cover, Maeve Binchy pulls the reader into her world--and makes you feel just a little bit more Irish. The life of Ria Lynch and her friends absorbs you and takes you to Dublin to the quaintness of \\"Tara Road.\\" As in Binchy's other work, reading \\"Tara Road\\" is like curling up in a big quilt in front of a crackling fire on a cold winter day. She tells a common story in a compelling and most uncommon way--with clarity, color and her own brand of Irish flavor. My only warning is DON'T READ THE COVER before you oopen the book. Why publishers feel the need to give away important plot ingredients on the book jacket is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Maeve Binchy","review":"Tara Road - Yes !! She did it again and will probably do it several times more. When I was done reading it I could have cried that there were no more pages of this magnificent book. I look forward to reading more of Maeve Binchy - the best author ever!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to read this book!!","review":"I thought this was a great book. It would encourage me to read other books by Maeve. It was long, but once I got into it, I didn't want to put it down. My favorite character was Annie, because I could really relate to her. You MUST read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to start but well worth in the end.","review":"I have trouble starting Binchy's books and gave up on this one after about 100 pages. Picked it up again later and got into it! I really felt that I got to know the characters. I now want to go back and read some more of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was in excellent condition.","review":"It was in excellent condition. t was an excellent story and I really like the way the author writes. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe it's just me","review":"Maybe it's just me...I was happy to receive this paperback copy, especially since it's set in Ireland initially, and I was completely enchanted with Ireland on my visits there. Also, some of my very favorite books have been Oprah's selections. But I am giving up after 140 pages. Is it ever going to be anything more than a typical soap opera? \\"Angela's Ashes\\" it's not! Sorry, but I can't really maintain an interest in any of the predictable, stereotypical characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"These women needs backbones, STAT!!!","review":"I picked up this book because it was an Oprah Book CLub book and I had several waiting for me to read.I found it hollow and not as OBC worthy as others, like Middlesex which I just finished prior to Tara Road.Tara Road is replete with weak female characters: a doormat in Ria, a punching bag in Gertie, a wealthy backstabbing friend, etc etc.I wanted to jump into their world and shake some sense into them! WHy must all the women be weak and accomodating and most of the male characters successful and in control (if not domineering)?I did find it enjoyable along the way but in the end I felt as if I wasted 600+ pages of reading on a stupid woman's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One more chapter, please.","review":"The book was very enjoyable to read. It was definately a page turner. The women portrayed in the book seemed very realistic and by the end you wanted a few more chapters to see what would happen next. I really liked the fact that there were two women, one a professional and one a homemaker, struggling in a parallel fashion. Neither were weak and both conquered their fears. I really liked this book and would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh journey from Ireland to America and back.","review":"While reading this book, I had to keep reminding myself that the story takes place in this century. For some reason, during the chapters that occur in Ireland, I kept thinking I was in a time gone past. Ms. Binchy's prose, and this is her first work I have read, is often quaint, and simple. I must confess, I enjoyed the Ireland parts better perhaps because I have a fondness for Ireland. Her characters were rich and well woven and I found myself indeed caring for the outcome. A nice book to read by the fire and another reason to visit Ireland someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy novel dressed up with an impressive cover","review":"I was terribly disappointed in this work. I read it for a book club I am in, and, had it not been for the book club, would have never finished. I trudged on through every long, boring page, only to find that the ending was every bit as unimpressive as the rest of the story. I am amazed that such a poorly written book with no real substance is loved by so many."},{"rating":"1","title":"women only","review":"I just did not like it. Nothing is really happening and it just drags on and on. In my opinion the characters are quite boring, maybe just like in real life. Anyway, I think it might be a nice book for women, but men, stay away from it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was well written with a great story!","review":"This was a story of Ria Johnson, a sweet unassuming girl who falls in love with a very ambitious Danny Lynch. Around these two people who lived on a fasionable street in Dublin are Ria's friends and different incidents that happens. However, Danny gets a young girl pregnant and tells Ria that he must leave her. Ria exchanges houses with an American lady and their lives change in very interesting ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding","review":"I am amazed as I read the other reviews of this over-long, tedious, trite \\"Oprah-pick,\\" bestseller. Reading a grocery list would be infinitely more exciting than this drivel. The woman has no style, no flair, no talent - but then Danielle Steel has made quite a living with the same set of credentials. The cardboard characters on the front of cereal boxes have more credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Sorry to you all, but I didn't like the book. I am very disappointed, I thought the story would be so great, but I couldn't finish the book. I didn't like how its written, and the way events are presented.It is a very slow-reading book! I kept yawning through out all the pages that I read.I don't recommend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worthy of Oprah or Maeve","review":"I agree with the nay-sayers -- I am a Binchy fan but found this one to be a bore; in fact, about 3/4 through it started speed-reading just to find out the answers to the very few things that interested me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The scandals never ended.","review":"It kept me interested. I really liked her depiction of the children in the book, they were very likeable. The neverending scandals and discoveries of improprieties was a bit much but I guess it kept the book moving. This was the first book of hers I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really a wonderful story with well developed characters.","review":"I really enjoyed this novel -- the first Maeve Binchy book I've read, although I intend to seek out others now. The ending was a bit predictable, but I so thoroughly enjoyed the actual story and the characters that I didn't really mind. Wonderful plot development and attention to character details -- a real joy to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzz","review":"Tara Road follows the story of two women faced with heartbreak and loss. Ria and Marilyn, the two main characters, switch lives as a way to distant themselves from the pain and sorrow they are trying to face. Although the first three chapters held my interest, I became somehwat disconnected with the characters and the story line and found it a hard book to keep reading and believing in. Still, this book was selected as an \\"Oprah\\" book so there must be a reason others will enjoy this story even if I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tara Road - I'll Stay Home","review":"While novels may require you to suspend belief, this one goes way too far. The characters were totally unbelievable. There are too many \\"stories within the story\\" and no time is spent to really \\"flesh-out\\" any of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like this book.","review":"I did not like this book. I didn't care for the characters and forced myself to read on telling myself it would get better, that there might be something worth reading. It did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read it if you want to read quality literature.","review":"She may have creative storylines but she is an atrocious writer. Don't do it. Save your reading energies for quality writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't even finish it","review":"This book was SO boring. I borrowed the book from a friend since I was flying back and had nothing to read - what a mistake. I read during the entire flight and was so bored that I tried sleeping. Once I was home I tried to get through it and finally skipped to the last couple of chapters and amazingly knew what was going on. I have never read Maeve Bincy before and it's doubtful I will again. I love reading but this one just didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tara Road","review":"This was the first Maeve Binchy book I have read and I was not impressed. The characters were undeveloped and the plot was totally unbelievable. If you like Danielle Steele, you'll probably enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"writing a review without spoiling the damn book!","review":"This message is for the READER from South Dakota who went on to list all of the story's emotional moments as part of her review. You should not write reviews lady! People check out your words of wisdom when they are thinking of purchasing the novel. Next time skip the details and give a REVIEW please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not near Maeve Binchys former, wonderfully written stories","review":"The beginning of the story was, to me, pure Maeve Binchy, then, the storyline became disjointed and characters not well formed. I have read all the previous works and felt like a stranger had penned this book. The dust jacket was beautiful enough to be framed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warms the Heart!","review":"I adore Maeve Binchy's books and this one is no exception. You can really get into each of her characters and you can tell that Maeve knows all about family life because everything rings true. Reading one of her books is like sitting before a slow burning fire with a nice glass of wine--you simply enjoy it slowly. I love to savor her books and I was not disappointed in this one. I like the way her women are not doormats, but are independent and caring and always come out winners."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was surprised when I heard Oprah picked this book.","review":"A little too easy to read if you know what I mean- written at a 8th grade reading level. I thought this book was a little too long and lacking any any good characters. Ria was unrealistically \\"perfect\\" - great wife, mother, cook, friend, daughter, sister and homemaker. The other main female character was more interesting and less predictable. Both women were quite different. While Ria was warm and open - Marliyn was cold and private. Although they both had experienced terrible tragedies, I had trouble feeling sorry for either of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy, rather dull, read","review":"I wasn't very impressed with this book. I felt that the first 200 pgs were quite boring. I wanted to shake Ria and wake her from her dream world. When she finally realizes her life isn't as wonderful as she thinks it is, things become a little more interesting. Ria's weak character annoyed me. I believe at the end of the story she still would have taken Danny back. I enjoyed how Marilyn's character grew and her interaction with Ria's friends was fun to read. I have 2 questions. 1) Who did Annie see Rosemarie with that afternoon? Did she recognize him or was she mainly shocked by the sexual scene? 2)Do you think Ria will end up with Colm? I do. Unless Danny were to show up at her doorstep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of Maeve Binchy","review":"Although Maeve Binchy is a \\"lightweight\\" writer,\\" I usually buy her books her \\"hardback\\" because the character descriptions are good and \\"alive.\\" This was the worst Maeve Binchy book I have ever read and I've read them all. It was predictable, redundant and the characters were stereotyped. Read her earlier books; they are much, much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tara Road","review":"I found the book to be completely tedious. After trying desperately to get \\"into\\" the book, hope sprung eternal for me that something good had to happen in the 500+ pages. However, by the end, I remained completely disappointed. Binchy elevates the Ria character to sainthood while condemning the American, Marilyn, to the role of a cold and distant witch. The constant reminders of all Ria's abilities wore really thin. This has been my first and last Binchy book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought it at the airport & left it on the plane","review":"Yuck...this poorly written book should be an embarrassment to the author. She has so obviously written a formulaic, commercially appealing book, geared toward the Romance reader set. But they deserve much more. Mousy heroine lands a cool guy, his ambitions move them up in society, and she tags along. Plot twists ensue. ZZZZZZZZ. The characterizations are skin-deep at best but the author persists in moving her puppet-like people through their paces. It was utterly unsatisfying. After reading it for a couple hours, (I bought it at the airport since I thought Circle of Friends was kinda OK)I slammed it shut in frustration, offered it to my airplane seatmate, who then had the same experience. We laughed as we left it on the plane as we disembarked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too wordy for me!","review":"I found this book very slow moving. I tried and tried. Usually I can't put a good book down. The story sounded good, but I guess I never made it that far..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Positive!","review":"Tara Road is one of my favorite books for 1999! I did not read it in the usual two-to-three days that I would normally read a great book---I purposely held off reading it every hour, every day, so I could enjoy it for a long period of time! I recommend this book to everyone who loves Great Britain---who loves to watch people---who has experienced the various man/woman relationships encountered in this book. This book gave me hope and a positve outlook for my own personal life. A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Binchy novel","review":"I laughed, I cried, I was not over-impressed, but I grew to love Ria and feel for her. Binchy does have a good juggling act going on I must admit, with all of those crazy characters. It was a long ride, but worth it. I may check out one of her others. My big question though, did anyone else realize that A LOT of the characters had the same initial starting their first and last names? It was a little annoying to me. Maybe it was just me, it wouldn't be the first time :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable.","review":"\\"Tara Road\\" is a very honest and intelligent book by the wonderful author Maeve Binchy. I've been a longtime fan of Ms. Binchy's and I found this book to be one of her best. (not, THE best...save \\"Circle of Friends\\" for that one) But, I enjoyed this one, none the less. All of her books are so character driven. And, you truly want to know them. You care about them, and worry for their future. Ms. Binchy is a rare and wonderful talent. I can't wait to read her next book. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bookclub Nightmare","review":"If you are interested in this book, do yourself a favor -- save $25 and read the inside cover at the bookstore. It sums up the entire story and will save you hours of laborious reading. I managed to finish Tara Road only because it was required for a monthly book club meeting.The plot has a slow start and highly predictable ending. Even more frustrating is the \\"heroine\\" of the story, Ria, repeatedly behaving like a complete doormat. It was maddening to endure this character's lack of self esteem and personality!For a 500+ page book, the narrow character development was a bonafide let-down. There was exorbitant detail about what every person was wearing and doing, but rarely was there any insight into what these characters were actually thinking. The popularity of this book is absolutely baffling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long but worth it","review":"This was my first Binchy book and I was hooked. I love her writing style and the way you are brought into her Ireland, and in this case, bits in Connecticut. This novel was long but one you did not want to put down for long. After reading this I tried Circle of Friends which was also terrific. See my review on that separately. For the reader who wants a relaxing read but looking for some intellectual satisfaction as well thanks to her prosaic style."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many characters","review":"Too many characters and a slow pace. I got bored with, and quit after 100 pages. Light a Penny Candle is a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Circle of Friends, this is not...","review":"If I had been asked to rate this book when I had read just the first 200 pages, I would have given it one star. However, I had nothing else to read at the time so I continued to read it. At that early stage the book seemed poorly written and terribly dull. I couldn't fathom why Oprah chose it for her book club. The story picked up for me over half way through and by the end I couldn't put it down. Once I was finished I could begin to understand why Oprah chose it, but I'm still surprised that the book was published without some major editing. If I recommend it to anyone I will be sure to provide a list of the characters and tell the reader to begin reading after the first two hundred pages. This is not Ms. Bincheys best, by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tara Road","review":"Well, well, well. Finally a story that sweeps you away from the present to a era of bittersweet love, commitments and family values. I really enjoyed this book and was heart broken when it ended. It is beautifully written and captivates you from page one. Ria's looking at life through \\"rose color glasses\\" hit home for me as relating to simular experiences in my life and many friends around me. Wer'e always the last to know... but didn't we really know all along? I think most of us realize later thats the case. This is book is a great lesson on life and what YOU make of it. Ria's story will stay with you for months to come... V."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tara Road","review":"I enjoyed the book very much. I had a hard time putting it down. There were many characters in the story and I loved everyone of them. I felt like I knew everyone like my own friends and neighbors. I'm interested in reading another of Maeve's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I received this book from my mother and hesitated reading it, since we rarely share the same taste in books. Then Oprah selected it as her book of the month and I thought I would give it a shot. I was totally disappointed! I keep wondering that if Ria were such a perfect wife and mother, why did she not see what was so obvious from Chapter 1? After all, everyone else knew what Danny was doing. I didn't feel any compassion for her, Rosemary, Gertie or anyone else in the story. I also didn't feel like any of the characters were developed. Binchy spends a lot of time telling us what Ria is baking or what Rosemary is wearing, but we never get an insight into what any of them are thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant book, but not captivating-lacked depth of character","review":"The premise and story behind this book were very pleasant; however, it was \\"lightweight\\". I didn't get the feeling that I \\"knew\\" the characters like you do in many books. I'm not even sure what they really looked like via the book. There were many characters, a lot of switching back and forth via story lines (think soap opera) and a general vagueness of the characters. When something happy/sad/pleasant happened, you didn't \\"feel\\" it; it was quite generic. It was a very long book with nothing really to bite into. Also, there was a question/situation that was alluded to, but was never answered. I won't be reading this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worthy of Oprah","review":"Having read some of Maeve Binchy's earlier books, I was surprised that Oprah would choose one; having read this book, I'm even more surprised. This was a fluffy, mildly entertaining book with plot developments which could be seen a mile away (did anyone not know who rosemary's lover was the entire time?). The lack of attention to detail was annoying (Americans do not use the phrase \\"have a lie-down\\" to take a nap, a 16 year old boy would not look in the refrigerator and comment on the \\"lovely quiche\\". The editor should have caught these.) Not bad for a beach read, but not worthy of discussion."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh ria..have some self respect","review":"didnt like it... characters very predictable..very mundane....i liked nothing...sorry..and that Ria i wanted to give her a good shake and tell her to get real..."},{"rating":"2","title":"By a Woman for Women","review":"I try and read most of the Oprah Book Club picks. This is good fiction and worth reading, but it is not great or one of my favorites. It is enjoyable and definitely a cut above most story lines written to appeal to women. I thought the main character and her life description about living on Tara Road, a shabby turned chic area were very interesting. The wife's mixed emotions about her husband's ambition were great. It also develops the friendship theme and our main character has some true good friends whose characters are also well developed. Definitely worth giving a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"For us Irish Americans","review":"Attracted first by the New England/Ireland connection, I found that this novel's appeal is the two women, Ria and Marilyn and their relationships with husband, children, other family members, and friends. One woman is outgoing and sure of her life (only to be devasted by her husband's betrayal); the other woman keeps to herself, grieving the loss of her teenage son to the point that she keeps his bedroom as it was when he was alive. They trade lives, as it were, when the Ria goes to Connecticut and Marilyn goes to Dublin. I love the telling of the strengths and weaknesses of these women, the children (and their astute understanding of the adult world), the husbands, Ria's mother, and the friends (some whacky, some tragic). Maeve Binchy has given us some great characters to relate to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you enjoy reading soap operas?","review":"Ms. Binchy is a good story-teller and a \\"could-be better\\" writer than what she has shown in this book. I have read quite a few of her previous books and enjoyed The Lilac Bus and Silver Wedding, especially.Unfortunately Ms. Binchy succumbed to the modern-day and, far too prevalent, \\"paid by the number of words written\\" syndrome. Having struggled through more than 400 of its 500+ pages, I do plan to finish this book. I'll at least credit Ms. Binchy with her above-average storytelling ability. As she tells her story involving a multitude of characters, she also turns the story into a soap opera: who's having an affair with whom, will the abused wife get away from under her husband's alcoholic rage .... Like any good soap opera, \\"we want to know\\"! And like any good soap opera, the stories must go on and on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Millenium Book - by lucky chance","review":"On my way back from a wonderful family Christmas in Washinton DC I bought a couple of books at Dulles Airport to fill in the long flight to Denmark - and the following jetlag days.Tara Road is my first, but definately not last Maeve Binchy book. Through two days and nights I laughed,cried and enjoyed these Irish - American everyday characters. Tara Road could quite well be a small road in Denmark, as well - and the Irish characters are quite similar to Danish everyday people. I hope to find a new MB book soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't get to the next page fast enough","review":"This was my first Maeve Binchy book and I must admit I could not put it down. She brings the characters to life and keeps the plot going with short sections passing back and forth between the characters. However, I was very disappointed in the ending and only hope it was left the way it was because there is going to be Tara Road II. So much was left unsaid. Did Ria ever know her husband was her best friends lover. What did Ria say when she found out Mona had saved her beloved Tara road house? I felt cheated, let's hope there is a Tara Road II"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tara Road","review":"Tara Road was quite a disappointment. I had heard wonderful things about Ms. Binchy and was excited for a good summer read for our book club. Though the book kept my interest (I wanted to know what the point was so I read it through) I was sorry to see, there was not much of a point.The characters were dry and not very likeable. Now I am wondering what we will disucss at book club. Perhaps the lack of interest, or smarts these women have in this book. It was a sad commentary on women who couldn't figure out what to do with themselves and are happy just living for their men. I would not recommend this book, pass it on and find another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"This book was too long - you're halfway through the book before anything really happens. And then when something does happen, its incredibly predictable and stereotypical of the characters that for some reason took 300plus pages to introduce.I was expecting a truly great story being that this book was selected for the Oprah Book Club - but man oh man! Was I ever wrong! I have no idea how they would let this piece of fiction in there!The characters were boring, the story was boring. Everything in the book took way too long to develop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too predictable, simple, light","review":"I couldn't wait to finish this book, just so I could get it out of the way. 500 + pages of knowing what's going to happen is just too much. But, if you are looking for a light read, this is the one. The idea of house and culture switching held some promise, but was not nearly as interesting as it could have been. This book is no, \\"Mother of Pearl.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly compelling, I could not put it down.","review":"Maeve Binchy has made me fall in love with Ireland. Her characters are so well developed; her story lines so interesting and her writing style is magnificent. Each time I read one of her books I enjoy it more. TARA ROAD is no different. The characters could be us or our friends or neighbors dealing with problems that are so prevalent in our society: financial; infidelity; alcoholism. A great read with noteworthy characters most of whom will remind you of yourself or someone you know. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maeve Binchy never lets you down","review":"This book had me hooked from start to finish. Everytime a new book by this author is printed, you think you have reached 'the best one yet' but she goes on to surprise you every time! The characters come to life and you feel like you are sharing their lives, problems and dreams. Maeve has the best grasp of 'getting into the characters' of any author I have ever read. The only complaint I have is that the ending comes too soon and leaves you waiting with baited breath for the 'next one'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Binchy, But Strangely Dark","review":"As is typical with Maeve Binchy, I couldn't put this book down, but I was left oddly disappointed when I was done. I felt as though I never got to know the main character and I was dissapointed in her doormat behavior towards her philandering, deceitful, spineless husband. How I wished she had stood up to him or even realized that she was better off without him. I know if I want happy endings I could always read Danielle Steele, but this book and its characters were strangely depressing. Not one of my favorites, I'll reserve that for Evening Class and Echoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"Mediocre, Mediocre and again Mediocre.

It is not that it's bad, it's just not very good. The author does not seem to have a story to tell. The characters are not very interesting. Its difficult to stay engaged.

Unfortunately, these characters are merely caricatures; so one-dimensional, unchanging and unsympathetic, you hardly care what becomes of them. All I could think about while reading it was \\"Why was this chosen for the Oprah Book Club?\\" I was certain it would eventually get better, or have some kind of creative, impactful ending, so I hung in there.There was nothing. No worse than your average Danielle Steel, or romance novel, but when you are expecting something more (due to Oprah's stamp of approval) it is a big disappointment.P.S. I had just finished reading the wonderfully descriptive \\"White Oleander\\" which may explain my disappointment. When Binchy referred to Rosemary's apartment for the third time, so tritely, as \\"something out of a magazine\\" I thought I'd faint!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tara Road by Maeve Binchy","review":"I could not stop reading this book.

Written from the view point of a child it will draw you in as the tragedy unfolds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffin Quilt","review":"The Coffin Quilt tells about The Hatfield's and McCoy's Feud. This book takes place in 1882. Its narrator is Fanny McCoy; she is the little sister of Roseanna McCoy. Roseanna is the Juliette in this book because she falls in love with Johnse Hatfield. But things don't work out the way they plan. They want to get married, but they can't because of Johnse Hatfield's dad. The time she spends at Johnse's dad's house is not a waste of time, because she has to finish this quilt called \\"The Coffin Quilt.\\" Roseanna's dad said \\"Don't put any of the McCoy names on the quilt.\\" If you want the ending you have to read the book. My favorite part of the book is when I finished the book because it was a good book throughout the book. I recommend this book to people that like interesting and love story books, and the book tells you about West Virginia and Kentucky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roseanna Mccoy","review":"The Hatfield and the McCoy feud has allways interested me, so when I heard about this book, I had to read it.The sister of Roseanna, Fanny McCoy has lived with fear and anger ever since that day in 1878 when a dispute with the Hatfields over the owenership of a few pugs that set her family on a path of hatred and revenge. But that is not all, in 1882, Rosenna runs off with Johnsie Hatfield, the hatred between the two clans explode. In real life, yes Roseanna did run off with Johnsie, she became pregnant, and Johnsie never married her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not what I expected.","review":"This is a good introduction to the Hatfield McCoy fued, but I should have paid more attention to the Amazon product guide and other reviewers (it's a young adult read, and well, I'm not a young adult). I was in a hurry and wanted a Hatfield McCoy book and also wanted to get free shipping on my order so popped this modestly priced book into my cart. Having said that, I am reading it, and enjoying it, but this is not for me a detailed account of the events of this fued. It is written from the perspective of a young girl--Roseanna McCoy's sister Fannie, and I'm not sure how much is fact and how much is fiction. I recently researched other more pricey Hatfield McCoy books on Amazon, and opted to buy The tale of the devil--a biography on Devil Anse. Like I said this is a good \\"light\\" read of this famous American feud, but leaves alot of holes in the story for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, love, love!","review":"This is the first book I have read since high school.

It is an Appalachian \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" story in the setting of the 1880's mountainous terrain of eastern Kentucky and West Virginia involving the Hatfield and McCoy conflict. Being of Appalachian heritage myself I find this is another well written and well researched Ann Rinaldi story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Relationships Behind the Feud","review":"I am a big Ann Rinaldi fan. My favorite is Girl in Blue. Unfortunately, I couldn't get into this book. Being thee feud between the Hatfields and the McCoys I expected more action and suspense. This novel was more centered on relationships and emotional and daily struggles. Not one of Ann Rinaldi's best books. I can't see a boy finishing this book. I think the interesting subject matter could have been presented in a more engaging way. However, her characters felt real and were well developed as always."},{"rating":"1","title":"ummm","review":"If you really like books that have family fueds, killing, and a little bit of drama...this is it!

It is probably a bit short for thePanasonic DMC-GH1 12MP Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Camera with 1080p HD Videodue to the longer 14-140mm lens that ships with the GH1.The TLZ 10 bag is smaller than theLowepro Topload Zoom Mini Camera Bag (Black). In addition, it has two pouches inside the front pocket that conveniently hold extra batteries and memory cards. The TLZ Mini lacks these pouches but does have a somewhat larger front pocket than the TLZ 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect bag","review":"Just like most of Lowepro bags, it's very professionally made.

I was barely able to fit in there a small tripodZeikos ZE-TR5A Flexible Tripod, an SD card and 4 spare batteries.

But, I found some flaws in this book compared with previous series. First, this story was about 1 year after Cain and Jade's story (Guardian Angel). But, this book hints that Nathan's been Pagan for more than 1 year. If you read Guardian Angel, you will know how long Nathan's been Pagan. Second, Nathan's sister Jade was not married to the Earl of Cainwood. If you see other series (Guardian Angel and Castle), it says Cain is a Marquess not an Earl. But overall it was a good read and fun too."},{"rating":"2","title":"hilarious and heart rending","review":"If you are a romantic at heart, as I am, you will love this story.

I found the character of Sara to be sweet and lulling. I found myself impressed by her quiet inner strength and hidden capabilities and thoroughly enjoyed as the tenderhearted, unspoiled heroine came into maturity. What I loved most was that Sara was far from perfect and her husband Nathan loved that quality about her. It was refreshing to read a story in which the woman isn't a cliche hellion or a typical paragon of virtue turned wild by true love. Even as she grows and harsh reality lashes out at her, Sara remains trusting and honest. Even her cynical husband Nathan revels in her honest reactions when they make love. Throughout the novel, Sara remains Sara."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of time to read!!","review":"The lead woman charater was WORTHLESS!!!!!!!

The hero was a jerk, who did not care about how his bride felt and liked embarrasing her, and the heroine is one of the biggest fluffheads I have ever read about. She sets out to demand a courtship from her husband and a period of time to get to know him better, and she ends up listing off her good points to him and trying to sell herself to him like a chunk of meat.

The characters were like every other Garwood character - the naive female with a \\"sprinkle of freckles on her nose\\" and a giant brute of a man who is \\"well-muscled and stands a head above every one else.\\" The plot was the same - two people from different backgrounds fighting each other and eventually falling in love, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sara seemed a bit dumb and overly whiny for the typical Garwood heroine - what kind of idiot would go about untying ropes on a ship (and how would she have the strength to do that anyway?)? She drove me nuts!I really do love Garwood books, though. I would highly recommend Honor's Splendour and The Prize because of their sweeter plots and characters. I particularly liked Royce in The Prize because he wasn't typically handsome and didn't think himself much of a catch, but Nicholaa saw past all that and loved and chose him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I enjoyed The Castle and The Secret but this book was a let down because of the heroine's lack of character. In one scene, Sara was trying to prevent Nathan from killing the pirates who attacked them because she believed that Nathan did not have to stoop to the level of the pirates. However, in another scene, she discovers her aunt in bed with an elderly gentleman, and because it is \\"not the proper thing to do\\" she holds a pistol in her hand, with the intention to shoot the man.

The writing did not even resemble Garwood's normal prose. The sentences were short and choppy. The dialog between the two main characters was bland and lacked any real chemistry.

I have only read a few select books of hers, but the gift has got to be number one. I just loved it from first page to the last. Nathan was a hero to the first degree and any red blooded woman would be crazy not to want a man like him. Julie garwood puts the most into her characters and never dissapoints with the end product.

From the historical viewpoint, however, it tends to romanticize the characters in a way which only adds to the myths that have surrounded them since their tragic deaths. Ambrose unfairly maligns General Crook. He also reiterates an oft-told tale about Frank Grouard's participation in Crazy Horse's death which smacks of the same sort of conspiracy theories that have plagued the Kennedy assassination and misled many Americans about that event.

What makes the Little Big Horn interesting in \\"Crazy Horse and Custer\\" is that after 21 chapters the reader is so ready for the fight and yet not without utter dismay when it's over. There will be no rematch! This book combines their engaging character traits with a crash course in the history of the West. Culturally speaking, this book is generally even handed. Both societies are examined and revealed in their greatness and folly. This is the best and most accessible place to start when studying the Indian Wars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling history, a really good read","review":"Crazy Horse and George Custer were leaders. They led by example, they led by acclamation, and they led driven by a desire to shape the future of their people. They lived their lives in parallel until the fateful day when they met on the grassy hills of the Little Big Horn. A meeting that was a significant historical mark in the final closing chapter of the free Indian nations in what is now the territory of the United States. Steven Ambrose offers again one of his masterful historical tales in a compelling read. George Custer's legend is well earned. He was a larger than life individual. Crazy Horse most likely wanted to raise a family, but the events of his day precluded a peaceful life. Ambrose captures the spirit and style of their lives while retelling the history. Forget watching the fanciful movies. This book is another creation that only Steven Ambrose could create - a history book that is as compelling a read as the best action thriller novel. ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Tragedy","review":"Historical writing doesn't get much better than this.In parallel chapters, Ambrose presents the story of these two warriors, from their births to their final tragic meeting at the Battle of the Little Big Horn.Of course we know how the story ends, but it is still a fascinating study of these two great men, both fighting for what they believed in.What makes the tragedy even more profound is that we see so many places along the way where a different choice by one or the other of them could have resulted in a different outcome.If you want a good understand of the troubled relationships between whites and Indians at this time, this is a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the Best Ambrose Offers before Lewis & Clark","review":"Very well written account of Crazy Horse and the \\"crazy\\" attitudes of the US Government (big surprise---some things never change). Ambrose gives a detailed account of how each man came to be iconic---warts and all. Very well written---a page turner. I must admit, while I admire Ambrose and his significant contributions to the D-Day Museum, the accusations of plagiarism have kept me from reviewing his books---once these accusations appeared, I removed his books from my list---satisfied that the ones already read were enough.All that to say, when my son, who graduated from college last year asked me what historical books I valued---this one made the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death in Battle - Death in Peace","review":"They are books like those written by Stephen Ambrose which keep the flame of my interest in reading of times and events of long ago burning. Some have accused Ambrose of taking too many liberties with the facts. To those I would say, Bah Humbug! This book is well written and worthy of the readers time, unless, of course, you are a \\"fact-checker\\", in which case the original sources, to the extent they even exist, might be more to your liking. For Orginary Joe's, like me, Mr. Ambrose has provided a good deal of reading entertainment and information. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be transported in time and place to the high plains during the Indian Wars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy Horse and Custer was well balanced and fascinating","review":"Crazy Horse & Custer is a riveting double protrait of two of America's most intriuging warriors. I found the story to read much like a novel, with high drama, moments of humor and poignancy. I was particularly impressed with Ambrose's balanced critique of both Crazy Horse and Custer. He neither over-idealized the Sioux lifestyle nor glamorized Custer, but made fair criticques of both men while remaining non-judgemental. I read this book in about a two weeks and could not put it down. I loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Clearly, this book is not Ambrose's finest work. It added nothing new to the library of books written about these two characters; rather, Ambrose's portrayal was fatalistic, over-romanticized, unrealistic, and in places, inaccurate. If you are looking for information about Custer, Crazy Horse, and the Little Bighorn, there are much better sources.I've given the book two stars, but only because Ambrose deserves the benefit of the doubt -- this was one of his earlier works and his later titles, including \\"Undaunted Courage\\", \\"Band of Brothers\\", and \\"D-Day\\" are excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Easy Read","review":"Very good book that is true to the Ambrose style of writing - very easy and enjoyable to read. Ambrose has the luxury of having 130+ years of research and writing to reference yet the story, as told, is not mired in minute, inconsequential fact. Ambrose provides his opinion (in the final chapters he includes a short analysis/AAR of the battle at the Little Big Horn) in many instances yet it's not distracting nor does it detract from the telling of history - as a historian, that is what Ambrose was paid to do. His description doesn't glorify either Crazy Horse or Custer without balancing his portrayal with measured criticism.As an ancillary benefit, this book describes the events surrounding Custer's activities in Kansas prior to his march to Montana. As a Kansas native, I found that to be extremely interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"CRAZY HORSE AND CUSTER","review":"This excellent text truly \\"compares and contrasts\\" the worlds and lives of two very similar men. I've learned many things about the Oglala Sioux culture, ranging from their ways of child rearing to their methods of warfare.In addition to the thorough telling of numerous steps, missteps, lucky outcomes and blunders one would expect in such a book, Stephen E. Ambrose weaves a masterful tapestry of the period studied and the men created by these times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read, entertaining history!","review":"I really enjoyed this book! In my opinion, much better than his WW2 book, \\"Band of Brothers\\" I am unfamiliar with US western history & this account left me wanting to know more. Ambrose deals with both central characters with an admirable objectivity. Rare in this type of \\"comparative\\" history. The war & battle sequences are described in a clear & exciting manner. The heavier political, social, historical developments are presented without detracting from the entertaining & fast moving account. Ambrose has a tendency towards a delivery that is occasionally too melodramatic & an over useage of colloquial language that seems slightly inappropriate for a serious history. Over all I found the book very well researched, gripping & an absolute delight to read. Highly recommended for lovers of military history. Deduct one star rating for the inclusion of the worst, smallest & almost uninterpretable maps I have encountered in print. Why did you let this happen Mr. Ambrose?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent work by Ambrose","review":"Stephen Ambrose was one of the truly stand-out historians of the 20th Century. His was a very able writer that treated a variety of subjects and events with depth and understanding. I have found his work to always be very interesting, easily understood, and well written. There have been some disparaging criticisms made about his work and some of his statements over the years, but I have not let those things diminish my enjoyment of his work. In fact, whenever I find myself curious about some new facet of American history, I look first to see if Ambrose wrote about it. If you are interested in finding out more about how 'Custer's last stand' came to occur, this is an excellent place to start!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes more \\"concurrent\\" than \\"parallel\\"","review":"This was a good read with interesting historical background about the lives of Custer and Crazy Horse without focusing on the Little Big Horn (just one chapter). There are plenty of other books that examine that action in great detail. Some of the historical context and information related to other tribal and US government leaders was as interesting as the Custer/Crazy Horse analysis. In fact, I think there were cases where an attempt to draw parallels between the two required some imagination. Just because they lived during the same period of history doesn't necessarily lend itself to parallels, but it's more of a complaint about the title than the content of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Non-WWII Book by SEA","review":"This is my first non-WWII Stephen Ambrose book I've picked up. Being a fan of his other work, I thought I would give it a shot and definitely was not disappointed.What is significant about this too is that I am not a huge Civil War or Indian-fighting book fan.Ambrose does well to paint a world in wonderful detail so you feel like you are right next to the two men the whole time. Though I'm not sure how much I buy into it, I can definitely appreciate his \\"President Theory\\" for the death of Custer. He definitely did make Custer seem less like the fool the media has made him out to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen Ambrose Delivers Again","review":"Crazy Horse and Custer is an extraordinary story told by the late historian Stephen A. Ambrose. Ambrose does an excellent job of showing the paralel lives of these two historical figures and warriors of the nineteenth century. As with his other novels Mr. Ambrose did a great job of telling their story without hype, just relying on factual acounts, many unknown to me prior to reading their story, to re-enforce his story. No fluff, no hype, just the facts, allowing the reader to draw his own conclusions regarding the subjects. A fantastic historical journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"This is one of the best books I have read recently. It gave me a lot of insight about the Indians and the white man during this time in history. Well written and easy to read. I didn't want to put the book down and have recommended it to many people. Even bought a copy for my sister."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy Horse and Custer","review":"I liked the parts about Crazy Horse better than I did the parts about Custer.

I suppose I would regard it much higher had I not made the happy mistake of reading Connell's \\"Son of the Morning Star\\" first. That book is much better both in content and writing. This is just another \\"Last Stand\\" book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A misleading picture of 19th century America","review":"I was looking for a good historical understanding of Crazy Horse and Custer and what drove the two to a such disasterous confrontation. I'm still looking and very unsatisfied with his analysis of 19th century institutions and morals."},{"rating":"2","title":"sad and beautiful at the same time","review":"I am in the process of reading this book right now - I keep having to stop because some parts are so sad and disturbing that I just can't continue .... but other parts are so cute and touching, like reading about their pet deer named Abby Road. I hope that Meg will write a children's book about that deer one day. Ms. Tilly is a very talented writer and I think she would have been published with or without her fame from the movies. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who enjoys memoirs although much of the material is about severe child neglect and abuse and can be very hard to bear reading and thinking about afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Singing Songs","review":"Awesome book.

Children are so much more resilient than we give them credit for. Parents such as these who are self-absorbed and narcissistic are all too common. Fortunately, most such as Anna are forgiving. The unknown is far too frightening. Anna is a survivor and will prove to either be just like her mother or the opposite. Meg has struck a cord in this former social workers heart.

It took me a while to get into it but then I think it was right after the first duel in the book that I decided I wasn't going to be putting this book down for a while.There seems to have been a lot of the sentiment that \\"The U.S history we were taught is a lie,\\" back in the turbulent 1960's.

It contains alot of photographs and drawings. It truly is a field guide not an encyclopedia. Although, there were times when I desired more information to identify trees first hand, I can't imagine how it could be fit into this pocket size volume. The only complaint I would have would be the photograph size since, they are about 2x3 inches they don't always show enough for identifying purposes. However, the book would have to be much bigger if the photographs were larger, size and cost would definitely increase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it could be!","review":"If you like having color plates in your field guide this one is not for you. I found it difficult to work with and hard to find information I needed. For a field guide it has too much written information looking to list various tees but not enough total tree information. For instance, the buds and leaves are shown but not the tree bark or the silhouettes with each. Silhouettes are provided for types but not referenced for the various species. One has to jump around with the guide looking for information on the same specie of tree. For identifying species in the field the book falls far short. Color plates are a limited number of diagrams and sketches instead of photos, a major weakness. On a positive note, greater emphasis in locating species with maps showing growth locations is provided."},{"rating":"2","title":"The illustrations are too pretty, the system is too cumbersome","review":"As a novice tree identifier in New York City, I wish the book's classifications were more easily located and included more variant names. There is at least one popular tree known variously as the Chinese Scholar Tree and the Japanese Pagoda Tree which does not appear, and, although Florida is filled with wonderful trees, I shall make every effort never to get to Florida to see them and I would have liked more space devoted to the rest of the East and less to Florida. I am certain many people love to identify winter trees by their buds, but I am not one. Although the illustrations are very exciting to look at and very vital, they would be better in a Disney film. I have a local guide which uses photographs and I wish the Peterson Guide used them as well. The most useful segment of the guide is the tree silhouette section."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cool, but flighty","review":"This phone is very very cool in its functionality.

I also used the book to make some decisions on some of the framing techniques I wanted used in the house and I was able to use it as a reference to show my framers what I wanted.

You sense Christoff trying to get his teeth into something that isn't really there. To try to make this opera seem a star vehicle, the first half is brutally filleted; some of the cuts really jar, particularly when the compact 6 min Overture is here reduced to 3. Christoff is is commanding, but the rest of the cast are not - Schippers whisks things along in a lively, but cavalier fashion, but much detail is obscured by the slightly boomy and confused recording. That this opera can work, and contains powerful choral music as well as a host of minor character vignettes, is proved by Gergiev and his Kirov forces on Philips, released under the works real title, 'The Maid of Pskov'.

Every step was agony. I healed it in 15 minutes by focusing on the Lord's Prayer, and on God's presence and power. Next day I hiked 7 pain-free miles still carrying the pack.) Christian Science DOES work when correctly applied--which it is clearly obvious the author and his mother and their practitioner didn't do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is my Violin?","review":"In my opinion, Volume Two is a much better DVD than Volume One. Again, the DVD has a limited amount of episodes, only four. But the quality of these episodes is much greater.Episode One is a re-enactment of a Jack Benny radio show from 1953. The transition between the TV and radio program falls very nicely. Episode Two is a classic with Humphrey Bogart playing \\"babyface\\" Bogart, a crook and is being questioned by who else? Captain O'Benny. Episode Three is a celebration of Don Wilson's 27th anniversary working for Jack. I wonder if he will ever get paid? And, Episode Four includes a performance by Liberace. Not the most comedic episode and probably my least favorite of the group but the other three make up for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video Set","review":"This DVD has 4 shows - and they are absolutely hilarious - I've watched this several times already and it's incredible.

I bought it while living in Belize, where specialty ingredients are scarce, and I was cooking all the time. Every single recipe I have made from this book (and I've made a few!) turned out perfect and amazingly tasty the very first time. The authors and testers have clearly done their work well. This book is worth buying for the (very-simple-to-prepare) Korean spinach salad recipe alone. People who *hate* spinach will love it! Hope you enjoy this cookbook as much as I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nicely done","review":"This is a lovely cookbook and general user-friendly guide to world conditions.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extending the Table","review":"This book is a nice addition to the More-For-Less Cookbook published by the Mennonite community. In addition to the recipes for economy-conscience people, it includes cultural sketches from around the world that are interesting and informative. I find that it is raising my awareness of how other world communities live that are differant from my own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just \\"Christian moralizing\\"","review":"All the recipes in this book are delicious, clear, and exciting, as the other reviews amply cover, but the anecdotes and essays and quotes are equal treasures. While the book is written from a missionary-Christian POV, I found it meaningful and touching as an agnostic sort-of-Jew, and never felt proselytized or talked down to, and it never seemed like the many different faiths and cultures of the people contributing the recipes were being disrespected. So don't let the fear of evangelizing put you off of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great choice for a wedding gift, or for any lover of international flavor and easy cooking!","review":"This is the ideal cookbook for people who love international flavors but are put off by cookbooks that seem to feature nothing but impossible to find ingredients. These are authentic recipes from all over the world that have been tested and adapted for the American kitchen by Mennonite cooks, most from Pennsylvania and the Midwest. Plus, in the tradition of their classic More with Less cookbook, this volume consists of simple, easy-to-follow (and impossible to mess up) recipes that emphasize frugality and healthier eating (more whole grains, legumes, fruits and veggies, less meat, and less strain on budgetary and planetary resources). I have given this book as a gift MANY times, and although I now cook from many more specialized international cookbooks, I still find myself returning here for indispensable favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Read!","review":"Caught from the beginning in a tightly woven murder mystery set in the quaint town of Indian Creek, Texas, I found Shadows Are Deadly a compelling read. Beautifully cast, homegrown characters add vibrancy to the colorful local imagery that Ms. Morris expertly creates. Easy, fast-paced dialogue and excellent action scenes whisk the reader swiftly from chapter to chapter. The plot is well constructed and the suspense is kept full-tilt right up until the grand finale. Shadows Are Deadly will leave you with that warm sense of satisfaction that only a good mystery can give. It will also leave you with a strange nostalgic feeling that, for one brief moment, you were part and parcel of that unique, untrammeled soft, sweet culture of pure country Texas. A wonderful read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Need Better Packaging","review":"As you can see by other customers reviews of this type of equipment Amazon has a problem they need to adress.

I was especially pleased with the service I got from Amazon. The bike came in a box that was not strong enough for this piece of equipment and was pretty banged up when it got here. The computer on the bike was broken and the tools and hardware for assembly were missing. I notified Amazon and they had another bike here in two days and paid for the shipping of the old one back.

This 203 Schwinn recumbent has been excellent. It is clearly a quality product, very quiet. The seat is supportive and comfortable, so I do not need to use my hands to steady myself. Thus I have begun doing arm lifts and such while I ride, for a more complete workout. I am a short 5 foot 2 1/2 inches, but on the closest seat setting, I can reach the pedals fine. Anyone much shorter or with very short legs might have problems reaching. Also, it is not the 'walk-through' kind, so you must be able to lift your leg over the center section to use it. I wish it had a brighter or lighted digital readout, and that it would read my pulse with only one hand on the side sensors, but those are small problems. I recommend it highly and would choose it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!","review":"The bike had very easy to follow directions and took a little over an hour to assemble.

Even though you could possibly save $100 and get a cheaper brand, it just isn't worth it. I completely agree with this reviewer. For an extra hundred dollars, you get so much more.

As for the quality of air, I did not notice any difference even though I had to clean them every couple of weeks. The small ones for the bathroom also hissed even when clean, I just threw them out. Save your money and buy something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"I sleep better at night with the Ionic Breeze","review":"We received an Ionic Breeze for Christmas several years ago from my parents. I put it in the largest room in the house and let it run constantly. We had carpet at this time. For a dust remover, it's very poor. It just simply doesn't have the air volume or dust collection capacity. That's what your central air unit is for - with close to four square feet of filter or more.As an air purifier it's excellent. I removed all the carpet in our house, installed fake wood floors, and moved the unit to my bedroom. I can get at least three or four weeks between cleanings - even with a cat. The lack of carpet really cut down on the dust in the house and the I.B. in my room helps me sleep better at night.* My unit is silent unless it's dirty.* It has three speeds but I wonder who runs it on anything but max?* It claims to only use a few watts - I haven't put a meter on it yet.* I would probably never pay this much for an air cleaner unless I was (more) wealthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consumer Reports Second Worst Rating","review":"Of 19 models of air cleaners tested, the Ionic Breeze came in second to last place, along side the Honeywell \\"Environizer\\" (another electro-static model), in terms of performance.Tested at it's higest operating level against the top 2 air cleaners: the Friedrich C90A and the Whirlpool AP45030HO, both of the top performers move over 25 times the air ON THEIR LOWEST SETTINGS. Further testing revealed these air cleaners to be almost completely silent on their lower settings and using only as much power as a lightbulb.In my opinion, you should steer clear of the Ionic Breeze, not only for perfornace issues, but because it the price to manufacture these units is about 1/20 what they're charging.

The author skillfully develops the characters and patiently allows them to grow and unfold, much as we do in life. It has an uplifting message that we all have so much control over our own lives just with our internal 'magic.'Though the Yorkshire accent takes a bit to get accustomed to reading, it ads a richness to the story that is already a feast for the imagination. One thing I have found I really enjoy about reading on the Kindle is the lack of pictures, which allows one to form wonderful illustrations in our own minds.I somehow never read this as a child or a teen, so this was my first reading. I am now 58 but work with elementary age children every day. I plan on having a bibliotherapy group with 4th and 5th grade students next school year centered around this book.

I remember holding the lovely green book and getting ready to dive into a treasure trove. After all I had seen the movie and I enjoyed the movie, The Little Princess...so I felt like I knew what I was getting into at 8 or 9...Well I don't know if anyone elso felt this way but the central character is a spoiled bratt as is her cousin. That is bareable, but the way the author refers to the natives of India and to the servants in England tends to be negative. I clinched my teeth at the tone that was echoic of Mary herself and put the book down.Maybe it was because I had parents who drilled history into me and tuned me to notice biases current in different eras and societies? No matter how I sensed it, I just thought to put that out there as food for thought.

It had bearly any excitment, pretty much the only that was really exciting was when Mary found the key and finally opened the Secret Garden. Besides that, the story just didn't really flow.

You should have made tthe main character a little more exciting, daring, and adventurous. I know that Martha speaks Yorkshire, but it was so confusing to try and interpret what she was trying to say and it made me just want to skip iover what she was saying. Iknow that you won\`t liuke this review, but the book could have been more action packed. Thankyou!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this book...","review":"This is supposed to be a classic? Not with these three obnoxious lead characters. Take a bratty girl, have her meet up with her obnoxious, long-lost, sickly cousin and throw in an intolerably polite green thumb, write them in a story about a garden that the Hunchback of Notre Dame locked away because it reminded him of his deceased wife, and write in the most annoying, condescending style imaginable. Then sell it and have people call it a classic. Oh yeah, have I mentioned that the dialouge is the worst I have ever read, the conflict is resolved in a childish, immature way, and the movie adaption isn't really much better? No? Okay, you just heard me say all that.If you want some good books...The Lord of the Rings TrilogyHarry Potter (Except maybe the fourth book)Eragon/EldestAngels & Demons/the Da Vinci CodeThe first three Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy books"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Secret Garden","review":"TheSecret gardenThis book was pure disappointment.This book was definitely not exiting and I can tell you why.First, people who like fun action packed books don't by this book.

This is a classic tale of rediscovering love and life after great loss. It is beautifully told, descriptive enough to see and smell the surroundings without getting bogged down in too many details.

This is the edition that I find myself giving these days. Yes, it's abridged but I don't see that as a problem. If a girl wants to read the full text that's available everywhere. But this is GREAT place to get them started. With ipods and audio everywhere, the girls I've given this to love the book. It's beautiful and they love the little illustrations.

With Mary's ever changing tempers and an ill boy, plus the almost magical garden that Mary falls upon, there is always adventure and surprise lurking around the corner. I was generally very happy with the quality of the writing, but it was a little slow at some points. I think that plenty of children and adults would enjoy listening to the audio book much more, because it is less slow when you can hear and identify the personality and voice changes, that is, if done by a good reader. I recommend this book for the age group of 3rd through 6th grade. I think that any younger, you'd be very lost, and any older you might be less interested.

She really enjoyed it and looked forward to reading the next chapter each night. It took us a while to read because I would stop often to explain what certain words meant and to discuss what was going on in the book to make sure she was following along. We would start out a new chapter by reviewing what had happened so far. I have found that her vocabulary has expanded greatly. I think it takes a lot for a young child to sit and listen to a chapter book but they gain so much from it. You just have to be careful to take it slow and not to overload them. I also know we can read this book over and over as she grows up and she will get more and more out of it.

I bought him the book and, of course, he was right. He ran across some words in the book that challenged him, and got frustrated for a time and set it aside. But, he came back to it and read it when I was close by so I could help here and there. I encouranged him to tell me what he discovered in the story that was not in the movie and he always acted like he had found a little treasure.

Our teacher read to us each afternoon after lunch and recess. I looked so forward to hearing the story each afternoon. My parents had just divorced and the story of Mary just took me away from the whole ordeal. I read it for myself in the seventh grade and it was like finding an old friend. After marrying and having a daughter I bought her a little paperback copy and then later comes my grandchildren and I found it on video. You see how it has been a lifetime companion. I wish our libraries had more of this type classic and I wish I could find a hardcover blue back like the one I read in seventh grade for my home library. The movie was very close to what I had imagined years before in that first grade class."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Secret Garden","review":"As enchanting a story as I remember from childhood.

This was her first chapter book and she resisted at first, but it went like gangbusters after that. It's lucky we read it over the summer because she wouldn't let me stop and we stayed up past her bedtime every night until we finished it. We loved Mistress Mary, and the contrary face the illustrator drew for her, gently metamorphing her into a sweet little girl. The abridgement is unnoticeable to me, who read it, or more likely, it was read to, at about the same age."},{"rating":"2","title":"No grownups allowed!","review":"I loved TSG as a girl. I'm surprised that young reviewers of today -- even the ones that liked the book -- don't cite the factors that made it my childhood favorite.1) Unhappy sallow girl sneaks off and transforms herself into glowing swan, while weak boy sneaks off and transforms himself into heroic athlete. (Isn't this every ugly duckling's fantasy?)2)Children escape into a kids-only world where no grownups rule over them.3)Children discover a magical wilderness where they can do what they want.4)Children forge a deep friendship and share a beautiful, mysterious secret which they carefully guard from the eyes of prying adults.I'm surprised to hear of sixth graders reading this book in class. I'm guessing today's sixth-graders are too sophisticated to appreciate the allure of a secret world. I would recommend the book to children the age of Mary and Colin: nine or ten years old. I think they'll be hooked and will love it forever, like so many others have since its publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book, incredible value","review":"This is a gorgeous copy of The Secret Garden, and the price is incredible.

The word \\"queer\\" appears hundreds of times, and I only hope I've convinced my daughter that it is no longer an appropriate word to call people. The book is endlessly repetitive, endlessly. I find it to be poorly written and can't believe we wasted our time & money on it. The movie version is quite a bit better.

It starts out like all books, like introducing the main characters and what happened to Mary, the main character. It talks about a spoiled brat, also known as Mistress Mary quit contrary, someone who couldn't dress herself and who barely got off her feet. Mary along with Dickon and Colin try to find the secret garden that they have heard much about.

It was so bad that after playing the game three times, the girls threw the game out because their were so few playing pieces left to dress up the dolls with.

It simply stopped playing and emitted a squeling tone like an impaled hamster. It never recovered and I've no idea why it suddenly packed up. The unit was never abused, never dropped, loaded 4 playlist changes via MusicMatch without incident and then on a sunny day in Austin decided to die. I believe it died because it isn't designed and built for reliability. Let's face it many MP3's were rushed to market without a lot of thought as to long-term customer satisfaction and less regard for quality. I thought the Nike unit was worth the [money] I paid.

The supplied software has been deliberately hobbled to force you to pay an extra $20, in a kind of reverse rebate plan.

I was a huge fan of the product until I took it out running in a pretty heavy rain storm, and it shorted out on me. It hasn't worked since. I think it's ridiculous that this sport mp3 player couldn't handle the rain. I would not buy this product again. If you do, do not take it out into the rain, it can't handle water."},{"rating":"1","title":"too temperamental","review":"I recently bought this player to use as a running companion for short 2-3 mile runs. I figured the 128 mb would hold plenty of music for that distance. I was innitially ecstatic at the quality and volume of sound (even if the software is a little tricky at first). after 3 weeks it has started to switch itself off every couple of minutes. I have formatted it several times with no success. Luckilly I had bought the replacement warranty and will be returning it first chance I get and trading in for the RIO Cali, which has gotten better reviews.After reading the bad reviews here I thought \\"no, this can't happen to me, the other people must be doing something wrong\\". However I have used this gadget by the book and the same thing is happening to this player as has happened to all the other reviewers.

I only use it 3-4 times a week during my 6-mile runs. When it is working it sounds great. However it crashes frequently and the memory becomes corrupted easily. I have had it replaced 3 times by Philips. I received my last one 6 weeks ago and it is already corrupted (it took 3 months to get the replacement) After working for an hour with the technician (located in Jamaica) they gave up. They will not replace this one because the warranty from the first one is now up. I have spent days over the past year (I was on hold for 4 hours once trying to get help) reformatting and installing firmware upgrades on this unit. I am computer savvy, but this is too much to me.

Headphones are pure garbage. They are those silly behind the head kind that bump the back of your neck when you run or do anything. They don't stay on.Finally, what is with the owner's manual being on disk?? If you have any questions you have to load the dumb thing, wait for the software to load, scroll thru the manual (which is in Adobe Acrobat) and try to find your answer.

But upon further perusing of this work, I began to notice incorrect information presented as fact. For example, the deer botfly does NOT fly at the stated high speed; that fanciful notion came from a quote by etymologist Charles H. T. Townsend. His absurd estimation was proven false by Irving Langmuir.I've also found information in this book that contradicts \\"facts\\" elsewhere in the book.

It is great to run with and holds plenty enough music to get me through a heart-pounding workout!If I had to say anything bad it would be that I don't care for the headphones. They don't fit in my ears that well at times and when running they have slipped out especially when I start sweating. So, I will replace those. Also, the remote thing it comes with is kind of wasteful. I have yet to use it.

I wouldn't know firsthand, though, because I never could get the driver software to install. The MusicMatch software installed quickly on Windows XP, but the drivers would not. After trying all of the updates from the Philips websites, and Firmware updates, still, nothing. This was all attempted by a network engineer who troubleshoots software and hardware installations for a living. I then attempted to use the Philips help line, but they were of no help at all.

The frustration of trying to install the music was hardly worth it so that you can only download about 14 songs! If you have Win 2000 or 98 and want something that will only last you a couple of months, this is the product for you.

From that short period of use, threads have come out and the hole surrounded with a metal ring (which is used to attach the pocket chain) has torn out from the wallet (not completely, but it will with extended use).Conclusion: A very good looking but impractical wallet, probably good enough for a kid who doesn't have much cards, has no use for a coin purse and who wouldn't use it very often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Power Pop blah...","review":"I instantly fell in love with the incredible catchy single \\"New Tokyo Is Calling\\". But like junk food, The Stereo is a bnad that at first you crave, and soon after you become quite sick of. The four chord power pop songs that are prevalent on this album (and others by the band) are songs that intriguing by their sheer simplicity, but eventually left me looking for something else. If you found the opening track off of Jimmy Eat World's latest album (Bleed American) wonderful and loveable, then this EP is right up your alley. If you long for something more complex and musically dense, move on. After a few more spins of this disc, I've gotta remove three of my original five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turn up the STEREO.","review":"The Stereo are emerging slowly into the underground rock/punk/indie scene and an explosion is just waiting to happen. The Stereo write guitar riffs that make you tap your foot and nod your head with a true sense of enjoyment. Their music strikes emotions of both happiness and sadness as they basically tell it how it is when it comes to relationships. The title track on this too short, 4 song EP, \\"New Tokyo is Calling,\\" sings hit song. But its so good that it will never be a hit song. Its a shame that such a good band writing both original music and lyrics is not at the forefront of rock today. The Stereo rose from the ashes of Animal Chin and the then defunct Impossibles. With power, passion and personal emotion, the Stereo have become a well rounded, tight sounding rock band with influences tinging their music from the likes of punk rock to oldies. Pick this CD up or you will be making a big boo boo for yourself and rock music today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good target for the price but not good for .44 mag","review":"Holds up great to 45, 40, and 9mm.

Anyone who is willing to immerse himself in this book will definitely acquire a good working knowledge of A & P. I found numerous chapters that were great starting points to motivate deeper study. For instance, the Chapter on Muscles is very useful. It provide views of each major muscle, along with a diagram that lists what type of motion the muscle creates, and it's origin & insertion points.

There are other horrors, as well, and they are very real. As with \\"The Descent\\", I didn't especially like the ending here, but the actors played their characters well. One of the best horror movies I've seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated Horror Film","review":"I had not read the book, in fact, I didn't even know what the movie was about. I was bored one afternoon, so decided to go to a matinee. The theater was almost completely empty and I wondered if I had wasted another $7 on a horribly boring/lame scary movie. I didn't. I loved this film. Considering that the only horror movies getting made are crappy remakes of classics and asian films, The Ruins was a breath of fresh air."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed emotions","review":"As soon as I saw the trailer, I couldnt wait to find the book. I was just about ready to order in when I had gone to visit my mother and found it in the trash. She said my sister had read it and immediately tossed it. I couldnt resist and went ahead and delved into it. Even though it was so predictable and stupid at times, I couldnt put it down and read it in 2 days. It read just like a movie (gratuitous sex scenes and all). Dumb dumb dumb. But on the other hand, I cant wait to see the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"An hour and a half poorly spent","review":"By the time this grisly, torture-porn flick is over, I found myself rooting for the killer vines to just kill the whole party and get it over with. I am rarely offended by violent or gory content, and I can't say that I was here, but the blood and violence was frequently gratuitous and usually unnecessary. I went into the film with low expectations, and the film merely confirmed those expectations. Acting is average, and effects are OK for those who don't lose interest after the first half hour. Fortunately, I was working on something on my laptop at the time, so I can at least count that hour and a half of my life as not being completely wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for true horror fanatics looking for a fix.","review":"The Ruins showed great promise when I first watched it, and it certainly did horrify and disgust me, but it failed in other ways. I didn't care a bit about any of the characters, so it didn't matter to me if they lived or died. The plot was a little flimsy (where did those particular plants come from? what made them act like that?), but they did stick to it pretty well, I think. And the effects were top-notch. But after watching it the one time, I haven't wanted to see it again, and one of the ways I know if I like a horror movie is if it leaves me wanting to watch it over to get all the nuances. This one just didn't to that. It was a one-time thing. I think more could have been done with the special effects, and the actors could have tried to build a little more rapport with each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected!!!","review":"Seriously, I didn't know if this was going to be a slasher, or with a supernatural. It turns out, it has possessed plants dragging people and getting beneath their skin. Whenever they have to cut the plants out of people, it was pretty gory and nerve-wracking! I wouldn't recommend THE RUINS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad book gets worse","review":"The film version of \\"The Ruins\\" is a classic example of \\"not as good as the book\\". Unfortunately, the book wasn't that great, either. By isolating the story in one small geographic area (really, just one \\"ruin\\"), writer Scott Smith increases the despair of his characters, but also limits where the narrative can go. The main antagonist lacks the sinister, deliberate quality that it had in the book, making it seem somewhat more incidental than the secondary antagonist(s). Without giving too much away, Smith never explains the theory of \\"why\\" they are trapped, as in the book, so it feels less satisfying. Ultimately, it gets the Hollywood treatment, with a different ending, the omission of a crucial character (his lines/actions are given to other members of an already large protagonistic cast), and a final feeling of \\"that's it?\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!","review":"I usually don't have the time or energy to write a review...but in this case, it is necessary. It takes a lot for me to HATE a movie. There almost always something that makes it ok...not in this movie. I want my hour and a half back. Trust me, everyone who gave it one star nailed it! Only one other movie ticked me off this bad: Hope Floats. The book is probably good. I enjoy books with this type of plot... the movie however tanks. It ruined my night. (pun intended)Avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book instead","review":"The book \\"The Ruins\\" by Scott Smith is a great horror story, full of menace and a sense of dread but the film version doesn't achieve this atmosphere. Although quite faithful to the book (Smith also wrote the screenplay), the filmmakers seem more interested in seeing how graphic they can get with the leg amputations and self-mutilation scenes. There are a few good creepy moments, like when the girls discover that the cell phone ringing is something else entirely, but those moments are rare. The acting is good and the sets are impressive but the movie isn't scary, which is what the main premise of a horror film should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a horror film should be","review":"I read many of the reviewer's comments, I pay attention to the negative reviews, as they are often helpful. In this case, I wouldn't agree. Stories that are confined to one location, often are too shallow and don't hold one's interest. This one starts out at a resort our group makes an ill planned excursion, ignoring a local's advise, sounds like young and dumb, huh? They arrive at the ruins, finding locals who know the secret and are bent on not letting anyone leave. The group makes it to the top, descends to the bottom, and real quick they learn what terror the locals fear. The use of killer plants is great, not an overdone plot. It ends in a classic horror film finale. There is enough scenery to make this entertaining for those of us that don't like a film shot in a proverbial box."},{"rating":"2","title":"quite a nice job","review":"I sometimes search for horror films in Amazon so I have a breif memory about this file so when I see this DVD i just bought it.I don't remember any of this film plotline so I had no expectations at all when I started watching it.Story turned out to be very sad, special effects were quite good, plays were good, especially whom called 'stace' in the movie, acted really up to the level. Of course the rest of the actors were not bad either.Funny thing is I watched this one and there was this 20 something year old girl beside me also watching (from China), she puked after several gore scenes... seems not many China people have experienced movies like, the thing, braindead, the fly, the beyond....;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Horror Flick","review":"Caught the film on HBO last night,I admit seeing the veins mimicing the sound of a cell phone and peoples screaming was crazy,but the whole plot of the movie and it's trying to scare viewers didn't work!

Unfortunately the decent build-up thruout the movie fizzled out once you find the vegetation is pretty much the gist of the horror. I wonder who decided to give the flower buds the ability to mimic speech? That was a sorta neato thing, but the fact that they only cried out certain phrases and the vines only moved at certain 'high drama' parts of the movie, made the whole fiasco feel like something a juvenile would have scripted! The actors made the whole thing mildly watcheable in spite of the goofiness, but there's no denying so much more could have been done within the fascinating lore of the Mayan world"},{"rating":"1","title":"YES, this movie is in RUINS.","review":"I've not read the book this film was based on. Despite that, I still find this movie delivers no suspense nor thrilling. There are a couple of scary scenes. For example, it's the scene where one of the girls cut off the flesh from her leg to get rid of the plants that had eaten it way into her body. The acting is below par. I do not feel sympathetic for the characters. The worse thing is the special effects. The devilish plants look fake.It's a typical bad B movie. I am glad my friend rented it for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book!","review":"Having read Scott Smith's book, \\"The Ruins\\" at least three times and listening to the audio CD as well, I was very disappointed with the movie version. The movie was loosely based on his wonderful and highly entertaining novel. I implore anyone who only saw the movie to do yourself a huge favor and read the novel. There were some engaging moments in the movie but they were few and far between. Rarely have I seen a movie veer so far away from the main story line of a novel. Perhaps \\"The Ruins\\" should have been a TV mini-series instead so that there would be adequate time for much needed character development. May there NOT be a movie sequel.

Some of this was laugh out loud funny as it's so over the top, I had to wonder who thinks of the stuff! :-D It's fairly well acted and the tension is there, but it has a rather abrupt ending and I felt it left a few questions unanswered.

A worthless one dimensional movie on every level. If you want the real deal... get \\"The Descent\\" which is a 5 star thrill ride of a movie. The Ruins is simply trying to ride on the back of The Descent's sucess. Check out the cover from The Descent and compare it to The Ruins. What a joke.

In fact, I watched the movie the same night I finished the book. What a letdown!!! The movie here can not come close to the silver screen of your imagination.What can I say? Though it started out following fairly closely to the story, it didn't take long for it to diverge. Much of what made reading the book so good was getting into the mind of each character. Plus-it seemed so much of what made the story so scary and fraught with tension was absent here.Of course, I could be too sensitive, having just finished up the 509 pg book which I'd read over 3 intense days.I did like to see the ruins fleshed out on the screen.

Your pulse quickens as these petulant, spoiled twentysomethings find themselves embroiled ever deeper in a nightmare from which they can never emerge. The movie, with its brilliant blue skies and gorgeous cinematography, lays bare the idiocy of the story, which at its best is in fact a well-paced sci-fi horror book, truly beyond description - and obviously beyond believability. Here on the big screen, with barely average actors, there are virtually no thrills beyond those which are placed there (cue the music; see the evil malicious vine dart up at the screen 3-d style! Scream!). The new Hollywood ending is laughable - it is a naked attempt to cash in on a quick sequel (please spare us).

This took me a good 5 listens until i started to jive with their whole deal- Funky electronica (though nothing new to you hard-core heads) combined with the monotone voices reminiscent of those good ol' electronica days. It's got a few spats of songs that'll knock your socks off, but nothing spectacular. Once you get around that \\"what am i listening to?\\" phase, 604 will suck you into the wonderful world of Ladytron."},{"rating":"2","title":"ummm,,,, yes--YES!!!","review":"If the beats' look of the 1950s were placed in the year 2050, this would be Ladytron's look. If the sound were made to emulate innocent truisms and hardcore, well, just general hardcore-ness, this would be Ladytron's sound. I love this band. I love the two lovely ladies of the group, and I never get tired of their sound. It's a mish-mash of Gang of Four bounciness, mixed with unabashed keyboard Korg sound, mixed with the android-angelic vocals of a 1960's style vixen. Love this. You can't not love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh and Cool!","review":"Love it. Most tracks are great. Highly recommended.

Progressions and rythms are very current. This is a great album- very interesting and very original. I'm 'remided' a bit of Atari Teenage Riot, Trans-X, Massive Attack, Visage, and Pizzicato Five, listening to it. I wouldn't rate any single track on this album below a 3 and most are 5's.

I was sadly disappointed beyond belief. This book did nothing for me except give me nightmares. If you respond well to intimidation and scare tactics as in worse case scenarios this book is a must have for you. Otherwise, it is a slow painful read with stories slanted toward those with the hardest struggles. Very little nutritional or alternative therapy information. The book is dull, outdated, and in general uninteresting. It's a really hard read. Maybe I got a bootleg copy but this book is nothing like the reveiws I read here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Essential!","review":"Many thanks to Nancy Hanger for outlining the things that a Lupus patient needs to know. She organizes the information in such easy bites that it doesn't overwhelm you. The explanations are clear and the information is valuable. So many doctors rely on information (or misinformation) based on what they learned about Lupus back in medical school twenty years ago. Even some rheumatologists dance around the diagnosis, the symptoms, what you should be told. Nancy Hanger spells it out clearly.If you are newly diagnosed, or even if you've had Lupus for a while, this is A Must Read. Thank you, Nancy Hanger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, friendly writing that explains this mysterious disease","review":"While I have not been diagnosed with Lupus, although the doctors suspect something autoimmune is occurring, I found this book very helpful concerning how to to live with a chronic illness. If indeed I am diagnosed with Lupus, I will have been glad to have read this book as it clearly explains how to live with this chronic illness that can affect so many body systems.I found particularly helpful the author's advice on how to manage and live with the malar (butterfly) rash. I've had this problem for sometime and reading her experience made me feel better as I knew I was not the only one who has had this happen. At least my rash occurred at home while her's occurred while attending a conference.Overall, this is a very helpful book that teaches about how Lupus affects different body systems; how to manage the symptoms and how to live with a chronic illness.Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Garage Fans","review":"This album has the street cred it so deseves.

I didn't discover the damage until I had already demolished the old box and started installing the new one. It functions OK without the one bracket and Amazon was good enough to give a price adjustment of 10% without going through the hassle of disassembling it and returning it, which was OK. The door sticks a little (bracket damage is on the other end, so that has nothing to do with this issue). Otherwise, it operates fine and for the price, it was worth the $. Better than spending hundreds of $ on those ugly square boxes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but far from good","review":"I liked the looks of this unit, plus it looked like it would be real easy to install on any post. But, the magnet to hold the door shut is placed in such a way that when the mail carrier tried to insert some of our weekly ad mailings (we get them two time weekly), they caught on the magnet and ripped. Larger items and the magnet closer do not like each other. I sent it back and am ordering something else. I cannot reccomend this mailbox to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product","review":"1. Entire top is plastic. Easily broken into. Turns yellow after weathering.2. After a couple of years, bottom and corners are completely rusted.3. Steel door is mounted on plastic brackets.

I guess any flat area would do-- and what's the difference? Right? Oh well. We were also supposed to ignore the palm trees that made their way into at least two scenes. Added on to that, was the obscene depiction of rural people. The director and writer really made no bones about their view of those of us who come from the South and Midwest;according to them, we are all a bunch of racists and hillbilly waste products(the characters played by John Favreau and Rory Cochran were straight out of the TOXIC AVENGER) I am guessing that not a whole lot of research went into the making of this opus. And as a result, we got a B movie disguised as an edgy, indie, arthouse flick, made by a cast and crew, who think they are just so hip and so enlightened. The truth is,all they really are is intellectually lazy, and socially unaware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks!

The global economy of the future will suffer from a plethora of people not a lack of them.

I'll tell you what, I'm so upset I missed \\"Stargate SG-1\\" show to see this nonsense! Stargate SG-1 has better effects.Rent this movie for the following three reasons:1. You are a film student and want to know how NOT to make a movie;2. You need a good laugh; or3. You have people over that you don't like and you want to get rid of them.

You will also hear him calling whites \\"hillbillies\\" even though all of the whites in this movie are very educated and are not hillbillies at all. I agree with another reviewer when he said that this movie tried to portray what the blacks do in this movie as \\"cool,\\" who are a bunch of \\"gangsta\\" criminals, and if you go to college to enlighten your mind then you are a loser. In one scene, you see a whole army of \\"gangstas\\" blow their way past a military roadblock. This is not possible.

The two stars are because some stunts are OK, and some false-looking CGI is still engaging, and the blonde is hot. and that's it. The racist instances against white people are only a result of the sub-culture propelled by MTV and other music channels; or maybe the expression of the way of life of a reified lumpen-proletariat.

Adequate doses of action and humor; lots of vehicular action (boats, cars, tanks, and a train); a little bit of silly sermonizing about throwing money at America's enemies until they like us; but fun nevertheless, if you can take Ice Cube's constant scowl.The movie does cheat, though; we don't see how XXX escapes a competently-organized dragnet while he's in the water, and the gunfights are totally lacking in any smarts - one side fires, the other side fires, one side dies.

Like a good friend they will tell you all your options and then recommend their favorite and we found that their favorites were also ours. They must have spent weeks on the Hana highway pulling over at every turn out to see if there was something interesting. This book is a must have. You won't regret getting it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated.","review":"I bought this book because of its glowing reviews. Most of the information matched the contents of the free publications given away at the airport and visitor racks in front of supermarkets. It is more of an advertising piece than a real guidebook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over hyped","review":"The text is out of a promotional brochure, like a chamber of commerce piece or an advertisement. I read the book from cover for cover and it showed no compassion for the people of the island or their history. Very slick and colourful but the material it contained was very shallow and disparaging. I found a good map and a rental car are all you need to see Maui and form your own opinions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't go to Maui without it!","review":"By far the BEST guidebook there is. While Frommers and Fodors are nice, they don't BEGIN to scratch the surface of what this books truly \\"reveals\\". The authors will even email you if you have questions and appreciate updates and tips from their readers. No reason to buy any other guidebook, this is THE guidebook.Selfishly, I'm going to miss all of those \\"secret\\" places we enjoyed now being common to anyone who goes with this book on hand!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must if you're going to Maui","review":"Finally, a guide book that gives honest opinions- good AND bad! This is a must for the Hana drive. You'll see so much that others miss. Make sure you get this well before you leave so you can take advantage of the helpful pointers on, for example, what to pack to wear on the volcano. I would have been lost in Maui without this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cutesy and flip","review":"This was our first visit to Maui and we wanted to find sunshine and special places where there wouldn't be gangs of tourists. Before we left we outlined where we wanted to go using advice from this book. With the glut of reviews, way more than any other Maui guidebook, we thought it would be reliable. Maui was nothing like they described. The beaches listed were overcrowded and their vague directions left us asking locals which road to take. Needless to say, we were very displeased with our purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something new and better","review":"The new Lonely Planet book for Maui just came out and it leaves Maui Revealed in the dust. To me it has a better tone, it's more upbeat, there are more listings and you learn alot more. Maui Revealed stayed in the glove compartment the entire time. For what we look for on vacation, it just didn't spark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush Photography and Consise Guide","review":"There is no better photographic treatment of Cuba in a guidebook than Knopf's guide. Beautifully illustrated throughout and well-written, this is a sumptous guide to view Cuba even before you get there. One of my three travel companions used the Knopf guide exclusively (each of us brought a different guide to the island) and we found out that despite its compact size, Knopf did a tremendous job in detailing the highlights. In fact, I just reviewed the book after the trip, and I don't know what else I would have included that they did not mention. The maps in this book were among the most accurate for traveling outside of Havana. Of the dozens of guidebooks that I bought for the Cuba trip, this is the one that I am keeping as a visual reference of the island."},{"rating":"2","title":"We'll Never Know How Far His Vision.................","review":"We'll never know how far Mark Brickell male erotic vision would have gone. Sadly, he left us in February 1994. This second book in the series is a highly erotic and beautiful showcase of male nude photographs. This Canadian photographer had a way with displaying the male nude in a very simply but erotic vision, much like that of Robert Mapplethorpe. His models are draped in cloth, and symbolism, but presented in their stark nudity, displaying their well-endowed eroticism to the best advantage. These black and white images of young men are very bold and stunning in their sharpness & clarity.This is a wonderful second edition to this series. A must for your collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A qiuck review","review":"The author presents a chronological order of events that mark ww1 aviation. Four stars are given to the exceptional factual accounts of specific air fighting episodes. Author typically has between 80-120 sources at the end of each chapter(biography). This \\"just the facts\\" book is an excellent reference to any ww1 enthusiasts library. Very detailed account of peripheral information regarding the war in the air. On the down side...for those interested in flowery story telling, they will be disappointed by the book's lack of flowery descriptions of air combat. I find this point a good point since only those actually fighting in the air could ever accurately describe the aura of air battle."},{"rating":"2","title":"the title speaks truth","review":"Reading this book truly is like taking in a big breath of air. Godden's style is so refreshing; though not a page turner, this book leaves you feeling as if you had just taken a trip to a wild island, and you are reluctant to come back to real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cut below the best","review":"This is the notorious European Tour in 1960 - the one where Coltrane was booed in the Olympia Theatre in Paris.A few days later, and here is the same quartet in Zurich. I have a feeling jet lag was starting to set in. Unlike the earlier Paris and Dutch concerts, the Swiss concert seems rather uninspired. Miles Davis himself soloes tremendously on So What, but is otherwise rather sloppy. Coltrane is even sloppier; even the greats have their off-days I suppose. Whereas mere days earlier Coltrane had been ravaging the boundaries of bebop at the Paris concert, here he seems content to play repetitious phrases that go absolutely nowhere.The disc is also filled out with another complete concert, from New York in 1958 - this is the Quintet with Bill Evans. From what I've heard it's rather better than the Zurich material."},{"rating":"1","title":"$59.99 is a total Rip-Off!!","review":"I just bought this toy for $12.98 at Toys R Us---my son loves it, the wires could be a danger as previously mentioned, but my 3 yr old is very technical and plugging this in was a better alternative to extension cords!! It is a little 'cheaply' made, but he is careful with all of his tools and takes it very seriously!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety Hazzard!!!!!","review":"I DO NOT suggest anyone buy this toy. The cords that connect to the tools from the generator are very long and dangerous. I am very worried that some child is going to be strangled by these cords. It is also nearly impossible for them to walk anywhere without tripping on the cords. The tools do not work without the cords but I have taken the cords away anyway due to safety concerns. My son just makes imaginary noises with them now. The generator makes an obnoxious humming noise which I could tolerate if I weren't so worried about the cords. Why would anyone make a child's toy with long tangling cords?? Also, my drill did not work properly straight our of the box even with the cord and batteries. And it says it comes with all the batteries but it does not. 4 more are needed to be supplied by you in the individual tools."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource","review":"I felt that this book effectively serves two purposes. First, it is an outstanding resource for survivors of sexual abuse and their partners to feel that they are not alone in their struggles and experiences. Second, as a clinician, this book gave me great insight to the experience of a sexual abuse survivor and gave me direction to use with clients who are survivors. After I finished reading it I loaned it to a client right away. Her response to reading it was as positive as mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am grateful for this book","review":"My therapist recommended this book to me and I am grateful. The book deals mainly with adult survivors' sexual issues. The beginning of the book helps define what has happened. It leads into how to deal with the sexual issues. It's one of the building blocks, in tandem with therapy and hard work, that will help survivors manage. It's well-written and covers a wide variety of issues. I would especially recommend this to women and men who associate fear and anxiety related to sex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Understanding","review":"This book is an excellent guide towards discovering the innermost effects that sexual abuse can have on an individul over time. The information is so familiar that, at times, it can be overwhelming to read. Chapter 8 contains helpful suggestions to direct abused indivduals toward healing and healthy sexual behavior. I finally felt like all of my feelings and fears were being described in a way that I had never been able to communicate. This book has helped me to understand my actions and has changed the ways in which I view myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource","review":"This Book is a great resource for every sexual assault survivor. In her nonjudgmental, simple acceptance, the author understands that each survivor is at a different stage of healing. She encourages the reader to read the parts they are ready to read and come back later for others. It's a wonderful book to have as a resource!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING book!","review":"If youve experienced any kind of physical abuse this is a MUST READ!

It is not that Hudson dismisses the horrors of slavery, but rather he expands on the story of the \\"humanity, endeavor and creativity of the enslaved\\" (p. xiii). To Have and to Hold is a fundamental work for the study of American slavery; a backbone on which all further study of slavery will build and be judged against."},{"rating":"2","title":"An in-depth examination of dramatic effect","review":"Leading literary theorist Terry Eagleton presents The English Novel: An Introduction, a scholarly examination of the artistic expression of the English novel that particularly focuses upon classic works by great authors such as Charles Dickens, George Eliot, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Thomas Hardy, and others. An in-depth examination of dramatic effect, narrative characteristics especially prevalent among English novels, ideological passions that fueled the individual authors, and much more, The English Novel is a superb introduction for beginning to intermediate college-level students of literature. Witty and inventive as well as filled with sharp observations, The English Novel is enthusiastically recommended for personal and public library literature shelves."},{"rating":"2","title":"A high peak in Bertini's Mahler cycle","review":"On the opposite to the other reviewer, i consider this as an awesome andperfectly judged, balanced and played 8th from Bertini's cycle.

An absolute reference for this great symphony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as pictured","review":"I love the design; the weight; the sturdy feel of this screen. I am reserving judgement until I see how long it lasts. It appears that the wire mesh on the front is merely glued on to the horizontal frame in the center. Since that is directly in front of the fire, I can't say how long it will hold. Otherwise, I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous collectable..","review":"This is a most gorgeous book, well produced on beautiful paper, with wonderful reproductions of the original NC Wyeth pictures. A collectable to treasure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it as a Kid","review":"I loved this book when I was 10 or so, as much for the drawings as for the text. As a kid, I didn't follow all that was happening. For example, for a pre-pubescent boy, why Lancelot would go insane over the queen was a distinct mystery and some of the other tales are a bit beyond younger kids, but the flavor of it all was there. I am delighted it is being republished and will buy it for my young teenage son. I tried reading the original Mallory version years later as an adult and am afraid it was better for me in this edition. \\"Aroint thee recreant knight!\\" was one of my favorite phrases playing sword fighting with my friends though I only guessed at what it meant.It is a pleasure to see the other Wyeth illustrated classics being republished as well. They may be next on my list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful find","review":"The well cared for old book was illustrated long ago by a family member whose illustration work had not been know to us. We were very pleased to find this art work in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor photocopy!","review":"This book is an obvious and poor photocopy (you can see faint library marks on some pages). The illustrations are barely distinguishable and the type is faded. There is even a dark shadow on the top of each page where the paper was not against the copier. I am shocked Amazon would sell such a poor product. It is going right back. Don't be fooled!"},{"rating":"1","title":"King Arthur and his Most Noble Knights","review":"King Arthur's Noble knightsSidney Lanier's re-telling of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table may appear confusing. However this story has the same original plot and theme of King Arthur weaved into the story. This book contains stories on the coming and passing of Arthur in the 6th century, King Arthur's most noble knights, and the quest for the Holly Grail.Sidney Lanier's version tells more details then other novels of King Arthur. For instance, Lanier always describes what knights do when they traveling to a destination. He tells where the knights stop and sleep for the nights and what they eat the next morning.Lastly, in my opinion this book should be read by adults who understand the meaning of words such as wrought, meseemeth, and wot. I did not enjoy reading this novel because of the complexity of the language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Short, Should Have Been Longer","review":"I was very exited when I first heard about this biography about J.K. Rowling. I immedietily went to my local public libray to check it out.Let me tell you: this book is not worth anything. It is way too short. It only had 96 pages, and the book actually started on page 11.The print is HUGE. It took me 15 minutes to read it. Also, I was dissapointed because the biography part was very short, the rest was all garbage all Harry Potter fans know about the four books.And yes, it will spoil them for anyone who hasn't read them.Don't waste your money. Read it in a bookstore or check it out of the library, but don't bother buying it.If you want a better, more detailed biography, try J.K. Rowling: the Wizard Behind Harry Potter by Mark Shapiro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"This book clearly was not what I expected. Though the book is the only \\"authorized\\" biography of Rowling, it's a dissapointing book. For starters, the print is huge and not to mention the book starts on page 11! The biographal part was really the only part where fans wanting to learn about Rowling can find information about her. Plus, is in a question-and-answer format, so it dosn't really tell full-out about Rowling. The rest of the book basically is about the Harry Potter series, and it tells about the four books that have been released so far. (Come on hurry up book 5, I'll be waiting for you on June 21!) Anyway, the book is basically more about Harry Potter than J.K. Rowling. And, like one reviewer said, you could go to the bookstore and read it in less than 20 minutes. Don't waste your money on this one, just wait until a decent biography of Rowling comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's it? No, seriously... that's really it?","review":"If I could spend an afternoon with any famous person in the world, it would be J.K. Rowling. I find her writing to be exquisite and (from what I have learned) her life story to be inspiring.Unfortunately, in my opinion, Conversations with J.K. Rowling isn't a proper biography. It read more like a short, weak high school report. You'll likely spend about ten minutes reading quick, but interesting answers from J.K. Rowling and another ten minutes of *yawn* time. As are all Harry Potter fans, I am eager for books 6 and 7, but I am also awaiting her autobiography. I want all the details straight from J.K.

Books like this make kids want to read! I highly recommend.However, advanced topics are addressed by the author such as drug use, corruption, and love.

Of the 3, sad to say this was the best but still it's not very good. It's suppose to have funny bits in it but it's not funny. Chester Morris is a magazine editor, and things get published without knowing what was in the magazine? Please. Then he lets his star photographer go to jail for murder, he's bragging he'll get her out he can fix it. She almost goes on trial for the murder. The whole thing is not believable, not even enough to say oh well it's ok for a bit of fluff, but remember it is be best of the 3 I bought. So there are 2 more that are worse than this.

Be forewarned, however, that if you did what I did and bought this album for a single track (Two Gods, in my case), you'll find very little in the way of variation. Every track uses the same bass synth, the same quasi-German expressionist wailing female vocals, the same hushed, almost chanted vocals. Which is all fine, if you don't like variety in your music. There is violin on every track, but it's used more for ambient noise than melody. Expect to hear that yawning tone and sinister sawing a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biochemistry made reader-friendly","review":"Holum does a superb job of explaining a complex topic!

Many of the techniques described in this book require the physical manipulation of the vocal apparatus, a process which can lead to undue strain on the vocal folds and surrounding musculature. Though this books does occassionally contain accurate information on the process of healthy singing, there is far too much that is incorrect and poses permanent damage to the voice.

Reininger was a member of experimental group Tuxedomoon who relocated to Europe. Both with that group and solo he has produced some incredible records. This live set from Brussels is simply mind blowing. It contains a spectacular version of Tuxedomoon's What Use?. The live version of night air is also incredible. The quality of the recording and the strength of the performance makes this an absolutely must have and must hear record. While the use of synthesizers is very dominant the music is extremely melodic and the whole record is a pleasure to listen to. It is much better recorded than Tuxedomoon and gains from the high production values.

It's a quasi-documentary and should be viewed by everyone in this country. There are only a few interviews with experts on consumerism but this movie is a good starting point for further research on consumerism. It is light enough to be enjoyed by children yet enlightening for adults as well. Hopefull the DVD will feature heavier bonus content that adds to the issue at hand.

I'm not a fan of the Lipton or Suzie whatever teas, my favorite is Shangri-La brand regular black iced tea. I drink my tea without flavoring or sweetener of any sort, so the iced tea really has to stand on its own.Unfortunately, Shangri-La was costing me upwards of 2 bucks a day, so I thought I'd give Walters Bay a try.This is good iced tea, with the price being hard to beat. When you open the box, you can \\"smell\\" this kind of fresh, fragrant smell, almost like iced tea potpouri. When you make the tea, it comes out pretty strong, causing me to lighten it a bit, but other than that, its a really good tea. It has a bit of bitterness to it, which is unfortunate, compared to Shangri-La, but the price is right, equating to like 20 cents a day if I make one pitcher every day.I recommend giving it a try, see if it works for you, the price isn't bad, and the tea is above average in terms of taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT !","review":"How this Mustard ever Won two \\"Best Mustard\\" Titles is a Wonder.

It is a thorough catalog for commercially available phonics based reading education programs. There is not actually any advice on \\"parenting\\". There is plenty of advice on how to be adversarial with your child's teachers and school. There is extensive use of the term \\"research-based\\", and this is what the authors use to support their arguments. However, their scope is extremely limited. The research they cite focuses on what works to teach kids to read words (decode the symbols) early in the school years, rather than what works to help kids truly read and comprehend complex language. There is no discussion of reading comprehension. I have no question that with their recommended approach, we could all have 6 year olds reading Dick and Jane. They don't address the ultimate goal of reading, understanding what one reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worse shoes ever","review":"I used this shoes only to go shopping or the supermarket, very soft use, and only after 1 week of use, the leather broke in the seam.

The problem was that I fell in love with the older line when navy was the color of choice and they seemed to last forever. I recently attempted the Sparta brand and they were destroyed inside of 3 weeks of hard walking and working... it's like they just gave up. (Had to take them behind the house and put them down... Old Yeller' style.) These on the other hand are much more durable and vastly more comfortable and supporting. I was leery at my color options but in the end very happy with the grey ones that I selected. (they look much better in person than on the picture) The insides are like a pillow hugging you're feet with just enough support to keep you from falling out of them. The arch in the center of the shoe is higher and it goes along way to actually assisting the way you set your foot down step to step. Just a great product all around. Very very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfortable","review":"Didn't buy these on Amazon, but being a devout reader and writer of customer product reviews on Amazon, and liking these shoes I thought I'd add my two cents. Although made in China, these shoes are very firmly, and well constructed. They provide comfortable support and wear well. Not surprised to read that people have worn them for several years, but I generally look for shoes <$50 and am used to buying new shoes every 6 months or so. So I'm now on my 2nd pair, but only because my first pair has gotten dirty with everyday use, and will now be my weekend/chores shoes. I wear size 11 and larger shoes often look \\"dorky\\".

They gave us three copies of this book. Until we read it, we did not understand either what we had just gone through or what we faced ahead.

Chandos released a lovely disc with the B flat symphony, the Viviane poem and Soir de fete, including two pieces from The Tempest that they claimed constituted all orchestral music by Chausson. No, this is not true. I found out about this gorgeous EMI disc years ago but could never find it, either online or at rare record stores. Alas, it finally resurfaced here on Amazon, I ordered it immediately and the results nearly brought me to tears. St. Cecilia is quiet and profoundly sad music, with shimmering choruses and a few songs from our heroine. Le Tempete is playful and Medieval, pure magic. Now I see how the two Tempete pieces on the Chandos disc fit into the incidental music as a whole. EMI France should really reissue this, a treasure of pure silver hiding tarnished in their vaults. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album, not as good as Funk All Y'All though.","review":"More of a P-Funk influence on this album and less detroit techno.

After three attempts at using it (instead of my inbuilt laptop microphone and speakers), I gave up and returned it to the company.

Plot twists aside, if you have ever thought about picking up Captain America, or coming back to Captain America this book is for you. Brubaker weaves a twisting tail of corruption and espionage on par with Clancy that is very much rooted in the history and mythos of the Marvel Universe reaching back into World War II. You would enjoy this book if you are fan of comics or a fan of TV shows such as 24 or Band of Brothers or anything written by Clancy. Its also a great jumping on point for new comic readers who may be curious about Captain America, SHEILD, Hydra or AIM and the dark corner of the Marvel Universe in which they operate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"new to captain america","review":"I got into the Avengers with the start of the New Avengers book. I've always like the idea of the team, so that got me hooked on the one. Then I found that there were newer books started on individual characters from the team, so I started picking up Cap and Amazing Spider-man. I like getting a closer look at the individual characters. It gives some depth when reading New Avengers.Neat book, though. Different from the typical super-hero thing. It has a heavy focus on anti-terrorism. That seems to be the main thrust of Cap as an individual character. These issues have a lot of flashbacks in them drawn differently giving it a very reflective feel - a pleasant change of pace from the average comic. You get a lot of Cap's background from the war. Definitely a good read if you're interested in Captain America or the Avengers."},{"rating":"2","title":"great remixes and some awesome new stuff too","review":"This collection of remixed BNH hits and some new songs is great for fans of their music.

Excellent book about adventures and misadventures while hunting dangerous game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your introduction","review":"Mr Capstick employed a writing style that fuels your imagination to the extent you can virtually visualise the scene he has created on paper, with a blend of humour that could ordinarily seem inconsistent with the seriousness of certain situations.

My siblings and I all wanted it when Dad gave away his library.Mr Capstick is a wonderfully descriptive writer! Each one of the big eight African game animals has a chapter; and each is the very worst way to die. Capstick does not skimp on the gory details, but he is entertaining and real. He spent many years in the Africian bush and obviously knows each of these animals very, very well.I worked with a gentleman who met Capstick while in Africia and he reported that the man in the book is the same man in real life. If you want a different view of Africa from the Disneyification of wildlife this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Read this book if you want to experience the thrills and dangers of the hunt. Capstick's descriptions really sends a chill down your spine. Punctuated with a humor typical of him, it is a great read. sadly it does not tell the reader how the hunt is accompalished.. stalking the prey, reading the signs along the way and all that. There are just mentions that the gun bearer finds it out for him.. also the African bush lifestyle and culture have not been described though the natives are the biggest casulties of the wildlife.Inspite of all these drawbacks the book is still a good read as the author has tons of experience as a safari pro.

The band butchers a great song, \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\" by adding an extremely dumb verse and slowing it down so much that I couldn't sit through the whole thing without almost drifting off. \\"AM Radio\\", with a sample from \\"Mr. Big Stuff\\" is so unoriginal it's almost sort of sad, and countless other voiceovers and vocal samples ruin most of the other songs, even \\"Wonderful\\". The worst, though, by far, is the voiceover in \\"Unemployed Boyfriend\\". One song that stood out was \\"Song From An American Movie Pt. 1\\", which in my opinion could have been great... if it had a beat! Let's face it, if Everclear had stuck with the \\"So Much For The Afterglow\\" formula for this disc, it would be a whole lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"great songs","review":"Don't pick up this album for the two catchy singles. There is a great rhythm to the rest of the songs. It tells a story moving from the glory ideal days to the bad times. I'm a big Everclear fan so I'm definitely biased but I found this album offered a lot more substance than just the two catchy songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The alternative to the alternative","review":"This was a superb album for everclear. Alot of the everclear fans are wondering where the old stuff went to. But there will be another album in the fall coming out which they are suppose to go back to old stuff. Which was more alternative with the good old guitar riffs everclear is known for. But I am fan or Art alexias and his lyrics. So any song I hear by everclear I think is simply \\"wonderful.\\" If your a newcomer to everclear then you would probly like so much for the afterglow. If I had to give my vote out for rock band of the 90's it would definatley go to these guys. They have kept pumping out the albums with much satisfatcion. I think this is a good album for anybody who has any kind of musical taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Everclear Album!!!","review":"Let's start by saying that the song \\"Wonderful\\" is wonderful. Also, the song \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\" originally done by Van Morrison, is re-done excellently, even though it sounds alot diffent. This has my vote as the best Everclear album. Also good music to play in the work place. (with the exception of a few)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everclear's best CD","review":"This CD is very good. My picks for best songs are #3 - AM Radio, #4 - Brown Eyed Girl, and #11 - Wonderful. AM Radio is an upbeat song about the 1970's radio and lack of CD players. Brown Eyed Girl is a great remake of Van Morrison's song. And y'all've heard Wonderful on the radio. It sounds like a very cheerful song but is very, very sad. All in all, I would highly recomend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad at All ... Quite Listenable","review":"\\"American Movie\\" is an album that deserves multiple listenings. Only then shall the music begin to exalt. Yes, I did say exalt! This album's strength lies in its lyrics. They're bold, irreverent at times, and insightful, sometimes reaching levels of real poignancy. Especially noteworthy are the songs \\"Learning How to Smile,\\" \\"Now that it's Over,\\" \\"Otis Redding,\\" and, most of all, \\"Wonderful.\\" In fact, this listener finds the latter to be one of the best songs she has heard in ever so long. It's a bittersweet ode addressing childhood (and adult) disillusionment, rivaling Supertramp's \\"Logical Song.\\" Yes, I dare to go so far! In sum, this album's a gem. A real ruby! Of course, until now, I was unfamiliar with Everclear's music and, therefore, may be experiencing profound infatuation. Hence, the Supertramp comparison. Do give it a go, or two, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pop album from Portland's Everclear","review":"This album's first single, \\"Wonderful\\", is one of the catchiest pop tunes I have heard in a long time. Everclear's newest album shows their experimentation with pop melodies and meaningful lyrics has transcended into a broader audience as well-- with varied and distinctive songs. This album is a must for any Everclear fan, or for a person who would like to see Everclear at its finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I just had my first listen of Everclear's latest; it was definitely worth the wait. It seems Everclear has aged - the hard-edged Everclear sound is notably missing on this CD, but it is replaced by a richer, improved sound. The band employs a wide range of sounds, including mandolin, and ukelele. When blended with great melodies and complex harmonies, the sound is tough to beat. The lyrics are very personal, and can be at once simple and devastatingly honest. Added to the mix is a dynamite cover of \\"Brown-Eyed Girl,\\" and an attempt to make this a CD to be listened to completely, instead of just a collection of songs. Truly a great effort; a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"These guys don't hit and miss...","review":"All of Everyclear's major label albums have been consistantly very good.This album is non exception. I like all the songs, and even though at it's heart Everclear is a southern punk rock band, with each release they grow a little.On their last effort \\"Sparkel and Fade\\" they ventured into beach music while keeping to their roots. On \\"Songs from an American Movie Vol. One\\" they revist the style of their first and second album and successfully manage to add pop, folk, hints of \\"hip-hop\\" and even thow in an excellent new rendition of the classic rock Van Morrison song \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\".They accomplish all this and manage to keep the music fun, and add enough of the real worlds irony to keep the lryics deep.How? Simple, Art Alexakis is a geniusOnly 4 stars because I wish they would have just made it a double CD set instead of doing the two album thing in a single year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overall cd","review":"If you liked so much for the afterglow then you would love Learning how to smile.

It makes a great gift for any fan of rock. Buy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought","review":"I bought this album with hopes of it being as good as \\"So much for the afterglow\\"and i was let down. Most of the songs don't even sound like the everclear i was used to. I found it dissapointing. There are only two songs on the whole cd that I actually enjoyed \\"wonderful\\" and \\"unemployed boyfriend\\". The rest was just somewhat boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everclear is great","review":"Well, i love their other cds and i love this one. Everclear is great. I especially like Wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"i love it, but ive been a fan since 93 and from what reviewers say...not so hot. id recommend so much for the after glow first for anyone who hasnt heard them before. this one is good though. different. buy. listen. decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"You mean I used to Like this Band?","review":"After hearing the disgrace to modern music that is \\"The Honeymoon Song\\" it's hard to believe that I ever considered myself an Everclear Fan. The insightful lyrics of their past songs (such as \\"California King\\") have been replaced by an endless stream of meaningless dribble, and if it weren't for \\"Learning how to smile\\" This CD wouldn't even have deserved one star. I just prey that Everclear's next CD lives up to their past work."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the deal?","review":"I am sorry. I am a major everclear fan,for a reason:because I liked the way they sounded. With this album, everclear shows how different they can sound. Yeah I want them to sound diverse but I don't want that to include pop. They should stick to what they are good at:rock music. I am glad I listened to the whole album a couple times over before I bought it. At first you want to like it because it is everclear, then you listen some more and realize that they turned pop. I hope that this is just some faze because I really want the old everclear back! The next album should be better.........."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for any collection","review":"Today I purchased Everclears' new Cd. Normally it's not like me to purchase a cd with only hering one single (in this case wonderfull). I have to say that I made a wise choice. The album is similair in style to earlier editions of Sparkle and Fade and So much for the Afterglow. It is apparnet that during the recording the boys from Portland have greatly grown in their musical ability, because they seem to incoprate all sorts of untraditional instruments in to their Songs (example of this is Annabelle, and Otis Redding) Spoken word is also include such as in Unemployed Boyfriend and Wonderful. All the songs seem to pull a quality from earlier music from the 1950s such as Brown Eyed Girl. The Honeymoon song is great for all couples getting married, and Learning how to smile is a song for everyone. I highly recommended this album to everyone, plus their is almost no swear words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different is still good","review":"Everclear is different in each CD but the poppier sound on this CD is still awesome. The best songs are Here We Go Again, AM Radio, Wonderful, Brown Eyed Girl, and Thrift Stone Chair"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 part everclear, 3 parts water","review":"I never enjoy knocking a band that I've enjoyed in the past, however if you are, like me, a fan of Everclear's older (and frankly better) material then you may be somewhat dissapointed by this excursion into pop territory. Where 'So Much For The Afterglow' was a paler retread of the excellent 'Sparkle And Fade', 'Songs From An American Movie..' is an even more dilute version of the bands former selves. While newer fans may point to Everclear evolving with the times, much of this album sounds as though they have lost their musical direction and turned into a messy retro-pop band hitting an early midlife crisis. Everclear used to have a knack for writing inspiring songs about being uninspired, whilst also celebrating life's little victories, and more importantly they knew how to rock. Now it's all 70's references, 'the good old days' and meandering songs with no real spirit, the album improves toward the end a bit but it's too little too late. Borrow from a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I have to say that I was completely disappointed in this CD. Disappointed the same way that I was disappointed with R.E.M.'s \\"Out of Time\\" CD back in 1991. It was so far away from what R.E.M. was doing as relatively unknown college band. With \\"Songs from an American Movie,\\" Everclear just stepped into that same scenario. It is far too pop-ish for my taste. After listening to it just once, it reeked of over-production, synthesizers and sappy lyrics. I love \\"So Much for the Afterglow.\\" It is by far my favorite CDs of ALL of my CDs. I am always listening to it. This one, will not be a favorite any time soon. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything Sparkle and Fades","review":"I have been an Everclear fan for over 3 years now. Sparkle and Fade and World of Noise are 2 of the best CDs ever produced in the 90's. So Much For the Afterglow wasn't the best, but it had those select tracks that rocked. When I got this CD the frown painted on the CD portrayed the way I felt. Art Alexakis found that whining about his childhood in \\"Father of Mine\\" sold records, so he did the exact same thing with \\"Wonderful\\". Art is nearly 40, although his lyrics remind me of a 17 year old. It makes you wonder how you can go from singing of rape, AIDS and abortion to \\"waaaaah songs on the radio make me cry when daddy yells at me\\" I'm sorry Art but I'll need to put another CD in my player in order to learn how to smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like other Everclear albums","review":"It seems as though Art Alexakis can't get over that catchy tune from '96 - \\"Santa Monica.\\" It's an awesome song on a mediocre album. Unfortunately he has beat us over the head with a bunch of songs that sound VERY CLOSE to it! (ie-> song rhythm, drum beats, always saying 'oh yea', etc, etC). His lyrics are some of the most shallow in the music industry today. You would be better off buying something from a band that doesn't try to be \\"Everything To Everyone.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This album shows diversity to Everclear's music that shines. There is a range of differnt tones and moods here that is impressive. Some may argue it's more pop than the other albums, but it's extremely likeable. It's very rare to find an album in which all the songs are good. This is one of them. 'Here We Go Again' is definitely a favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Wonderful!","review":"I'm still kinda freaked out that this is a Everclear Album!I mean they sound so popish on this album that it makes me not want more of this album!The only 2 songs that caught me here and were okay were Am Radio & Wonderful but that was all!And the cover song Brown Eyed Girl was better left alone since i really enjoy the original.But i had to pick the best Everclear album to date,it would be So Much For The Afterglow.Followed by then Sparkle and Fade,World Of Noise,Songs From An American Movie Part:2 and lastly part:1 But i would recommend this to any soft rock or pop fan since this is not hard at all.So i'm hoping Everclear will get back to what they do best and that is Rock..."},{"rating":"1","title":"arg!?","review":"i dont know. i bought this cd expecting it to be as good as the first one i bought. but i was dissapointed. the songs on it arent what i expected from the band. i also bought sparkle and fade, but so much for the afterglow is my favorite cd.so maybe i just didnt know what to expect from the band...but i really didnt like this cd that much. if you dont have so much for the afterglow, get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everclear fans this is not for you........","review":"Ok I am one of the biggest Everclear fans in the world especially when I picked up the amazing So Much for the Afterglow....If I was on a desert island and I could only pick three cds this would be one of them. Thus I was there the morning of the release of this \\"album\\" and I was sorely disappointed. Everclear is known for there \\"pop\\" rock music yet amazingly sarcastic lyrics. This is what hooked me about the band. The lyrics were deep and insightful. This album has no depth and I really couldn't identify at all with the lyrics. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THIS BAND? Anyway I encourage Everclear as a great band but this album....Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run away as fast as you can","review":"I am so disappointed at Everclear. What ever happened to them?

All I can say is save your money, and don't buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a big fan of this one","review":"If you listen to this one a few times, you'll find some songs you like. Personally, I like \\"Now That It's Over\\", \\"the Honeymoon song\\" and \\"Wonderful\\". But most of this album is kind of corny and hokie. And the lyrics, frankly, don't have the honesty that makes Everclear great. Whereas previous albums fed off Art's cynicism, angst and pain, this one often seems emotionally vapid. I get the impression that he has to manufacture some of the emotions that once came naturally to him, which is a real problem. I still love the rest of this band's albums and will probably take the risk of buying Volume II."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY MUSIC, THEY SING","review":"I first heard their music on the radio few months ago, and their music really touched my heart. They sing, they sing what they saw in the smallest detail of our lives! They know the true meaning of music is to touch other's feeling! Listen their songs, you'll fall in love with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the learning how to smile happened?","review":"I am an Everclear fan to the bone, but I'm more into Sparkle and Fade and So Much for the Afterglow. I anticipated the release of this CD so much but I have to admit I was disappointed. I'm used to a more angry everclear. I suspect that the people who wrote positive reviews are pretty old and haven't heard Everclear's old stuff. But I still respect Everclear for their past Albums and I will always consider myself a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everclear finally sold out! :(","review":"Anybody who knows me knows that Everclear is my ultimate favorite band. I've been with them from Fire Maple song to Strawberry to Amphetamine. Unfortunetly I don't support them on this CD. I don't have a \\"chemical smile\\" either. They not only lost there \\"sparkle\\", but worst of all they ran out of ideas. To a true Everclear fan this stuff is like drinking water after you were expecting wine (and belive me only Jesus could change this CD!). Basically this is not the best CD for true everclear fans. I recommend you try it for yourself though. Then try the real thing with either \\"World of Noise\\" or \\" Sparkle And Fade\\" ( Everclear began to sell out with \\"Afterglow\\"). Everclear USED to be a great band, and I USED to be a great fan. They took away the spark inside. :( P.S.: I'm older than one, but they must think I was born yesterday to give this more than one star!Joan of Arc 2000"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everclear Rocks","review":"Some of the people here dont own the CD. I do and I think it is great. Pop like songs contribute to their latest CD, Songs From an American Movie Vol. 2: Good Time For A Bad Attitude which is more rockier. So, to sum it all up, I think that Songs.. Vol. 1 is a great CD, that's why I rate it a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST CD'S OF THE YEAR","review":"This CD is one of the best to come out in the last 5 years. It has the very rare quality of having all the songs not only be good but flow into each other. This is a concept album in my opinion, along the same lines as Sgt. Pepper and Dark Side of the Moon(those albums had better music, but I'm not going to compare this work to those two masterpieces, that wouldn't be very fair). The theme that runs thru the album is the seperation of Art and his wife and Art's love for his daughter. Also, I think that the band had the cover of Brown Eyed Girl come after AM Radio so that it would sound somewhat like a radio broadcast. Anyway, all the songs are great, so just buy it and listen to it straight thru, you will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everclear - Learning How To Smile","review":"This CD is incredible!! Every song is good, except for maybe track 6(Honeymoon Song) and track 12(Anabella's Song)- but who cares cuz its got 10 other good songs to fall back on!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexspected","review":"I am an Everclear fan so I had to get this album, even if \\"Wonderful\\" sounded like a rewritten \\"everything to everyone\\", but I have not been let down by the band. The album feels a lot more diverse than the previous three and even though it does not stand up to the power of the first two albums. \\"learning how to smile\\" and \\"honeymoon song\\" have become my daily dose of Everclear."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST BUY!","review":"Everclear decides to go with a lighter feeling in their third CD, Songs From An American Move, Vol.1, Learning How to Smile. It is reminisent of 'the good old days', and has been spinning in my CD player nonstop for weeks. You will not be sorry if you buy this excellent CD, so go ahead! In my opinion, the best tracks are AM Radio, Learning How to Smile, Wonderful, Annabella's song, and Otis Redding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for an American CD","review":"With a CD cover that pokes fun at the famous painting \\"American Gothic\\", Everclear's new album is really diverse in its offerings. Hard rock, pop, and a little rap combined to form a really neat album. I looked into this album after hearing \\"Wonderful\\" on the radio. I thought that it was a really cool song. After listening to a few samples of the album, I was ready to purchase it.One of my favorite tracks on this album is Everclear's remake of Van Morrison's \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\". Other favs include \\"AM Radio\\", \\"Now That It's Over\\", and \\"Wonderful\\".If you like rock with a little pop in it, or are an Everclear fan, or if you really liked \\"Wonderful\\", then look into adding \\"Vol. 1\\" to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Great Album","review":"I'd heard a couple of Everclear's songs but never bought any of their cd's until I decided to get this CD at the store on a whim. I'm sure glad I did, as it's probably my favorite of my whole collection. Once I cracked open the case I actually listened to the entire cd straight through, no small task considering my short attention span. The songs hang together very well, although they're all very different. My favorite is AM Radio, mainly for its oldies-type tune and nostalgic lyrics. I was also expecting the Brown-Eyed Girl cover to be horrible, yet I was surprised to find that it was just as good as the original, if not a tad better. Get this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but a little soft","review":"I tought this album was different from the rest of the albums. It kinda repeated it's story lines and lyrics about girls and art's life. It also was soft but in all I enjoy listening to Wonderful and Am radio. I guess the title really fits into the songs. Well all in all it is a very good and different album. I truly think this album is not there best though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw, hot and lusty!","review":"Even though Art Alexakis got a little nasty toward the crowds at the Beale Street Blues Fest last year (c'mon Art, you don't call a bunch of drunken southerners \\"rednecks\\" puleeze)...after listening to this cd I forgive him. The edge from \\"Afterglow\\" isn't gone, but complimented perfectly by some lighter, more fun tunes to get ya groovin'. Great mix, great balance. Art, you can be my unemployed boyfriend any day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different...But Good","review":"I loved this album, my favorite tracks being \\"Annabella's Song\\" and \\"Unemployed Boyfriend\\"...for all who are lamenting about Everclear going \\"soft\\", the sister-CD to \\"Song...\\" is supposed to be more of their original rock sound. Great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Album for the masses","review":"Originally concepted as Art Alexakis's solo project this cd blends in the Everclear sound to make it a great CD for the masses. Although more mainstream and pop oriented it still carries with it well written lyrics and an attention to detail with overlaying strings and well placed samples. From talking about his little girl in song one (song from an american movie pt I) and song 12 (Annabella's song) Art continues to talk about the importance of his child in his life. His hardships with his life and marriage are evident in \\"Here we go Again\\" and the hard hitting \\"Now That It's Over\\". The remake of \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\" may not have been necessary but nonetheless is a version you just can't get out of your mind. True it is not \\"the old Everclear\\" if you want that wait for Sounds from an American Movie Vol 2 to be release later. But if you want a CD that carries with it songs, each in their own right, deserving of radio play, it's a must have CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning How To Smile","review":"Everclear is one the most musically diverse bands out there today. They continue to evolve in their musical abilities, and aren't afraid to try new things. This album is a fantastic illustration of Everclear's evolving music, and although new, this album still rings true with the unique sound of Everclear. You will not be disappointed. Congratulations Art on another great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXPECTED BETTER","review":"I really didn't enjoy this. I like the old-Everclear better when they were semi-country. Now they crossed into pop-rock and I don't think it works very well. They do have a couple meaningful songs on here,though. But am I the only one who noticed that \\"Wonderful\\" is a complete rip-off of Savage Garden's \\"Truly madly Deeply?\\" Every time one comes on the radio,I have to wait until they actually start singing before I can distinguish which song it is. If you like this kind of music,I recommend Matchbox 20 or Vertical Horizon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun Stuff for the Kids","review":"I was suprised by the change in focus on this disc. Everclear's earlier work demonstrated an emotional edge and typically focused on adult themes. This latest release, however, seems to be aimed at a much younger audience. The songs are cuter and less provocative, and even the angst-ridden \\"Wonderful\\" has a Sesame St. feel to it (today's lesson...counting to 10).As usual, the music is tight and well produced. \\"A.M. Radio\\" and \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\" are fun songs, as would be \\"Unemployed Boyfriend\\" without the silly narrative. All in all, however, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"If you loved Everclear's works before, you'll love this CD, from the first single \\"Wonderful\\" you know that it has to be a great work, Everclear is a band that will never grow out of style, every song on thsi CD is powerful! I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I am a huge Everclear fan. I have their 3 previous efforts, a couple live albums and have seen them in concert 4 times. This is not an Everclear album. A case of too many acoustic guitars and electronic \\"beeps.\\" It is a little too soft and \\"sappy\\" for my taste. Unfortunately this has been the pattern for many great bands (i.e. The Police, Clash and Rancid). I can only take solace in the fact that they are currently working on a \\"rock\\" album due this winter. We'll have to wait and see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs From An American Failure: Learning How To Sell Out","review":"God this album is terrible. I have an hour long commute to work and was hoping it would be a great album. I used to love Everclear (especially So Much For the Afterglow). But when Art starts talking in the third person about how he looks like a sensitive, cute Perry Ferrell (on Unemployed Boyfriend) it is embarassing and I am tuning out. Also, they really have to get rid of the strings, banjo, synthesizers, and overproduction. Don't buy this album. Unless you really really love, power ballads with a pop flavor, you will be disappointed. If you haven't listened to So Much For the Afterglow, go get it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupidest song on earth","review":"never hear wonderful. why? because at the begenning it only says wonderful. i think its retarted to have that song on now 5. i hate it and its retarted"},{"rating":"1","title":"*yawn* Recycled and rehashed....","review":"DMK's attempt at a magical training manual is really just more of the same-old-same-old. It takes the standard western hermetic tradition and dumbs it down (rather than simplifing), without adding any significant insights. There are much better sources for this information, such as Regardie's Golden Dawn books, and Crowley's Liber ABA (Book 4), both of which give wonderful insights of true masters of the magical arts. DMK's well-intended book fails miserably on this front. What little original content there is in it is thoroughly unimpressive.The final straw for me was his repeated harping against \\"black magic\\" without ever really defining what it is, leaving the student with a vague sense of fear and paranoia that he is somehow in danger of getting into some sort of mysterious, secret, nebulous trouble.All in all, it is an extremely non-scientific approach the hermetic sciences.

If you are a beginner on the path of Ceremonial Magick i highly reccommend Modern Magick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good beginning, but be careful","review":"So effective I thought it might be a good idea to post a warning here. For instance, the exercise in which you create and empower an astral entity to take on the attributes of one of your own shortcomings could be extremely dangerous; it has been my experience that it is much more difficult to banish energy than it is to form it. The trouble with many magicians is that they are working with forces they cannot see. This is a distinct disadvantage if these forces decide to take advantage of you. I suggest the magical student practice protection and intuitive techniques before performing any entity creating or invoking exercises- and the more accomplished the magician, the more protection he or she will need.Also recommended: Hands of Light, by Barbara Brennan; The Way of the Shaman, by Michael Harner. Both are excellent for beginning to perceive and work with subtle energies- shamanic work is the root of all magical practices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"This book is amazing! The author writes so you understand, and he writes so interesting that you keep reading the book until you have finnished it. I have read it 5 times and It's one of my favorite books.

It's fine if you want to practice Ceremonial Magick, but first you should learn the basics of plain old Magick. Read \\"Liber Null & Psychonaut\\" by Peter J. Carroll, \\"Basic Magick\\" by Phillip Cooper and \\"Real Magic\\" by Isaac Bonewits. No amount of Qabalah or Alchemy can give you all the practical information in these three books alone.And one other thing: the information on using the Keys of Solomon is hardly original, and worse yet, dangerously incomplete. Go to the original source: \\"The Book of Solomon's Magick\\" by Carrol 'Poke' Runyon, and the accompanying video, \\"The Magick of Solomon\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thoroughly Excellent Training in Magick - for Anyone!","review":"This was my first magickal text, and while I have since moved on from practicing ceremonial magick to other forms of Neopaganism such as Wicca and Druidry, I nonetheless still value and recommend Modern Magick as a superb grounding in both modern Neopagan and magickal practice in general, and ceremonial magick in particular. It is both practical and useful in the lesson structure, background material, and rituals therein. Beginners will find a plethora of accessible and well-integrated information, and more advanced students will have the opportunity to fill any gaps in their knowledge while simultaneously viewing magickal history and practice from a different and refreshing perspective. Definitely worth the price of admission!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The elder's choice.","review":"I was fortunate enough to buy the first edition of this book the first year it was published. Since then it has been a text that I will pick up from time to time for reference. But the best part of having it was as I first started my studies into the occult nature of the universe. My own occult studies have led me to many different books from Regardie's ponderous GD book to fluffier books about modern witchery. Kraig's book has stood the test of time for me. I don't think there is a better book for beginners out there or for intermidiates either. Kraig's \\"program\\" has a large following on the internet, not that having a large following is indicative of excellence, and I read the boards at wwwDOTmmstudygroupDOTcom which are often informative about the contents of the book.

My primary focus is on the mechanics of spirit and how/why something works. I'm not sure how relevant that is to the review here though, other than to say I don't consider myself an \\"expert\\" in high magic and I still found this book very basic.I'll keep it for my kids though when/if they start studying.

The way it was laid out in lesson chapter was great. Rituals laid out in the book are quite accurate and explained well. One thing i would like to say is that Mr. Kraig may have done well to leave some of his opinions out of the text though. That does make the book more personal as opposed to cold but for a rookie that may not be the best way to go. The rookie needs to be free from opinions and assertions from authors. Not in terms of knowledge just opinion. However im confident that any reader will make his or her own opinions and use this excellent manual as a great source of information.

It would be impossible for any one person to know EVERYTHING about magick and the craft but this is a GREAT start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, to think it's from a teenage singer","review":"I Turn To You is a song I cannot get tired of. Christina Aguilera has displayed a wide vocal range in this song and put enough emotions to put her on par with singers like Celine Dion and Michael Bolton. Indeed, it is amazing to expect such a high quality from a teenage singer. The lyrics and music of the song is beautifully and powerfully written by the legendary Diane Warren, and watching the video, I reckon it is a song written as a tribute to mothers. Easily it can move one to tears.Por Siempre Tu is the Spanish version of I Turn To You and it further demonstrates Christina's capability and talent in able to sing well in another language.The video is a bonus because enhanced CD's and videos are not very easily available, especially with Sony artists. Very well arranged, and makes this whole CD a definite must buy. US$4 ++ is not really a problem to many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovely Ballad Ya Know","review":"I bought this about a month before Christina's Spanish language debut was released, which means right around the time this was receiving a massive dosage of overplay. Radio really can make me sick of a song, and this is a song that radio ruined for me. I find it pretty boring, will the Spanish version seems even slower, and makes me tired. Christina looks lovely on the cover, and the song is LOVELY, but it is far to boring. It also has a sticker, and the enhanced video for your computer. While it is great video, she looks a bit too layered with make-up, providing a clown-like view of her. If you can listen to a song even after the 5,000 + radio overplays, your a stronger person than I, and you should buy this lovely Diane Warren tune, but if you are one who tires of the same old song, seek music some were else."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Turn To This Single When...","review":"I loved this song and it was really amazing that a slow song after Christinas first two singles did so well! The song is really nice to listen to and its comforting in a way. A good mothers day song and it could almost replace the Spice Girls \\"Mama\\" as the most devoted song for moms...but not quite. The spanish version is interesting as you hear Christinas voice in a different setting. Hearing this spanish version brings promise to Christinas spanish album! The only downside is that their are only two tracks. An orchestral version with her voice, or a karoke version or even a remix would've been a nice touch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Part","review":"I love that she sings her song in both English and Spanish. Her voice always shows the meaning of the lyrics. She sings them so perfectly, you'd think she'd be telling her life story. \\"I Turn To You\\" tells that when ever she feels like quitting, somebody's there to help her pull off whatever it is she's tackling lately. \\"Por Siempre Tu\\" is the same song only in Spanish.

This is the chronicle of one man's efforts to learn, and the many unexpected paths that journey of self-education took.If you buy this book expecting a L'Amour novel of the frontier, you MAY be disappointed; but, if you love this author, books, history, travel, or especially the act of trying to live life on your own terms, this is a book that you will find completely fascinating (and may return to often through the years for insights and reading suggestions, just as I have)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A ok book","review":"This book at some parts has very interesting stories. Louis L'amour has been through many interesting situations before which he describes in this book very well.

It had good information and good concepts but it didn't grab my attention like horror or mysteries do. It was interesting to read about Louie Lamour because I have never read any of his books before this one but I saw some of his movies on T.V.

I thought this book had good lessons and good information it just didn't catch my attention as much as horror and mystery books. After the first 7-8 chapters I thought it got a bit boring. And I didn't quite get it either but I guess that's just me. If I could change it a bit I would add more suspense or mystery to it. I read this book because I have seen his movies and they looked interesting. But the movies kept me interested more than the book did.

In Education of a Wandering Man, he relates how he has been a reader and a writer all his life. No matter where he was, or what he was doing, he retained a love of books and words in general.This love, of course, led to his present career. But, more importantly, his voracious reading gave him an education that he was missing otherwise. He would live on a sandwich a day so he could afford to buy more books.This is a compelling story from one of the most compelling storytellers. Anyone who loves to read will find much to identify with, especially those of us who keep logs of what we read. It's so nice to find another like oneself.After reading this, I want to go out and find more L'Amour books to read, especially The Walking Drum, which gets a specific mention because it concerns reading. Education of a Wandering Man has become a new favorite autobiography. It is one-of-a-kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Lover is Happy","review":"I love Books, especially collectable and pre-loved ones.

He is the creator of his own cinematic 'style'. It consists of low camera angles, no close-ups, no camera movement, the camera stays still. Probably the most quietly precise director of foreign cinema, he is know as the most 'Japanese' director of Japan's filmmakers. In this film he tells the story of an acting troupe who come to a small fishing town. To reveal more of the plot would be to deny you the dramatic impact of the film. While certainly not a technical marvel, it's raw power to move us remains untouched, and even more because of Ozu's direction. As we see the film evolve we feel him slowly coming toward us, but he doesn't creep at us, he puts his friendly hand on our shoulder and makes us feel comfortable. This film is a perfect introduction into Ozu's work, but also stands well by itself. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 9!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Floating Weeds","review":"Trademark bloodbath by Yasujiro \\"King of Carnage\\" Ozu.But seriously folks, this movie does seem full of shocking, \\"sensual delights\\" for him: riotous color, sexually mature women (no spinsters to marry off here), a young couple that *kisses* & has a post-coital hotel scene. But we still have inter-generational conflict & a wistful ending. Loved the making-up scene b/w the troupe leader & his mistress."},{"rating":"2","title":"A small disappointment, nevertheless a must for Ozu fans","review":"Yasujiro Ozu is unarguably one of the greatest directors of this world. This is a late Ozu piece, and it is somewhat disappointing. A story of a travelling company theater actor who returns to a village where he has left behind an illegitimate son, is the central theme in this piece. Although superbly acted, and beautifully shot, the direction (surprisingly), with the editing takes a few stumbles, and the end product is somewhat half-baked, and does not stir you as much as the classic Ozu pieces. I am glad that Ozu left us with the beautiful \\"Autumn Afternoon\\", made 3 years after this film, a dazzling return to form, and a sublime swan song. Nevertheless, for all you die-hard Ozu fans, \\"Floating Weeds\\" will be a welcome addition to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"all-time favorite of two generations","review":"My dad got this set for me when I was a kid.

My daughter is 3 1/2 now and both of these stories have been *huge* hits since she was just over 2, so much so that I transferred them to CD so that the tapes wouldn't die.

While this is no exception, the role is minimal, the afterthought that one would expect when reading about a family just trying to survive together in the face of multiple disasters.Puzo creates wonderful characters, and plants the reader so firmly into their lives, it's nearly impossible not to become invested in the ups and downs player experiences. This book also does a good job of creating a contrast between what poverty means today, and what it meant during the 1920's and 30's.If you enjoyed the \\"Godfather,\\" or any other Italian-American fiction, this is a must-read.

I do get tired of the same subject matter (weed), but i get passed it, paying more attention to style and delivery and blend. All the tracks don't receive a 10, but at least 12 do. I get excited when there are at least 3 or 4 great tracks on an album, but this one has 12. I could see hip-hop and electronic melodic ambient music merging real well in the mainstream.

At the time I had the first two Brand New Heavies' releases. However, this album totally blew my mind from the first song and on till the end of the album. This was their best album and the last with N'Dea Davenport (I also have the UK version which has two extra songs not on the American release). My favorite tracks on the album are: People Giving Love, Forever and Brother/Sister and Fake.Why was this their best album? Great songwriting, great songs and vocals and the band was just tight at that moment. It was as if they poured their heart and soul into making that album.Definitely buy this album and then their first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums ever!!!","review":"If you are a fan of Acid Jazz, this is one album that you should definitely get. Ever since they started, I've been trying to collect every album that B&H ever did, and comparing all the albums, this has got to be their best effort. I'm not saying that the other albums are bad, I just treat this album as one of MY roots. No one could ever resist the shuffling groove of the drummer, the wicked bass and guitar and the mellow-to-devastating vocals in this album.

Ms. Sprinkel does that, but more importantly, she shows the reader how to approach fundraising with the proper mindset. Gone it the \\"tin cup\\" mentality. Instead, she advocates that we approach fundraising with an investment mindset.Having set the stage with her philosophical approach to fundraising, Ms. Grace proceeds to walk the reader through the different stages of fundraising, including annual and capital campaigns.I used the information in this book to assist the development team at my children's school with a capital campaign. We trained a number of people in the art of fundraising and went on to raise the money needed for a new building.

But Morag Prunty had both my boyfriend and me reading Recipes for a Perfect Marriage from cover to cover - with no desire to put it down. And that is rare. Perhaps because Prunty articulates what men and women from all generations can so easily relate to: the fear of commitment and the challenges of relationships. And perhaps because it is refreshingly more pro-male than most books about love. Recipes delivers honest, beautiful messages. It will surely hit an emotional chord with anyone who has ever been in a relationship, or afraid to take the plunge.

I personally love books where there is cooking, so this one hit the spot for me.Both seem to have married without really being in love. However, what they discover on their journeys is, is love really marriaging someone who does everything you want and expect and you think is perfect for you, or is marriage developed over time mixed with respect and a deep caring that grows.This book had me looking at my own life and my own marriage. Beautiful writing from the heart and soul!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate title","review":"The book and title don't match except for the recipes that are used as a framing device to represent principles of a perfect marriage and tie the two women together. Neither had anything remotely like a perfect marriage and only had a tolerable marriage because their poor husbands didn't bolt. Both women were whiny and emotionally unfaithful - looking for love outside of their own marriages.

Recipe for a terrible first chapter. And recipe for how NOT to start a relationship. I did not want to read anymore. I certainly did not want this book to sit on my shelf as if I condoned her methods.

As the book progresses throughout the decades(that's how \\"Inside\\" is divided), it's starts looking like a very uninspiringly put together society page from a newspaper. Ho-hum pictures with Hefner and celebrities. Don't get me wrong, the book also has some great shots of the most important playmates ever, especially Barbi Benton which was possibly the cutest playmate ever.However, the thing that bothered me the most about \\"Inside\\" was the last part, were Hefner marries Kimberly Conrad and they have two boys.

It was never meant to be a serious movie, nor was it meant to be in any way about the Beatles or their music. It was simply a funny, imaginative fairy tale told using the music of one of the best pop groups of all time (the Beatles); and performed by another of the best pop groups of all time (the Bee Gees).

The acting is...nonexistent, the musical renditions take perfectly good music and turn it into 70's schlock. The plot makes NO sense (a weathervane comes to life in the end and makes everything right.

The movie is horrifyingly bad. Yet as a time capsule it's rather fascinating. I grew up in the 70's, and yes millenials, this is just how bad your parents looked back then. And how bad style was. And, well, everything. Except maybe some of the music. If you're a Beatles purist, skip this movie or have nightmares. If you're a BG fan, you'll love it.

Movies like this used to fly.Incredible.It makes me want to watch \\"Shields and Darnell\\" reruns. Or \\"That's Incredible\\".This film TOTALLY encapsulates the weird transition-phase that pop-culture went through as it kissed the seventies goodbye and leaped into the eighties. Everything is SO colorful, everyonoe looks SO innocent. Peter Frampton is dancing around in a sweet pair of white overalls with his name on them.Twisted man, really out there. This film really helps you understand where the punk movement came from.I don't know that this film has any redeeming qualities as an actual film, but as a study of late-disco era white culture, it is priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Blast from the Past","review":"I loved this movie as a kid and love having it on DVD....that's what the 4-stars are for. The fifth star is missing because I don't want people who've never seen the movie to get the impression that I'm saying it's a block-buster of a movie. In truth, it's pretty darn cheezy...but it's fun to see a young George Burns, Steve Martin, Aerosmith, Alice Cooper, Frampton, Sandy Farina, and the Bee-Gees. I also think it's cool the way the movie is basically the entire Bee-Gee's version of the Beetles Sgt. Pepper hits (and others) put to music, all 4 sides of the 2-record album and, I believe, in order. Oh, and I'll admit it, I like the Bee-Gees."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Career-Killing Turkey","review":"In early 1978, the Bee Gees were riding the crest of their phenomenal \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" wave. Then came the late-summer thud of \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\\" What a difference a few months can make! Except for Aerosmith, Earth, Wind & Fire, Steve Martin and Billy Preston, no one looked good in this embarrassing rock musical. Beatles producer George Martin somehow got suckered into working on the equally disastrous soundtrack album. The careers of the Brothers Gibb and co-star Peter Frampton (not to mention Robert Stigwood's entertainment empire) never truly recovered from this wrongheaded decision to imitate the inimitable Fab Four. Who knows what happened to Paul Nicholas?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I saw a film today, oh %$#@!","review":"The last, dying, gasping, crushing, eviscerating, agonizing blow to beatlemania. See it once AND ONLY ONCE for the sheer ridiculousness of it. But be forewarned, if you are a Beatles fan, and especially a SGT Pepper fan, the experience is kind of like being sodomized. How did the 1960's come to this? How could the the producers, audience, or anybody miss the irony of the we hate joy we love money message? Pretty much for sociologists and sado-masochists, otherwise do not pay to see this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring on the silliness","review":"Ocassionally, you see something that is so ugly it's cute. That's the way I feel about this movie. They probably didn't intend for it to be so incredibly silly and bad, but it has this wonderful time capsule of silliness effect. Unlike many other bad movies, this is at least bad and fun. I really don't think the music is as awful as some folks think. The Beatles gave us songs that two generations have sang. At least these guys and gals sound better than my ex-husband in the shower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nostolgic, but nothing more","review":"I saw this movie in the theater when I was a teen. I had hoped for more then, and I hoped for more now. It was not bad, but it will not appeal to anyone who is not a Beatles fan. My kids got a kick out of it because of the shiney 70s look, and they knew a bunch of the music.This movie is a loosely strung together series of later Beatles music, and a few inside jokes for the fans, but other than a trip down memory lane, the movie is not worth watching. I can even remember being dispointed in Alice Cooper's rendiditon of \\"Because\\" as a teen even though I was a huge AC fan. Still, Aerosmith's \\"Come Together\\" is as good now as it was then. Billy Preston doing \\"Get Back\\" was the most appropriate selection for a performer (Beatles fans will understand why).Unfortunately the movie lacks any real substance. It may be worth a rent for a trip down memory lane, but not worth owning. The chances I will watch this again this decade are pretty small."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\" of rock music","review":"1970's megaproducer Robert Stigwood hit a bump in the road when he tried to create a storyline out of characters from various Beatle albums.

Steve Martin makes a hilarious screen debut playing \\"Maxwell\\" from the \\"Abbey Road\\" track \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\". Earth, Wind and Fire, Aerosmith, The Bee Gees and Peter Frampton are watchable in this assault on the senses that is now a camp classic.

In a word...\\"ARGH.\\" I wondered how Peter Frampton manages to read sheet music since he obviously can't read a movie script. Great hair and colorful costumes weren't enough of a distraction from the lousy story and through the whole flick the one big question running through my mind was: \\"WHAT is George Burns doing in this awful movie???\\" He can't have been THAT broke.Sergeant Pepper has one saving grace: It will NEVER be as bad as \\"Can't Stop the Music.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality, VERY BAD!!

But there was also this movie that delivered a crippling financial blow to his international RSO empire.The 1978 musical starred a pair of Billboard chart monsters - Peter Frampton and the Bee Gees - in a thin story line that ties into the classic album of the same name by the Beatles. The last scene - \\"Our Guests at Heartland\\" - is the most fun, as it is a fitting tribute to the classic album cover and features an incredible cast that includes Tina Turner, George Harrison, Donovan, Linda McCartney and Heart.But to get to that point means to view director Michael Schultz pouring on the glitz, though nothing can ultimtately save the exploits of Frampton (Billy Shears) and the Gibb brothers from the incredibly weak script that centers on keeping the musical magic going in Heartland, U.S.A."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheezy acting, but the music is good...","review":"I watched this when if first came out when I was a kid.

I had some great expectations since the choice of artists was truly excellent. However I find this movie rather disappointing even for Bee Gees fans or Beatles fans. The story of the movie is quite confusing and even the segments of different bands are included in not very well chosen way. There is no explicit or persuasive read thread in the movie.

But, for those who can lighten up and enjoy a weak plot with great music, this one's for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Light-Hearted Moovie","review":"I saw this moovie for the first time after the Anthology's came out . . . I loved it. I laughed even cried when . . . well if you've seen it you know. It's good to know that good 'clean' moovies still exist. This is a moovie that I didn't mind watching with my family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless Musical Mess Butchers the Beatles","review":"Ho, boy. From the opening moments of the film, the garishly childish pastels of the costumes and scenery, and the cheesy high school band sentiments, should be enough of a warning to stop the tape. If you don't, be prepared to listen to Beatles songs softened to the squishy point of matching the decor. This film's faithful dependence on the Beatles' archives being the sole source of the song options brings the seemingly stoned cast staggering through the most ridiculously unfathomable, so-called storyline. The very fact that Stigwood thought he could get a hit out of this bomb makes the reality of 1978's audience reaction justifiable. Don't see it unless you are a huge fan of the cast members. (then again, maybe that's even more of a reason not to see it)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What were these guys thinking!","review":"This one one of worst films I have ever seen. The songs are terrible. The acting is laughable. There is even a character called (get ready) Strawberry Fields. This piece of cinematiceye candy destroyed the careers of the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton. You wonder what these guys were thinking when they were looking at the script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak story, but well-done renditions of great music catalogu","review":"Although the film itself proved to be the swan song for the RSO empire, and a huge blow to the careers of Peter Frampton and the Bee Gees, SPLHCB does offer a really good soundtrack. In addition to the mega-hits \\"Come Together\\" by Aerosmith, and \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\" by Earth Wind & Fire, remember that this soundtrack also features Billy Preston boogie through his own remake of \\"Get Back\\", Robin Gibb's radio hit of \\"Oh Darlin'\\", and Frampton's poignant \\"GoldenSlumbers\\". When it comes to assessing Beatles cover albums of the 70s, this film's soundtrack blows All This And World War Too completely off the map. As for the film's premise, acting, and direction, it's best viewed as a Lennon-McCartney revue, rather than a through-composed screenplay. Only then, in a camp atmosphere, can it be viewed \\"seriously\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it less stars.","review":"I don't see how anyone could enjoy this steaming pile of $hit. Ignore any reviewer who gave this atrocity over a single star. I guess if I have to give it one star, it's for Steve Martin, and Aerosmith. The rest is a poorly thought out black-hole of talent (yes, despite the Bee Gees there are talented artists in this flick). The only people I'd reccomend this too, are people who wanted to get a good laugh out of one of the worst movies ever recorded. I'm surprised the Bee Gees haven't made another movie, cause there's nowhere to go but up. Listen to the album, let this movie slip into oblivion where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Court-martial Sgt. Pepper!","review":"This movie is nothing more than a travesty! Robert Stigwood should be taken out and maimed for having the audacity for making this cinematic stuff!! This movie denegrates the Beatles and their musical legacy with lousy acting and fourth-rate musical performances from Frampton and the Bee Gees, save Robin Gibb's version of \\"Oh, Darlin'\\". However, the performances of Aerosmith and Earth, Wind and Fire are pretty decent and they keep the film and soundtrack from being a complete disaster. Aside from that, SPLHCB has nothing to recommend it. This movie doesn't deserve ANY stars and it should be thrown in the compost pile of cinematic duds. SPLHCB is so bad, it makes \\"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\\" look like \\"The Maltese Falcon.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is a good PSA for saying no to drugs","review":"It has some \\"it's so bad it's good\\" appeal, if you go for that kind of thing. I do not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rating of zero is generous","review":"I'll challenge anyone who may think they are a bigger fan of the Beatles than myself, however, this is the absolute WORST movie I had ever had the displeasure of viewing in my life. I simply cannot understand how the Beatles could have given the rights to their music to an outfit who could make such a disaster. This is actually painful to watch; you'd get more enjoyment out of watching paint dry. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one!, Not six!","review":"The toy itself is cute, but the photos of 6 in a bag on the page were entirely misleading.

Both positions are usually very poorly informed. I bought this book hoping to find a well-informed, balanced look at drugs. Unfortunately, this is another poorly informed, biased take by someone who obviously knows little about drugs aside what one could learn from a decent encyclopedia. It is decidedly anti-drug, and completely fails to examine why people would choose to use drugs. Edwards provides plenty of anti-drug statistics, but, when lacking legitimate backing, also reverts to anecdotes and unfounded generalizations to reach his conclusions that governments should do everything in their power to outlaw and discourage use of all drugs excepting caffeine. If you want decent information and any semblance of balance, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic read","review":"While many of Pierce's novels have main characters who have special abilities, Kel is one of the few that serve as rolemodels a girl could achieve since no special power is needed.

When I hear these two songs on my local radio stations while driving, I can't help but start shaking and grooving but when I listen to this CD, I keep waiting for the music to move me -- it does not!

From scuba diving to helicopter tours, we were able to choose what we wanted to experience, no deception there. I agree that some restaurants reviews are a little off, but I never ate twice at the same place, so my opinion isn't statistically significant, the authors visit those places many times, so their ratings is more an average.The structure of the book really helps to find what you need quick, I usually read the book before going, but with this one it is not as critical (although it helps). Prices were up to date, rarely the case on high priced islands like Hawaii, since most guidebooks wait 2-3 years between updates.we went on to buy the one on Maui. Same structure, same style, same humor, just great !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Overview of Kauai!","review":"We used this book on our honeymoon a couple weeks ago and found it to be very helpful when planning activities and finding food. They were definitely right with the helicopter tour in using Air Kauai and were usually spot on with restaurant reviews. Book layout was easy to use. Could use a few more local maps. All in all, this was the most used book during our trip. The other more traditional books (Fodors, Frommers) that I purchased were more general but okay. Once you actually on the island and using the tour books, you'll understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Must Have Kauai Guide","review":"This book will guide you through everything you need to know, from beaches to restaurants, to where to stay and etc. We used it a few weeks ago and found a great restaurant with reasonable prices and outstanding food that we never would have found without the book.

This book has everything, from the hole-in-the-wall places tourists only wish they could find to wonderful hiking trails and information (take SERIOUSLY the recommendation to kike in Waimea Canyon in the MORNING) to beautiful restaurants for the \\"splurge\\" evening. We definitely recommend the book and felt that it enhanced our experience, our ability to make intelligent choices and the control we had over OUR vacation. Don't miss the hamburgers at Duke's or the reference to the shave ice place - wonderful! How would we have known otherwise???? This book is great!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing new","review":"We were disappointed to find so many people at places they claimed would be secret and out of the way. The authors need to refresh the text with new areas and better organize the information. We supplemented with two other books we had along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps a bit biased","review":"While this Kaua'i guidebook approaches the sheer excellence of the others written by these authors, I think they understate the effect of winter on the enjoyment of this island. The north coast, while beautiful, is not particularly enjoyable during a downpour while sliding in the red mud ubiquitous on Kauai'i. Perhaps the authors are less objective on Kauai'i because they call it home (?). The book would be more helpful if it were more candid about the impact of rain and trade winds on Kauai'i. The comments are in there but too subtle as written. If this is your once-in-a-lifetime holiday, you're better off avoiding the north half of Kauai'i in winter (\\"off season')."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best travel guide !","review":"We are going to Kauai in the fall and purchased several travel books. This book, by far, is the best. They included information on everything we plan to do and more. I liked the fact that they rate businesses etc. with nothing to gain or lose. They also have updates on their website if there are any changes. This book will go with us daily."},{"rating":"2","title":"We took this book with us everywhere!","review":"This book is very helpful to a first time visitor. I felt as if a friend was giving me advice about the local food and accommodations.The only thing that I did not like was the food and accommodations were in spearate sections from the maps and I had to keep flipping back and forth. But that is a small problem that should not discourage anyone from buying the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical, helpful and easy to use","review":"We just returned from Kauai. I studied the Ultimate Kauai Guidebook before going and used it to anticipate a glorious time. I kept the book with me everywhere I went on island and found it immensely helpful in finding our way around, identifying activities, restaurants, places to visit. The ability of the authors to vividly describe places and to recommend everything from grocery stores to fine dining, places to swim, snorkel, hike, as well as what to avoid, helped make our trip wonderful!

It should be required reading for anyone going to Kauai, with very precise and accurate directions and descriptions of sites, activities, restaurants, etc. A lot of Kauai's attractions are \\"hidden\\" and with this book, we felt like we were driving/hiking around our hometown, there was none of the typical confusion and bactracking trying to find our given destination. We spent a few days in Oahu afterwards, and sorely missed having a guide book with such detail.Don't waste your money on another book, this is the only one you will need or use!

Don't go to Kauai without it.","review":"If you're going to Kauai, buy this book. We took it with us everywhere! The best part was the \\"where to stay\\" section. The online content (webpage and password given in the book) provided direct links to the many individual condos brokers and made it very easy to find a good price on a unit. We found an oceanfront condo for $140 per night in Princeville. The restaurant reviews and beach recommendations were also helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly Dissappointed","review":"Though the maps were noteworthy I was shocked at the manner in which some of the business establishments were reviewed in the the book. Curious we decided to ask the \\"experts\\", (locals), on the island about some of the businesses in the book. We were glad we did because we would have missed out on one of the best adventures on the island - Kauai ATV.So reader beware. Do your homework and remember that these are the opinions of 2 people with questionable taste. We found some of the reviews to be inaccurate and unnecessarily slanderous. Remember that the best advice is from those on the island who have an intimate knowledge of what is great about Kauai...and as soon as a book is publised it is outdated...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - buy another","review":"Full of inaccuracies.

Andrew goes into great details about places to shop, eat, and see the sights. The restaurants that we tried were just as he had said. The funniest thing was when we were on our way into a restaurant and we saw his book on the dashboard in another car. I liked the overviews of the different areas and reading about the history of certain places and things. I wish that there was an intro to each of the areas that could sum it up in less words. Overall, the book was good for Kauai. It seemed that there was not as much going on there as compared to Maui. The Maui revealed Book was 10 times more interesting and included more details but I think that is simply because there is more to see/do in Maui."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior Guide Book","review":"The major differance between this guide book and many others I have read is reflected in the layout of the text. You may choose to read it as you would a book, or to use the index to focus only on those areas, or activites, you are interested in. You do not feel as if you walked in half-way through a movie, and it is objective enough, and well enough written so that you might actually go back and read the whole thing anyway!Good objective reviews of the avaialble tourist activites, helicopter rides, horse back riding, etc., but also excellent advice and counsel about what you may do if you love to explore on your own. Great maps and graphics round out the book. A great place to go if you are planning a vacation in paradise."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Kauai Guidebook *IS* the best!","review":"I **LOVE** this guidebook - it definately is the ULTIMATE and best Kauai guidebook out there - period. THE only guide book you will need to discover the beautiful island of Kauai.

It's a good heavy doll and looks like it is made well, but within two weeks the hair stopped moving. It just makes the sound like it is trying to, but no magical hair.Before that disaster, it was an ok toy. It pretty much sings one song and then a few phrases if you wave the magic wand over the crown. However, if you happen to have a child that tends to lose pieces - know that you only get one magic wand. Without it, you are doomed to listen to that same song again and again. Maybe that's why her hair stopped growing. Maybe she grew sick of her own voice and her magical hair refused to cooperate any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Dora Fan","review":"I read the reviews for the Magic Hair Fairytale Dora before purchasing for my 3 year old daugter. I saw that some dolls were defective, but I didn't think it would happen to us. The dora doll that I spent so much time tracking down does not work. She talks just fine but the hair doesn't grow.

One time, my sister combed Dora's hair too much and too hard. Then it didn't work. My father fixed it on the day he got batteries for my MindMania Spelling Clip.
