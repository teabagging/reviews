A nice departure from usual organized crime films about italian families or the modern day rap star gang bangers. Denzel Washington is a fabulous actor. He consumes the leading role of Frank Lucas, a man from Carolina that is tutored under a crime boss in Harlem for 15 years. After his mentor passes away, he fights to maintain the \\"kingdom\\" that was established. He revolutionizes the way that his \\"type\\" of business is conducted. Being a true story, I'm glad they didn't only glamourize the gangster lifestyle. They show the way that the drug trade affects the everyday people, including showing junkies passed out on filthy floors while Frank and his family eat Thanksgiving dinner. There's a certain morality to the story once you reach the end of the film.

I like it on small wheat crackers and one wedge, is plenty for a quick before dinner snack.This cheese comes in several flavors such as French Onion and Garlic and Herb, which are nothing to throw stones at, but I like the original creamy Swiss the best.All in all, this is a nice little box of cheese spread to have handy for those instant hunger attacks.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's exactly what I wanted.","review":"It completes my set of volumes 1, 2 & 3.

This is the perfect book for you if you are new to Perl. The style of the book is to explain concepts by giving simple details and by following these details with clear and complete Perl programs. So that the book would also have appeal for all Perl programmers, there are also many advanced topics in the book which are generally not covered in an introductory text. These include Web Programming (CGI), Database Programming (DBI) and Graphical User Interface Programming (using Tk)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unneccesarily Complicated Examples","review":"I am a technical trainer and had the unfortunate task of teaching a Perl class using this book.

He also starts using functions in early examples without first explaining what the function does. How can you learn arrays when his example has looping though he hasnt explained it yet? His examples are unneccesarily complex and could be written simply to get the same point accross.A much better book is 'Teach Yourself Perl in 24 Hours' Second Edition by Clinton Pierce.

What I got instead was the filming of people possessed by their sect's spirits during bizarre rituals and people dancing about with fake breasts attached to strange attire. Yes, one can see different types of instruments used througout the world, but their uniqueness and purpose is totally ignored. With some escoteric clips of the Bayreuth festival and its wealthy patrons, some unexpected nudity and a vague installment with the conductor John Eliot Gardiner, the video scrapes the bottom of the barrel.In viewing the tape's third world music offering and even Bayreuth, the music making itself and its intrinsic value takes a back seat to the sensationalism producer Jeremy Marre affords the socialisms, rituals and bizarre costumes.

Evergrey, like a lot of prog-metal bands, utilizes a cheesy synth from time to time, but it really works on this album, with the sci-fi spacey theme. They are also further back in the mix than on other efforts, and the result is terrific atmosphere over a powerful, though musically limited band.

The rap is good, though I have to say I'm not feeling the R&B tracks too much as they reminded me of the first Aftermath compilation. (A few more listens through and they may grow on me.) On the other hand, Dre and Snoop are in fine form as always, Busta Ryhmes is out in space somewhere waiting for all of us to catch up, and regardless of what Amazon's review said, D12's track is a cool little party jam. It should be noted here that Eminem produced this track. Very, very nice work. His skills are somewhat slept on as a producer and they shouldn't be. Same thing goes for SupaFly. Very slept on, but very dope.All in all this CD is definitely a worthwhile purchase. I mean, we get Dre, Snoop, Em, and one of the phattest tracks in recent memory by Busta Rhymes.

Simply beautiful.I have not been disappointed with the rest of the album either to say the least. If you don't believe me, look up some of this stuff on YouTube (like I did) and you can get a feel for their music (in my opinion, some of it's the kind of stuff I could see being on the soundtrack for an action/heist movie or something along those lines). But they definitely know how to tap into your emotions musically. And really, you can't beat the price here for good music.

The dialogue is robotic, and poor. The plot is bad. The budget is way below low. I could live with a low budget if the story was in the least bit worth watching. This movie is not even interesting at all. There is no character developement. I could live with the \\"Dubbing\\" if the movie kept my interest, but it doesn't at all.

The print of First Spaceship on Venus is from the butchered Crown International release and is in rough shape. The contrast is horrible, the colors run from oversaturated to faded and the full screen images are just that - full screen images. No pans or scans here! The print of Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet is in better shape. This is the American International Television version and is again presented in full screen minus any attempts to pan and scan. Colors are faded and there are actually a couple of emulsion flakes caught in the film gate (shades of high school projection). Both films are just as confusing and slow as I remember them from their original release. The ancillary material on disc is amateurish and worthless. This DVD is a waste even at this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoughts of 'First Spaceship on Venus'","review":"This DVD is in need of cleaning up. The images are quite blurry, out of focus and the color seems to be washed out quite a bit. It was probably pulled from a VHS at one point or from very old and un-kept 35mm reals, the transfer was not entirely successful. The story itself is different though. It does become 'long running' after a while. They do have one of the coolest looking spaceships I have ever seen in a SciFi movie though, I have to give them that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chopped to bits","review":"This version is so chopped up that it's difficult to tell what's going on. I can't help thinking that there might have been an interesting movie in there, but between the awkward dubbing into English and the abrupt jumps in scenes, it's just too difficult to follow to be really fun.An attempt at scientific accuracy (for what was known in 1959) seems to have been attempted in the first few minutes of the movie, but as it goes on it gets increasingly wacky; losing any pretense of being hard science fiction. It's visually interesting at points; that's about all it has going for it. It does get points for the interracial crew and a decent spaceship. But it's hard to recommend this one, overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth watching","review":"Surprisingly good for an old sci fi movie.

I'm not sure how Amazon associates reviews with titles but comments on the DEFA version shouldn't apply to this DVD which is a St Clair Vision release. The St Clair Vision release is the 80 minute version, not a 130 minute version, despite what the DVD box says and despite what Amazon says. Amazon should correct their information and give some grief to the distributor. I'm returning the DVD as I already have the shorter version in other collections. I'd give the film itself a higher rating - I appreciate it for where it was coming from at the time and, frankly, as camp fun - so this rating is based soley on the false advertising."},{"rating":"1","title":"incorrectly labeled - now corrected","review":"This is the 80-minute version chopped for US distribution, not the 130-minute European version.

The story is a little herky-jerky in its shortened form, but the movie is still interesting for fans of old sci-fi, and some original plot elements almost compensate for the primitive special effects and stereotypical characters.***Another addendum: in response to Brian Thibodeau's comments, I rechecked my copy of this DVD which I purchased here on Amazon.

In the US, 900 and 1800 are not used for cell phones. T-mobile uses 1900 and roams on 850. ATT works primarily on 850 with some 1900. In the past, I used this phone with a T-Mobile SIM all across the US, and it worked almost everywhere I went. In those areas where there was only a 850 signal and no 1900 signal it would not work.

We should all conform to the lowest common denominator. Well SOME of us are bored by your 3-chord blunderbusses like Third Eye Blind and your self-absorbed posers like Kid Rock. We want to be able to sit and listen to a song and hear something NEW in it each time we listen to it. Air provides some of that in this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful album!","review":"A lot of people have given this album less than favorable reviews. Their comments are justified to a certain extent. This album is definitley love it or hate. One review stated that this was prog rock. That is correct to an extent, you can definitely hear echoes(pun intended) of pink floyd and peter gabriel era genesis and also german rock like Neu!. Personally I think that every track is strong and that this is their best album, although Moon Safari and Premiers Symptomes should be purchased first, once you wear out those albums then buy 10000 Hz Legend, and after you wear that out by The Virgin Suicides Soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Moon Safari","review":"The day this album came out I rushed to buy it. It was very exciting for me because Air are a favourite band of mine.I put it onto the stereo and began listing - I was delighted by the first track but at first the new synth voice wasn't my cup of tea however I have become very fond of it. The next few tracks I must admit were not my sort of thing in fact they were not Air like I know Air. There are a couple of other great tracks on this album although I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who likes the proper Air."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disaster!!","review":"...Air is very good when they concentrate in what they do best which is instrumental music. An exception to this is the beautifully crafted song All I Need from the Moon Safari CD. In this CD they venture into songs that really don't go anywhere. This has to be by far the worst CD I have ever purchased. And I have over 700 CD's in my collection. It sounds so dissonant and amateurish at times that I couldn't believe it was the same group who did Moon Safari, Premiers Symptomes and the soundtrack from Virgin Suicides. Please, do not believe the Pink Floyd references. The only piece of music of Pink Floyd that sounds similar to this is the howling of the dog from the CD Animals. It is impossible to pin point a fault or a weakness in this project because is a complete disaster. If you are curious about this CD just wait a couple of days and buy it used. I guarantee you that the used CD market will be flooded with this piece of garbage. A major disappointment from two good musicians."},{"rating":"1","title":"10,000 Hz disappointment","review":"Moon Safari and Premier Symptomes are two of my all time favorite albums.

Get lost, I say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indie pop continues to ruin electronic music","review":"When a band's entire body of work is based around irony and kitsch, one begins to suspect that they simply don't have anything original or interesting to say.There are a few so-so moments on this album, but it's impossible to escape the self-absorbed, look-how-inauthentic-we-are schtick. Schmaltzy pop arrangements, accompanied by cheesy drum machine beats and love-song lyrics sung by a Macintosh - did the world really need this? Guys, if you don't have anything meaningful to say, just shut up. The signal-to-noise ratio in pop culture is bad enough as it is.The only thing stopping me from giving this album one star is the last track, \\"Caramel Prisoner\\", which is *almost* a good song. At least, I can listen to it all the way through without cringing, unlike the rest of the disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another letdown","review":"Even though \\"Virgin Suicides\\" was a huge disappointment, I resigned myself to believing that Air just wasn't quite ready to begin scoring films (although it probably seemed like a good idea in theory). I hoped for a return to form on their next studio album, but while you can hear slight echoes of Moon Safari all over this CD, sadly, none of these tracks even come close to anything on that brilliant debut. In fact, having recently listened to Safari again to see if I had misjudged Air, one can only ask: where is Beth Hirsch when we need her most?"},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding effort","review":"it seems that some older fans of air are sort of cleaved into two camps over this new release. I find 10,000 Hz to be darker, more brooding, and less gummy than Moon Safari. I like both recordings quite alot. But they are very different. IN A GOOD WAY. Get this record and listen to it. Give yourself some time to digest and understand. Its more complex, more intricate, and more elusive. It seem to be a natural organic extension of the previous efforts. More advanced musically, more evolved technically. I can't seem to understand why fans of Moon can't get 10,000Hz....quit whining and listen-"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a bad smell in the Air !","review":"I bought this album with great excitment only to find that the band I loved so much had lost all ability of creating beautiful music.

This is a good record if you like DEITER'S DANCE CLUB on SNL."},{"rating":"1","title":"When I first got it I hated it....","review":"This album is louder than Moon Safari. When I put it on in my car, I just about blew my head off from the pounding I got from the subwoofer (I had been listening to something quiter and the volume was cranked). It annoyed me because not only did it not provide me with that warm mellow feeling I craved but it annoyed fellow motorists too. Yes the first track has bass. My initial conclusion was that this is the sort of CD destined for people who don't necessarily like music, rather the noise it makes. The sort of person who you can hear several blocks away when driving.That aside, I've been listening to it. And I don't hate it. But I don't like it. Air, I fear, have lost thier innocence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overindulgent artists stuck in-between","review":"2 1/2Make no mistake, there are a couple beautiful songs on here (or at least several which have beautiful parts inside the experimental electronic confusion), but for the most part people who slap the ol' sophomore slump label upon Air's much anticipated follow up to Moon Safari would be in the clear. In labored, pretentious, but shallow structural dabblings the French duo strain for an artsy depth merely hinted at with their spacey, more intuitive debut. Between the often stilted compositions and a few awkward genre leaps, 10,000 Hz becomes clouded by it's own self-absorption. One hardly notices then, quite a few contrastingly solid ideas inserted into the bloated disc, hinting at the more complex, melodically driven approach that would usher in Talkie Walkie's warmer reception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurm.","review":"I haven't really warmed to this CD yet. And yes I do love Premiers Symptomes and Moon Safari, but I don't think I was just expecting more of the same. I like a few tracks (Electronic Performers, Radian, The Vagabond), but what I really find annoying is the use of the Macintalk voice on How Does It Make You Feel. IMO that Mac voice synthesizer is SO annoying, for me it makes an otherwise interesting track unlistenable. Not to mention that this has already been overdone by other artists (Radiohead, Pink Floyd)..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"Air is one of many dance groups from france, but apart from Superfunk, Modjo and Daft Punk they are doing more slow relax music then electro kind of like Royksopp, nothing bad with that cause many songs on the album are exellent if you like that kind of dance but when they put Beck in the mix they lose all credability and respect from me. Some songs are as far away from dance as you can come, some decent relax music and a few exceptions are pop-dance, \\"Radio #1\\" is good, a pop-dance tune with good hook. I thought the album wuld be much harder, the title gives me the feeling of something more electronic, however it's allright but nothing that will go down in history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Air..........Smooth, Flowing and addictive","review":"10,000 Hz Legend adds to the legacy of Air. It flows seamlessly from high and low transitions making it into a perfect flow of rhythm.

Its their desicion on what they do, and in my mind, was a great one. 10,000 hz Legend is an electronic beauty, this experiment was a mastermind desicion, the songs have so much power, esspecially electronic performers. My favourite songs would have to be Electronic Performers by far, dont be light, people in the city, how does it make you feel, radio #1. Great album, will enjoy forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...","review":"Air just keeps going downhill. \\"Premiers Symptomes\\" was excellent. \\"Moon Safari\\", despite the dumb title, had its excellent moments. But I should've seen it coming with the tracks \\"Sexy Boy\\" and \\"Remember\\", two horrible, horrible euro-pop clunkers. The cover of the album \\"10,000 Hz\\" pretty much explains the content: interesting at first, kind of silly, then you realize what it is...poor, overbearing art. Someone explain to me why \\"Radio #1\\" is so darn good? By the time I got to \\"People in the City\\" I was thoroughly shocked.Air's saving grace is its good background melodies. As for vocals and effects, I don't know what the fudge Dunckel and Godin were thinking. What happened to the mellow, 70's feel of \\"Symptomes\\"? What about the airy tracks of \\"Safari\\" and \\"The Virgin Suicides\\"? I know that Air are \\"artists\\", and they must \\"evolve\\", but for Christ's sake! Make music for humans, not computers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very mixed and mostly misguided effort","review":"... The most embarrassing tracks on this album (at least 1,2,3,maybe 5,maybe 9) are full of jejune chord progressions, inane lyrics, and bad synthesized vocals that could be background tracks to a bad \\"B\\" movie. ... This should be titled \\"25,000 Hz Legend\\" because then only dogs and bats could be listening. Unfortunately, you have interesting tracks such as 10-Don't Be Light and 11-Caramel Prisoner which are worth a listen in their own right (as are Beck's pieces), so I can't be entirely dismissive of this effort. What was interfering with Air's musical sensibilities early on in this album? Beck's supplying free pralines?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep the cover, toss the album","review":"Another reviewer raved its like 'Kraftwerk meets Pink Floyd'. I don't want either of those bands to shake hands, much less meet.I can't think of a bigger disappointment this year other than my last haircut.

Its hard to pick on one track because they offend the senses equally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like a bunch of experimental crap","review":"This album is NOTHING like Moon Safari. It seriously sounds like some of the bizarre things I hear on college radio and Shoutcast stations with poor playlists. To their credit, no two songs sound alike. But I never complain about songs sounding alike if it's a song I like to hear. The songs on this album are... different. They start off one way, then go off in some other direction like some kind of tangent. It's weird. Some people like this kind of weird, some don't.

Premiers Symptomes is pretty good. So is the Virgin Suicides soundtrack. Those last two aren't amazing, but they have their moments.So, I was all excited when I heard about 10hz Legend coming out. I was equally disappointed when I finally heard the album. Very different from their earlier works, and most of it isn't worth your time. The only tracks I recommend are Vagabond and Radian. Those two are great, but it's Beck that makes Vagabond so awesome. Radian recalls some of their early work. If you can get your hands on those tracks while avoiding the rest, you'll be doing well.

It's definitely a change in direction for the French duo. That said, it's not that great either. Tracks like \\"Radian\\" manage to salvage the album as a whole, but others, like \\"Wonder Milky Bitch\\" are just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get into this","review":"I have heard Air quite a bit on XM in the past couple of years, and their music always seems to get my attention. So, when I saw this in a local pawn shop a few days ago, I thought it would make for some neat listening in my newly-purchased 2005 Ford Five Hundred. I played it a couple of times when I realized this collection just wasn't what I was hoping it would be - that it might sound very interesting on first listen but the novelty starts fading fast upon repeated listens. I believe that Air has much better music available than this direction-less, experimental fluff. I'd recommend avoiding this album and try some of their others."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY interesting","review":"Well, it's certainly not as immediately gratifying like Moon Safari, but that seems to be a good thing. Unlike other reviewers, i really liked this album the first time I heard it, yet something seemed a bit off about it. That \\"thing\\" kept me coming back for repeated listenings. It really has grown with each listening. I love things that manage to be completely goofy and friggin beautiful at the same time. I don't think it is a perfect album, but I think it is just as good, if not better than Moon Safari (which I would also give 4 stars). I don't think there is a bad song here, but The Vagabond is VERY MUCH out of place, It is a great song, but it belongs on a Beck album, not this one. I much prefer Beck's guest work on Don't be light. On that Track he is integrated into Air's song instead of being the whole show. But this is the only song that sticks out, and like I said, it's still a good song. It's a great album and definately worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss it it is quite special","review":"I come from a \\"techno\\" background and bought the cd a couple of month ago.

This is how they're categorised in shops, this is how they got famous, they even won \`Best Techno album of the year' in the French equivalent of the Brits in 99 (Which Musical dictionary are the French using? Air - Techno?) but I swear if this album is Dance music then Kylie Minogue should really be treated as Indie or Post-Grunge. They trick us and we love it, don't we? They do cool music under the coolest contemporary umbrella - Dance and we can like them without being accused of liking Progressive Rock or some bizarre alternative stuff.

A corded drill is a pain and doesn't give the control you need for countersinking screw holes and screwing cabinets together.

A RA drill is not for drilling 2 bys and a 14.4 v will never last for the day in that application. That's what I use my 18v for. But for drilling & screwing up to 2-1/2\\" screws in tight quarters this drill will last most of the day and works great.

To make the experience complete don't forget your accordion (which they use on several songs along with bells and gayflute) and be sure to wear your elf costume. You know, the one with the pointy shoes with the bells on the tips.

Filling in the gaps of so many metal genres and alieviating the need for classification.This particular album may sound to many like a more contemporary Isis, still with a touch of hardcore in the likes of Converge.This album moves slow and progresses with thick and almost ethereal tone.I myself noticed the guitar effects much like \\"The Cure\\" during \\"Disentegration\\" and \\"Wish\\" (many hardcore bands do the same)Have no doubt this album is a moving experience. As a yoga afficianado of 6 years I have found only 3 bands I can do my yoga while listeneing to, one of them is this amazing and insiparational elegant band, the others being of similar cerebral quality and appeal, Neurosis and Tool will be most likely welcome friends to people likeing Isis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Panopticon instead!!!","review":"Panopticon MUCH better album,this one has some tracks that are just noise.Quite annoying as Isis makes some incredible music.There are a few good tracks on this,but there is no flow due to the occasional noise track.Panopticon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nevermind the Chinese Dictionary","review":"I stood for the whole performance.

There is a clean openess to his playing on all he does, from almost roots Bluegrass to more contemporary modes. This is GREAT driving music, specifically away from major urban centers. Sometimes I become afraid that it almost borders on easy listening, but since there are no wind instruments and the bluegrass is always there, there are no problems. It is bluegrass, but cleaner, perhaps a little less gutsy but no less passionate. It avoids the hummingbird and ballad quality that can become a little (just a little) tiring in traditional bluegrass.If you are looking for music that sings without words, look for anything using Russ Barenberg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for NY Admissions","review":"Very good as a first book to get acquainted with the private school admissions system.

Some were covered in a line or two; others in a page or two. While I initially enjoyed reading about each event, by the time it got to Massachusetts, I was wishing a good editor had excised about 25% of them. I found myself skimming by then and wishing it would end.I'm not sure if the earlier hardback had photos or maps but the paperback had neither.

The LaScala staging is a major star of this production - absolutely beautiful - no expense spared. Corelli's video is out of print, Domingo's is dull, so go for Carreras - you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your first choice","review":"As my title has indicated, for those who are interested in the French and Indian War, the first choice is the PBS version, not this one.This piece has the run time less than one hour, definitely not thorough enough to cover the whole story of this war. I guarantee that you cannot see the whole picture after you have finished this film. In addition, the making of this film is not so smooth, nor delightful to watch. It, however, gives a deeper analysis on certain parts of this war. For those who have been familiar with this war, this could be a bright side.On the whole, this film could serve as a supplement, not for general-purpose use."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with above","review":"I too found this film far less than comprehensive...not as good as \\"The War that Made America\\". However neither is excellent. Why with all the detailed DVD's and audio books about the American Revolution we cannot get a decent excellent production on the French and Indian or Seven Years War? I wish I had a few million to put together a documentary. Hell even popular films are few and far betweeen...\\"Last of the Mohicans\\", \\"North by Northwest\\"....doesn't anyone care about North America's first big war or the world's first World War?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Filer kit to have","review":"Filter kit for 77mm I use with Sigma 24-60 f/2.8 lens. Filters are everything I expected. They fit smoothly on the thread, glass quality is high. UV and polarizing filters do the job flawlessly.

And nice touch - filter kit came with a very nice hard leather case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low cost filter kit that does the job","review":"I was looking for an inexpensive yet quality filter kit for my new 77mm 12-24mm lens.

I don't know if I'll ever use the fluorescent filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it should be","review":"Not what I expected from the man who rips it to shreds on \\"Who was in my room last night.\\" So much of it is just too contrived. The vocals are terrible, high-pitched, and made my stomach hurt. He plays everything himself, which is admirable, but all of the performances, save for some of the guitar work, lack the gusto I would expect from him. The songs are weird and very hard to enjoy. A lot of forced synth sounds that sound off key and very dull percussion that works more as a metronome and less like an instrument. I found myself skipping to the next song 30 seconds into each one, usually when he started singing. \\"Is it Mikey\\" is OK, but it is the sole exception. This record is an oddball in any collection, but no worth being put into rotation. Sorry Paul."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Fireproof\\"","review":"I didn't particularly like this record, but I can tell it was made by people that definitely know what they're doing. My hat is off to them regarding the nice, thick production. This is a solid, white guy rock album, with few flaws when heard in that context. These guys are confident players, without being flashy. The songwriting and arranging is precise and coherent, in fact they even approach greatness with the track \\"Heartbeat Mosaic\\". Overall, it's excellently done, just not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Civil War Snapshot","review":"Swamp Doctor is filled with tidbits of Civil War life in 1862-63. Here is a 36-year-old doctor from Western New york, already twiced widowed and two young sons at home with live-in caregivers. Dr.Smith is regimental surgeon for a while, then goes home for a while to check on his boys and court his third wife, and returns to the often slow-paced War of the Rebellion. Surgeon Smith is a captivating storyteller and once you get the vision of life in camp and at home, it is hard to put the book down. Author Lowry has enriched the story with historical events, which adds to the relevance of Dr. Smith's experiences. If you have a passion for the Civil War, or are interested in what it was like being a surgeon in the swamps of Virginia and North Carolina, or just enjoy good non-fiction reading, Swamp Doctor is a book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good as expected","review":"The only thing I would say I did not like was that it was needed a ring adapter on my DMC Z7 and this cause the lens borders appear on picture"},{"rating":"1","title":"For page-flippers only","review":"Simply put, using this guidebook is one of the most frustrating experiences any traveller can have.

I am lucky I didn't burn myself.Then Nokia refused to help me out and told me that it was \\"out of warranty\\", which is ridiculous because I bought it in January 2007.If you want a nice, boring, simple phone, with no bells and whistles like a camera or whatever, then I recommend the Samsung T-209.

None of the Jabra headsets work with this phone. There are two \\"earbud\\" headsets that work, and one horrible over-the-ear headset (you can get this one here at Amazon for under $10, if you wish to throw away $10).

As for the music, this is a nice meaty slab of metal that should satisfy the palate of any metalhead. It is my belief that European bands can stomp all over their American counterparts talent-wise, and this album does nothing to dispel that belief. Tanya has sufficient power and vocal range to soar above the crunch and grind of the guitars, and I don't think there is one bad track on the album. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because they don't take enough chances (at least, in my opinion). I definitely look forward to their next album, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only the cheese factor wasn't sooo high...","review":"What a cheesy looking album!! The singer is good looking, but why have her hunched over on the cover apparently giving the bird while showing her cleavage? And the photos on the inside are laughably atrocious. Anyway, artwork aside, the music is mostly enjoyable. They take the run-of-the-mill gothic/darkwave formula, you know, Lacuna Coil, Gathering, Flowing Tears, etc, and put a sharp pop-influenced vocal edge to it. Basically, they can take any part of any song on this album (vocals, guitars, solos, drums) and interchange that with any other song, and still be consistent. Normally I would sentence a band to hell for doing this, but some of the songs are just too damn catchy to ignore. The singing is powerful, the dual guitar work is heavy and harmonious, and even though, admittedly, its approach is too often formulaic, I dig this."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK If you have the time","review":"Not an awful idea, but customizing these cards for my organic class was a little more than time consuming.

Great for the GMAT, GRE, or any other graduate level exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful","review":"After buying these cards I realized that the real study value of flash cards is making them for yourself. That has to account for at least half of the learning that you do.

I ended up making my own the same way that I always do.

The material was structured somewhat sensibly, but in a order very different from our textbook. This made using them more work than it was worth, as our in book chapter summaries were far more useful. These have sat on the shelf and collected dust for years and I don't foresee them ever becoming useful. On a side note - they have a horrendous chemical smell from something in the production process.If you're looking for something to help you succeed in O-Chem, buy a Molecular Model kit or a Study/ Solution guide for your textbook. These will actually be helpful, while these study cards will likely be of little use in conjunction with a course."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a colossal waste of money!","review":"These cards don't help at all. They are basically just an abridged text book (paragraphs and all) printed on 200+ separate cards. In fact, my textbook has more useful summarization tables, examples and diagrams. Furthermore the cards themselves are bulky and cumbersome to hold. If I hadn't taken the plastic off, I would take them back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall, there is no need to purchase this card set","review":"The main problem with OrgoCards is that it is not really a set of two sided flash cards. It is simply a shortened text book in card form. The cards are not 3 X 5 index cards and they contain a lot of information on them, much of which is not really necessary. You are better off making your own flashcards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superfluous","review":"These cards are overkill, they are simply too extensive. The majority of people buying this product will be applying to medical school or studying for organic chemistry. The problem is that there is much more information than is required on either the MCAT or the big ACS (American Chemical Society) test that is usually used as the Organic Chem 2 final exam.These cards are not useful as flashcards to review reactions or mechanisms because of their size (twice the size of a normal notecard) and (again) the massive amount of information they have. Bacially, this product is like a textbook in notecard form. This sounds like a good idea, but in practice there is simply too much material to make them a worthwhile review. You're better off using the much more simplistic notecards most people typcially make for organic chemistry."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very helpful","review":"I purchased these cards hoping to improve my understanding and also to use them for reviewing before tests in my organic chem 2 class. The cards were not useful for either task. If you don't already understand the material from class the cards won't help clarify material. In addition, many of the reactions were not even covered by my instructor, particularly in the aldehyde/ketone section of the cards. This could confuse the heck out of someone.

And it is an Oxford Preess book which puts it high on my list.If it is well done there is hardly an aspect of the Civil War that is more easily made fascinating than the Missouri problems. The guerrilla war is interesting by itself and when history is well written it becomes fascinating. The characterization makes this read like a novel, but one thoroughly researched.

As far as the paste, my cat LOVES that stuff, she starts to meow and comes running when I get the tube out and I put it on my finger and she licks it right off, but again I don't know if it does anything to help calm her down. I bought all of these in preparation for moving to a new apartment and wanted to use them at the new place, I did plug in the diffuser on the first day and had been giving her some of the paste every night starting before the move.

Travolta is great in it although the film hardly saved his career after BattleField Earth, he still might as well do Look Who's Talking 4.

A cyberheist movie with an overly convoluted and meandering plotline and a few disinteresting hyperpryrotechnic set pieces, this adds yet another project to the list of recent Travolta stinkers.Travolta plays Gabriel, an arrogant self-appointed vigilante who resorts to thieving and the murder of innocents to finance his antiterrorist schemes. Halle Berry is his accomplice. She manages to entice Hugh Jackman, who plays the world's greatest hacker, into working for them by baring her breasts. Jackman's adolescent spastic, drooling reaction is indicative of the maturity level of this film. Not much else can be said. This picture is strictly a throwaway, and the producers should have followed their instincts.As one of the characters says, referencing DOG DAY AFTERNOON, \\"It's a morality play. The bad guys can't win.\\" In SWORDFISH the audience can't win. It's eminently unwatchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately 5 Stars!","review":"When \\"Swordfish\\" first came out, I wasn't interested in seeing it nor did I wish to see it. Although I was forced to see it when my sister and my mom were dying to see it, which would result in leaving me home alone. So I went to see it, planning to sleep in the theatre but... TADA!

This movie is so bad, although it could have been good if you consider the world of hacking and how people could go to extreme criminal lengths with it.

Seriously, this is two hours of my life I'll never get back.If you want to watch some edgy film style, watch memento. If you want to watch a Hacker movie, see the Matrix again.

A topless Halle Berry---I really didn't see the hoopla over her boobla-------and some interesting special effects with computers and graphics but ultimately its a Mission Impossible episode gone on too long. John Travolta over acts----hopefully on purpose. Halle Berry plays sultry and shocked---two notes, and Jackman plays reluctantly moral. Everyone is \\"playing\\" something and why is that? I think it's because Dominic Sena's direction is really great here. The use of slow motion and angle shifting is really inspired and it's very difficult to create balance. Great direction may mean lackluster acting or a shoddy script. It takes a lot to bring all three of these elements together into a synthesis. Its a little scary when I actually liked teh special effects more than a film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swordfish:action and wit personified","review":"This movie should be considered an action powerhouse.From the beginning to the end I was at the edge of my seat wondering what the next move would be.

The only saving grace is the special effects, and for that there are many other movies around. Beats me why talented professionals like Halle Berry and John Travolta agreed to do this nonsense. Berry doesn't do much except take off her clothes at every available opportunity. It's a bad rehash of Dog Day Afternoon, with a plot line so unbelievable that one wonders how the actors found their way through it - and then one realises they didn't. A total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"watch the opening scene and then turn it off","review":"This really starts with a bang, the opening scene is very well done, and really blew me away. but what happens afterwards, nothing, every effrot seems to have been made creating the opening scenene, and the rest of the movie tacked on as an afterthought.Theres some really really bad performances notabley from vinnie jones and halle berry, and frankly, i could care less about a brief flash of her soft focus flesh, which seemed to be the main adolescent selling point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um....NO!","review":"This movie was AWESOME....LY TERRIBLE!!! Great opening, mild ending, overall 10-15 minutes of good footage. The rest is ... Some megalomaniacs who love Rambo and other ... fast movies might enjoy this one.

Most of the action seemed completely pointless - as in the director was thinking \\"Oh this is an action movie - we need to put in a car chase somewhere - hey it can go here.\\" The same thing for the nudity. While I know a big draw to this movie is Halle - it just seemed so pointless - as it really didn't add anything to the scene. There were several other places where they put shots like that in -- and there wasn't any reason for them.This was one of the few movies that I really wanted to walk out on.

Rent it if you don't believe me.","review":"I bought the DVD after seeing Swordfish in the theater, mostly because I was impressed with the effects. While truly blockbuster in effects, even the talent (and body) of the fine Halle Berry can't support the lurching, smarmy dischord of the Point-Break-rehash script or Travolta's tired, played-out badguy act.

The picture is astonishingly clear and vivid through blu-ray conversion. John Travolta plays a fairly decent bad guy and the story has some twists that keep your attention. I thought the plot was rather ridiculous though, but definitely an original. The motive for the characters wasn't just for a lot of money, like every other boring action movie, but the actual use of the money was the motivation. Good guy needed money to get his daughter back, bad guy needed money for anti-terrorism in his own demented way. Nothing great, but overall, a fun movie to watch on blu-ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat watchable...","review":"After hearing all the bad hype about this movie, I saw the DVD just to satisfy my curiousity.It was watchable. Some good action scenes but the acting wasn't much to write home about. A good enough movie to watch on a slow night.There's a great piece of dialogue by John Travolta in the very beginning about why Hollywood movies suck, then the movie takes it a step further and ends up proving its own point.It's nowhere near as bad as Wing Commander, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish that happened to me while tapping the keyboards","review":"Jackman is the new Clint Eastwood but I fear that the film making talent just isn't there to give him his own iconic 'Dirty Harry', an affliction troubling many up and coming Hollywood stars today. His look of bewilderment and horror at the surreal nightmare he's trapped in during the robbery burns itself on your memory. Unfortunately, his subsequent willingness to except his cut of the appalling enterprise which cost the lives of innocent hostages disappoints and disgusts, even if he has a child to support in this barely watchable and frequently ugly would-be satirical examination of 'the ends justify the means'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting!","review":"I can't believe the reviews of this movie were so bad. This is a great action movie, with or without bare breasts. It has lots of plot twists and surprises. John Travolta was great even though they made him look ugly.

The only time I paid any attention to Jackman was when he mentioned the DEC PDP-11; because I used to run that computer in the early 80's.Oh, and Sam Shepard, who played the Senator, really needs to change his one-dimensional characters he portrays in nearly every movie I've seen him in.Bad, bad movie, with too many predictable scenes.

Jackman gives a fun performance as a dancing (!) hacker who wants to get his daughter back from, for all you Soprano fans, a very drunken and drugged out Drea.

You expect this truly stunning, rollicking action ride, but for all the pyrotechnics and Travolta/Jackman/Cheadle/Berry star power, it's a yawner. Throw in some really stupid pseudo-geeky computer stuff that any real hacker would scoff at, a little kid in danger (always a cheap, stupid, easy way out for a screenwriter), and a gratuitous shot at Berry's really-not-that-impressive rack and all you have is a 2-hour waste of time that leaves you wondering what else you could have rented.For God's sake, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did it really have to be THIS dumb?","review":"Slick and savvy terrorist Travolta recruits ex-computer hacker genius(Hugh Jackman)to transfer billion dollar funds from a forgotten account.

The plot stabs in all directions without hitting anything substantial, more wrapped up in looking cool than going anywhere, and has its priorities so far out of whack that it actually expects the audience to deify the same character that's shown casually slaughtering dozens of innocents in the very first scene.

Had no idea this was part of a large series until I went to look for more titles by same author. To my mind Elizabeth George is far superior to Nora Roberts, Iris Johansen, Mary Higgins Clark, or Sue Grafton who seem too formulaic after you read George. She is just much better at drawing characters that live and breathe. You're not just reading a book about them, you're in their company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! But call out the SPCC...","review":"If you've never read any of Elizabeth George's novels, this is as good a place as any to start. By the way, she writes novels, not just \\"mystery novels.\\"This book works as a novel, as a mystery, as a puzzle, as a soap opera, as a sheer entertainment page-turner, and as a travelogue. You get a lot of bang for your reading buck.Poor, poor Barbara Havers... I think there should be a society for the prevention of cruelty to characters. I feel so sorry for her.Fantastic (in both senses of the word) plot twists.As it happens, I am extremely dense about guessing whodunnit. I just read mysteries for the atmosphere, the characters, the story, the procedure, and the background. But Elizabeth George has pulled off what for me is a very rare experience--I didn't guess whodunnit, but at the end I actually feel that I ought have been able to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping mystery","review":"Despite the plot flaws (some of which I hadn't really paid attention to until I read other reviews on this site) this book was gripping from start to finish.

I agree with several other reviewers here, who have said that there is absolutely no hint of how Lynley et al were able to determine who the kidnapper/murderer is, until the book's climax. One thing that I have to get off my chest, though, is the little critical blurb on the front cover of the paperback edition. It says something to the effect that this book combines \\"the eloquence of P.D. James with a story John Grisham would envy\\". I'll agree with the part about Ms. James - she's another excellent mystery writer. But John Grisham? Of course he would envy this story - that hack couldn't write his way out of a paper bag!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not one of my favorites","review":"Even though I'm a Elizabeth Goerge fan, I had trouble \\"entering into the story\\" and buying it.

There have been a few favorable comments so far which really surprises me. I think they must be people who just love anything British.

All busy MP's of that era and cirrently would hire a top-notch nanny for their child.

I found the book to be very suspenseful, but after finishing found what I believe to be a logical flaw in the plot which ruined the overall experience.

I think this book is full of fascinating information on how to eat healthier, and how proper eating can impact your long term health. My only criticism would be with the daily menus. While most of the dishes sound delicious, the breakfast and lunch recipes are far too involved for what most people have time to fix. One lunch recipe took 50 minutes to cook, not to mention prep time. Only on the weekend would I have the time or inclination to make most of those dishes and that defeats the point of adding these foods to your daily life. However, I have found ways to add some of these foods to what I already eat, and this book has certainly made me more aware of what I buy at the supermarket.

A healthy approach to eating as a means of preventing disease or promoting wellness, this book should prove useful for anyone. As someone who already ate fairly healthy, I used it to move to the next level. The book offers a lot of great information on adjusting your diet, which you can apply all at once or gradually.

It's really just a fantastic little movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly Crazy for \\"Crazies\\"","review":"This George Romero film, which (like Night of the Living Dead) was filmed in the small town of Evans City, in Western PA, revolves around what happens after a military plane crashes. The residents who come into contact with whatever the plane carried either die or go insane. Of course the government bungles the containment and a few protagonists attempt to escape the town. There are a few humorous moments, intentional and otherwise. The film is clearly a Romero flop. Of course, if you relate it to FEMA incompetency in recent disasters, it makes its own kind of sense. And, as in most Romero films, human incompetency is much scarier than an alien monster. If I hadn't lived in Evans City, PA, I probably would have rated \\"Crazies\\" as only 1 star, but seeing my former neighbors go insane, made me realize that Geroge Romero may have known, all along, what I had only suspected about the residents, leaving me with a tiny bit of self-satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful reminder of atrocious cult film acting","review":"Can't remember seeing a more atrocious example of acting since Cuba Gooding's Direct-to-DVD releases.The producer and director must have recruited every podunk, no-talent actor from the backwaters of \\"Trailer-Trash U.S.A.\\" You do not want to watch any further than the first 10 minutes. Honestly, there are better amateur production \\"shorts\\" by high school and college-age students on YouTube than this crap.As always, in the early years of \\"cult classics\\" the acting by the majority of players is nauseating; as they seem to be reading lines from queue cards off the set.

The military, or what appears like extras in cheap army clothing, start to order martial law except a few hot headed guys break out. Each time the military is shown on the screen, Romero has some corny drum beating like we are too stupid to figure out that the army is there. Absolutely no suspense and an awful ending to boot...."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're CRAZY if u watch this","review":"One word, \\"HORRIBLE\\"! This movie was ANNOYING in more ways than one.

This picture got on my nerves & not in a positive way due to the unnecessary yelling. I saw the remake & enjoyed it immensely!! Great remake George but your original version would receive zero stars if permitted. I am a huge George Romero fan & obtain all his movies but this 70's flick is by far the worst film he has ever created.

Johnny Pine is a man adrift -- a successful night-manager for exclusive hotels, he spends his time carefully forgetting his past in the SAS, and trying to forget how to feel.This is probably the most Greene-like of le Carre's novels; the action is driven by Pine's need for atonement for sins we know of and sins sins he barely hints at. It's richer, more complex and better-written than its forbear, but to some extent it lacks the melancholy ring of truth that made _Spy Who..._ so effective as an antidote to the romantic spy fiction of its day.

Can't wait for Bear City 2!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and terrible!","review":"A horrible and depressing portrayal of everything that is superficial, cliche, and stereotypical about the gay (and bear) community. I can't help but wonder if this movie was produced by a bunch of bear hating homophobes, they did the gay community and bear community a disservice with this crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"awful!!","review":"this movie was awful. i don't understand any of these positive reviews. the acting was dreadful and the characters unrealistic. i was annoyed by the steretypical asian roommate, the unbelieveable couple who argue because one of them wanted lap band surgery (really???), and the lack of chemistry between the lead and the so-called 'bear' he has the hots for."},{"rating":"1","title":"mostly monochromatic","review":"The cover says it effectively: the bears are white and the men of color are twinks here. This film takes place in New York City, the home of hundreds of thousands of Black, Brown, and Yellow men. Nevertheless, MOST of the bears here are of one ancestry. I didn't say ALL; let me be clear. Still, this was terribly un-diverse. \\"BearCity\\" joins countless other low-budget gay films that support Eurocentricity and throw men of color to the sidelines. Even a doubly-oppressed population can be unjust or far from inclusive. I'm not surprised by the lack of diversity, but it rubs me the wrong way even still. I hope one day a work with bears of color would be filmed and distributed. That would be da bomb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I paid $13 for this?","review":"This movie is so bad it's embarrassing. It's as if a group of a dozen friends in NYC were sitting around drinking one evening and one of them said, \\"Hey, let's make a movie!\\"Anyone know how to go about getting one's money back from Amazon?"},{"rating":"1","title":"can a gay movie get any worse?????","review":"I DON'T WRITE REVIEWS BUT I HAVE TO PROVIDE A WORD OF WARNING TO THOSE THAT ARE ATTATED TO THIS MOVIE CAUSE OF ACTINGBAD BAD ACTING MISSED CHARATER DEVELOPMENT AND WORSE WRINTING DID'T ALLOW ME TO ENJOY THIS FILMWHAT TERRIBLE ROLE MODELS GAY STEROTYPES SHUCKING AND JIVING FOR STRAIGHT PEOPLE AND WE ARE HUMAN BEING NOT ANIMALS TO CALL \\"BEAR\\" TO EVERYBODY IS OVER WEIGTH AND HAIRYI CAN SEE WHY ITS DIRECT TO DVDI USAULLY LIKE ALL MOVIES BUT I HAVE TO SAY THIS MOVIE SUCKED YOU HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON SERIOUSLY DONT WASTE UR MONEYI ONLY I COULD GIVE IT LESS THAN 1 STARI LIKE MORE BEARCUB (CACHORRO) THAT IS A GREAT MOVIE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and funny","review":"Great production value and characters for an independent film.

If it was directed much better and had better story I would've given it a better rating maybe."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY ENTERTAINING","review":"A very nice movie to enjoy with friends.

What a waste of time reading this trash!!!","review":"This book about Robert Blake and Bonny was one of the worst books I ever read. It was torture getting through each word of this book. I would not recommend this book to anyone. If you already know Robert Blake's acting history then there is no reason to even buy this piece of trash. It does not give you anymore insight to the murder case than what we already know. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Much On career !","review":"The book focus's a lot on Robert Blakes career and his bad childhood and his bad TV shows as he says it . He never really liked doing Baretta . Book makes it sound if everything was bad for Blake from Childhood to his older adult life . He never really loved Bonny but married her cause she tricked him by getting preg , Bonny wanted to land herself a movie star and did . Bonny ran a well organized internet porn scam on mostly older men . To me the book makes Bonny Blakley look bad and makes Robert Blake look mean but yet its like everyone should feel sorry for Blake . He was called \\"creepy\\" by costars Makenzie Phillips and some others , he keep Bonny away from their daughter Rosie . A better title for the book would have been Oh Me , the miserable Robert Blake . OR a Title like Our Gangs star has rough life . FOR SURE NOT THE BEST BOOK OUT THERE ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Film noir poetry from Los Angeles","review":"I found this volume of edgy, film noir poetry strangely intriguing. The author brings you along on late night drives through the streets of Los Angeles, creating interesting characters that draw you into the poem. Landmarks of the old city, like the Ambassador Hotel, loom up in his headlights for a moment then disappear. If you're looking for happy or romantic greeting-card verses, move on. But if you enjoy film noir, the lights of the big city and just a touch of sadness in your poetry, this is the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mini Captain's Desk Organizer","review":"This is a really cute little miniature captain's desk with compartments for pens,paper,envelopes,ink,paperclips,etc. Also there are two drawers with dividers.

They are beautifully illustrated and I can't wait to cuddle with them and read them a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great classics - read them to your children!!!","review":"Ok, so I'm a little disturbed by some of the reviews here. These are the classics, and you should read them to your kids. Dark? Maybe, but no darker than reading the old testament or anything else like that. It's literature, children have been reading these stories for GENERATIONS and have turned out OK. And you know what? The original version of Rapunzel by the Brothers Grimm written in 1812 DID have Rapunzel giving birth to twins! These stories are enriching, they are stories of right and wrong, good triumphing over evil, and magic. You can't have great stories without these story lines, and in order to make the stories good - sometimes they have to be a little scary. This book is beautifully illustrated and will be a fantastic keepsake for your children. My little girl loves it. On top of the stories there are poems too, so if you feel need to hold off for some of the 'scarier' stories, get them for the poetry too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED THIS BOOK","review":"Ok, so I'm not even a child anymore but I never forgot this book. I used to read it all the time growing up, well past 8... until one day I gave all my beloved books to three boy cousins of mine and they didn't take care of them. Anyway, this is an excellent book and it's one I think that helps really young children to fall in love with reading. I was just sitting at work today and I thought about this book and wondered if I'd ever be able to get it back... and voil?!! YAY!!! :) I'm so happy to find it again, I'm ordering it right now :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully illustrated, but some surprising additions","review":"This is a very beautiful book indeed, and the vast majority of the stories included are great. Classics like Sleeping Beauty and Little Red Riding Hood are required reading for cultural literacy (not to mention just plain fun). The poetry and tall tales are good as well.I was surprised at the excerpts from larger books that were included. Selections of Peter Pan, Alice in Wonderland, The Nutcracker, and especially The Wind in the Willows were not favorites at our house. The reader is just thrown in the middle of these stories with no context as to who the characters are or what has happened before in the story. We will be skipping these selections in the future.Another surprising inclusion was a mention of children being born out of wedlock to Rapunzel, but not everyone would be surprised or offended by that.Over all, a good addition to our family's library with judicious reading on our part."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great keepsake book for your child","review":"I was looking for a book with all the classic stories to give my son as a keepsake for his first Christmas - this book ticks all the boxes. It has a hard cover, all the classic stories and fables, and has beautiful illustrations. Very happy with his book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice collection","review":"This turned out to be a nice collection for bedtime toddler reading--with some very short tales mixed with longer ones. My son really loves Stevenson's garden of verses. The art is a bit lacking and pretty much absent from some of the pages. That is my only complaint. Kids need more art to stay interested & give them something to look at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Love it!","review":"A must buy! Great stories! Awesome graphics! Your kids will remember this for time to come!!!! One of my best purchases!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my choice for a young child","review":"This is a beautiful, but dark book. While the illustrations are lovely, many of them are very dark and somewhat scary. Not appropriate for a young child or bedtime reading. We bought this for my 3 year old who loves many of the stories in the book and she was frightened by so many of them that we stopped reading from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the moraly minded","review":"This is a beautiful book and I have only read to Repunzal, but that is when it fell apart for us. In the end of the story the blinded prince is able, by some miracle, to find his beloved Repunzal whom he was to marry. But when he finds her she is not alone. No, two small children are with her. It is THEIR twins! It may not bother many to read this to their children, but I don't want my child believing it is okay to have premarital flings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Addition to Your Home Library","review":"I bought this book two years ago when my daughter was 3 years old. We had just moved to China for my husband's work and were then without access to a public (English language)library. This one book added so much depth to our home library. Two years later we are still having fun rereading many stories plus we are trying to read all the ones we haven't read, yet. I think we only have about 4 stories left. The illustrations are also beautiful. We are currently enjoying the section of stories that are excerpts from longer stories. These passages are giving me ideas of which full-length books I will want to buy next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Collection of Children's Classics","review":"I've been enjoying going back and reading the stories that were read to me as a child. My original copies of most books are long gone and this one I never had. The artwork is wonderful and enchanting. You never get to old to enjoy fairy tales. The book is high quality with glossy thick pages. Highly recommend to anyone loving old world stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"All the great fairy tales in one book.

Its ridges make it very easy for him to pick up and its football shape make it bounce in random directions when it hits the ground. It's fun to throw and is a great throw toy for a standard suburban-sized yard. Our springer is a very aggressive chewer and this has lasted well over 6 months--which is very good for one of his toys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yo owe it to yourself","review":"While surfing the web trying to find a new rock band worthy of my attention, and hard earned bucks, I found a Mustasch album and the CD cover caught my attention, and since I have always believed in the power of a good album cover I took the chance and bought the album in cuestion, Ratsafari.Well, I was right! This album packs quite a punch and rocks like if there's no tomorrow. Some songs brought to my memory the riffs of Black Sabbath but their sound was quite particular (Alpha Male), while others rock hard all the way (Monday Warrior and Black City) and some others are melodic doom ridden fests (6:36).An extraordinary band with a sound so personal yet familiar that every rocker should give it a spin, imagine Black Sabbath riffs mixed with Soundgarden grunge sounds, I can't explain it you have to hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW Roy Rogers","review":"None of the screen cowboys come much better than Roy Rogers.

I was not around for the movie serials and early tv westerns and only saw these as reruns but they are still a hoot,"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nuanced Work of Scholarship and Ideology","review":"I just skimmed through the book in the university library and looks like a fine addition to the growing scholarship in the political-literary discourse of early modern England, which confronts revisionism headlong.Although Chakravarty begins with John Milton's classical centrist republican interventions in the political ferment of the civil war, his sympathy clearly lies with tracing the pathmarks of genuine conflict in defining liberty during that time. The Winstanley chapter is brilliant: nobody to my knowledge has shown us so far is such clear terms both the social-political aspects of Winstanley's project as well as the phenomenological dimension of his enthusiastic experience. A fresh (after Chritopher Hill really)look at John Warr is also commendable, but one finds Chakravarty's endeavor to bridge Locke and Warr a wee bit stretched. Overall, its good to notice that the political is being once again highlighted in cultural-literary issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Historical Movie!","review":"This is a nice movie if you like historical movies.

This is the first time I've used one with JetLan (PCLinq2) software and the experience has been horrible. I can't transfer more than one small file at a time without the software locking up. I've been trying for an hour now and anything bigger than about 20 MB just won't go across (smaller files do fine). This is under WinXP SP2. Also, the software defaults to the C:\\\\ root drive and doesn't seem to have a way to override the default starting directory for transfers. Do yourself a favor and find a cable with better software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I was interested in transferring files and settings between two XP machines.

As a result, it is a great way for English teachers whose L1 isn't English to get improve their knowledge of vocabulary theory and teaching. As always, Nation give practical ideas and guidelines that can be applied in the classroom, but backs it up impecably with research findings. This book includes one form of Nation's vocabulary levels test that readers can use to diagnose their students' or their own English vocabulary (the test isn't really sensitive if the testee knows less than 3000 words).He's currently working on either a new book, or a new edition of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why isn't there more of this music?","review":"This is wonderfully dense, danceable electronic music, with a stylishly bored female singer. You feel as though she has seen it all on tour, but doesn't mind singing to you about it. And it's all so European.I searched in vain for comparisons to other bands. It fits roughly with some of the current electroclash bands like LCD Soundsystem or Fischerspooner. The singer sounds somewhat like Siouxsie Sioux. The Fitness is another comparison I could make, although they're a rather obscure Seattle band.It's nice and long, so you get your money's worth. It gets boring after a while if you expect too much out of the lyrics. The most fun song is \\"Superfast Service\\". Otherwise, just put it on and set the mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware! The product is great; shipping costs are stunning!","review":"Great product to have handy, particularly if you have kids. :)) STRONGLY SUGGEST that you try to buy it in your local area, suggest medical supply stores (almost all of which are open to the public) as the shipping costs are beyond belief otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not That Bad","review":"I bought this \\"twofer\\" because I enjoy the Putumayo label immensely and the interesting musical offerings provide accessible world music to the casual listener without being too intense and it was a great price. This set did not disappoint. If you enjoy easy to listen to world music, I think you will enjoy this.

See Google for the refernce. Sheridan G. Tucker MD"},{"rating":"1","title":"An overyhyped book with nothing to it.","review":"I really thought reading this book would give me peace. Instead it made angry. Bernadette tells the story of how her husband Phil Keaggy, a singer I once appreciated and enjoyed, abandoned her while she lost her five babies (ie. didn't return home from concerts). She talked about her babies and then just blindly writes off her children's deaths as 'God's will' and 'meant to be'. I found there to be a great lack of depth to this book and no questioning whatsoever. How can a loving mother sit back and be okay with the fact that her children died? How can a father not be involved or even meet his babies? Reading the back of the book only the author's three living babies are mentioned which I found very offensive. Why weren't ALL of their children recognized? All this book did for me was make me angry. I can't sit back and go 'Okay my child died, oops, oh well' and that's what I felt the author was doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like your country REAL...this is the cd for you!!","review":"Chely Wright has an amazing voice! This new cd is her best example and showcase of that talent. She is a country fan's artist because she is just that...country.

This is by far Chely's best CD yet. Her voice is stronger than ever, and you can feel the passion when she sings. She wrote or co-wrote 5 of the songs on the CD, 3 with good friend Brad Paisley. These all have hit potential. Deep Down Low which Chely wrote by herself is a fantastic ballad. It really reaches down to your soul. Jezebel is an uptempo romp about getting even with the woman that stole her man. One Night In Las Vegas, Love Didn't Listen and For The Long Run all talk about real life and love situations that many people can relate to. Horoscope and Never Love You Enough are about relationships, one in which the woman wants to get back with her man, and the other about loving someone so much that you would do anything for them. I truely love every song on this album, and I would recommend it to anyone that loves great music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"This album was okay...but the singing sounds kind of harsh, which makes it difficult to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star has Risen","review":"I don't know if she'd still be called a rising star or not, but in my mind Chely Wright has risen. The title of her new CD, \\"Never Love You Enough\\" pretty much defines how I feel about it. Each song is better than the last and worth re-hearing countless times. I bought it because of the representative music video from the album, but I love the whole thing. I'm now on the wright side!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Window vent","review":"I guess I would have asked about installing these vents on a van with the extendable mirrors.

They fit perfect and I couldn't be happier. Fast delivery and Great Price too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard rockin' album","review":"The CD is about 35 minutes long, 12 tracks. No multimedia extras (or tough-to-access extra tracks) this time, unlike Born a Lion last year. It is quite a hard rocking album, definitely no ballads anywhere near here. Danko's guitar screams on pretty much every track, as does he. He's bordering on metal now. There are some good tracks here (Forget My Name, Dance, I Want You, Strut). I don't hear any breakout hits though. Lyrically Danko swings between lusting after women and slagging love and saying he doesn't need it. So that's about the same. Overall this is a quality album. I think on average this is a better album than Born a Lion, however the best songs on Born a Lion (Papa, Lovercall) are better than the best on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Sharp Edges and Corners!","review":"The stop functions as expected.However, the main bracket is sanded on six sides and the sharp edges and corners were not are not deburred afterwards.

It has the very types of information that you want in a pregnancy organizer: spaces to record details about your pregnancy, medical information, information about gifts that you have received, information about your birthing plans, details about what types of baby supplies you have purchased, etc. There is also a comprehensive resource guide that you can refer to while you are on the go (e.g., which types of cheese are/aren't safe to eat during pregnancy; a medications guide; foods that increase/decrease nausea; symptoms of preterm labor; etc.) There are also some blank calendar pages at the back of the organizer so your pregnancy organizer can replace your regular organizer for the duration of your pregnancy. The organizer is attractive and compact -- the perfect size for carrying in your handbag or briefcase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great organizer, keepsake and reference for subsequent pregnancies!","review":"I used this organizer with my first pregnancy and it was wonderful--it had everything I needed in one compact place. After my son was born, I found that I loved looking back on my weekly journal pages and remembering milestones and significant happenings during his pregnancy. We are pregnant again and are using the first organizer to remind us when we can expect to hear the heartbeat, do our ultrasound, etc. I have ordered a second organizer for this pregnancy and am enjoying it very much--especially knowing how it will help me relive details in the years to come. Pregnancy is such a wonderful time and, yet, details really do get hazy! Love her pregnancy and baby books and love this organizer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book if you like to keep track of everything!!!","review":"I orderered this book when I was already 4 months pregnant and well I missed out on the first half of the book. The weekly notes are a little much for me as I am not that interested in writing down every detail of my pregnancy. The prenatal appointment sections are more useful and the checklists are great! Basically I use the second half of the book and I love it but would probably like the first half more if I was more into diary style writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this book - buy your own planner instead!","review":"I brought this thinking this would be more of a guide or a read-made checklist of items needed or things to keep in mind by a weekly basis. Instead, most of the pages are blank with minor guidance. I agree it's a great way to motivate yourself to keep track of things, but I wouldn't recommend buying it. A spiral bound planner would be the same thing. Skip this planner, you aren't missing out on anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the expectant mom!","review":"We used this organizer during our first pregnancy and it was fun to jot down some notes as the pregnancy went on.

(There are a lot of details to keep track of, after all.) So far, this organizer is working out really well for me. I like its compact size and its friendly, down-to-earth style. If you're in the market for a pregnancy organizer, you might want to check out this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome record keeper!","review":"This is a perfect book if your looking for something to keep up with day to day activities.

I'm the type that likes to keep up with everything in hopes the baby will look at it one day and see what all happened to me =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this planner","review":"I have religiously used this planner. I can't say I have used it as much of a planner rather than a journal. Everyweek you can fill out what is going on with you, and every doctor's visit you can put down all the information you recieved. I love this book for the fact that I can see that I can see myself giving my daughter this book when she is pregnant to compare what happened to me during pregnancy that may be happening to her.

Even if you really can't afford it just now, buy it anyway. It's that good and it will open your eyes to the remarkable classical music of SE Asia. This set is an ethnomusicologist's dream collection of Cambodian music and it doesn't stick to only one genre (i.e., royal court music) but explores other traditions within Cambodia that are less well represented on recordings, such as the \\"trot\\" tradition indigenous to the area around Siem Reap. It's fascinating music (actually, the word I should use is addictive) and the performances are nearly perfect, especially considering that the Khmer Rouge nearly succeeded in silencing this music forever by killing nearly all the music and dance masters between 1975-1978. The only thing that would be better would be to take a trip to Cambodia yourself to see live performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not excellent.","review":"Remember this is a 4.1 sound system, not a 5.1, this means 4 speakers + subwoofer, not 5 speakers.

If you want to connect it to a gaming console: you dump a stereo jack (loose back), and with a Y cable, convert the Red and White cables to a stereo jack (front). Notice you loose the back part! You end up with stereo sound in 4 speakers. I DO NOT recommend this for console gaming, only for PC.

Elizabeth Scarborough had co-written several books with Anne McCaffrey, which I had enjoyed, I was looking for some other books that she had written when I found The Godmother. The book is a very interesting blend of SF, current urban political realities, magic and an updated version of the Grimm's fairy tales with a liberal dash of humor.Scarborough does an excellent job of developing real life characters.

I've been borrowing my father in law's DW705 and he has the extension kit for that model which is great - it stows neatly under the base of the saw. Not so with the DW7080 extension kit and the DW716 (both are advertised as being compatible). I couldn't believe that it doesn't slide under the base more than a few inches. This is practically useless since I don't always want 20\\" sticking out the side of the saw. Others noted the same issue with their model saws. If it stowed it would be perfect, but it doesn't and I'm dissapointed. Also, the screws are self tapping which explains some issues other people described in their reviews. I didn't have any issues, just a little annoying but not a big deal since the instructions explained this."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT POSSIBLE TO ADJUST IT!","review":"I bought it thinking it would logically be like the one I saw on a Makita miter-saw. One could slide it in or out as desired. Unfortunately one can not only not slide it in or out to adapt it to the wood piece length to be cut, but one can't either slide it out and remove it easily to carry the saw around. Very bad design from Dewalt. I liked my miter-saw until I saw this \\"design-flaw\\". This accessory piece is also a pain to assemble and if one plans to remove it to save space or to carry the saw around, has to be sure to have a wrench to loose the locknuts. I definitely don't recommend this accessory and suggest Dewalt to change it's design to make it adjustable and easily removable..."},{"rating":"1","title":"DeWalt missed the boat here","review":"Looks and feels great, out of the box.....but, when installing on my DW713 the nightmare began. Mounting is very sloppy, and impossible to level with the saw base. Although listed as compatible, it just doesn't work. DW7080 and DW713 = JUNK. Trying to return, but mail order return are costly...my costly mistake...don't do the same. I suggest you find another support system or saw..Added Comment....I found a second hole on my saw base. It wasn't indicated in the instructions, but looked like it could help the situation. This hole needed a special size hex head screw, but did the trick. I now have my extension mounted solidly, and functional. I still won't change my rating or previous comments, because DeWalt failed in its' instruction and their support help."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK if Mounted Permanently","review":"These extension wings will be fine if you want them permanently mounted on your saw. I returned them because they are not easily removeable for saw storage. My Hitachi saw has similar wings that slide in and out with one top mounted set screw, the Dewalt requires mounting from beneath the saw and are not made to install and remove readily, so I returned the items.I decided on the Porter-Cable PC136MS Universal Mobile Miter Stand for my DW716 miter saw. The Porter-Cable stand is well worth the money and Amazon has is for less than I paid and shipping is free. The stand is excellent. I also used separate roller stands for support for my 20-foot long 2x8's I was cutting."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are fine but the saw is lame when using them","review":"I bought two of these but Dewalt designed them and the saw poorly.Holes on both sides of the saw are in the exact same place so when you put in both, they can only be pushed in half way, so they stick out.They also fit sloppy, not something I would expect from Dewalt.What they should have done is offset the holes so they could be pushed in for storage. Other saws do this, its not hard.Other than that, they work fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extension System - Not For A DeWalt 706","review":"I purchased the DeWalt DW7080 Extension System for my new DeWalt 706 Dual Compound Miter Saw. While I was very impressed with the tolerances and quality of the 706, the extension system will not work properly. The 7080 system is made for the 708 saw but DeWalt said in their product brochure and on this site that it is the right one for the 706. This is incorrect, as the extension system will not store under the saw. It seems the saw lacks the proper clearance under the saw table to store the system. The base casting needs to be modified by DeWalt to make this work. This means that every time you use the system, you must take it on and off and store it somewhere. I called DeWalt and after some research they agreed with me. In my opinion, based on the lack of ajustability for short stock, this makes the extension system worthless and diminishes the Model 706 saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice extension -- but buy 2.","review":"This is a very nice, high-quality extension. It is wider, and has a flat top on the support (opposed to the curved bar on most miter-saw extensions). In addition, it is longer than the extensions you typically receive with a 10\\" miter saw. The screws to secure it are self-tapping, which is explained in the instructions, so be prepared for that. I use it with the DW703. The only reason that I didn't rate it 5 stars is that if you want support on both sides, you need to purchase 2 of the DW7080's. This gets a bit pricey, considering many saws come with extensions included. A partial solution to this is to purchase the DW703K, which includes one extension for the same price as the DW703. Overall, however, the combination of a DeWalt saw and these extensions are well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"DeWalt Should Sell as a SET and at a reasonable cost!","review":"Ok I admit it, I misread the advertisement and thought I was buying a pair (set) of extensions. For the price, I feel one extension set is a rip-off and DeWalt should consider selling a set at a price somewhere between $32 for 1 set but certainly not $64 for 2 sets (list price is $88 for 2 sets).One set is useless when, for example, sawing crown moldings or similar instances. Nobody wants to keep switching the extension back and forth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, not great addition","review":"I bought this mainly so I could use the DW7051 length stop. I will say I didn't have any problems with the self-tapping screws, I was able to put them in with the adjustment wrench that comes with the DW708 saw.

Storing the saw will take up more space unless you take the extention off.The holes that the screws to secure the support rods in are not threaded from the factory. I used a large flat head screw driver to push down really hard while the screws created initial thread.You need to be careful that you do not strip the thread when screwing them in the first time.Probably need to take care when securing the extention later as the base of the DW718 seems to be some kind of cast metal.I tried to change rating to three stars but could not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Granted, it is very cheap, but the quality is so low it is not even worth the $3 they charge.

No other country even comes CLOSE. Moreover, there's never been a better record in the entire history of aviation. As such, it was unnecessary for Ms. Schiavo to panic (not a recommended character trait for any pilot). The only value of this publication is as rally call to AIM for perfection in aviation. That's it.

I'm not sure why she misses the mark so poorly in this extended essay on the link between children's fiction and the publishing industry. But the work is very un-focused and rather trite. The approach is a bit dated, and I can imagine that perhaps the book is more an extended discourse on the theoretical apparatus that she seems to be enamored with rather than a solid interpretation of Peter Pan. The book is really an odd one, and it left me feeling so disgusted that I did not wish to finish the tome. Although, the other reviewers are a bit too vituperative in their critique, this book really strikes me as somewhat immature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd Treatment of Old Genre","review":"Rose's analysis is dubious. She attempts to make the claim that Barrie created a new genre of fantasy with the publication of Peter Pan. The problem is that Barrie's books about Peter Pan are actually components of a genre well-studied and documented for hundreds of years. Even a cursory read of scholarship in folklore would have clearly demonstrated to Rose that Peter Pan is a Marchen, a genre of folklore in which a poor, obscure hero is called to complete acts of bravery in a land of fantasy and magic. There are numerous other problems with her analysis. Even reading this study as an essay on contemporary social issues is a confusing exercise, at best, because Rose's style tends to obfuscate rather than to provide any semblance of clarity. Sorry to be so critical of literary criticism, but incoherence and bad writing simply do not belong in scholarly discourse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreed -- Don't Read It","review":"The book is absurd. Rose reifies \\"culture,\\" assuming that it is a property of \\"children\\" or \\"adults.\\" As a result, she fails to recognize that the process of enculturation is actually a sharing of cultural resources rather than a colonialist imposition of cultural hegemony. Furthermore in using Freudian psychoanalysis, she undermines her counterhegemonic cultural critique, as Freud, himself, maintained a view that \\"the child\\" is less than the civilized adult. As a result of these two fatal errors, her analysis is bogus."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't read one book this year, this should be it!","review":"I am amazed that a book this bad was even written, let alone published and bought. Rose develops an incoherent analysis of children's literature that is an olio of deconstructionist literature theory, formalism, psychoanalytical musing, and neomarxism. The main argument, if there is one, is that children's literature is a form of child molestation. This book is an insult to the agony of the millions of children who suffer from the devasting psychological consequences of child molestation.

It is only a little bit better than using the saw without it. I would say the dust capture is 20% at best.I found that I am a lot better off for dust capture if I attach my shop vacuum to the port where this bag is supposed to attach and have active suction to pick up the dust. This captures about half or more of the dust. Overall, though, it seems that there is a reason there are dust hood systems with large hoods to capture miter saw dust into a collector: a lot of the dust does not exit through the blade guard, but spews right off the top of the cut.Conclusion: don't bother with this, it's not good value and it gets in the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bag-it","review":"Just like the one that came with it.

And even if they were, they do not rise above the level of puberal joking. That's not my biggest complain though. What bothers me is how the vocals are really obnoxious and annoying. There's no singing and there's not melodic screaming either. Just whining.I wish I could say the music makes up for it, but it doesn't. The guitar sounds are okay, it's dynamic, but I don't think the guitarist has any technical experience and does nothing you can't hear better elsewhere.

He also produced numerous books of photographs, but I would class them below the handmade works. \\"Etched in Sunlight\\" is an autobiography with many illustrations, and to me is notable as a record of how an artist in a \\"minor\\" field could carve out a living doing what he truly loved.

Ostensibly about three friends Jakob, Bo, and Mikkel on the soccer team, the movie spends the most time on the fits-and-starts romantic and sexual relationship of Jakob and classmate Mathilde. Meanwhile, Bo drifts away to an older, wealthier crowd, and Mikkel takes his chances with Mathilde when she's on the outs with Jakob. And then there's the consequences of the summer house break-in. The movie is gently humorous overall, but has some disruptive dark moments. In the end, an attractive cast and locations, and a peek at European life, make this a pleasant movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't believe this one didn't win the Grammy","review":"I have to wonder if the Grammy voters actually have kids, or if they merely vote for Name Brand as reflex.

Not only is it stylish, catchy, well-performed and well-written musically, it is also uniquely educational. We were fortunate enough to have been able to attend some live performances by this talented group, but I know many families who haven't and whose kids still adore this album. The theme is dinosaurs, of course, but there's a sensitively-handled subtext about handling fears and nightmares.

In comparison to Coldharbour, La Peste is their come down album. I'm sure half of their friends OD'd and who knows what else since the release of Coldharbour. The reason I say that is because La Peste seems to have been written in a very dark place, and I don't mean an attic. Although this album is probably a product of a more mature A3, I don't know if that is necessarily a good thing. I happened to like the less serious and no excuse approach of their previous album.If you do not have Exile on Coldharbour Lane, get it.

On mine, when the split fence was set perp. to the blade, the other half of the fence was .007 out (V-shaped if you will). This doesn't cut it when building furniture. I had the fence surface ground at a local machine shop and all is perfect now. Out of the box, this saw may be good for mitering decking material or for cutting ends that are going to twist, warp and bend anyway. But, if you are looking for a precision saw for furniture building or cabinet face framing, expect to add another $300 fixing up the fence. I was a little disappointed at the quality, but I guess it's I should have not expected precision from overseas."},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get any better","review":"This saw beats the competition hands down. Every single petty gripe I've had with Hitachi saws is resolved by DeWalt with the 708.There are various complaints about adjusting this saw to steep bevels but if you read the manual it is clear how to deal with these adjustments.It could be argued that this is a very dusty saw but that has to be expected.

The DW708 is an excellent tool when it is new; however, over a short period of time, with inconsistent use, the slides get loose and does not cut an accurate angle. You must keep the locking screw snug which is not the way it is supposed to operate in that it is then difficult to slide without this screw being loose. It also has no dust protection in the table bearings and eventually becomes difficult to move the table from one angle to another. Again, I do not use the saw everyday so I am confident that anyone who depends on this tool daily to give them accurate angles would be disappointed after a short time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ya gotta love it!","review":"It's big and it's powerful and it may be my favorite tool.

So in other words it dog tracks. It is a manufacturing defect and there is no way to adjust it. It is just defective. Others may have had good ones but this one is bad. The back of the blade drags on the right side of the cut. In a 3/4\\"x 4\\" thick board as much as 1/32\\".

What is absoultely most FRUSTRATING about this saw is the quick lock lever on the table. DON'T EVEN TRY to cut anything less than a 2 degree angle - this table simply will NOT LOCK in place!

It is just not accurate, and worst of all, the bevel adjustment moves no matter how tight you try to get it. It seems that the bevel angle gets altered after every cut because it won't stay tight.

How true.Straight out of the box, ready to go. Angles were dead true. even the 60 tooth blade that's thrown in is decent - never a splinter. The small amount of kick on the handle when you start up is a reassurance of good power.Too bad you can't dado or fit a masonry blade. I'd recommend some variety of clamp addition for the deck though - holding down the business end of a piece of trim whilst back cutting with that 12\\" blade can be intersting - and the dust bag would only be useful for catching the fingertips of a novice like myself.all in all, well worth the money, shame the accessories are so pricey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holt great as usual","review":"It's the sixth book of Holt I have read so far and probably the most syntetic; he outlines not only the problems but also the solutions.

Holt's radical vision is very clear, very understandable; his solutions so natural that they seem to be inevitable and not radical at all.

One result of this problem was \\"The Killer Meteors,\\" an early Chan film, featuring him as the villain! Chan delivers a spectacular performance, as always. Unfortunately, he only appears in the last third of the movie. Also, Chan as a villain becomes somewhat difficult to swallow, considering his lovable, down-to-earth personality depicted in the vast majority of his films. Overall, one of Lo Wei's better films, but it suffers from too little Chan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Jackie","review":"In this movie, Jackie playes a villan who is being poisoned by his wife. He doesn't have a large role, and magically reforms to fight the last fight scene; after being melted!

It has Jackie as a rich master who tricks a warrior with magical powers into fighting his evil wife and her 4 magical bodyguards.Unfortunately the presentation totally ruins the movie. The opening credits are presented in the correct 2.35 aspect ratio, but immediately afterwards, the picture reverts to a panned and scanned image that ruins the fight scenes, which are the only reason to buy the disc to begin with.On top of that, unless you're a Chinese speaker, you have to settle for an English dubbed version with no subtitles or closed captioning. Considering the capabilities DVD possess for including multiple sets of subtitles and languages, this is most disappointing.

Save yourself a lot of the hard work that I went through and just read Smith's well researched work. It tells all that the US did to bolster their own short term position in Asia - at the expense of the common person in Japan and the long term future of the country. The massive (insurmountable?) problems which Japan now faces are very well explained in this book.I only wish more Japanese people could read it.

Its focus is not simply on describing the hot new features of the RDBMS (although it does that as well), but rather on how they can be utilized to best effect within a complex database environment. The book is clearly written by someone with a wealth of experience managing solutions in a high availability environment where any outage hurts the bottom line.

As soon as this CD hit my hand, I knew it would live up to it's title. What an AMAZING line-up! Legends old and new covering the biggest legends of all time, the Granddaddy of country music: Hiram Hank Williams, Sr. From Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash to Beck and Keb' Mo', each artist brings their own flavor to the classic they've chosen.

I love Petty, Beck, Dylan and others on here and I also love great county music. Sadly, none of this matters here as the songs are lifeless, awkward, and depressing. It is a $3 cd at best with no songs worthy of any quality jukebox nor has any redeeming value for completists who want the rare b-side.

My favorites are Early Christmas Morning, Home on Christmas Day, Christmas Conga and Minnie and Santa. She also puts her own personal spin on Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree and (I Saw) Three Ships.Silent Night with the bagpipes is unusual, but then so is Cyndi, as she's admitted herself publicly with one of her album titles (She's So Unusual).

Seems like the only video around but maybe worth it if you want to know the basics before taking it to someone who'll do the job for you. But, I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing really stood out","review":"The Knights Templars by Frank Aneloo is an overview of how the knights Templar functioned and how they recruited their members and performed their deeds. Overall I found the book to lack something. The one big thing and this may come from Sanello being a journalist and not a historian is the lack of citations throughout the book and although there is a bibliography in the back I don't get a sense for what plugs in where to read more. I have no way to evaluate his opinions or conclusions being I do not specialize in this area at all but I found the book to jump around quite a bit and not focus in on a specific area. Perhaps those with a greater background in this area can offer more on how his book fits in to the ongoing debate but I feel I learned very little from this and I have almost no idea where to go for more information due to the way it is organized."},{"rating":"1","title":"bummer","review":"I found many discrepencies in Mr. Sanello's book, compared to other books I've read on the subject. Due to the absence of footnotes, it is impossible to trace Mr. Sanello's sources. While the bibliography does list good sources, I doubt that Mr. Sanello has read them, because most of the listings contain the phrase, \\"Quoted in....\\" It makes for an impressive looking bibliography but one without authority.The section on \\"Europe\\" is merely a rehash of the dramatic events surrounding the Templar Trial.There are a few contemporary good puns like \\"bull\\" and \\"bullishness\\" referring to Pope Alexander. Otherwise, spend your time on this subject with more reliable sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok chick flixs","review":"these two deal with girls finding their way into adulthood. anywhere she wants a life away from mom's drama & gets it.

Back then, the album cover was pink with a red bow on it; I understand it could be purchased for $1 with a fill up at Firestone (so that's why we had it...). For many years, the sound of Christmas was the sound of Julie Andrews singing these carols. I was delighted to find it again. The sound quality of the CD is excellent and the songs bring back the memories. Anyone looking for a classy Christmas album with a nice assortment of more and less familiar carols will likely enjoy this classic Andrews collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better remastered","review":"This originally was released on CD as A CHRISTMAS TREASURE with Julie and Andre Previn on the cover. It replicated the original artwork on the LP. The sound was fine but with its remastering is even better. I especially like \\"Irish Carol\\" and \\"Away in the Manger\\" and the harpsichord solos done by Previn. For some reason they have given us three songs from one of her pop albums. One hopes they will reissue both of them in their entirety. This is one of the all time best Christmas albums and I am glad it is available for younger buyers of CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The hauntingly lovely Firestone Album of the early 60's!","review":"If you are looking for that wonderful Julie Andrews album put out by Firestone in the early 1960's, this is now it(replacing the Christmas Treasure CD, which is no longer being produced). I remember when my mother bought the original album, making a special trip to the Firestone store (though we never actually bought their tires).She brought it home, and it was beautiful beyond description: The Lamb of God, the Wexford Carol--both especially inspiring if your Christmas season is losing its Spiritual focus.All the guys in my fifth grade class were in love Miss Andrews, and I was no exception: She was pretty, funny, and had the voice of an angel. In interviews I see and hear of her now, the kindness in her beautiful speaking voice reminds us of the true person behind the voice of those earlier years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"Julie is simply \\"Timeless\\" A classic for all ages.

I think the last time I heard it was 1975, and now it's 2010. Wow. Hearing Andrews' amazing Wexford Carol has me in tears. She is such an elegant singer, she never sounds like she's trying to impress, she just sounds like she's trying to make the most beautiful interpretation of each song. And she certainly succeeds. The arrangements and performance of the orchestra are superb. I'm thrilled that this CD is available and I'm so excited that I can resume my decades-old tradition of listening to this great album each Christmas season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julie Andrews' second best Christmas album.","review":"Julie Andrews represents my favorite traditional Christmas voice. The orchestral arrangements here are a perfect compliment to her vocals. For me this album, combined with \\"Christmas with Julie Andrews\\" (her very BEST Christmas album) provides the most beautiful carols of the Christmas season. This particular album also includes 3 memorable songs from movie musicals, as an added surprise...very enjoyable,however, out of sync with the holiday genre' , which, is the only reasonthat I didn't give this CD a 5 star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgic Christmas album","review":"This is a \\"update\\" of an old vinyl record of Julie Andrews from my childhood.

I realize that \\"The World Is A Ghetto\\" appears on \\"The Best Of War And More, Volume 2,\\" but we shouldn't HAVE to buy Volume 2 to get this song. Then again, maybe this is why it was omitted from Volume 1.Also, \\"Spill The Wine,\\" \\"The Cisco Kid,\\" \\"All Day Music\\" and \\"Slippin' Into Darkness\\" are edited versions that were supplied to radio stations, not the longer versions that appeared on the regular 45s (The edited version of \\"Spill The Wine\\" keeps turning up on War compilations.

The last two episodes were brilliant and feature some of the finest writing regardless of genre or medium.Season 2 continues this strong line of writing. Nothing seems contrived. Our characters are very real. If anything, a lack of Alice Morgan may be one complaint; however, this was a result of the writers allowing a natural progression from season 1 to season 2.It may be a \\"procedural,\\" but you never feel that way when watching. If you enjoy great acting and incredible story/writing, you should be watching Luther.

Understanding that Luther is going through a period of mourning after Ep6 Luther 1, he's trying to find himself/his center of being in his crazy maze of a life. Nevertheless, he is who he is and he lives among his work.I didn't like characterization of serial killers...too young, to predictable, wish they were more edgy/freaky/weird. Boys just out of puberty attempting to be serial killers...did not make me quiver at all.I missed Alice...love the banter between she and Luther. What flavor they add to the show.

In other words, about half of the movie is good, 15% very good, and much of the rest is pointless crap just shot for effect.

A tiny bone to pick, however, is the assessment of the close of the opening duel, when the bystander rushes to the fallen duelist and exchanges swords with the slain man. After he absconds with his prize, it becomes clear that the sword he has left with the corpse is bamboo ( another character breaks it in outrage). This indicates the extreme poverty of the thief, since he has clearly been forced by circumstance to sell his sword and has carried a bamboo sword to conceal this disgrace . A similar circumstance occurs in the more recent \\"Twilight Samurai\\" when the viewer is told that Sanada Hiroyuki's character had to sell his sword to bury his wife.The final battle contains some of the best swordplay ever filmed; and oh, that Katsu Shintaro, perhaps his most poignantly heroic scene ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hmm Ok","review":"Its ok,GP just reprises a lot of his tracks from the 1991 release.

There is no info on any secret or really sensitive spots, but the main breaks are covered and its a great starting place for exploring the region. The board ads (in the guise of advice about appropriate boards for a given region) are lame, and the cultural / non-surfing info is not detailed or deep enough to be really useful, I would rather have a lighter, smaller book without that page count. But, all-in-all this book was useful and it's a lot smaller and more durable than the Stormrider Guide to Europe."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is very good","review":"Perhaps the best book of it's kind. It's better than the Stormrider's Guide to Europe because of it's attention to details and a huge wealth of useful information aside from just surfing -- airlines, car rentals. detailed maps and other travel info. Also, the book is very well laid out with fantastic iconography. The only thing I wished it had was a chart for the wave heights of each region based on the months. I'm surprised this book does not have a wave height chart, because it has a chart for everything else. Overall, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightweight Shoes Deserve Heavyweight Title!","review":"I discovered Asics Gel shoes a little over a year ago and now, that's all I wear!

Quite the contrary - I believe that the live sound has been captured quite nicely in their second offering. Featuring some great musicianship, minimal vocals, a rhythm section that's as calculus-reliant as it is destructive and a guitar sound with cave-depth heaviness, \\"II\\" whacks your grill from note one and never lets up once. 360 can best be described as an aural sledgehammer fight, each beat a strike and each riff a bruise. Plenty to be had on both counts. \\"Some Day, Some Other Place\\" and \\"New World\\" continue the beating with an assault similar to a nuance delivered by Neurosis meeting older Spaceboy. Real technical without the sparseness. Rhythm section is probably the most underrated in metalcore.

He's got a soothing voice, but it can get edgy and scratchy just when it needs to. The songs are catchy but not poppy and pretty moody, which is something I love.

I hooked the planer up to a 1 1/2horse delta dust collector with a 4 inch line, but my shop vac worked ok as well. Definately a good buy.... but the mounting is a little shacky with the way the screws go in to the point where you might screw things up if you do it too often. Basically, you have to leave it on, which wouldn't be bad except that you can't close the outfeed extension with the dust hood on. This means that there is not an easy way to transport or store the planer once the hood is mounted.

The title track, Gone Gone Gone, is an absolute masterpiece, and even those who dislike electronica and techno will find themselves enjoying this song. Other favorites on the album include Home, Episode 7, Homewrecker, and Don't Blame Yourself.The female vocals on this album are wonderful, but I believe that their presence is one of the reasons I didn't enjoy this album as much. I enjoy The New Deal's music much more without the vocals, and although they included sound bites in their first album, there was no actual singing.

Both machines had initial problems with their assembly at the factoy. Once they were corrected by the repair service facility the machines have been working trouble free. Even with the initial problems I would strongly reccomend this Scroll ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great 2 year saw","review":"I have been scrolling for 20+ years. Not long ago I bought the 4th Dewalt DW788. Still Disappointed! I bought my first Dewalt about 10 years ago. worked great (low vibration/blade shake). At the beginning of the second Year it started surging and screwing up, I took it to a qualified repair shop. He said the motor was shot. Replacement motors are well over $200. So I bought a new Dewalt. 2 years later, same problem, so this time i bought a new motor. One year later that stopped working. I have now bought my 4th DW778. It has a terrible front to back blade vibration that I can't adjust out of it. Good design, NO reliability.I would love to buy the next better saw out there but at twice the price what will I end up with?"},{"rating":"2","title":"tribute to the best","review":"This scroll saw is a Bentley.

I now only buy what is considered to be the best tool I can afford in order to avoid having to buy a second better one later. I used this saw for about 2 hours total and didn't have occasion to touch it again until recently. After 5 minutes of cutting some 5/8\\" plywood pieces the fuse blew. I replaced it but it blew again. Took the saw to the local DeWalt auth. service center. They tell me the motor is no good and it will cost me ... to fix! They called DeWalt to explain it was in new cond. but DeWalt says it's out of warranty. So if your saw fails be ready to throw it out and buy an new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"I bought this saw less than a year ago. With less than ten hours on it, the motor burned out. Dewalt told me to take it to a service center which I did. They replaced the motor, but after getting it back I have problems with the saw stopping in mid cut! To make matters worse, I t will not hold a #2 blade in the bottom blade holder. I use Olson blades, and after ruining a dozen, I called Dewalt again, and once again they told me to take it back for repairs. Since the closest repair facility is 50 miles from where live, this is an uneeded time and expense to me. To make matters worse, the service person I talked to told that was \\" A fragile machine \\"! I have been scrolling for 15 years, I bought this to replace a Delta 16 inch that finally died.

I had the same problem with the table screw holes not tapped in the correct location causing the blade to hit the table(only off by about 1/8th\\"). I called Dewalt and the service rep. told me that he wasn't aware of any problems with this saw. After speaking with the rep, he told me that I could file the holes that support the table. I asked if this would void the warranty and he said no. I filed the arm screw holes, however I am not happy with Dewalt. The saw seems to run good, but I just can't recommend it to anyone until Dewalt does something to resolve this issue. The only way I would buy it is from a local store so it can be checked out.

It looks very nice on its stand, with NO BLADE in it. Apparently DeWalt let my saw out of their manufacturing facility without the thumb screws needed to mount the blade. It is a totally worthless piece of junk without the ability to mount a blade.So, I call DeWalt and they tell me that they have the parts I need, but it will take 7 - 10 days for them to get them to me. I asked if they could Fedx the parts since I need the saw to cut a piece of wood now. The woman on the phone told me that they don't do that.I told her that although I have several DeWalt products in my workshop that this one would be the last I ever purchased. She didn't seem that concerned. I really hate to see companies when they start to go down. AOL did it, Blockbuster was next, and now DeWalt. They seem to forget that they can't sell products if they don't have customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some nice features but,","review":"If you like to saw out a few items in the garage then this will work for you, but don't expect it to perform day after day in awoodshop. First be careful of the blade holder. It is made of caste iron and if tightened too much will break. A replacement takes weeks to get. The blade tension lever will wear out which requires you to tape the lever into position. We have also \\"burnt out\\" two motors in a eight month period.Having said all that it realy is a good machine for the hobby person. The blade is easy to change, the table easy to adjust, and the variable speed is handy. Further, Dewalt has been very helpful in their customer service.

The most basic, yet the most stylish tune is LOST THEME- Piano Version. Somehow I wish there were more variation to this piece in the film. You don't have to watch the movie first to like this album. However, you would definitely want to own a copy of this rare CD if you happen to have enjoyed watching this extremely well composed film by Brian de Palma.Ryuichi Sakamoto, Brian de Palma and Stunning Mrs.Rebecca Romijn-Stamos [femme fatale herself] make quite a team to STEAL your heart and soul.Quite breath taking."},{"rating":"1","title":"for fans...","review":"Not the best OST Ryuichi did, but the bolerish (a personnal vision of Ravel's bolero) is interesting and sounds really good (quite live with a classical orchestra).If you like Ryuichi OST's, I think you'll like it as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Going/ Old School","review":"I have struggled to get through this book.

This Bible tells reformed Christians why they believe what they believe and where in the Bible their beliefs are supported. In short, no other Bible I know of is like it for reformed Protestants. It helps you to distinguish yourself from non-reformed Christians.As to the Bible's contruction, the paper is very good and the leather is pretty good.Thomas Nelson, the publisher, is doing an inadequate job in publicizing the value of this Bible.It's the Bible some people are sure to believe they have been missing all their lives..."},{"rating":"1","title":"too expensive to maintain","review":"I have been using the Jura Capresso for the past 3 years. The coffee has decent crema, but I am not happy with it's inability to make a very strong espresso. Setting the cup size is supposed to accomplish this, but the cup size is variable even when a single setting is maintained.My bigest gripe is that 2 years ago the machine malfunctioned and again this year. There is a flat fee of $275 to fix it including mailing (find your own box) which I find extremely excessive for a delicate machine that seems to break down every 2 years. The customer service person did confirm that this happens to a number of customers, but it is not excessive in the company's point of view.

Of the Flower Kings CDs, this is my favorite so far because of this. The songs are some of the more elegant and majestic songs of this very prolific band. Its hard to rate Flower King CDs against eachother because they are different (actually true progressive rock) although still drenched in that 70's prog sound. This Hit and Miss band has 'hit' on this one. 4 stars is still a good rating, but 5 star ratings are reserved for the best in the genere.......to this reviewer, these ratings tend to be given to \\"porcupine Tree\\" releases and some of Spock's Beard.

While still good when compared to most other bands, the new listener would be well advised to start with \\"Retropolis\\" which in my opinion, is the most accessible.This CD is lacking the musical soul and strong lyrics of the band's previous efforts. There are a few good tracks but as a whole, I was left disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now, that's what I'm talking about","review":"The Flower Kings have produced some interesting music with a unique sound that combines old school prog with some modern flavors. The Rainmaker is the second CD of theirs I've purchased and I have to say, it's excellent. 'Stardust We Are'(the first FK CD I purchased) has some great moments but includes a little too much playing around with keyboard sounds vs. focus on composition and musical quality. The Rainmaker does what 'Stardust' could have done if it were a single CD that eliminated the noodling. It gives you catchy, prog based songs with some substance and musical focus. Roine Stolt's voice is fabulous; reminicent of Greg Lake from ELP. Although the compositions are very board based, the guitar playing seems very prominent in the music and brings a good balance to the songs. I feel this release gives me an excellent baseline to refer to as I explore other work that they've done. I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for those shopping for pearls!","review":"This book is a great source for information on pearls and a neccessity for those who are wishing to buy pearls.

Liked the interesting design and the fact that it waslighter than old faithful but after about a month it was clear this was not a professional quality tool. Problems with the guard, and gears and a table that wouldn't stay locked. Almost impossible to find parts for this tool, rather heartbreaking when I had a box full of Skil parts right in the van. After the switch went out I gave up - returned it - and got a shiny new Skil HD77M, with the magnesium table. Just as light as the Black & Decker/Dewalt and not a single hiccup since I unwrapped it from the box. Wish every tool was built that tough."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best have been beat","review":"I'm a general contractor in Colorado and Skilsaws have been what the guys and I have liked. The Skil original is indestructable but heavy, the Mag is lighter and nicer to work with but still not as light or as powerful as the Dewalt. The Dewalt is so light you can cut above your head when need be and is not too light that you have to push it through a 2x on a downward cut. The angle of the handle and the balance are a little different than the skil but its easy to get used to. The built in rafter hook is also great. I've used this Dewalt for a year and a half just like I did my Skils with no sounds or problems. It's another tool improved upon by Dewalt.

Even on angle cuts or when the stock is wet, this saw just plows right through it where other saws bog down. And being right handed, I now have an excellent view of the cutting surface. This saw is now the only one that goes to the job with me.

The '77 is still a classic but this saw gives it a run for the money. I give Dewalt and edge for two reasons:1) Lighter weight. It's not that much lighter but when you hoist it around for a day it really adds up.2) I like the ergonomics better. It's shorter from front to back than most worm drives but it doesn't have the annoying motor sticking out the side like the sidewinders.The power is great. I don't think it has more than the Mag 77 but I haven't found anything to stop it yet. (Ok, yes I've stalled it but I can stall my 3HP table saw too! - but that's just the operator's lack of skill.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real power house","review":"Had the 378 for a few weeks and I'm very impressed with it. The power to weight ratio is about that of an Indy car. The saw actually wants to twist on start up. I'm right handed so the left hand blade gives a great view of where your cutting but safety glasses are a must as it throws a lot of material at your face. It seemed cheaply constructed at first but after much abuse nothing's broken. The only suggestion I'd make is allow the blade wrench to be stored on the saw somewhere and an electric brake would be nice. Overall Great saw.

I loaned it to a fellow I know well to build a dog house. When I get it back it acts like I need new brushes. Take it into service center and they say the armature has a burned spot. I don't think the guy that borrowed it abused it. Anyway DeWalt says $86 to repair it, still have to add tax to that.I can get another recon for $109 (free shipping and no tax) and that comes with a new saw warranty. Keep in mind also this saw has a current recall for safety problems. Maybe the Makita or Skill Mag would be a better choice. The Makta is the same price in a recon so maybe I'll give that a try.

At the time it was the gold standard of sidewinders and in many ways it still is. I love the adjustability: super fast and accurate depth adjustment (the front knob and rear pivot is brilliant DeWalt!), fast, smooth and accurate angle adjustment. While the base was an improvement over most saws of it's time, it has been surpassed by cast bases such as Bosch's, and I'd like to see DeWalt put a better base on this saw. Mine has not stayed flat. If they did that, and perhaps boosted the amperage a bit, it would be as perfect as a sidewinder gets.Chris[..]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buying a new circular saw?","review":"Don't buy the DeWalt 7 1/4\\".

Comfortable, light and accurate. But within a few hours of cutting 2x lumber, it soon went out of true. Then the shoe started to warp. I have not been able to get an accurate cut since. I am returning it and going to stick with my Makitas. I have six Makitas. Three 7 1/4\\", one 8 1/4\\", and a 10 \\" chop saw, and a new 10\\" compound slide miter which I love!

This saw makes consistent cuts and has a ton of great features. I would make two suggestions when buying it that some people may overlook:First, I would buy a quality blade for use with your intended projects rather than the one included (it cuts, but as with most blades included with saws, probably isn't going to satisfy your needs)Second, I would strongly suggest picking up the optional rip fence (DW3278). You can usually find it up for around $10.00, and it makes long straight cuts infinitely easier. Definitely a good investment!Nevertheless, I am extremely happy with this saw.

Only two days later here she comes. Impressive. more after I get the saw and how it all works.Got to open the box and put the table together today.

No directions to speak of, but was very easy to look at the picture and even supplied a few extra nuts and bolts. recommend this stand with no reservations at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dewalt DW7880 Scroll-Saw Stand","review":"What a piece of crap. Don't waste your money on this product. I purchased this product and it had to be sent twice to me due to lack of hardware however, all-in-all, I should have sent the product back for a full refund. If you want a stand for your Dewalt 788 Scroll Saw my suggestion is to make your own table as I did to mount your saw on. It gives you much better support and room to work.

Don't waste your hard earned money on this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scroll Saw Stand","review":"Just what I needed. Don't know why it took me so long to buy one. Great price and quality product. My saw takes up a lot less space with it's own stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be easier","review":"This stand is definitely heavy enough to comfortably support the Dewalt Scroll Saw. However, the assembly instructions don't adequately reflect the actual product or its assembly. It's not that hard to figure out but its just ridiculous that manufacturers can't get this simple detail right and include decent instructions for their stuff. Also, they could have done a better job with the design, placement of the three bolts at the back end makes it hard to get all three in correctly. However, you only have to put it together one time, and once it's done it makes a fine platform for Dewalt's excellent scroll saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Strikes on Shipment","review":"This really isn't about the stand, since having received 2 shipments thus far, I haven't gotten a usable one. Just wanted to add my (disappointed) voice to the others who have gotten damaged boxes and missing parts.These stands were part of the discount bundle Amazon has with the DEWALT 788 Scroll Saw. In both cases, the boxes I received were beat up badly and retaped. The first box was virtually empty, all that remained was one leg and a cross brace.The one that arrived today had a crisp 5x5 inch square hole cut in it through which someone had reached in and removed the bag of fasteners. The hole had been taped over with transparent tape, so it was obvious that the box had been tampered with. My experience has certainly made me a believer in the theory that Amazon is recycling returns. You can draw your own conclusions as to how much quality control is going on there. Hope you have better luck with the stand than I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 leg stand","review":"If you aren't aware of it DeWalt originally produced this 3 legged stand.

Definitely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best flip flops ever!","review":"This is my second pair of Chaco flip flops. Still haven't even worn out my first pair after well-over a year of almost daily wear, but bought a back-up just in case I can't find a replacement when my current pair finally wears out. I have very fussy feet, trouble with plantar fasciitis and don't like to always have my feet trapped up in some bulky orthopedic type shoe. These are simple and yet incredibly supportive! I cringed at the price of my first pair, but after over a year of constant pain-free wear, they have been well worth it!

I have repeatedly tried to wear them and I find them to be painfully uncomfortable to the point that even wearing them to run out to get the paper is unpleasant. I believe that these shoes are made for people with arches, but I have very flat feet so it feels like something hard is pressing up against the bottom of my foot.I am giving the shoe 2 stars rather than 1 because I have heard so many good things from others."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE these flip-flops","review":"They're not cheap, but they are wonderful. I have flat arches, and my podiatrist told me I had to wear Birkenstocks in the summer (or regular shoes with my arch supports)...there was no way I was doing either of those things.

I have wide feet and wear most Medium width and a few Wide width footwear but this was way too narrow and short on my feet. Also, these are VERY HARD soled. No cushioning whatsoever. A let-down for me since they came so well-recommended (see other reviews). They didn't come cheap so I'll have to resell or gift these at some point. Disappointing :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"My feet felt wonderful at the end of the day","review":"I bought these one day and then wore them the next and my feet were not tired.I was thrilled.

True Story. So when I finally thought about getting a pair of flip flops that cost more than 10 dollars... I was hesitant. When they first arrived (quick delivery btw), I was hesitant. I also hated them. Because they made my feet hurt... Eventually I discovered that my feet hurt because I was walking all wrong all these years. I was recommended this brand by a sales associate at REI and finally decided to check them out. I highly recommend these flip flops and this brand to everyone. They are worth every penny.

I am constantly pulling the eraser out, only to see it pushed in again while erasing. I try to tape the chuck in place, but that doesn't last either. Second, the motor is not as fast and powerful as my old Koh-I-Nor which lasted me forever through thousands of drawings.

My only disappointment was that there wasn't a disc or two containing music of the Bosa, or Lom people of Armenia, the Gypsies. But then, that's probably another project, since this box set covers the folk and sacred music styles of the ethnic Eastern Armenians. The liner notes are almost as interesting as the music itself.

Even if all you want are titillating nudes, you are more likely to find it with Bouguereau than in this book. If lots of mood, but unpleasant faces is OK, Waterhouse gives you plenty of mood.

It is a nice start, but some of the tracks are all to avalible elsewhere and it would be nice to see some more rare tracks by the artists included on the disk. Mead & Ginsberg talking about the Beat Generation is classic conversation. The CD is a much needed relief from an age where the top music stars are overproduced supermodels, and good looking pretty boys who cannot play an instrument much less write one of their songs.Before the age of MTV, when pop stars had to look good, there was the golden age of Rock radio, and this disk is a reminder that there was a time when the focus was on the music, not the glitter."},{"rating":"2","title":"why the re-recordings?","review":"This is a great collection of 50's Rock n' Roll songs that focuses more on a certain sound and energy than it does on hits - and that's its strong point. Songs like Mel McGonnigle's Rattleshakin' Mama illustrate the raunchy,sleazy menace of early rock n' roll way more than say, a big hit like Lavender Blue (dilly dilly - yuk!!) The main problem here is that three of the \\"HITS\\" are re-recordings. Little Richard's \\"Lucille\\" is not the original Specialty Records version. The same goes with Gene Vincent's \\"Say Mama\\" which sounds like it's from the early 70's. Bill Haley and the Comet's \\"Shake Rattle and Roll\\" is an exception, although a re-recording, it is actually a very cool version with a great,spooky sax riff.

The problem is that for no known reason, while typing in WORD and using the foot pedal, the audio file that I am transcribing suddenly jumps back to start. It happens randomly and without apparent cause. I spent hours on the phone with customer service (who were very, very friendly, if not always knowledgeable)only to have a product that makes me so angry I usually just give up. I've even upgraded to the most recent software package and changed the setting as per instructed to help resolve the issue, but it continues.

I am master's student trying to transcribe my interviews for my thesis. I wanted a product to take my recorder interviews and turn them into written word. This software does not do that. All the software does is allow for you speed up, stop and rewind a recording with your foot. This foot pedal somewhat eases the process but if you did not use a Sony IC recorder the software will not read anything that is not a .wav file. My recorder of course saves the audio files as .wma. So I then had to download conversion software!! The headphones provided with the software and foot pedal are of poor quality especially for the price the product costs. I ended up having to combine the transcription software with Dragon Naturally Speaking to transcribe my interview. It has been a big hassle. I would not recommend this item for if you are expecting a faster and more efficient process."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Far Not So Good...","review":"This product is great in theory, but so far I haven't been able to use it. It does not appear to be compatible with my Sony ICD-UX71 digital voice recorder. It might have been nice if someone had told me that before I bought the thing.

And bees that polinate all of our crops....Mason bees, Squash bees, leaf cutter bees, Bumble bees, miner bees....all native be to north America. Why do we not see this? It is because they don't produce Honey..However, the native bees are 10 -100 times better polinators than the honey bees (which were introduced into North Amreica in he 1600's)..why do we not care.. becuase wild native bees cannot be manipulated by breeders like the honey bee. This is the reason were are having problems with honey bees.

The book is something that would be useful for families of people who are widowed--so many times the surviving partner of a marriage reports that after the initial sympathy outflow, they are ultimately ignored.

The content is at best common sense and at worst completely inane. The layout follows no discernable logic. The graphics make no sense, or at least no point (other than filling space). And the format appears to be the work of someone unfamiliar with the most basic word processing program - bullets out of order, indentation that muddies the content. Hiles needs to establish a service level agreement with his editor.For the price, I expect a book that is not only informative, but professionally designed and edited. Instead I get the ramblings of a self-styled expert in service level agreements. In the end, the book is a joke...and Hiles is laughing all the way to the bank at $125 each."},{"rating":"1","title":"Premature burnout","review":"I have had this saw for a couple of years and used it only a few dozen times on plywood and press board.

The light's arm is not strong enough to hold the light in the \\"up and over\\" position I want it to be in - you are basically stuck with it being just a couple of inches away from your work. That was probably what the designers had in mind as the can is only rated for a 25 watt bulb that is a pain in the neck to screw in (why does it have to be so tight fitting?); I like a lot of light around my projects, and even with every light in my shop on plus this little scroll saw light it is barely adequate.I would save your money and buy a separate light that cranks out the power - you want to be able to see your work without the distraction of the light can being so close to your project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective bulb, but otherwise OK","review":"Easily attached and a useful addition.

I finally removed the thing, got one of those magnetic base work lights with a stiffer goose neck, stuck it to the DeWalt metal stand, problem solved for now.

Being a bored college student over the summer [and trying to make room in my bookshelf] I gave it a go. It isn't the fastest reading material in the world, the weightiness of the topics tend to slow it down, but it is good writing nonetheless. The narration reads true and feels appropriate, and I love how it ends--not completely definite, but definitely sweet.Thinking back to if I would have read it when I was eight instead of twenty, I think I would have liked it, but not appreciated it so much. I am unfamiliar with the setting it has, and it isn't a setting to necessarily get lost in. The message of the story and how it's composed is really what gives it four stars, over any other reason. I think a younger audience will like it, but only those who have or are dealing with grief actually get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for young girls, or any young reader","review":"I liked this book a lot. Willa Jo and her sister are spending time at an Aunt's house after the death of their baby sister. They refuse to come off the roof. The youngest won't talk at all. The story is about the young girls learning to deal with loss, and healing and realizing love's healing power. It's a great book for a young reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sentimental, essentially meaningless","review":"This book, about a family torn apart by a baby's death in the Depression is frankly, depressing. The entire book takes place on a rooftop with flashbacks making up most of the content. There is no particular reason to be on the roof it justs \\"feels like the right place to be\\" or something of the like. And in an attempt to be very profound the author attributes the cause of their rooftop venture as the family's way of \\"getting near to baby.\\" Yes, that is the whole point of the novel. The exciting climax where the family actually talks on the roof is heartpounding and turbulent. If you can't detect my sarcasm by now, you are not educated enough to read this book. Well honestly this book is to touchy-feely, if that were ever thought possible and has no conflict or plot whatsoever. The moral learned from reading this is not to ever read a book by someone who lists their hobby as \\"making stone walls.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly Spiritual","review":"It took me a while to get into this book, but each time I put it down, there was an empty space wanting to be filled with answers. The more I got to know Willa Jo and Little Sister, as well as Aunt Patty, Uncle Hob and Mom, the more my questions yearned for answers.This story, about a summer filled with grief and the different ways of trying to cope with it, is hauntingly spiritual. Despite the well-meaning efforts of Aunty Patty and her churchgoing neighbors, the spiritual depths are mined by a grieving mother who paints pictures of angels, and by two lonely girls sitting on the roof watching the sun rise.I'm not sure how many middle-grade readers will be drawn into this sparse story, but it would be worth the effort, especially for those dealing with grief or the departure of a parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book!","review":"Getting Near to Baby definitely deserves 4 stars! The writing style Audrey Coulumbis shows is interesting. She is a very poetic writer and I will definitely read her other books.

This book satisfys readers young and old. The characters are very intriguing, and make any reader want to read more. Willa Jo and her family seem like normal people, but I don't know anybody who sits on a roof to watch the sunset. The plot of the book is twisted and sad, unlike most books I have read. It was sad how the aunt treats the children. Doesn't it seem mean not to let children play with children across the street because they live in little houses?

I have only used one of them and found it to be less crisp than the plain store brand popcorn.I agree with other reviewers about the cheaper store brand popcorn be equal or better than the high price brand.My only con is that a little steam/grease spatters through the vents and lands on my hand/arm while popping.

To my further delight, I found that it only takes a teaspoon or two of oil versus the 1/3 cup oil that I had been using in my stovetop method!All of our kids and grandkids have taken their turn popping corn and we have bought three more Whirly-Pops as gifts within the family.Excellent product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Popcorn lover","review":"This works great.

The flow stream is evenly distrubuted and really makes a nice improvement over a standard shower head. I did experience a problem after the initial installation.

My shower valve permits water temperature adjustment but does enable the flow rate to be adjusted so I wasn't able to try turning down the flow.

Please do your research, perhaps google \\"baby wearing safety\\" before you purchase any carrier- it is important for you and for your baby.I will also say, this was our first baby carrier, and my husband and I found it to be very very uncomfortable, especially in comparison to our moby wrap. Because he doesn't like the \\"fuss\\" (it is second nature to me now- like tying a shoe) of tying up the moby, we bought an \\"ONYA\\" Baby carrier- it is newer to the market,but WAY more comfortable than any of the baby bjorns we have tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"My son currently wants nothing more than to be attached to my body for hours on end, and our navy Bjorn was getting covered in spit up and was just far too hot in the summer heat.

Also, don't think you'll go for long hikes with this- baby's inner thighs and butt will get sore after a while with any of these type carriers. We did do shorter hikes using this from 6-9mo old. We used it for our first until she was about a year, then gave it to a friend for hers, now were using for our second-- pretty durable.

I've also tried the Moby wrap, and while the fabric is soft, it too traps body heat and the yards and yards are fabric are difficult to manage taking on and off - especially when going through airport security! The Moby wrap was a pain to have to take off and put back on at the security checkpoint in particular and I had difficultly keeping baby in a position comfy for both of us where I knew he could breathe freely. We switched back to our Bjorn for our return flight - it is so much faster to get baby in and out of and baby traveled great in it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the Best!!!!","review":"Reasons why I love this product:1). Easy Operation: easy to get the baby in and out2). Stability and Safety: baby is very secure in it and cannot get out of it.3). Comfort: Our baby is very comfortable in it and goes to sleep very easily in it, especially with the soft breathing fabric.4). Carrier Comfort: I use this product every day, I mean EVERYDAY!!! Sometimes, I have my baby in here for couple of hours during shopping and it does not hurt my back at all and I am an average built guy who does not exercise at all...One thing I wish: I wish that the weight capacity was a bit more (25 lbs). My baby is 18 month and is about 25 lbs. I don't know what I'm going to do after he graduates from this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better buy 'active' or 'synergy'","review":"I bought this one for someone else because I love my 'active' bjorn. I ended up returning this one, because without the back support it is just not worth it. If $$ is an issue, you are better of with spending a few more bucks on 'active', if you do not want to spend double on 'synergy'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for new parents!","review":"I bought one of these several years ago for my son & his wife. They're still using it 3 babies later. I bought another one recently for our nephew & his wife because it was on their wish list. We were delighted to choose the Bjorn baby carrier as a gift because we know they'll enjoy it for years. A great gift & a great value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Carrier...","review":"This carrier works really great. The best part is that it gives really good back support which is so important when you're carrying your baby for a while. I have a sling and love that also but find this to give better support. This carrier is also great as it provides ventilation and the material breathes which helps alot as we live in Florida and it gets really hot here and it doesn't make my baby extra hot. The head support is good and she seems to be quite comfortable in it. The only thing that I don't like or find helpful are these extra straps that are to support the legs, but they seem to be too much of tight squeeze on her legs; I never use those straps. Overall this is a wonderful carrier and it make my life so much easier as I need to get around and to use my hands. Great for around the house or out and about!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great for the back","review":"The look and feel of this Baby Bjorn is great but I wish the design was similar to the other carriers. After just walking with my son for ten minutes, I can feel the strain. It says it can hold 25 lbs but the back definitely couldn't handle that much weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very east to use and baby loves it","review":"My baby hates all carriers but she can tolerate this one. I bought it because I was so hot with the others and wanted something from mesh. This one is airy and light. It is very simple to use and now that my baby is 4 months old and can ride facing forward she is willing to be put in it. Yesterday she was in the carrier while my husband cleaned the house and she didn't complain at all. She liked seeing everything from above."},{"rating":"2","title":"baby carrier","review":"Easy to use, and very comfortable. I use it almost everyday to carry my newborn around. Most importantly, you don't lose your cool daddy look with this product :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for dads","review":"I purchased this for my husband so that he could carry our little one on his dog walks and around the house when he's home. He loves it. It's easy to put on and get the baby in and out of. We've only had it for a few weeks now and we don't have any negatives. It's breathable too, which is great for the humid days we were experiencing in Dallas. All in all, would recommend this product to anyone expecting a baby or has a baby who loves to be held all the time (which we do)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent purchase","review":"A friend recommended this baby carrier and I went ahead and purchased before my baby was born. I couldn't dreamed what a great buy it was. Since then, every time I go to the Mall or even sometimes at home when I have things to do I carry my baby on it. Do not hesitate to buy it.It's great for the summer, the baby is not as hot as in other carriers.Ah! It is also very easy to clean .... another great plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine if you just want a carrier for a newborn","review":"Don't be fooled into thinking that this carrier is the best by the sheer number of them out there. We were given one by our parents when our son was born and it was fine for the first few months. However, as soon as he hit 15 lbs the shoulder pain became unbearable when wearing him for more than 5 minutes. We did an incredible amount of research and switched to an Ellaroo Mei Hip (also available on Amazon) and have never looked back. They are incredibly comfortable and shift the weight to the hip instead of the soft part of the shoulder. (Our friend has the Ellaroo Mei Tai carrier for her newborn and loves that too.)Ellaroo Mei Hip Baby Carrier - BlackAgain, this isn't a bad carrier, it just isn't that functional after the first few months. Its also padded in such a way that it is difficult to fold it up small enough to carry in the diaper bag and still have room for other stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I had a snugli baby carrier, which killed my back, so I wanted to get a carrier that would be easier on my back. I guess I was wrong in thinking that a way more expensive carrier would be better. This carrier is just as awful on the back, and not any better than a $20 baby carrier in my opinion. It was also kind of confusing trying to figure out how to get all the straps adjusted just right. The only pro is the mesh fabric. Other than that, I was very disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splurge for the more expensive one","review":"I have been using this exact Baby Bjorn for about 3 months now and I am pretty happy with it. I like how easy it is to use and adjust. The one major thing I don't like about this model is the lack of waist support. Because there isn't a strap around your lower back/waist, all of the babies weight is hanging on your shoulders and that begins to hurt very quickly. I wish I would have splurged and gotten the better model with the waist support. Do yourself a favor and spend a little bit more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must buy! Don't waste $ on cheap ones!","review":"I have 3 kids. for the first 2 I got cheap baby carriers you can get new for $25. My back and shoulders hurt soooo bad! For this third kid I again got a cheap one. PAIN! Then when he was about 1 month I figured I'd bite the bullet, and try a nice one... This thing is amazing! Even now at 22lbs I can strap him to me and carry with minimal discomfort! It can carry up to 25lbs."},{"rating":"2","title":"reliable","review":"this carrier is very reliable. i had this for my first born who's now 2 1/2 and i'm now using this for my 2 month old baby. it's so easy to use. i can even breast feed, i just hang a baby blanket to cover. it's durable and high quality. still looks brand new. it's been with us for years now. easy to wash too. i'm now using a baby ergo for my toddler when we go somewhere where we need to carry her. can't do without baby bjorn!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"Baby and I love the new Baby Bjorn carrier air. It is light comfortable and my 6 week old son loves it. I was excited to see the little pouch to store the carrier. It makes it easier to fit into a diaper bag. Even my husband is proud to wear the carrier around the house and around the neighborhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Mom Bjorn","review":"My husband LOVES to use this whenever he can, whether its just walking around the house or doing some shopping. I like that it adjusts to both him and I, and its easy to tighten and loosen up. My son is only 2 months old and loves to be hugged up next to mom or dad. The reason why I gave it only 4 stars is because where my son's legs and arms touch the baby bjorn have to be covered otherwise they rub and get all red. It doesn't seem to be painful at al for him though. Great product, I'd buy another one again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"We bought it but quickly returned it mostly due to the inability of it becoming a backpack. Bought the ErgoBaby Sport instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL TERRIBLE","review":"One of THE WORST carriers on the market. It hurts me, hurts my baby. After reading about the pressure and damage that is put on her spine I wish I could burn every bjorn/crotch dangler ever. So, so, so bad. A waste of money and a painful time. So glad we threw this away."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most comfortable carrier","review":"We received this baby bjorn carrier fast and absolutely love it! It is comfortable, easy to adjust and fits both my husband and I perfect. Our daughter's head is well supported and as much as she loves riding around in it, it makes us feel good knowing that she is safe secure and comfortable. Very well made, we are happy with this purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, reasonable price","review":"It was really easy to use,The only problem is, once our baby turned 1, we can;t use it any more, It would be great if we could switch it to cary her on the back, because it is getting heavy to carry on the front."},{"rating":"2","title":"We LOVE it!","review":"BabyBjorn Baby carrier is very easy to use and very light to carry when we travel and go shopping. It is also very comfortable; my 2-month-old baby loves it. most of the time, she fells asleep in the carrier. Last but not least, it is easy to clean. My mom and I really love it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for infants, not so great once they face out","review":"Love this for newborns. Super lightweight and easy to put on. Baby fits well and comfortably inside when facing in. But, once baby starts facing out, this carrier put lots of stress on my neck, back and shoulders. My baby gets excited and leans forward and kicks, adding even more to the stress. I'm in the market for finding a new carrier because even though my baby's only 14 pounds, she's already too heavy to carry facing out. For the amount of money you spend on a new one, I'd recommend finding something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"over all great baby carrier","review":"I have had others in the past. I never really like they way they would position the baby or the way it would sit on me. I figured you get what you pay for so i went out and got the babybjorn. I must say that over all it is an amazing baby carrier. My son sleeps snug in it, the material is soft and makes it super easy to put the baby in there; no struggle or hassles. I will say though sometimes adjusting it is a bit difficult. It becomes a bit difficult to properly distribute the weight on the shoulders so it begins to apply excessive pressure on one side. Like i said though... overall its great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my baby bjorn","review":"This is a very nice carrier. My 9 lb newborn fits great. It is easy to get on and off. It washes well on gentle cycle. The only thing that could be better is that the material doesn't seem very soft or comfy against the baby's skin. I use a burp cloth to cover the areas were her face press against the material. It is worth the money though."},{"rating":"2","title":"its a nutty nite","review":"t-nutty.this is actually my first time listening to t-nutty but i must say,i can listen to this cd all the way through.all around its just an excellent cd and none of the tracks are really bad.Last of the Flowheecanz is great period."},{"rating":"2","title":"germany cookbooks","review":"this is one of my favorites i grew up in germany and know all the foods well these foods were even far better then the foods we cook here in america has more cholesterol then german foods. most of which i love are in there and are bavarian in many ways. and if anyone orders these books i gurantee you will love it. go ahead order the book and the cooking best thing is make good stuff for oktoberfest it sure will sweeten things up with the great food cooked at home i find it my favorite"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is there a new way???","review":"This book is a terrific reference for anyone who wants to make a really useful and unique sweater.

If you plan on knitting sweaters at all, designing or modifying your own, you need this book. I can't think of any of the basics it doesn't cover, from simple box patterns to full yoke, even graphs for patterns. The best part is the % and inch explanations. Most patterns I've encountered start with casting on x amount of stiches for y rows, etc, but they don't tell you exactly how big it's supposed to be. The # of stitches changes with every knitter, but inches stay the same, and it also makes it a breeze for figuring out your own gauges and weights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shiny, shaded pretty smileys","review":"These stickers are small and cute, just the right size to put on my child's toy van. They are yellow smileys with a little pizazz - they are shiny and are shaded from yellow to a peachy-pink.

This album rocks out. From Bones in the Ground to Greatest Generation to 21 Gun Salute. But it's also really fun, just listen to Everday.

When Mary has a go at it, it is in B-flat (as it is when Dick Powell and Frank McHugh demonstrate the piece in their hilarious duet). When the opera singer who gets into her singing mood with perfume (\\"Forget the smell, honey; sing\\") gives it a try, it is in C. Finally, when the woman who wins the audition sings it, it is in G.

This is African guitar and drums at their very best, a kinetic whirlwind of rhythms that is riveting to listen to. Ade draws from a deep well of Nigerian music to put together a stellar concert that will sweep you off your feet. The music is chant-like, exhorting the audience to participate in the polyphony of sounds. It is very hard to stay seated. There is also a video of him and Ebenezer Obey for those who must see him to believe him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as expected.","review":"I chose this sander based upon a review in Consumer Reports which ranked it #2 (behind a Craftsman sander). The dust bag is not worth using. I could never keep it attached. The vibration from the sander would constantly cause it to fall off. I bought an adapter for my shop vac which mostly fixed the dust extraction issues. Another problem is that the sander bogs down significantly when performing heavy sanding duties. DeWalt's quality seems to be constantly falling. I wish I had bought the Craftsman sander instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The switch is the Achilles' heel","review":"Other reviewers are correct, this is a terrific little sander with one problem, the switch is tricky to operate. The switch is too small and the rubber dust cover over it makes the action of the switch awkward at best. Getting it to turn on or off can be a two or three attempt task, this should be a no-brainer for DeWalt to fix in future production. Other than that the quality of the finish it produces is excellent, noise level acceptable and the dust collection is a major improvement over the old 1/4 sheet sanders. I typically use this sander immediately after my 1/2 sheet Porter Cable (with no dust collection) and the DeWalt sucks up all the dust left behind by the PC. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Update","review":"Since my last review, the sander has ceased to function. Either the main on/off switch or the motor has failed.

This sander does not seem to take too much off even if you use 80 grit paper (my little mouse sander does better job) and as for other features, I agree with the others that the dust port keeps falling off and the switch is suspect. But my variable speed option still works though. After using it on a project for about 20 hours, the bearings went and I had to get it fixed. Once this sander quits on me, I think I'll opt for the Porter Cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sander, poor electronics","review":"I bought this sander after doing much research. It worked great on one and a half projects, a front door and part of my kitchen table. Part way through the kitchen table it flat out quit.

The only complaint that I have, as do others, is that the dust collector falls off of the body of the sander - all the time during use! Shame on Dewalt for not fixing this.

I def'n recommend buying one of these units (and fixing the dust port before you go to use it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad switch, bad company","review":"This tool's switch went out too soon for an $80 sander.

Also, when attaching my Fein shop vac (*highly* recommended) to the little dust port, it quickly wiggles loose -- and the vac does stay attached to other Dewalt tools properly. On the bright side, this sander *does* sand well, leaving a nice finish in a very short amount of time.PS: (I make it a little practice to note where each Dewalt tool I buy is manufactured, anything that can be tracted back to Elu, or made in Italy is of high quality, hint, look where the owner's manual was printed)-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little sander","review":"I found this to be a great little sander.

I have probably put close to 500 hours of heavy duty work with this. C & D side plywood, raw wood as well as refinishing. I just had to replace the pad today as it losts its grip on the sandpaper.

I have noted the same minor difficulty at times operating the on-off switch that others have mentioned, but I would say it is really a very minor problem and the switch has never failed. I think the problem arises out of the way the switch is sealed from dust. The dust collection bag has worked well for me.The tool is light and easy to use. It removes material as well or better than other sanders I've used, and the sanding discs are relatively inexpensive and readily available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish, modern watch","review":"Only criticism is that it has no background light function, so viewing time in the dark is essentially impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"comfortable & stylish watch","review":"The watch is attractive and affordable with a very confortable curvature and wide leather band.

The topics of the chapters are presented with very little detailed information being given.I have read other books and many magazine articles by Patrick Sweeney and know he is very knowledgeable and usually is able to give the reader useful information in a way that is enjoyable and easy to understand. However, this book falls well short of his normal standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patrick let us down","review":"Regarding AR-15 Volume #2Most of the reviews here are clearly for the first volume which I also enjoyed thoroughly. I could hardly wait for volume 2 to become available. However it was quite a let down. It was virtually void of the technical information Patrick usually provides and instead was filled with quips and comments. He spent too much time trying to be funny and or arrogant instead of providing his usual first class reviews. Editing left a lot to be desired as relevant pictures were often pages away from the text they supported. I have many of Patrick's books, but,I definitely would not recommend AR-15 Volume 2, sorry Patrick, you let us down with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Volume One was much better.","review":"I found Vol 1 well written and very informative.

If you are looking for something technically informative, I would recommend by Zedicker Building guide or the Competitive AR book he has done. Also the Marine Corps Field Guide to the M16A2 is very informative. This is typical Guns & Ammo publication.

There are very few hard facts in here. The few facts that are present are of little consequence.Still, it was reasonably entertaining, and it isn't very expensive.This book is not going to be a valuable resource for any novice builder or collector. It is only an entertaining read for those who know their gear.In short, this is simply A BOOK, that happens to be about certain AR-15s and certain parts for AR-15s.

For instance, he calls the hospital room \\"the worst hotel you've ever stayed at.\\" For me the hospital was the best hotel I've ever stayed at. Who cares if the bed was uncomfortable, they were helping to take care of my wife and new child. Tongue in cheek chapter titles like \\"So you've ruined your life\\" and \\"I have no friends.\\" I realize now after having my child the reason this book was making me feel so daunted every time I read it during pregnancy- it makes everything seem like a crisis rather than a joy. I'm probably more cynical than most people but this book treats childbirth like an act of sarcasm. I know this is his \\"sense of humor\\" and it might sound humorless of me but I find it too bad when something so meaningful as becoming a father should be dripping in irony."},{"rating":"1","title":"You look like a [flop] to me...","review":"I'm sorry, but what this guy is selling is just one blinding flash of the obvious after another. As a first-time expectant father, I thought I'd get some useful information from this book, especially since my wife's cousin (also new parents) recommended it to me. Quinton Skinner comes across as a very immature, self-centered man whose answer to everything is to stick his head in the sand like an ostrich. As was the case with another reviewer, I only made it halfway through the book before his whining drivel got the best of me.

It's a clear, honest walkthrough of his experience, making note of the advice received and his own lessons learned along the way.By the time you get to your fourth \\"how to be a dad\\" book, his levity is very refreshing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatally Flawed","review":"I've got two dance pads; one from Mad Katz and this Naki pad. This one is more comfortable, since it's got extra padding on the bottom, and it stays put on my wood floors no matter what I do with it. Unfortunately, it never makes the good grades, because it has a fatal flaw: you can't press two of the same buttons simultaneously.While this may not seem like a big deal, it comes up quite often for those of us with big feet. You step on the left or right arrow and your foot overlaps the triangle or square. With your other foot, you step on an arrow; you hit it square, \\"Perfect!\\" on the beat, but the dance pad won't register the step. \\"Boo!\\" There goes you score, your strobe light, your rating... Extremely annoying.Additionally, the extra padding makes it difficult to fold, and it never seems to lie exactly flat.

However, when I started playing light and standard mode it was a whole different story. The pad often slipped and I often stood on an arrow by mistake thinking that it was the middle of the mat. The back arrow of the mat stopped responding if you tried to press it. However, this pad is great for beginners. I would recommend a wireless \\"Night Moves Pad\\" if you are more advanced.

Yet simultaneously, it is impossible to ignore its undercurrent of war-related anxiety, a constant reminder that a war continues to ravage its victims' lives long after its end.Although Weinberger's work might be classified as travel writing by some, she encompasses aspects of many other genres -- history, memoir, nonfiction, humor -- creating a memorable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP OFF!!!!","review":"I HAD PURCHASED AND HAD THIS TV COMBO FOR LESS THAN A YEAR,AND IT HAS ALREADY BEEN IN THE SHOP 4 TIMES.CALLED THE MANUFACTURING COMPANY AND ALL THEY DO IS APOLOGIZED.THEIR WORDS MEAN NOTHING TO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT AND STRESS I HAVE HAD TAKING THE CHEAP THING BACK AND FORTH TO GET REPAIRED.AFTER TALKING TO THE TV REPAIRMAN,SINCE I WAS A FREQUENT CUSTOMER BY NOW,HE SAID THE VCR AND DVD PARTS WERE MADE OF PLASTIC AND THE LITTLEST THING LIKE ROOM TEMP WOULD WARP THIS PLASTIC AND JAM OF EAT VIDEO TAPES.SO AFTER THE 5TH TIME OF BREAKING AGAIN,I HAVE TRASH THIS TV AND NOW I WILL BE SURE TO SHOP SMART ,ALWAYS BUY ELECTRONICS WITH GOOD OLD FASHION METAL.ITS STURDY AND WILL NOT WARP OR STICK,AND THAT IS THE ADVICE COMING FROM MY TV REPAIRMAN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Saw","review":"This saw is great.

It hooks up to the longest plunge stop screw on DW621. As you turn the knob, it rotates the screw. As the screw is inserting or releasing from the base, the router body is raised or lowered. The problem is1) Range of height adjust is only 1+ inch.2) If you raise to the end, the screw will jam and if you lower to the other end, the screw will come off from the base.3)There are three screw joints along the line of connection. Thus, often you end up unscrewing the knob instead of lowering the bit.4) The knob is too close to the dust collection port making it hard to turn.5) In order to raise 1 inch, you got to turn the knob 30 times with your two fingers.They could have provided 1) a hookup for the stop screw and the existing fine adjuster. 2) An extension handle for the existing fine adjuster hex hole.

Then he could have a smoke alarm that seemed to protect his family, but is actually just an empty ugly disk on the ceiling. If I were really good, I could design it so that its batteries would always run low at 3:38 am also, causing an annoying voice announcement and a set of beeps to go off every 30 seconds. But if I were a REAL genius, I would make sure that every new building permit required that these annoying, unreliable, and potentially unsafe devices be installed inside every bedroom and in every hallway.

It was a simple process of simply powering down the circuit, removing the old smoke detector, stripping and installing the wires to the adapter, activating the installed battery, installing the ceiling mount adapter, installing the new detector, powering up and testing the unit. Overall, quite simple.Money well spent and by purchasing this unit, you get a two-fer, a smoke and CO detector.

Since I wasn't home at the time, the fire department had to locate the issue. The fire dept made a comment that these type of detectors are notorious for false CO alarms and recommended that I switch back to smoke alarms only and get a stand alone CO detector.

Never read anything by Stephen Frey before, and never will again. Awful dialogue, superficial characterizations, completely unrealistic situations -- four or five members of this family get clipped in a week and no one seems to notice any pattern or react.The book seemed like one of those role playing computer games where none of the characters react at all to events -- a presidential candidate shoots himself, no reaction; the head of a billion dollar hedge fund gets killed, no reaction. It was laughable.Frey seems to be aiming to be Grisham for the financial set, which is aiming pretty low. Grisham is awful too, but at least grounds his stories in characterization as well as plotting. All Frey does is add an explosion or murder every 15 pages, trying to keep the story moving.Save yourself two hours of your life.

He manages the multibillion dollar family investment fund. He is exiled to the West because of concern that he is just too smart and too honest to deal with. But, naturally he returns to carry on the good fight. This book is a fairly exciting read. But, Frey tends to write his key figures as being virtually unbelievable. They are just a bit too perfect. Past that point, it's a good,quick,exciting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A murder per minute","review":"Having read Frey's previous books and enjoying them all, I was disappointed by his latest effort. It was difficult to suspend disbelief as the silly and contrived plot unfolded. Paranoia about our political leaders and cynicism about the power of money in the political system are natural subjects for thrillers, but even the dumbest and most credulous members of the media would have figured something was up as the body count rose in this book. Frey's narrative and prose are not his strong point and the weakness of the story led him knock somebody off every time the suspense flagged. His obsession with plot twists and placing characters in physical danger became tedious and while I finished the book quickly, toward the end I was skimming to get to the end.

Now (they are 3 1/2), we use it to also encourage vocabulary (our son is speech delayed) by holding up the card, asking what the kids see on it and who has the match.

However, he is so intent on convincing his audience that cholesterol is meaningless that he distorts the data. Several times he lumps the effects of cholesterol in the diet (probably of little importance) together with cholesterol in the bloodstream (shown to be important in hundreds of studies). In the end I decided that I wasn't sure that anything he said was not very biased. Heart disease is probably not a case of homocystene OR cholesterol but homocystene AND cholesterol. I hope all readers of this book will also read other sources such as Kowalski for a balanced presentation. Fortunately there are other sources of information on the importance of homocystene. Reader beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money","review":"This book does a disservice for those who really want helpful information about diet..

It's no more appropriate to focus exclusively on homocysteine than on cholesterol. Human health and disease are related to a huge number of factors and we have an inkling of only a few of them. The only unequivocal 'truth' is that lifestyle modifications (Mediterranean-type eating rather than American fast-food and 'diets' + regular exercise [swimming, bicycling] + stress management + no smoking) are the best approaches to longterm health.

Kilmer McCully does a great job of adding balance to the medical community's current enslavement to the cholesterol=heart disease theory, and in the process demonstrates again how the world of science tends to banish those whose breakthrough insights don't fit the mainstream mold.

As you can imagine, a belt sander removes material aggressively and wood dust is the obvious byproduct.It didn't take me long to realize that none of the dust was being directed into the bag and perhaps this is due to a design flaw if in fact the designers gave this feature any thought. On the good side, you never have to empty the dust bag because it has no function since all dust is left on the work piece or shot into the air for potential breathing.If dust collection is a concern of yours, perhaps a different model or manufacturer would better suit your need."},{"rating":"1","title":"My bad karma","review":"Bought the sander and used it for a couple of days for some moderate to light sanding on a bookcase I was building.

It will surprise and intrique you the the very end. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Ideas But Poor Plot","review":"The ideas in this book are very interesting in terms of the interactive storybook as well as other nanotechnology references. The bad thing is, as with too many hard sci-fi stories, the characterizations are paper thin. I wound up not caring about any of the characters except the little girl but her story is poorly intertwined with the others subplots. The novel just meanders along and completely loses direction at the end. I can't honestly tell you what the point of the book was. Interesting science ideas don't mean anything in a weak plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant ideas, little suspense","review":"A lot of people read SF primarily for the ideas, and I'd argue there is no better fiction for that purpose. Add at least two stars to this review if you are an 'ideas' reader, because Stephenson has more ideas than the next five successful SF writers combined.For me, though, the lack of suspense, the lack of absorbing characters, and the lack of story momentum led me to abandon this book after I had dutifully slogged through more than half of it.Maybe it picks up dramatically near the end, but frankly, at this point, I just felt my reading time would be better spent elsewhere.It would be interesting to see Neal Stephenson team up with a strongly character-based SF luminary for a collaboration."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Vision Splendid, though the plot ultimately collapses under its own weight","review":"Don't get me wrong in the title: I strongly recommend this book. It's densely packed with great and big ideas, some of which seem to be taking hold in the present.

The second half of the book was a real disappointment - and it made my husband more sick than myself. Avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephenson can't put the pieces together","review":"Not coming anywhere close to being as good as Stephenson's masterpiece \\"Snow Crash\\" nor his excellent \\"Cryptonomicon,\\" this is a book that's filled with some great ideas that never come together as a decent book. Stephenson frequently seems like he's completely uninterested in telling a good or even readable story, and is more concerned with sounding clever or urbane (i.e. wizened on Eastern culture). There aren't any characters here worth caring about, there's a world that's too complex to bother paying attention to, and a climax that's intense but seems to come out of a separate book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly addictive","review":"The plot is complex but not convoluted. The twists and turns are unexpected, but understandable, and whenever you figure something out, there's another mystery to pursue. Most of all, I love that character arcs are woven together with both short and long term changes and developments. Everything that seems unimportant comes together as the story develops. The characters are realistic and constantly changing and reacting to the plot in ways that suit their personalities. Not every development is good for them, but it all feels real. And each of these characters is so unique and three dimensional that the moment they leave a scene, you wonder where they've gone.This story is part Matrix, part Pygmalion, part Dungeons and Dragons, and all excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I loved this book. I have it in audiobook form and I'm listening to it on my commute (again) and hoping for traffic jams so I can listen longer.It has wonderful characters and the most amazing ideas. I loved Snow Crash, too, but this book was more insightful, if less adventurous. It's in my Top 20. Along with the Dune series and everything by William Gibson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent Sci-fi","review":"This is exactly the kind of book that all sci-fi books should be like. It's got everything you could ask for - stunningly envisaged futuristic technology (far beyond the usual Star Trek or Blade Runner cliches), a huge cast of well-developed characters which lend the book a strong human element, beautiful imagery with a distinctly dark streak, a labyrinthine plot and, above all, lavish doses of originality. This book is a classic of the genre, well up to the level of \\"Dune\\" in my opinion.This is one of the very few books I've read which I can recommend to anyone without any qualms. An unfortunately neglected classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version MUST be edited","review":"I am positive that this book is a masterwork of science fiction that readers have come to expect from Stephenson, but I must submit this one star review in the hope that the Kindle version of the book gets some desperately needed attention from an editor. There are so many typographical errors in this book that, having read roughly halfway through, I have gotten fed up to the point of having put my Kindle down mid-sentence on more than one occasion. These are mostly scanning errors - the words \\"man,\\" \\"men\\" and \\"mat\\" appear so often in the place of \\"than,\\" \\"then\\" and \\"that,\\" that I have begun to make the corrections automatically as I read. Is it really so much to ask that someone go through and bring this product to the level that one would expect from a printed book? Sorry I couldn't review this book for its obvious merits as a great work of storytelling, but I just can't get over how horrible it is to read this unfinished garbage on the Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Diamond Age - The Way Science Fiction Novels Should Be","review":"Classically, there are several types of science fiction worlds, one of which is based on a single or several technological trends extrapolated to their logical conclusion. The Diamond Age is one of the best contemporary examples of this type, as Stephenson creates an extensive sociopolitical and technological landscape based on Humankind's mastery of nanotechnology.The advantage of this type of science fiction, as Stephenson clearly shows, is that human nature can be explored in a context different from our own, providing the reader with greater insight into people, just as other great authors of the past have done."},{"rating":"1","title":"pseudo intellectual garbage","review":"It is disconcering to find, that like in the world of art, the incomprehensible is seen as denoting a fine work. This read was tantamount to having a bad acid trip. The author has no concept of science and attempts to so confuse the reader that the reader is supposed to see greatness in a work that is merely jejune."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Yourself Time! Do Not Read This Book","review":"I am a deep lover of Science Fiction. This book was a major disappointment, a waste of time, and can be categorized as pure goobly-gook! I wanted to like this book, but it was full of maddening obessive verbriage. The first 400 pages of the book was hyper-reflixive technology-speak. There existed no character development that emboided humaness nor humanity. I felt I should have been paid for enduring the torture involved in sticking with the book until the end. What a labor of false hope. At least the Science Fiction works of Paolo Bagigalupi's (Pump Six) and Brandon Sanderson's (The Hero of Ages) embraces eternal themes, philosophy and caringiness in their essence. I am so angry at myself for being fooled into reading this obessive junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't get it.","review":"This was my last attempt at a Neil Stephenson's book. Cryptonomicon and Snow Crash were the others. I enjoyed or even understood not a single one mentioned. One thing I credit Mr. Stephenson with is his out-of-the ordinary inventiveness and attention to detail. He is also a visionary. I get lost in his stories, though, in a bad way. Get confused and lose interest. Not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out bad and went downhill from there?","review":"Halfway through this boring book I decided to see what the reviewers here at amazon thought of it. Reading the worst reviews I notice that many people thought the book started out strong then got worse in the second half. Since my own experience was that it started out poor, I decided to give up at this point. I seldom give up on a novel. I picked this one up because I'm fascinated with the future of nanotechnology, and while there were some interesting tidbits scattered throughout this book, the plot was so boring that it just wasn't worth it to continue."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope I can save you","review":"There is a bit to be encouraged about after reading this book. This book demonstrates that you need absolutely no talent, abilities, or any skill what-so-ever in wrting to become a published author. It appears Bantam Spectra will publish any piece of trash you send them. Be warned, delete your browse history, turn off your computer, take a cold shower, go for a long walk, just do not read this book. I just hope I can prevent someone else from suffering the same fate that I did. You have been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"The trouble with Stephenson","review":"This is a great book. Anybody who's looking into writing interactive narrative should read it. It gives interactivity something to shoot for.Like all the Stephenson books I've read the narrative ticks along. Multiple protagonists run along their converging plot lines beautifully. The stories are engaging, the characters are identifiable and Stephenson continues to twist away from the predictable at just the right moment.The trouble with Stephenson (and he's done it in all the books I've read to date - Diamond Age, Cryptonomicon and Snow Crash) is that he doesn't follow up his brilliant content with strong conclusions. His books just fade away.Neal, baby, we love you. Your research, your vision, your imagination and your scope are fantastic. There's nothing better than sitting in a comfortable chair with a great mug of espresso and one of your books. But what about the ends? Don't be Starbucks, Neal. Do the extra work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic. Perfect.","review":"This is an incredibly visualized and complex set of places, characters, and technologies. There are no books I like better."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've have the book right here...","review":"This is the second time that I have read THE DIAMOND AGE and cannot help thinking: \\"What the heck just happened?\\". Maybe my understanding of the book is no deep enough, but I cannot help feeling disappointed (and confused) about the ending. I am not a casual reader (ie. I've read most \\"good\\" works of classical and contemporary SF/Fantasy), but Neal Stephenson strikes me as one of the most original modern SF writers (I know that that sounds rather ambiguous, but this is a book review not an analysis). The ending of the story (in fact, the last couple of chapters), does not seem to fit with the rest of the novel (to me it does not even vaugely make sense). This is the only thing that prevents me from giving this book a heartfelt 5 stars...Please excuse any spelling/grammar errors. I usually hurry through reviews and thus do not pay attention thses details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"Stephenson crams lots of neat tidbits of ideas in this hi-tech fantasy but fails to explore most of them and the book bogs down in a slow-to-develop and not very interesting plot. Occasional flashes of brilliance kept me turning the page hoping this book would take off but it kept getting slower and slower and I was glad when I reached the last page that I didn't have to read it anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"What?","review":"Having devoured with great satisfaction everything Stephenson I could get my teeth into, I think I can be classified as a true fan. Diamond Age, however, left me wondering if the master was pushed into publication prematurely here. The unanswered questions, intriguing as they are, become pure frustration when answers are not forthcoming. I hope there a sequel in the works that will fill in the gaps."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love books and love to read, this book is for you!","review":"The Diamond Age is what I would call techno science fiction. It took a bit to get into the story but then I was hooked. The primary story (at least for me) was the coming of age of a girl, who survives a threat-filled world to emerge as a leader. Credit for her survival goes to a book! But not just any book. This book, designed to help one girl to growup strong and self-sufficient, bonds with its first reader. It knows when the girl is in danger -- immediate or chronic -- and helps her figure out how to survive. The book changes its techniques as the girl ages, finally leaving the decisions solely to her.The story takes place in a future world but all the problems of the current world are there in some form -- greed, violence, politics, class struggle. But so also are people who make a difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book. Highly recommended","review":"I agree with what people have said about the ending. I feltvaguely disappointed but it worked all right logically --I still say it is a work of genius and have given it the full 10 points, it is the sheer quality of the writing which earns it this, as people up there have pointed out, it refutes the idea of SF as not-literature and builds up great human characters with moving, real relationships, while dazzling with inventiveness.The book is scientifically important because it was the first I had really heard of nanotechnology which is closer than we think. Drexler and Merkle are real people -- go and check 'em out on the web!Would like to see some words from Neal S. himself here. The book is an extension of the Net and he always seems a wired character. So here we are at the great amazon.com.CheersMartin"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ditto","review":"An excellently written book...but the ending was clearly the work of some overzealous editor who truncated Stephenson's story in some misguided attempt to keep the number of pages down.I applaud the excellent and engaging characters with which Stephenson builds his story, and the vivid and accurate society he builds for them. With 20 pages left, I was completely enthralled and dying to find out how the author was going to wrap up the numerous of fillaments of the plot. With five pages left, I realized that the story would not be resolved, and was quite disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it! Enjoy it!","review":"Captivating and original.

I think it was a great read with so many interesting designs for how technology can push the future. Definitely something worth any sci-fi/futurism fans time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different!","review":"First goes first, I enjoyed this book quite much. It has a very well developed story which is fast-paced and intriguing. It is something that goes beyond usual stories in science fiction, originality is something which I think should be quite valued these days. There are quite a few characters whose personalities have also been very well lain through their actions, thoughts, physical descriptions...Maybe the science in this science fiction book is not that great but just don't expect nothing too realistic, let's just use our imagination to see how the future could be.Buy if you feel like it and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"really quite good","review":"I read and loved Snow Crash, but it didn't strike the right cord with me like Diamond Age did. Stephenson is such an imaginative, informed, and eloquent writer. I spent a great deal of this book just being blown away by the exceptional dance of ideas and wordplay. I just really love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only cyberpunk novel I've enjoyed","review":"This book begins as a babble, and the reader at first spends a lot of effort getting used to the technospeak. But once the plot gets going and Nell begins her journey of discovery, the book takes off and becomes riveting. This book is an amazing example of people interacting with technology in interesting ways, and not just taking technology to the next logical step. For that alone it's thought provoking. For the character of Nell and the others, including Hackworth and Miranda, it's fascinating reading. Definitely a wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough","review":"I've read all of Stephonson's works available and always look forward to the next, but from what I had heard from other fans, this just didn't live up to my expectations. That doesn't make it bad, I just had high hopes for it. I personally prefer the \\"furture will be a wasteland\\" concepts over his \\"future will be neo-victorian\\" since that appeals to me somewhere on the same level of having my toenails torn off with pliers. The samuri and leather of Snow Crash - that's cool, but the lace and top hats of Diamond Age are boooring. Even with that it had its good points - although now having read Neuromancer after this, it has its \\"borrowed\\" spots just as much as Snow Crash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story bad ending","review":"I loved this book. The only thing that stops it from getting five stars is Neal's inability to end a book. It wasn't that I disliked the ending, it was that there wasn't one. It feels like he decided, meh I've written enough I'm done and stopped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak ending","review":"All that and a weak ending? This is the second Neal Stephenson book I've read, the other being Snow Crash. Both were great reads for the first 3/4's of the book, then it is as if Neal got tired and ended the book. It ended inconclusive and wanting. I wouldn't recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of near future art","review":"An outstanding piece of work. The diamond age is one of those special near-future sci-fi books that will be remembered. What makes it special is the complete originality and visionary images Stephenson presents. The story unwinds with alarming depth and texture, beautifully written with an artistic edge. The story concepts are new and may take a little getting used to; but once comfortable with Stephenson's writing style, the reader will be taken on a truely imaginative journey. Readers looking for a cheap cyberpunk thrill will be dissapointed. The diamond age is much deeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Kindle Edition Stinks","review":"Great book, my favorite author. Get the hardcover.Don't buy this Kindle edition.This ebook is missing all chapter data. There is no index, and the \\"Book Extras\\" are weak. They print \\"The Diamond Age (Bantam Spectra Book)\\" at the top of every page, which really stinks on smaller e-readers.It's even missing the cover art!There are bootleg versions of this ebook that are far better, this version is a rip-off at $12."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading binary code is slightly less interesting.","review":"Mr. Stephenson is a technological visionary. He describes vividly a possible future. But description is his downfall...it drags on and on and on with little concern for plot or characterization. Admittedly I could only stomach the first 100 pages before I had to give it up. It simply wasn't making a whole lot of sense...and I graduated with a minor in computer programming. Frankly, I think Stephenson is one of those authors where people think it's cool to say they read, like they're smarter than the rest of us. Stephenson is very bright, but he's not a writer. A writer, specifically sci-fi writing, incorporates compelling characters and stories with technology. Stephenson nails 1 out of three. If he can get the other two down, if even in small measure, he'd be a stunning writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real stinker. Starts out strong, then limps home sick.","review":"I loved Snow Crash, so it was with extreme optimism that I started in on The Diamond Age. The first third of the book was great! Then it was as if someone else took over the writing of it. Nothing made much sense, what did was contrived, annoying, and worse boring. I couldn't wait to get to the end of the book. I kept thinking \\"it's got to get better\\" but it didn't. If I could give it less than one star on this system, I would. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow moving disapoinment","review":"I put this book down after about 50 pages and did not pick it up again. After reading the triumphant \\"Snowcrash\\" I had high hopes for this next novel, only to feel robbed of the money I spent on it. Slow moving with poor character development, I didn't care what happened to anyone in the story, nor did I want to find out what happened in the end, much less the very next paragraph. All of the parts I read, reminded me of the boring bits of \\"Snowcrash\\" without the prospect of excitment or gripping story telling. I can't even recommend buying this book used, if you must read it, then borrow and assure your friend, that it will be returned, and the last pages will still never have been read."},{"rating":"1","title":"yecch","review":"I agree with the people who said this book started out great and went downhill. Way, way downhill. I didn't understand the majority of what happened in the second half of the book, and what I did vaguely understand, I found utterly ridiculous.

I was reading this book, and had a jolly good time, until I got to \\"Part Deux\\", and then I said to myself, \\"this guy sucks.

How depressing...","review":"If this were \\"fantasy\\" it would be forgivable. Flat characters, big logical flaws, and the most pretentious (and superficial) treatment of nanotech I've ever read. Big waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A scifi Master in the Making","review":"Diamond Age qualifies as one of the best new sci-fi books I have read in the past ten years. In many ways, though the style is quite different, it reminds me of Hyperion. The reason is that both books go back to the basics of what makes great sci-fi. Both explore the impact of singular inovations on society. In the case of Diamond Age, it is nanotech.Stephenson asks a profound question. How would society structure itself if it eliminated want? What if there was no more shortage and social structure needed a basis other than division of scarce resources? Stephenson answers this question brilliantly, all the while rapping it in an engrossing story with interesting characters. The book never gets lost in its technology, but instead is firmly rooted in a gripping story that pulls the reader in.In short, this is a wonderful book that I could not put down and is a must for serious sci fi fans. I am certain you will enjoy it immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Novel","review":"This book is a wonderful, intriguing, groundbreaking novel! Absolutely worth the read.As for the person who reviewed this book here who \\"hates the city (Chicago) . . . can't wait to leave it.\\" Just where are you going to go when you finally turn 16? The suburbs? What's the matter, can't you stand culture? Are you longing for the strip malls, tasteless food, ugly architecture, 30 screen movie theaters and Sport Utility Vehicles of suburbia? Why don't you just move to Wrigleyville?"},{"rating":"1","title":"beautifully written but ultimately unsatisfying","review":"The writing is sublime, the premise intriguing, but in the long run this novel just doesn't deliever. Nell, the heroine, is wonderfully drawn but then, for reasons known only to the author, squanders all her years with the Primer for a job in a brothel. And what's with the little girls army? That just struck me as improbable and silly. I also didn't understand the Drummers or what Miranda is doing with them at the end. The endless indepth nanotech discussion and descriptions will delight anyone who is interested in this subject but it makes for boring reading if you're not."},{"rating":"2","title":"building, Building, BUILDING, HOLY COW, hey what happened?","review":"\\"The Diamond Age\\" presents some fascinating and not outlandish future tech visions. Mixed with outstanding insight into political, sociological, moral and educational concepts that caught me by surprise, halfway through the book, I thought I had stumbled onto GREATNESS. Unfortunately, starting with the undersea drummers society, the interlacing arc of ideas began to go off course and Neal or his editor seemed to push the self-destruct button and wrapped it up in a hurry.\\"A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer\\" will be on the futures 'Wish List' of every parent who reads this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life doesn't end neatly -","review":"Good story, great read. Takes some flexibility to follow all the story lines, but the skein of the stories actually shows part of the social commentary sewn through the book. If you're looking for brain candy, just read the story: if you're looking for purpose in your books, this is a good reflection of some of the best and some of the worst motivations of mankind. It's not neat and it's not pretty and it's not complete: but like life it hangs together in a messy mass, has it's own beauty and is much more than it seems. This story can make you think and can make you re-evaluate your motivations and your place in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like browsing the net? You will love Stephenson's Metaverse!","review":"Here we are shopping at Amazon.com on the net when what we really want do is shop in persona at the Metaverse storefront. Hey all you Microhackers. Read this book. Make is happen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Snow Crash, but where's the AI?","review":"There are a lot of interesting plot elements, but they don't form a coherent whole for the most part. The ending is kind of weak.Then there is the fact that there is no artificial intelligence to speak of in his world, which is a necessary device for his plot (and because of that really sticks out like a sore thumb), but totally unbelievable considering the other marvels that are shown, even from a conservative point of view.If it weren't so full of neat ideas and plain fun, I'd give it a much lower rating.Read it while it's fresh, because as with most books based on cool science, it probably won't age very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great first half, poor finish.","review":"Like _Snow Crash_, _The Diamond Age_ is populated with wonderful characters, some of whom we have the privilege to see growing up. But the book loses something once the characters have grown up, as though the training they are given in order to be smoothly assimilated into the elite of society requires instead that they somehow dominate--even subjugate--that group.The concept at the core of the book--the Primer--is a bit reminiscent of Ender's desk in Orson Scott Card's seminal _Ender's Game_, but is handled in a fairly original way.Though I was completely enthralled its first half, this book--much like Gibson and Sterling's _The Difference Engine_--fails to capitalize on its finest ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long, dreary road to a salvageable ending","review":"After reading Cryptonomicon and Snow Crash, I jumped right into Diamond Age with enthusiasm. Based on those two books, I felt that this author could not possible write anything short of outstanding. How wrong I was!Diamond Age began with pathetically uninteresting characters in a future that makes me want to run off and live in the woods. I know that Stephenson likes to paint dreary pictures of the future in which technology does not solve all our problems, but it is the ridiculous cultural setting as well as the tech that ruins this book.The book is waaaay too long, incorporating about 100 times more of the Primer than is necessary to make the story interesting. I must say that he does salvage it somewhat in the end, with an interesting finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe of nearly the worst sort","review":"Another long, wandering tale, poorly thought out and very unimaginative. The clumsy ending just confirms the reader's worst fears. However the future turns out, it definitely WON'T be anything like this \\"cyberpunk meets The Sand Pebbles\\". The author has heard of molecular nanotechnology, but can't see past the simplest, most obvious implications. The rest of the book is the same: name dropping, but no real information or knowledge to prop up the boring characters in their uninteresting lives. The author can't even define hypocrisy, which may explain how he had the gall to foist this rag on an already suffering public"},{"rating":"2","title":"How many new, plausible ideas can you stand?","review":"Just when you think you can relax when reading this book, Neal Stephenson throws in another creative, plausible, and disturbing idea, that always works brilliantly with and for the plot. There are multiple threads of plot, characters, and action at all times, which wind sinuously with each other. The overall impression is of a complex, exploring, engrossing, HUGE, and deeply satisfying book"},{"rating":"1","title":"A mix of marvellous ideas that disappointed as a whole","review":"Having heard only positive reports of Stephenson's work (especially \\"Snow Crash\\") I expected interesting ideas and a good story when I picked up \\"Diamond Age.\\" I found the former, but not the latter.The world setting of the story was quite novel, and had great potential. The concept of an interactive educational tool, completely self-customizing for the needs of its user was another attendtion grabber. Besides the technological marvels and the admittedly excellent characterization, the plot was,alas, quite weak. The introduction of unexpected elements ('the Seed'??!) seemed a markedly artificial means of enlivening the story, and the actual conclusion itself was quite unsatisfying.Overall, the book failed to come anywhere near my expectations of a book from the well-recommended Neil Stephenson."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down after reading Snow Crash....","review":"I was very disappointed when I started reading this book. It is way to surreal for me. I have really enjoyed all his other books. Snow Crash was first rate and Zodiac made me want to be an eco-warrior but this book...OY.....I couldn't even finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling audiobook","review":"I can't finish the Audible audiobook version: the recording quality is distractingly bad.

Remember Neal Stephenson...Also read Anatheum.Neal Stephenson...Neal Stephenson..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Me Bored and Hungry","review":"Though Stephenson has some titillating fantasies about nanotech to share, they fail to overcome the lack of a compelling plot. Usually I can't put a good book down. This one I found hard to plod through. The story finally gelled and became somewhat interesting about 2/3 of the way through the book, but even then it never really grabbed me. It seemed as though Stephenson relied on imaginative sound bites of future tech to carry the book, while the story wandered around and really went nowhere.Two thumbs down. I usually pass on my favorite reads to a good friend. I wouldn't waste his time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephenson has imagination, but no craft","review":"Imangining interesting gadgets and how they might affect society are his only greatness. He does not understand story, and he does not understand people.If he learns the craft of story, he may yet be great. Until then he's an interesting might-have-been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointngly pointless","review":"I find it almost unbelivable how the author who wrote Snow Crash, which is one of the greatest books I ever read, could also write something like this. The sole explanation that I can find is that it seems that authors, like programmers, often fail miserably with their second project, as they loose the focus on what is important and what not in their writing.This is what I think happened here. The characters are schematic, the action also schematic, the plot inexistent. Nothing really happens in this book. The focus is on the effects of nanotechnology on the world - but in my opinion a single-sided boring view (for example, in the whole book there are no computers or AIs).The author makes some presumtions about the future which seem very wrong - but this would not be a problem if the book wasn't so badly written!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total crap","review":"Snow Crash was brilliant, this story was pathetic and poorly put together. There is no point to the majority of what happens in this novel and the ramblings of the author could have easily been cut in half. Worse still, all the possibly interesting contents -- Hackworth's story, Dr. X, CryptNet -- weren't flushed out and instead ignored in this tale about nothing. A war happens at the end, unexplored and for no purpose to the plot. Read a different novel, as this one isn't worth your time. I want the time I spent on it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good isolated ideas, worst novel I had ever read","review":"I forced myself to read to the end of the book because of the good critic the book has. The end of the novel was the \\"Best part\\" in the sense that the pain of reading had finnaly come to an end.Then I started \\"Snow Crash\\" (god knows why) and I couldn get past the 4th chapter: \\"a super hacker that does pizza deliveries and if he doesnt reach the destination in X minutes he get killed?...And the mafia rules the pizza biz?\\". I HAD to stop reading, I felt stupid...Neil Stephenson is the worst writer in have ever read in my life. I am cleary stating all this because these reviews can really be misleading. I have to admit that he has some brilliant ideas like the nanotech world, but save me all the rest of the story.To the ones that didn't like this book I recomend them to take a look at \\"Hyperion\\" or \\"RAMA\\" (for hard sci-fi) and \\"The Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy\\" (for fun sci-fi) and the good old Neuromancer and secuels (for cyberpunk csi-fi)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced","review":"As I write this, the Kindle edition is only 50 cents cheaper than the paperback, and text-to-speech is disabled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! What a waste of 8 hours!","review":"When I picked up this book, I was hoping that it wasn't as confusing and as hard to follow as William Gibson's Neuromancer. I was pleasantly engaged by the first half of the book. Wonderful world building, attention to detail, and captivating characters. Unfortunately, it went downhill from there.After the halfway point, the book lost what little semblance of a plot it had to begin with. There seemed to be no motivation behind the characters actions. We seem to just be looking in on segments of peoples' lives with no ultimate goal in mind. At the end, there was no climax and no resolution. It was as if Mr. Stephenson couldn't figure out how to finish the book and so just stopped writing at the end of a random chapter. I finished the last page and, literally, asked myself, \\"What the hell was that! \\" I felt like Mr. Stephenson had just wasted 8 hours of my life. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"Having read Snow crash already, I picked up the Diamond Age with no hesitation. I knew I would be in for a rip-roaring good story that would teach and entertain me at the same time. I was not disappointed. Stephenson's knack for incorporating the details of his obviously extensive research without coming off as a pedagogue is unparalleled. The book falls short of five stars for its ending, though, which seems rushed compared to the attention to detail given the rest of the novel. Nevertheless, that's a small quibble for a novel by which I was consistently challenged -- and rewarded for the effort. When it was finished, I was a bit saddened because this was one of those rare novels I wanted to spend more time with when it had come round to its conclusion. Incidentally, the cover art on the British edition is much better than what's shown here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephenson creates intriguing nano tech world","review":"Diamond Age is a fascinating read although it loses steam half way through. Stephenson writes about the future with nano technology as if hes been there. The characters are well written (more believable than Snow Crash) and there is a lot of insight into differences between cultures (philes). Stephensons background in Geography and Physics is quite evident here. I would give it 4.5 stars and it would be even better if the plot was cleaned up a little as it starts to drag and become convoluted in the middle. Still worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neal Stephenson is akin to William Gibson in cyberpunk","review":"As well as akin to some of the Old Masters of Science Fiction/High-Tech, like Asimov or Clarke. He already has an impressive body of works: \\"Cryptonomicon\\", \\"Zodiac\\", \\"Snow Crash\\", \\"Quicksiver\\", etc. The various high-tech attributes, such as taking place in a far-flung future society that is \\"Victorian\\" in nature and the use of a super-computer built by nanotechnology (the \\"primer book\\") all rank him with the Old School of Science Fiction/High-Tech. I, personally, have added this book (and his others) to my collection: \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\", \\"the Foundation series\\", \\"I, Robot\\", \\"Starship Troopers\\", \\"Childhood's End\\", \\"Neuromancer\\", \\"Virtual Light\\", \\"Mona Lisa Overdrive\\", \\"Count Zero\\", \\"Darkeye: Cyber Hunter\\" and so on.

It is key to the story that you somewhat understand how it works. The story is very compelling and you find yourself cheering on the characters.

I've used a couple of other leading brands before, and I have nothing but good things to say for the DW421! The dust bag used to fall off from time to time, but no more. I didn't do anything to fix it, it just stopped falling off. I have recently replaced the hook/loop pad for the first time, and I change paper a lot. The finish quality is superb, with no swirls, and it really works fast! The finish is very good when using DeWalt brand papers, but I like the Klingspor paper just a bit better.

DeWalt needs to rework this pronto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Durable, but too much downtime","review":"This Dewalt is a durably built sander, but the plastic ring used for the controlled finishing feature wears out much too quickly. I only get about 4-6 hours of use before this part need replacing. No home improvement, hardware, or building supply sells this part in my area, which means it has to be ordered everytime the part wears out, meaning too much downtime. Not only does this part have to be replaces every 4-6 hours of use, the part itself costs $7 to $8 apiece. This is extremely poor design and needs to be corrected. The hook and loop also stopped accepting sand paper after about 10 hours of use, however, I'm using the cheaper priced adhesive backed paper on the worn pad and it works fine. As much as I use the sander, I would be much better off buying another brand sander with the money it takes to replace the controlled finishing ring and the pad.

Plus it's inspiring, making the concepts very easy to apply.The book covers the basics of writing fiction and does so in a very illustrative manner. It talks about the proper way to use dialog, adding details that help to set a tone or make a point, and others.

One bolt fell out of the carburetor and a second one was loose. By the time I had changed oil the first time, I hated this machine. It is impractical to back up without pulling the wheel pins and placing in free-wheel mode. The wheel pins keep falling out. You can't back it up without straining a muscle in your back. And after a couple of hours, the tubular frame was twisted, due to the constant pressure on the handle trying to keep it going straight. It has a directional bias.

This book does a very good job explaining the mode of thinking that lisp programmers use; in other words, it's a very introspective book.It is aimed at people who know how to use the language already; for an intro, you may wish to look at his book _ANSI Common Lisp_.About macros: It is an important feature of the language. If you eventually decide that macros are harmful, it is best to been shown macros' full strength so you can make such an informed decision.If you don't know what macros are, they're just sort of a shorthand you define, that gets expanded to its full form.

I purchased it knowing it would be a good one because I enjoyed watching Spirited Away, Castle in the Sky, and Kiki's Delivery Service. Also available from Studio Ghibli on Amazon! This movie is truly a touching tale... so purchase it today... you will not be regretful, at least, I wasn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hayao Miyazaki's fans","review":"I have yet to watch the English version of this film so my review is based on the original Japanese release. It's a light and fun story of a high school girl who saves the life of a cat who ends up being the prince of Cat Kingdom. The kingdom therefore wants to shower Haru with gifts, one of the gifts is becoming the princess of the Kingdom. This is one our family's favorite Hayao Miyazaki films (behind Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service). Our three year is always asking to watch it.We did watch a few minutes of the English version just so our daughter could understand more (she's just learning Japanese) and the voices were better than most of the Disney dubbed films. However, one voice ruined it for us (the king's servant) and we switched back to Japanese. I'd recommend the Cats Return to parents of young kids or anyone that enjoys Hayao Miyazaki's films or Japanimation in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little criticism","review":"I feel there is no need to go over the basic plot of the story since so many have done a far better job than I could ever do. Instead I will cover a few minor points that weren't mentioned in other reviews.Having seen this movie on a big screen in original Japanese, with English Subtitles, I fell in love with this movie immediately. With a few exceptions, like the substitution of a few lines (e.g. a couple light \\"perv\\" references) and the numerous annoying \\"Babe\\" comments, the essence of the original was retained in the American release. I am slightly displeased that the subtitles are off of the English dialogue, not the Japanese. Nonetheless this is a great movie to add to any animation collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and Spontaneous","review":"This movie took me totally off guard.

The humor was witty and spontaneous, and the characters had excellent chemistry with each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Cat Should Return!","review":"This was my first viewing of a Studio Ghibli movie and I am very, very impressed. The story of young Haru (Anne Hathway in the English dub), trying to find acceptance is truly spectactular. The art work is nothing like you've ever seen, the colours vary from bold, soft, dark to reflect the scene you are seeing. Even if you don't care for, hate or love or are neutral on anime this is a feature you can enjoy since it's not too simple or complex. It's a refreshing movie that may remind you of the old Disney movies. Though this movie is G it isn't too kiddy or (obviously) too adult. Everyone from a small child to an adult can enjoy this. You don't need to rent it first, this is worth adding to your collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"falls short of Ghibli magic","review":"I watched this for the first time last night, and after watching Totoro, spirited away, Secret Life of Arrieti, this movie falls short.The characters are not believable or in any way likable.If you are looking for more great movie magic from Ghibli Studio skip this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too basic for me.","review":"Simple basic children's film which is lovely and sweet for kids but anyone older than ten I can't imagine getting too much from this.I'd go for Spirited Away and if you like that Howl's Moving Castle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but glad I decided to rent it instead....","review":"It was ok, but I've seen better from Studio Ghibli. I had this item in my cart for awhile and I came across it at Blockbuster one night and decided to give it a shot. Again, glad I rented it first because it was NOT something I would purchase. I think I would've been really mad if I had bought this online and watched it. Usually when I watch Studio Ghibli films I walk away remembering something breathtaking or a wonderful feeling I got while watching it. Not so with this one. I don't remember anything about this film except for some cats walkin' around on their hind legs talking and crap. Again, don't waste your money, rent it. It cost me 2 bucks to rent at Blockbuster."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cat Retrns is really Meowth-ful! (No Pun Intended!)","review":"You know, this film kept me laughing on and off all the time, especailly in several scenes when Haru (played by Anne Hathaway), the main character, sometime emotionally freaks out and screams aloud, like the one when she's found out she's become a half-cat! It was very funny, ha-ha-ha! And the waltzing part when Haru was dancing with the Baron was so classic too! Anne Hathaway and the rest of the cast have done a superb job in their voice-work! Meow!The only problem is that it's kind of short in the story part; otherwise, it's all perfect in every other aspect, such as soundtrack, voice-work and choreography. Therefore, The Cat Retrns is really Meowth-ful! (No Pun Intended!). I'd like to give this film a 4 out of 5 stars for Meowth-ful performance! Meowwwth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent movie; Bad DVD","review":"This movie isn't really up to par with Ghibli's other work, but it's still pretty good. It's really simple and transparent and aimed at kids, but it's not without charm. Plus, the animation is really something to look at.However, this item gets 2 stars, because the DVD is messed up. On all of the other Ghibli/Disney releases, the viewer is given two subtitle choices: one is a closed caption version of the English dub, and the other is a more literal subtitle translation of the original Japanese. Although this DVD gives the viewer both choices, both subtitle tracks are the same. They are both closed captioning for the English dub. This means that if you watch the film in Japanese with subtitles, you get a very inaccurate translation (sometimes you see subtitles without even hearing a line spoken.) It is incredibly annoying, and if I could, I'd return my copy. You've been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cat Returns","review":"Just to clear up a misconception - this film should not be considered a sequel to Whisper of the Heart. Although the two cat characters, the Baron and Muta, are shared in the two films, the stories have absolutely nothing to do with each other, other than the lead female character being a schoolgirl in a uniform, and both showing a realistic glimpse of life in Japan. In Whisper, Muta is truly Mute, while here he is a wisecracking albeit faithful warrior, who sounds not entirely unlike Nyako Sensei, a 1970s anime.If you like Ghibli, cats, Japan, fantasy adventure, or good Anime, you might like The Cat Returns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming","review":"Another wonderful, enjoyable movie from Studio Ghibli.

That style is for short pieces in technical journals. It is not for use in a work such as this. Instead of footnotes, the style interrupts the flow of the text by inserting author's names and pages within parentheses, breaking up the sentences.This might be a matter of choice for an author writing on a general topic. But in regards to academic dishonesty, the authors should also know that the type of discourse both dictates the type of citation to be used, and that certain citation systems are more given to academic dishonesty than others (when used outside of academic journals)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rollercoaster Ride Science Fiction and more...","review":"I wouldn't give The Clone 5 stars if the author didn't include the short story, \\"Young Again.\\" But this modern science fiction novel certainly deserves 4-stars for its chilling story of human cloning for the purpose of changing the world with a better model, an ancient and ambitious idea that has been tried a thousand times before. The Clone is more entertaining and sinister and is not bogged down with the science and political issues.

Unfortunately, I was so disappointed, that I never made it past the seventh chapter. Mr. Huntly's writing is so amateurish that he makes Michael Crichton look like Shakespeare.

It's use of standard and t-blades was the deciding factor. When I started sawing wood,I noticed that it cut to the right, so I had to face the saw about 25 degrees left to track straight.When I examined it, it looked like the the blade holder, or the entire shaft was crooked. The blade ran against the side of the guide bearing instead of being straight. The power-on locking mechanism did not work all the time, and it seemed chintzy. Also, the blade locking mechanism did not inspire confidence. Besides for these things, it was okay. I thought it felt good in my hand, and the power was good.I returned it and bought a Milwaukee 6266-21. I think I will stay away from Dewalt after this. Seems their QC is sleeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't recommend this saw","review":"I must own about 20 DeWALT tools and this is a frustrating tool. For the most part I really like DeWALT tools but this one needs to be redesigned. The blade will not track straight. The problem seems to be in the blade mounting system. I have never had a problem with the blade coming loose, however as you screw the cap to tighten the blade you can see the plunger start to turn as you crank down on this thing. Since you tighten to the right, the blade will end up pointed to the right. Now I have found that if you back off slightly you can line it up, but that's not the way a jig saw should work. I think that in this case you would be better served with a Bosch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have believed the bad reviews...","review":"After reading the review that said \\"read the manual\\", I figured I could pick up a good saw (that was badly adjusted) for short money. Oops. This thing is a piece of junk. It doesn't matter how aggressive (or not) the orbital action is when the shaft has play - I can not get this thing to track a line properly, or to make true cuts. Since pretty much all of the professional quality tools use T-shank blades, it's getting harder and harder to find high-quality \\"u\\" blades, so the fact that they don't fall out of the saw is pointless - the saw was designed and advertised as working with both, it should work for both.Of course, try looking for a used Bosch - there aren't any, at least not any with a good discount over new. Guess that should tell you something right there. Save your money and buy a Bosch first time out instead of trying this piece of junk first."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Dud!","review":"Despite the hefty price tag and prestigious name, this saw won't hold a blade!

Upon use, I have found that the saw refuses to cut straight and can sometimes change as if a mind of its own. The most annoying problem is the bolt and locking extension for the bevel adjustment. This adjustment will vibrate loose often, causing bad things to happen to your cuts since the blade will torque and the bevel changes. Tightening it up is also a pain, since any common renches, nutdrivers, etc. will not fit into the tiny area. If I had known, I would have bought the Bosch, Milwaukee, or Makita."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would I recommend this saw to a friend?

I have used DeWalt tools almost exclusively in both building and woodworking and always found them to be top rate. This pile of junk however, is the most inaccurate and impossible to use tool I have ever seen. The blade lock does not hold secure, and the sole plate lock never fully tightens which results in a tapered and off center cut every time. The instructions are not clear and without any previous tool use, the saw would likely be a mystery. I saw where a previous reviewer had given this away, I however could never hate anyone so badly to give them this tool. After ruining a recent project that was near completion, I threw this saw in the dump where it hopefully can do no harm. Do not spend any hard earned money on this wreck of a saw, find another.

I don't use it daily, but it does get more than its fair share of abuse. To this day, any problems with it have been due to my inexperience.One thing to keep in mind with any saw is having the right blade for the job. Ask your local home improvement expert which type of blade is right for your project. When I first used the saw, I was using an all purpose blade to do everything. After experimenting with a few different types on differend stock, I learned just how much difference they make.For me, this saw has worked great on everything from from countertops to crafts and beyond. It is more than powerful enough for a casual woodworker like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Try","review":"De Walt had a great idea when they made the 321. It is handy to have a saw that will take both Bosch and Universial shank blades, that way, you can go into your local hardware store that only sells Black & Decker products and get blades.

I bought this to replace a 20 year old Craftsman which required a screwdriver to change blades. Somewhat inconvient, but it works. It took me 20 minutes to install the blade in the Dewalt. When I turned it on, the blade shot across the room. I have owned a number of good Dewalt tools in the past, which is why I bought this one. I hope the 30 day warrenty isn't up so I can return this saw for another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy A Bosch!!","review":"Just recently I had a chance to put the Bosch and the Dewalt through the ringer. I had 42 rafters on a house with swoops that had to be cut in them, no easy task for any saw. The Dewalt didn't last through four cuts seven feet long before it gave out. Not too worry though the Bosch picked up the slack. The problem was, there is a tiny pin that holds the blade holder on the Dewalt straight, sort of a locking pin. This system needs some serious help. Once it pops out or shreds you can not track straight with the saw. So go ahead and save yourself some money and buy the Bosch. Trust me you'll be fixing the Dewalt very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I own several DeWalt tools and love them (circular saw, cordless drills), and so I figured this jigsaw would be similarly great.

Still, it's a lot of fun, with a successful attempt by the authors to outdo themselves on every page - some plot twists are plainly mind-blowing. The first book, The Prodigal Sun, is actually the weakest, so if you like that one, you're in for a ride. In contrast to some other reviewers, I actually like the ending.

It turns out to be a mixture of traditional and modern, which is fine - but not what I really wanted. The titles are all given in English, but the chorus sings (thankfully) in Latvian. There is an acoompanying booklet, but it has little useful information and there are no texts and translations. What were the producers thinking??? A program of sung music in a foreign language MUST have texts and translations. The music is lovely, but who knows what they are singing about? The listener has no access to anything beyond pretty sounds. The producers of this CD, Rykodisc, deserve the blame for this botched release."},{"rating":"1","title":"renee olstead","review":"CD arrived in condition as described.

I LOVE IT! It's very lightweight and easy to attach to my bike. I can hardly tell it's back there (except when there is a significant wind then the thing is a parachute). There were no instructions on how to assemble, my poor husband had only the picture on the box to go by. I haven't used it as a stroller yet but it looks very easy to put the front wheel on. I don't like the shoulder straps, however. I wish the fasteners were your normal clips (like on a stroller) instead they are the hook clip that can be rather difficult to undo (especially if you have a 1-year-old that's had enough of the bike ride). Other than that, I'm very happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Child does not like it","review":"This product might be great for a child that feels comfortable with zero support and is not upset by awkward straps. My son has tried this trailer out probably 10 times in the past year. We were hoping he would grow to like it. The canopy seats offer zero support for his back and the straps are quite awkward. I'm not sure how any kids would like this because my husband and I both feel like we should have spent an extra $100 or $200 for a better quality trailer. If your child is easy to please and is content with most situations, by all means, go for it. If your child is a bit picky and likes to feel supported - I would not recommend this bike. We are going to try and sell it on Craig's List for $50 - $75 to try and recover whatever money we can.

I bought this trailer because it had 20\\" alloy wheels, allowing for easier rolling and a bit of shock absorption, alluminum frame for lighter weight, the option to convert easily to a stroller if i wanted to, and the brand name Schwinn, which i think gives a bit better resale value than instep brand would.Overall I am very pleased with the performance of the bike trailer, the sling style seat is a bit strange to me, but my 21 month old does not seem to mind it at all.I would recommend this trailer to anyone who doesn't mind not having the brand name Burley on their bike trailer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good trailer","review":"We find the trailer easy to put together and tow around 2 kids.I don't have any issues with the shoulder straps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal!","review":"I bought this about a year ago. My son and I go all over Chapel Hill with it. He loves it, and so do I. It's a great way for me to spend time with my son while running errands and getting exercise. We never vacation without it. If I were designing this trailer I might tweak some things, and I've seen features on other trailers that look nice, but I think you'd be a fool to spend more on a trailer unless you were planning to do some serious single-track mountain biking with your child in tow. It's like harnessing your child into their own roll cage, which makes it WAAAY safer than a bike seat.The only minuses I can even think of are a cheap front wheel for the stroller conversion (it's made of plastic), I had to reglue the safety flag, and it doesn't lock in the folded position. All of those can be fixed if you're willing to spend double the money on Burley or a Chariot. Save your cash. You're a parent.

Customer Service is not helpful at all. After 2 months of going back and fourth they are not able to provide any solution and decline that there is a problem with this design.

Though Kearney despises Yazzie, he takes the job. Yazzie offers him money, Kearney has respect for Terry's ex-wife, and Kearney is Sammy's God-father.Kearney begins the hunt. The clues come.

The descriptions of landscapes made them real and inviting, and the addition of watercolor paintings made it that much more vivid. The offbeat coloquialisms made it interesting, in some repects, but I still think this novel falls short of the people and places described within its pages.The plot seemed dull, and there wasn't any real who-dunit story that weaves a reader into a web. I thought this was more like an episode of \\"Columbo\\" where you already knew who did it, and it was just a matter of catching the bad guys. The clues found by the detectives seemed haphazard and that they just happened to bump into things by chance.

Kevin Kerney is an intriguing character with lots of layers to be probed. The plot is intriguing although the ending is a bit contrived and the scenery is vivid.

It is noisy and dusty (I don't use the available \\"shop vac\\" connection, this might change the dusty part...).It does do a good job in terms of alignment, and ease of use. This is my first biscuit joiner, and this unit has made me a fan of this system. I use it mainly for attaching solid wood edges to plywood, which it did well. I like the rack and pinion height adjustment separate from the fence height adjustment.

The pitch will remind you of the dentist chair every time you run it, but the worst feature is that the motor cooling vent is on top of the machine, and you will get a blast of air/dust in the face and eyes because of their chosen design, it's a real pain.The DeWalt does the job, but along with the non-precise travel after adjustment and tightening in the fence I would recommend the PC or Lamello. I recently purchased the PC 557K because of the lousy Dewalt design and dumped the Dewalt at a second hand tool store and laughed all the way, to pick up my new PC several months ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dewalt is no Porter-Cable","review":"Because this unit was $50 cheaper than the Porter-Cable, I thought I would give it a shot. Bad idea. The Porter-Cable has more angle settings and more power which make a cleaner cut in hard woods. The Dewalt fence is feable and is easily prone to damage.

Not only was it missing a pin on which the miter swivels up and down, but the blade cut far too deep, no matter how much I adjusted it. I had to stick a 16p nail in the missing hole to keep the miter from flopping around while working. It was a good thing I made many test cuts since it cut far deep. For example, on setting \\"0\\" it cut so deep that a \\"0\\" biscuit completely disappeared in the cut. I was finally able to crank the fine depth adjustment down so that on \\"0\\" setting I could use a \\"10\\" biscuit. I normally purchase DeWalt by default since I have never had anything but good luck with them, but boy did I get screwed on this one. Fortunately the retailer is taking it back based on the 90 day money back guarantee. I am honestly not sure I want to chance another DeWalt joiner at this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tool","review":"I order this tool for a special project and was ready to use it as soon I got it out of the box. I started to cut the first joint and the handle collasped forward and smashed by fingers. On closer inspection I found that the threads in one side of the handle were stripped completely out. With care I continued to use the tool to finish the project. Later I filled the hole with metal epoxy and re-threaded it. I am sure dewalt would have made it good but I didn't have time. Somewhat dissapointed but the tool works great if you keep your fingers \\"from between the bricks\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"I purchased a new Dewalt 682K. The instructions were not great, especially for me (a relatively new woodworker). However, the problem was the depth gauge for the plunge--none (0, 10, 20, M) worked. With the exception of 0 (which was much deeper than it should have been), the other three were all the same depth. So, I took it back to the vendor (Western Tool). They pulled out a floor model to compare. Its depth guage didn't work either! That was the end of my Dewalt biscuit joiner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Value","review":"First, the rack & pinion design of the fence makes this a very stable and accurate tool. It is powerful and the grip and switch location is convenient. When used without the vacuum attachment, this machince shoots the chips right at the operator. However I always use a vacuum attachment because I don't like having all those chips all over the shop anyway, so this is not a serious draw back. The Porter Cable which is priced competitively offer a smaller blade option for face frame construction but the handle is awkward and the fence is sloppy. This tool works great. It is accurate, dependable and easy to use. You could buy a more expensive tool and get a greater degree of refinement but if all you want is a dependable tool that does its job well. I recommend this. If you cut biscuit joints all day long you may want a quieter tool. If you only make a few pieces of furniture at a time, you will be probably be glad you saved the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice tool needed tweeking","review":"I bought this tool before I found this review page, and I was a little disappointed with the lack of accuracy when edge-butting long boards. I had probably 1/32-1/16\\" difference between the two boards. requiring lots of sanding. When I read on this review page of the lack of parellel between cutter and fence common with this tool, I checked it out, and sure enough, one side was higher than the other, reference the fence. Easy to adjust---just loosen the two Torx fasteners and bring to parellel. Test boards indicate about 1/64\\" difference now, and I could get it closer if I wanted to continue tweeking the settings.Other then the inaccurate factory settings, the other complaint is the joke of a dust bag. When trying to use it, the chute becomes clogged almost on the first cut. Leave the dust bag in the case, check the settings, adjust as necessary, and this really is a very nice, powerful, and easy to use tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"Here is my story...after two attempts to purchase this joiner, I went with the PC 557. Both of the Dewalt models I bought had their fences racked which caused the biscuit slots to be cut on an angle. Cutting a #20 slot was off about 1/8\\" from left to right. Plus, reports of the chute clogging are true. It was worth $30.00 more to get the PC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use and works great","review":"I read the instruction, looked it over and made a few test cuts with it.

The exception is the an early scene in which HB and crew try to fight off thousands of tiny fairies with single shot pistols - the only victims of the fairy mass attacks were the non-essential characters which makes the fight seem contrived HOWEVER the main problem with HBII is the dialogue which is simple and insipid and utterly lacking in imagination - the humor aims for the lowest common denominator and at times lapses into slapstick - poorly done slapstick at that. My advice - do not buy this movie before you screen it.Glenn"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hellboy II: The Golden Army","review":"Hellboy II was not as good as hellboy I, it was kinda corney, now I guess we wait for hellboy III to see what the baby looks like.

I bought this along with the first one. they both shipped quickly and I received them very fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful vision of the graphic novel","review":"Hellboy 2 has a new story unrelated to the first film. Del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) was also a lot more involved in the art direction and wow, it shows. The visuals were simply beautiful. Some might like the plot of Hellboy 1 a little better, but after watching it again, I would say they're about equal to me. This installment is definitely more fantastic and I like that.I really liked the movie even from the opening history vignette that is acted out by animated wooden figures. The whole production oozes style. It has the humor of the first movie and enough eye candy that it would be worth a watch even if the plot sucked, which it didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME!!!","review":"Today is my 19th Birthday and I received this as a Birthday present! I thought it was really good and just as good as the first! This time, Hellboy and his crew has to stop a Prince from raising the Golden Army and taking over the world. Abe falls in love with the Price's sister. I highly recommend HELLBOY II: THE GOLDEN ARMY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE...CANT WAIT FOR A HELLBOY III","review":"If you liked the first one you will difinately want to see the 2nd one.If you didnt see the first one you should difinately watch them both. I love sci-fi movies. Movies that take you out of everyday and into a dimension of the unknown. It was captivating and exciting. I love to purchase the DVD's to watch at home so I can pause when I want or rewind if i didnt catch something. Having all the same characters return for the 2nd Hellboy is also a plus. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too flashy - not enough substance","review":"The first movie was very much more betterer. Too much flash and not enough substance in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hellboy+Evil Elf+Bad Slapstick=Mediocre Film","review":"I've been a a fan of the comic Hellboy for a long time and I enjoyed the first movie so I was set to really dig this one. I thought that Del Toro could do no wrong after HB 1 and Pandora's Box. How wrong I was. What we got was a \\"Evil\\" elf straight of of Lord of the Rings who was about as evil as and altar boy next to Rasputin in the first movie which manager to balance the darkness of H.P. Lovecraft with the levity of the comics (but not too much like HBII)Overall, HBII was a mess and was matinee kiddy-fare with hardly a chill in sight except for the tooth fairy's who were still too bloody cute to be scary. Add to all this mess the comedy routine between Abe and HB and it was mostly a loss. I was bitterly disapointed after walking out of the theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most disapointing sequel since Highlander II","review":"What a HUGE diappointment. Del Toro took the characters that we fell in love with, in the original Hellboy, and made them each drink a pot of coffee and take a bottle of No-Doze thinking it was going to give us more of what we wanted. So wrong. There were certain scenes that looked like ripoffs from \\"Lord Of The Rings\\", \\"Never Ending Story\\" and even a Star Wars Mos Eisley Cantina bar scene thrown in for good measure. One cheesey scene after another. I haven't been this disappointed in a sequel since Highlander II when Russell Mulcahy turned our lovable earth bound immortals into whacko aliens from planet Zorg. Don't waste your money on this one, wait for it on TV - then watch something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hellboy meets Men In Black","review":"What a disappointment. It is hard to imagine that the same director who put together Hellboy would allow this confused production into public view.From the very beginning the script was contrived and confused. The depiction of Hellboy as a \\"Young boy\\" was laughable and silly. From there we go into contrived story about a underworld with no real basis in plot. Talk about the inappropriate use of gratuitous monsters...one is reminded of the MIB and the bar of star war fame on several occasions, but not in a good way. The movie does no real character development except for a love development that is to say the least embarrassing. Not worth watching and a real disapointment for those of us who really enjoyed the real Hellboy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's already been said...","review":"Ok, first off I have to address the voice of Abe Sapien. I realize the whole story behind David Hyde Pierce refusing credit in the first movie because he felt the performance of Doug Jones was brilliant. Agreed. Doug Jones does a brilliant job wherever he appears. However he just doesn't carry Abe Sapiens character the way Hyde Pierce did. I too LOVED the first movie. Can't count the number of times I have seen it. But there was no threat to the world. I never feard for humanity. I never feared for Hellboy. And the overblown accent of Dr. Strauss was a movie killer. Even Sargent Schultz and Kernel Klink has better and more digestable accents. Beautiful imagery. TERRIBLE story telling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hellboy II: the golden army","review":"OK so who was that guy playing the evil prince??? He totally stole the show with his sword-play. Could'nt wait for him to return. Cute twist with Selma Blair; but talk about chaste. She did'nt even KISS Hellboy! A much better movie if they combined I & II. An evil FLOWER??? Come on, guys. And the Golden Army looked like yellow bowling balls; take a lesson from \\"Lara Croft\\" or the \\"Mummy\\" movies for creepy ancient return from the dead monsters.

They took Hellboy and made him a sissy. Everyone has a right to an opinion and that's cool, I just disagree with this one being any good. I ended walking out of the movie theater when it came out. I just tried to sit down and watch it again because it was on TV and after suffering through the whole thing. I know I was right to have left. Sure Pan's Labrynth was good but that does not mean that you have to like everything del Toro does. All they did was visual while the story itself either sucked or sucked the persona of Hellboy. Really, Freaking singing and sobbing over relationships? WTH? Why would they even include that scene? Trying to Humanize him for what? It's an action fantasy not a campaign for congressman. But it's ok, for most ppl this will be great since it's made for the masses. If you liked Idiocracy you will love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"100 STARS !!!!!!!!","review":"This is now my Favorite Movie of all time! I am so crazy for Hellboy!! it was so fantastic, so sexy I could see it over and over again! And can't wait for them to make #3! its amazing how well Hellboy did at Box Office even though the Hellboy comic is not as famous or well know as the Batman one!

The characters pull directly from the first movie and move nicely along into the second, seamlessly.All is exceptionally well done. The special effects, costumes, sound, music, plot... everything.This would certainly be best in a theater, however I rented and boy was I sorry I didn't go to see it while it was playing.Definitely for adults, language and violence are strong themed here. But if you're an adult who likes strong action/fantasy movies then this is the one for you. Without a doubt, one of my more recent favorites.Rent it.... you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Hellboy","review":"I love this movie. I got the HD version for my Kindle Fire HD and it downloaded quickly and the picture is amazing. Hellboy touches my heart because he trys so hard to fit in and also for the love he shows Liz.

I think it was horrible and not worth the money paid for the dvd. All three of us opted to shut it off without finishing it. Maybe I'm just not watching it right - but in my opinion it does not measure up to what the first one was. I'll just keep playing the first Hellboy over and over. Hellboy II will not be played again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Shipping, GREAT film!!!!!","review":"Shipped and arrived in my mailbox when i expected it to, perfect quality, no freezing or anything. THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING!!!!! If you found the first one kind of slow, then watch this one. This one has more action and more intensity. The best part is that, unlike Spider-man in Spider-man 3, *SPOILER* both Hellboy and Abe talk about the women they have fallen for and do not look weak!!! They show true love in this film, and true epicness, and good humor!!! 6/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth buying to complete the set","review":"Special effects really carry the film. The attention to detail and a somewhat complex plot leave you wanting more. The only drawbacks are: 1)Prince Nuada's over-extended training and fight sequences... We get it. 2)The overexposure of Hellboy's weird yellow eyes, instead of mostly shadowed in the first film. I understand that action is key to keeping short attention spans focused, but it's an unfortunate trend that sacrifices character development and general depth in key plot elements. I bought this sequel to complete the set, because the first one made me want anything related."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I bought it sooner","review":"Saw this DVD on Amazon for around $18 when it first came out and put it in my whis list.

Perlman's wisecracks and gritty attitude were funny, but Del Toro's normally inspired storytelling couldn't carry this comic book sequel.

The first movie was so much better and this was a total letdown. The underlying story was pretty corny, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been great","review":"So much CG talent and so much earnestness from Del Toro, so much visual splendor, and it's all to serve a story and screenplay that's plucked right from the head of a suburban ten year-old who plays Xbox all day. Studio movies tend to aim downward, but this one aims WAY down to the level of Shrek 2, or Nickelodeon. How this can be the same guy who gave us Pan's Labyrinth, I'll never know. Repeat, some great CG, but DUMB in the worst way possible. And by the way Del Toro, you've totally dated this movie by having everyone fight with that retread kung fu wire-fight style. So, Hellboy is a Chinese acrobat in his spare time? Man, I feel like I've insulted 10 year-olds in this review, now that I think about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny","review":"Disappointing. The humor essential to Hellboy's survival in a world that treats him like a freak is totally missing. Without this and his love for family he would totally crack up and destroy the humans around him. The love affair has been cheapened by marriage that makes the love a \\"given\\" rather than a genuine feeling that takes place against all odds. What's left is just another film about monster chasing. Yawn. Worse yet, this film seems confused about its audience. The scene with Hellboy fighting a monster while holding the baby is just a rehash of Hellboy I scene of fighting a monster while holding the kittens. While the kitten scene was believable, the baby scene is not - wouldn't he just put the baby down somewhere? What audience does this kind of scene appeal to? If you're going to write a film about monster-chasing, at least come up with some original material. And preferably make it somewhat believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like Toys","review":"The toy is pretty cool, and the movie in blu-ray looks great... but i wonder why they didn't do a hellboy instead of a soldier of the golden army as a toy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was so dissapointed","review":"It could have been so much better.

Cleanup of baked on dribbles have not been a problem so far. I own two of these. I have no regrets that I don't own the 24 piece pan because the smaller pan means one is more likely to have room for it in a fridge for a quick cool. And one feels very doll-housey using it.I bought this a few years ago.

Anna Russell's performance is a classic and the way the original opera is presented makes it a little bit easier for the young ones to enjoy it. Sure this is not the sort of thing you would see at the Metropolitan Opera House, but it is a lot of fun. And this Video brings back a number of good memories!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite classic","review":"Mother took me to see this film when I was a child. Loved it then and I still do. Have been searching for this video a long time. I have a German heritage. This is one of my favorite fairy tales and favorite operas. Learned to sing several of the arias. Danced the part of one of the 14 angels and later the dew fairy in OKC productions of this opera. Beautiful music performed in the opera comic style with singing and speaking. Wonderful visuals. Am preparing lesson plans which include this video and Bergmann's subtitled Magic Flute for a unit on opera. Unfortunately, this move is not for everyone. Today's audiences have been brought up on very shallow popular entertainment which is geared to the lowest common denominator. This lovely little piece of video art requires some cognitive activity on the part of the viewer and an attention span of more than 20 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charming film; awful transfer","review":"Aside from some silent classics, if ever a film needed a complete restoration, it's this one.

This book helped me get a true dressage seat. My horse is so thankful! I bought one to read and highlight, another to lend out. It's especially helpful for trainers to explain the physiological basis for the correct seat, hands, leg, etc. Also, for adults learning to ride, who process information much differently than kids, Susanne von Dietze knows how to explain riding properly. The book contains a lot of helpful photographs, as well as anatomical illustrations. The exercises and stretches are also great. My only beef with the book is that is was translated from German by a German, so the English is awkward at times, but this is a minor quibble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This book changed my riding - after ten years of riding and showing - I finally am developing the ever-elusive INDEPENDENT SEAT. My horse is delighted, moving freely forward and over her back. Filling up her ribcage and carrying me softly because I am no longer a nasty burden! Sitting the trot, without bobbing, weaving or bouncing is easy now if I align and control my body the way this book describes.I've promised it to many struggling rider friends, but can't let it out of my hands.It's very technical - lots of anatomy and physiology interspersed with simple little exercises, some in front of a mirror, that help you understand how your body can work when you're riding.

It is even better than I expected. The photos are as beautiful and moving as advertised. Especially good are the essays showing the continuity of understanding about the historicity of the site of Christ's tomb. The text also explains the various positions of the Christian churches with possession or rights within the Sepulchre/Resurrection complex. The book also does not shy from the embarrassing fact that ancient divisions within orthodox Christianity continue to this day. How wonderful it would be if these divisions could be put aside, especially in light of the current cultural and religious onslaught against Christians. I recommend that the book be ordered through Daedalus books (beware--Daedalus the book catalog, not the kinky publisher) because Daedalus has it in stock at a much reduced price."},{"rating":"1","title":"having a hard time following her.","review":"I love boxing but this video is way to complicated..

I was first introduced to Fodor's music when he appeared in my somewhat small city for a concert. He is a very fine virtuoso and I loved that nights experience. I listened to the cd and was amazed. He has great talent and this \\"brew,\\" mixture of different kinds of music is a great musical experience to anyone who loves the art of violin as well as music. He leers at you through his music and then lovingly puts his emotions into each note. Fun to listen to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Nice Laptop","review":"This machine was purchased for my wife to do her work-related activities on.

The problem is that's it's overpriced. I would like to see Dorel price this seat around $80, at which point I believe they would actually start selling these again. You can buy a Graco Nautilus for the LESS than this costs on Amazon currently. It will last most children longer and is a much nicer seat. No need for headrests, and it is made by a company that has a history of much more ethical practices than Dorel.The only situation I could imagine this being a good choice is if a child was obese, their parents could not afford a Britax Regent, and the car had headrests or high seat backs. I would only do so in that situation because it would be highly possible that the child would not fit into a Nautilus. Otherwise it's a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really like it!","review":"We've had this seat for over a year now & love it. My husband, who is strong, but not a beast, has never had any trouble getting the seat installed w/ the LATCH system. & we've moved the seat a 'few' times. I've even done it a couple times. My son loves it too. He is a tall 4yo who weighs 35lbs. Yes, we're early on the weight, but wanted to be prepared. All in all, a great seat at a great cost!

The arm rests are kind of useless and only get in the way when he climbs in and out.That being said my son likes it. and the harness is easy to use. I would definitely buy this seat again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It get's the job done.","review":"I purchsed this car seat because of the extra weight capacity in the five pont harness. My two (now almost three) year old weighs in at 37 pounds and, even though he met the weight requirements, he could no longer fit in the five point harnesses that are rated to 40 lbs. I've had the seat for almost a year.Pros:The seat is large and accomdates my son and his toys easily.Def. the five point harness weight limit.It's an attractive seat.The latch system is easy to use.PRICE! It's less than half the cost of the only other extra weight capacity five point seat out there.Cons:The arm pads come off .. and they are fun for baby to take off. Mine are gone.The cup holder is flimsy and mine broke within the first couple of months.Not much padding.Seat belt twists up and is a pain to use.Bottom line .. it's not perfect .. but if you want to keep your child in the five point harness for as long as you can .. it's a great way to go.

This is a series that has satisfied me as a reader more times than even Robert Asprin's Thieve's World series.

This is not a deep book, but action-packed with interesting plot twists.His descriptions of the Dells and Madison, Wisconsin are quite beautiful and especially of interest if you have been to the area. They made me want to see the Dells. The book describes sexual behavior a bit over the top unusual in a mystery novel.He also describes a type of community and characters I'm not familiar with but are plausible in this strange world.I was driven to read this book to the end as fast as possible because I really wanted to know what happened. And a lot happens in the many plot twists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Convoluted & Implausible","review":"By the time I had read about half this book, I could've given it 4 stars, in fact I was hoping for a crackerjack ending that would raise it to 5. I liked the reminiscing style of Thayer's writing plus not too much useless details. Then the book completely unraveled with too many unconvincing convolutions, an unbelievable plot twist bordering on ludicrous & of course evil, conspiratorial Republicans! And Pennington's voyeurism totally turned me off, watching teenagers...Ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hummm?","review":"All in all I did like the book. I enjoyed the narration, despite the fact that the narrator was somewhat of a depressant. However, I don't know if there was some sort of political bias crafted by S. Thayer, but republicans then and now obviously don't complement the rudimentary actions of the book's characters as the author might have intended. Secondly, and most importantly the reason why I rated this book lower than three stars is this: The sex scenes. I have heard of vicarious reading but this was more in the area of vicarious writing. Sure, it was illicit and many people will find these sections of the book exciting, but that is why they sell penthouse magazines. Three pages to describe (sexually) a scene (early in the book), and yet the point of the scene was summed up in less than one paragraph. Go figure?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this book was very overrated.","review":"The copy I have lists excerpts from apparently rave reviews. I was not that impressed. The book isn't terrible-the main character is rather interesting and the pacing isn't too bad but there were several flaws that kept me from really enjoying the book.The subplot featuring the presidential campaign was not convincing at all.Aside from Pennington, the characters were not very well-developed in my opinion.I think writers like Thomas H. Cook handle this type of material (sex and violence lurking in small towns, the downfall of high school heroes and protagonists with a troubled past) much better.I recently read Nancy Pickard's book about a beautiful dark-haired young woman with a complicated sexual history who is loved unrequitedly by a local law enforcement officer and is found naked and dead in a field (The Virgin of Small Plains) and I liked it a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short life, chatter","review":"IMHO, these wipers are cheap in price and performance; they wipe fairly well for a short time, but chatter and wear out quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"2000 miles later... it's damage?","review":"Installed 4-5 months ago, the blade already detached at the far hand and I hardly drive my car.

I know a lot about Mozart, and Die Zauberflote in general. IF someone HAD to make an abridged version of Die Zauberflote (don't ask me why!) they could have done a better job than this. Most of the great scenes are cut out, and the story is changed a bit! Cutting out two thirds of the opening scene (\\"Zu Hilfe! Zu Hilfe!\\") is a terrible idea, cutting out half of, \\"Der Holle Rache\\" is even WORSE, destroying the part where the Queen, Monastatos, and the Three Ladies are destroyed just as bad- Note: Cutting out the finale causes something like this to happen: \\"The Queen told Pamina to kill Sarastro. Sarastro says, 'That's okay,' Papageno finds a mate, and they live happily ever after.\\" What happened to the Queen? Ugh! Also, the sound quality is terrible. The costumes are ugly, and the staging, with staircases leading nowherte on either side of the stage, just doesen't work.

The video is an abridged version of the Mozart opera, The Magic Flute. I was disappointed by the poor video quality and poor production values. One of the reasons I purchased an abridged version is that the full opera would be much to lengthy for elementary school audiences and I thought I would be able to show this in its entirity due to its abbreviated length, but the video is so poor, it failed to capture even my interest as an ADULT with two music degrees (one in vocal music performance, no less).

This album tops their other releases: the riffs are brutal, the vocals are intense, and the drumming is the best its been on any Lamb of God release. This band one day will be the new Megadeth or the new Slayer. If I can see one down fall, its the vocals. They are very death metal-ish, and that may hurt the bands success. But for a metalhead, they fit the music well. Bless the metal gods for this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Un-freaking believable","review":"Two grossly oversized thumbs way up! This album is amaingly brutal and better than any other lamb of god release to date. These guys are taking metal into the mainstream by making their first major label release one of this caliber.

This cd will rip you open, feast upon your entrails, and then poop them out... metaphorically speaking.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was not big fan of LOG, Ashes changed my mind","review":"This CD has everything a true extrememetal fan loves. Great guitaring(riffs and leads), pounding drums, great bass rythms, and clear powerful vocals. The songs are good too. I was not a huge fan of the As The Palaces Burn, but this album has changed my mind about Lamb of God. Each song on this cd flows to the next one seamlessly. Many of the songs musically have a Meshuggah/Opeth(heavy Opeth/Deliverance cd) feel to them. If you like this you will probably love the new Unearth, the soon to be realeased Shadows Fall. I would say ShadowsFall, Unearth, Chimaira and LOG have the 4 top cd's of the past year, followed closely by Killswitch Engage, God Forbid, In Flames and Opeth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complex?","review":"I'm unsure how anyone could classify this album as complex or good metal. The guitars are mediocre at best, the vocals are more prominent than the music and I find them to be pretty awful. The only thing they have going for them are the drums.Also, pretty much every song (aside from the title track) sounds the same. Songs that stood out the most were Laid to Rest, Blood of the Scribe, and What I've Become. The rest I didnt find to be entertaining in the least.If you're looking for good metal, might as well look to their tour buddies Children of Bodom and Fear Factory, and others, i.e. In Flames, Killswitch Engage, Dark Tranquillity, Soilwork, Opeth, etc etc etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is LOG's best album.","review":"Another example of what modern metal can and should be.

Along with Mastodon, they are at the forefront of American Metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The kings of modern metal","review":"With this album, Lamb of God secure their slot as leaders of modern metal, and on their forthcoming tour they will be headlining over established acts Fear Factory and Children of Bodom which is quite an accomplishment. Simply put this is probably their best release so far, but New American Gospel is right behind it. Lamb of God really didn't change their sound much but they certainly improved with better production, and non stop shredding with riffs galore, and as always brutal breakdowns that make you want to punch the floor and jump in the pit. My favorite LoG song of all time is on here, \\"Now you've got something to die for\\". Other good songs are \\"What I've Become\\" and \\"Laid to Rest\\", but what am I saying people? This is a Lamb of God album, every song is simply amazing. If you like Lamb of God I highly recommend these other amazing bands: Chimaira, On Broken Wings, Throwdown, Devildriver, Darkest Hour, Unearth, Terror, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"wouldn't expect less...","review":"finally a metal band that has refused to sell out its sound after signing to a major label. a kick-in-the-junk follow-up to \\"as the palaces burn\\" and \\"new american gospel.\\" if you like these two albums, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"was good, but lost its luster","review":"like too much american \\"metal\\" these days, this album was great for the first week or two. then you realize that what you're hearing is WAAAY too much production applied to the same 4 or 5 riffs which are then just repeated. once those riffs go stale, the album is worthless. the only song on here i could see myself listening to for years is \\"one gun\\", and that is more about the lyrics and meaning of the song than the song itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks....","review":"I'm not a kid, I'm actually 17. This band does not do anything new or original for the genre of metal. Unless you consider throaty vocals an innovation. Just because Lamb of God is better than most contemporary metal bands, doesn't mean you should praise them. I say metal is dead(along with a plethora of other music genres). There are many great metal bands from the 70s - mid 90s, and I'm sure even the most diehard metalhead has yet to listen to a few. Let metal die, so we can stop misleading future generations of metalheads to listen to worse metal than they could actually be listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"PoserCore; The new music thats sweeping the nation","review":"Wow, Lamb of God is a horrible metal band period. I am a huge metal fan and Lamb of God are all posers. They try to play like real musicians but suck. And the vocals are god awful and guitar is the same as all metalcore bands. Trivium is so much better. Matt Heafy can actually sing melodic choruses and trivium knows how to play guitar and they drummer is also great, and even the bass is good. So I bet im gonna offend all of you who love this band and im glad, because this isn't metal. And going on epic was stupid also. They should have stayed underground. Now its funny to see the good charlotte kids wearing LOG t-shirts. They just arent as hard as you think. So avoid this cd. Your ears and sanity will thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell yeah!","review":"Lamb of God is like a shot of tequila... sometimes it goes down perfectly, other times it's like someone just kicked you in the throat. Either way it's exactly what you wanted when you took the shot. Lamb of God is in my opinion the most aggresive outfit in modern metal. Their style reminds me of Pantera (Southern Trendkill era) with elements of thrash thrown in for good measure. At times it's more than your ears can handle, but mostly it's good heavy metal fun. About the only critism I can think of is their political views... I am a Sgt in the USAF and I despise the anti-war message of today's metal. Aside from that I rock out to Lamb of God everyday... check out their older albums, especially New American Gospel. Metal rules, check out BLS, Shadows Fall, and Mastadon!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'd like to start by saying how amazing New American Gospel is. Then by saying what a solid follow-up As The Palaces Burn is. Lamb of God is truly one of the best American thrash/metalcore acts.However, If you enjoy either of their first releases, I would recommend skipping this one. It's disappointing and generic. If you're considering buying this and don't own the previous albums, buy them first. Lamb of God is an aggressive, technically skilled band, and I really expect their next release to be a comeback after this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Professional Badass's Soundtrack","review":"Oh man, this album kicks some major ass. If I'm not wearing headphones, there is no way I can't headbang while this album is blasting. And I've tried with headphones, they just come flying off and I can't hear the song anymore, which sucks, which is why I don't do it. In other words, this album makes you want to buy a strap for your headphones, or if you don't care about waking the neighbors, makes you buy a full Marshall stack, hook your CD player to it, turn all knobs to Max, and play the loudest metal you've ever heard outside of a concert. Like I mentioned above, if my job was to just walk around being a badass, this album would be my soundtrack. Some death metal comes across as ridiculous, with the unusual vocals and all, but people know not to mess with Lamb of God. I mean they're called LAMB OF GOD. Probably the best band name ever. And they make a sweet ass album too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd","review":"Lamb of God are definitely at the forefront of the American metal scene. They combine old-school metal with some of the \\"newer\\" hard-core death metal elements. This cd is solid all the way through and won't dissapoint the average metal-head. All things aside though, this cd is pretty tame compared to New American Gospel, quite possibly the best metal album to come out in the last 5 years. So that's why I only gave it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally got it together","review":"This is a really good Cd for about anybody that likes metal. The music is brutal and the production is crystal clear. At first it sounds like the vocals was somebody playing with a voice over machine and then by the third song finally learned how to use it.

A really good Cd for any fan of metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Explicit, yet still edited?","review":"This album says it's the explicit version yet it still has the swears edited out.

Obviously, he's not a metal fan. Consider the source, chilluns..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent all around album","review":"I'm not as much into Metalcore and the other styles Lamb of God is built on, but it's still got an American Death Metal edge to it, so I definitely enjoy this album. Also, the lyrics are deceptively well written. From a critical point of view, many of Lamb of God's albums have a hard time of keeping the interest high in the later half of the album and for some reason a way to close out the album just isn't found or reached. Ashes of the Wake actually closes well, but the vibe I feel is that this is a band that from then on, will not find a different way of acheiving this. So this is why I have have a luke warm feeling about Lamb of God in general, but Ashes of the Wake is their high water mark, and if you look at their lyrical ability, abrasive sense of melody, musicianship, the successful communication of bleakness towards the listener, despite some minor short comings, it's no surprise how well liked Lamb of God is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Metal Release of 2004.","review":"This is without a doubt the sickest batch of songs to be released in a long time. These guys are flawless both live and on tape. I can't stress enough what a major release this is for this band. I predict Lamb of God to be as huge as Slayer.Killer CD, every track is ferocious as hell. Grab their others also."},{"rating":"2","title":"best thrash album this year","review":"this album is so crazy. ive been listening to this album since i got it and havent gotten sick of it. i wish there were more guitar solos. mark and willie rip so hard they should change the bands name to lamb chops. chris is an amazing drummer, he doesnt just bash the set like some drummers today. randys voice has clarified so much since new american gospel. i love lamb of god. cant wait for the next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"great,great piece","review":"Lamb of God proved once again their value with this new album...As far as I can see, theres no other band that Lamb of god look alike...thei're very original,theres always that kind of \\"touch\\" in their sound who makes Lamb of God unique.Honestly, I enjoyed more As The Palace Burns, but this new album still rocks a lot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good.","review":"I took a chance on this CD because I'd heard one cut on the radio that I'd liked--but that turned out to be the only cut I liked. I was quite offended by some of the stupid, angry, creepy lyrics, and the music wasn't very pleasant to the ear either. Oooo, she's such a rebel. Only, not so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds great live, not so good on the album.","review":"I heard multiple live recordings and got very excited. Thought this might be the modern musical savoir that I was waiting for. She might still be, but not on this album. I believe lots of \\"production crap\\" would be the appropriate tag line for the way that her smart and refreshing sound has been slaughtered on this release. There is a bunch of smoke and mirrors that she doesn't need. I'm disapointed to say the least. The thought of hearing it live is still inticing. For me, at least, she sounds better alone at the piano. Anybody want to buy a Nellie McKay CD? I'm selling cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow this is bad","review":"I really want to like Nellie McKay. She's beautiful and has a nice voice, but I have listened to all three of her CDs and they all sound like the soundtrack to a musical that closed off-Broadway after about a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Get Away from me' --- and please do it quickly","review":"Having heard a few songs of hers on the radio and a review on NPR's \\"Fresh Air with Terry Gross\\" I thought I'd go ahead and spend the cash. I listened to both CDs a lot for about six weeks trying to figure out why I was having such a weird reaction to it..and I finally did.Miss McKay sure has a lot of talent as a musician and a singer but eventually it is her skills as a songwriter and lyricist she is simply annoying. Not brilliant, not insightful; just annoying and just too young to be as deeply world and male weary as she wants us to think she is. So that pose just comes across as just glib pretense . Occasionally funny but mostly just annoying right now it will be interesting to see what she is capable of in ten years. But for now, you can skip the act.(and no I don't particularly care care for Norah Jones as a songwriter either.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic and Could be even better!","review":"I was introduced to Nellie by deposed NPR host Bob Edwards. It is one of 3 cds I have purchased on the basis of his interviews. I liked her singing style and voice and playing style but was only slightly dissapointed by the production of the album. The in studio version of the NPR show was piano only and was fantabulous! The spinning and swirling tracks added didn't add anything to my listening pleasure and slightly decreased it. I have the cds but I still like to listen to the archive of the NPR version with Bob Edwards. Still better than most crapola out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"QUIRKY & FUN","review":"If you ever heard Dr Deminto's radio show? This is definately that style. She reminds us not to get so wrapped in life that we forget to live life! When you need a smile & don't take her songs seriously. YOU WILL ENJOY THESE CD'S!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclectic, witty, quirky","review":"Overall, this is a terrific CD. I'd describe it as quirky, albeit intelligent. Nelly has a wonderful band to back her up, and their style adds a nice elegance to her quirkiness.In \\"I Wanna Get Married\\", Nelly talks of her desire to \\"...pack little lunches\\" and \\"read Danielle Steele\\"...On \\"Respectable\\" I think it is, there's some flamenco-style guitar and castanets that pepper the song, and then at one point Nelly shouts out a \\"hi, hi, hi, ARRRRIBA!!\\", which of course comes off as rather silly. But again, it's very clever how she incorporates a Spanish flavor into a song with a somewhat serious message about the upper echelons of society.Then there are other songs that are just plain charming, and I guess Doris Day would be as good a comparison as any. It definitely harkens back to a time when life was simpler.If you like quirky and eclectic, chances are you'll like this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A breath of fresh air.","review":"Nellie is sharp, versatile and edgy. And her voice is crystal clear. Not lullaby music."},{"rating":"2","title":"My CAT died and I quickly poured myself some gin","review":"Just an example of the lyrics that nellie comes up with. Great songwriter! This cd is unique, fun, and catchy! I originally heard her on the late night show and I went out and bought the cd the next day. Great cd!! a must buy if you like unique lyrics and music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded my expectations...","review":"Nellie McKay's album is one of the most creative, lyrical and brilliant albums I've ever bought. Her songs highlight her musical genious. I just cannot believe that she is only 19 or 20 years old. I expected her to be much older because her songs reflect a mature spirit.I agree wholeheartedly with a previous reviewer who says that he quickly switches the CDs in order to get to the next song. Each song is enticing!I highly, highly, highly recommend this album.And for the reviewer who said that Nellie makes Hillary Duff look good, I'd wonder if that reviewer was Hillary Duff herself writing in. Duff is a lightweight compared to Nellie. There is NO comparison!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The zany variety is startling and charming.","review":"This is a young, multitalented artist's first CD and I am amazed that a 19-year old could do all that. Several of the songs are stuck in my head. The melodies are original and some are quite catchy.There are quite a number of these songs freely available via her Web site, recorded during nightclub performances in 2003. The CD demonstrates a considerable improvement in delivery, voice, and attention to rhythm. Other reviewers have preferred her solo nightclub performances but I like the more polished CD versions of her songs.If somebody once told Ms McKay \\"Write what you know,\\" then it's clear that she did just that: \\"just walkin' my dog,\\" \\"my cat died,\\" \\"David, can't you hear me?\\" \\"I apologize too much,\\" etc. The music is a real breath of fresh air. I wish her much success!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So much better live.","review":"I listened to some of her live tracks on her website, and I was struck by how spunky and cool she was. I ordered the CD. When I popped it into the player, it sounded like pop-y junk. The core song was there, but most of the songs became overproduced. The live versions are just her at the piano. It was simple and she got to play. In these tracks, they stick in a bunch of off sound effects. Too many \\"awes\\" and sound effects. I felt schizophrenic listening to it. There are a few songs that I did enjoy on the CD, but otherwise, I'd recommend waiting for the live CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe later...","review":"Well, we may have something here. Nellie Mckay's debut, is not exactly what you'd expect.While most of the songs are, well, more like jokes. But there are a few that show she does have some talent ( David, Change the World, Manhattan Avenue...) She can definitely play piano, and her voice is not bad. Her songwriting though extremely creative, is not quite a match. The songs, while funny, just aren't very... well, serious. I think if she would try to write a serious song, she would do very good. Look, you've got to be good if you can think of THOSE songs. ^_^"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little Different","review":"My friends told me about this CD and i bought it. Okay it was 'Cleaned' but at that moment i didn't realize what that ment. But after listening to it, i didn't care. Okay so theres a couple swear words..that dosent matter. I cant explain what kind of music she writes, but whatever it is i like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! It's only February, but this is ALBUM OF THE YEAR","review":"I am loving this CD. I read about her months ago in the New York Times and I bought it the second it came out. Imagine all the years we still have with her voice. I don't think any album this year will match this excellent disc. I have hope for music's future now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa Nellie!","review":"When I first started to listen to \\"Get Away From Me\\", it was like a joke, that I didnt get. Luckily I listened to the entire two discs, before i made a judgement. As it played on I \\"got it\\" more and more. It's like a black comedy. VERY creative, and I can honestly say I've never heard anything like it.There is such a range of music on this album. I prefer the more upbeat songs, the slower ones are a little too Norah Jones, though the lyrics are MUCH smarter. This is becoming a favorite the more I listen to it. Nellie McKay is a True talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's a nut--but a colorful, genuine nut","review":"Nellie McKay(the M.C .on the DVD pronounces it \\"Mc-eye\\")has an unplaceable accent, a faraway glint in her scheming eyes, and a tart sense of humor that catches you totally unawares. She's an honest-to-God original, and a breath of fresh air in these calculated-pop times. Her music careens between different inspirations, and she's juggles them all like a pro. My favorites are the whimsical \\"David\\", the plaintive \\"Really\\", the humorous/serious \\"I Wanna Get Married\\" and the comical \\"Clonie\\". \\"Married\\" really epitomizes McKay--sardonic, rueful, but wistful and longing. You can hear the yearning in her voice even as she spouts scattershot poetry. The DVD is a wonderful(but brief)concert in San Francisco, and her in-between patter is constantly surprising. You never know where she's gonna take you."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! How Knew?","review":"Nellie McKay is AMAZING!I have nothing but praises for her phrases.I heard her and immediately ordered her debut CD. I certainly have been amused. This girl is truly UNIQUE. (On 'David'... \\"Mr Bushie says- I'm your president-I have lots to say-hey hey hey- and click goes the remote-there you have my vote\\" so very clever!) This young singer is an able ENTERTAINER - she is not a one-trick pony - she does it all.

I bought this album based upon the reviews, and I don't think I have ever been more disappointed in a purchase. I was expecting an artist with an amazing talent. I was thinking a Norah Jones, or Sarah Brightman, or a female Harry Connick Jr. Nope .. so far completely the opposite direction. I kept skipping from one song to the next trying to find any semblance of decent music ... completely without luck.Why this album is so loved by some amazes me. Maybe I am missing something .. but if anyone wants to buy my CD for cheap let me know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I heard all the hype and raving reviews so I bought this CD.

Beats me as does the question why do so many people like this CD?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever but lets get serious...","review":"Now I know that Nellie McKay is a terribly clever young song writer, and her music and lyrics are very sophisticated for her age.

Nellie is very refreshing and I would refer her to anybody in a second. BUT!!! this lousy label she recorded this wonderful music on limits me from hearing her on all my listening devices. This is a locked (anti-theft) CD so I can't import to my iPod (thanks SO very much). It plays only on my main stereo equipment, not my Mac or car stereo. In other words, it's an event if I want to listen to her music. I can't casually listen to Nellie. I say, Nellie, Get Away From THEM! I'm glad you left that label! Good luck to you! I hope all recording artists wake up and free themselves from this horrible, limiting \\"locked\\" format! Nellie gets 5 stars. Recording label, a negative 100000000. By the way, just download this from the iTunes store."},{"rating":"1","title":"ORIGINAL, KIND OF...","review":"I bought this based on the hearing the song, Its A Pose. Not bad. The music is OK, just OK. It is, however a great effort for a nineteen year old musically. There is some stuff on here I liked, the work Song and Won't you Please B nice. I give her all the credit in the world for being out there, but by the second or third listen I was kind of bored. Her lyrics tend to show her age, not really new ideas politically, just sounds like she took some PETA, Greenpeace, NOW and DNC ramblings that were handed out in a pamphlet on a street corner and set it music. Or maybe had an 11th grade honors English Class' poetry squeezed into her muisical arrangement (see I wanna get married or change the world).

It is not that I don't enjoy her type of music, I love any type of music. However, every song she sings makes me feel like I'm spining out of control and will throw up. She is even worse in concert. I recently saw her live and lauged so hard as did the security guards and other members of the audience. The loudest applause of the night was when she left the stage.

This dust bag catches all the large planed shavings but small dust particles will still escape but isn't so hard to clean up.

Fortunately for our dogs there has been a quiet revolution in dog training to a less coercive method of training. For example, her method of teaching sit involves pulling up on the collar while pushing on the dog. In short physical discomfort is being created for a command that the dog does not even know. Her methods are based on negative reinforcement. The correct response will make the discomfort vanish. This type of training can be effective if you have the right dog for the stress it will produce and if you the handler have great timing and can always perfectly and rapidly make all pressure vanish when the performance is correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless approach for active defense reflex dogs","review":"When attempting to find solutions to training problems in a rough collie showing active defense reflex behavior problems (see William Campbell's 'Behavior Problems in Dogs') I read this book. The author fails to take into consideration the differences between active and passive defense reflex dogs. At the time, a number of dog trainers in our area were focused on this approach to training. In class, I was required to reposition my dog physically rather than using vocal cues to correct his behavior (the Bauman approach). This absolutely does NOT work with an active defense reflex dog! You can't imagine the problems this approach to training caused for my dog. I later found William Campbell's book, figured out a proper approach to training my dog, and consequently put a CD on him. The 'Bauman' trainers had told me I'd never succeed, but they lacked the insight into dog behavior to problem solve outside their 'box'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old-fashioned, correction-based methods.","review":"Bauman's book is very old-fashioned.

But there are SO many better, more positive, more reliable, and more fun (for you and the dog) ways of training now. I see no reason why anyone would stick with this stuff when there's a better way. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harsh methods and out-dated techniques","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. The author advocates the old fashioned training methods of correction for wrong behavior vs. the newer methods of positive reinforcement for correct behavior. She states that we should pinch our dogs lips and ears to teach them to retrieve. She believes spraying our dogs with a hose is a good way to teach them to drop on recall. She states that they \\"have been known to throw metal chairs\\" at big dogs to get them to come. But then reminds us to put a longline on them so they don't run away instead. Wouldn't you run away? She even devotes a chapter expaining why our dogs are stressed while learning. Of course any dog would be stressed by the training methods she advocates.

Well done, Dr. Edgar!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Much Needed Book That Falls Short","review":"I'm glad to see this book -- one of the few comprehensive histories of SC in decades. It is a clear, easy to read history. However, I was disappointed. Edgar is often too brief with his subject. One example is the Mill Villages. He mentions them, but fails to go into depth, especially in their changes with the decline of the textile industry. He does fairly well with the discussion of the growth of the Republican party, but makes no mention of the Governor's race in the 1970's in which Dorn lost to Edwards. Caused primarily because of the unconstitutional race of Charles \\"Pug\\" Ravenel, Dorn's loss to Edwards quickened the rise of the Republican party in SC. All in all an adequate book that will serve until something better is written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Race-o-mania","review":"While race is certainly an important topic, it should not become the popular be-all and end-all of a general history such as this one. I bought this book and began it with great anticipation, but soon found its author had on blinders. This is typical of a kind of fadism that comes from academics and academic presses. Let's relegate this volume itself to history---the history of a time when academics lost sight of all but academic careerism via the proper politically correct attitudes and postures. By the way, there are many typesetting errors and small errors of fact here and there. One wonders if the author is a journalist or a historian, when he gets on his political kicks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A View Of Walt Edgars' Book Without Rose-Coloured Glasses","review":"Much to the dismay of Ms. Hyre of Columbia, South Carolina (see 8 November, 1999) & her rather sappy review, I find serious flaws with Walt Edgar's diatribe of a book. First & foremost, it is truly not history when political views take precedent over actual history. It is quite evident that Dr. (sic) Edgar embraces some sort of perverted history that is directed towards agendas, more specifically towards political correctiveness & race-baiting. We certainly are regressing as a society when we take consideration of half-truths , which in turn cause people to point fingers at one another because of the colour of their skin. Is this what we really want?I pity the ignorance of any of my fellow South Carolinians who look at the cover of this book written by a Alabama native & consider buying this book & putting it on their bookshelf or coffee table is the \\"South Carolina\\" thing to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Rest of the Story?","review":"In 1948 South Carolina's most famous citizen of the modern era -- Strom Thurmond -- ran for President of the United States.

I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed.

As you progress, you can move onto more locations, and have more parties with more people and music, too! Another thing I love is that the passwords AREN'T random jumbled-up letters and numbers.

Your character is Hello Kitty and you are throwing a party at your house. You need to gather or make the things you will need including food, invitations, decorations, etc. There is a little reading involved as you have to communicate with other characters in the game. My daughter's one complaint is that when she wants to save the game, she is given a code that she either has to write down or remember for the next time she wants to play. If you forget the code, you need to start the game from the beginning. Overall....she loves this game :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lefthandedness and asymmetry","review":"The subtitle of this book is much more accurate than the title. It's not about left-handers so much as a quest into why lefthandedness (or handedness at all, for that matter) occurs. As such, it delves into asymmetries throughout nature, delving as far down as the nonconservation of parity in K-mesons, not to mention the \\"handedness\\" of amino acids. Only toward the end does it address more relevant issues like brain structure, coming up with some interesting information about differences among right-handers, hooked left-handers, and nonhooked left-handers (\\"hooked\\" referring to how the left-handers bend their hands to write).It's really just an okay book: some interesting information, not particularly well-written or well-organized."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"\\"Lefties\\" is one of those books that the bookstores place in racks near the checkout counter, hoping that you'll buy it as an afterthought. If you saw the cover, you might think that it was a humorous and lighthearted look at the phenomenon of left-handedness. However, the vast majority of this book is not even slightly amusing. Unfortunately, Jack Fincher isn't very good at explaining complicated concepts in layman's terms, and he doesn't really try to make \\"Lefties\\" very entertaining. The body of the book is dedicated to a scientific explanation of what causes some people to be left-handed, and it strays into such fields as particle physics, molecular biology, and neuroscience. I suppose that some people might like that sort of thing, but to me it was about as enjoyable as a high school chemistry textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"Numerous typos and absolutely redundant throughout the entire textbook.

I do have another Bulova that I like and others do as well.

Listening to it in the car on the way home from the record store I must say it changed my life and the perception of the type of band I wanted to play in. Chilton's guitar playing is amazing throughout this show and the band is just so tight.

If you've listened to #1 Record/Radio City over and over like me, and wondered why Big Star never got really popular, this record will answer your questions. The stripped down band (no Chris Bell and no overdubs) can't do justice to the songs. Plus, Alex Chilton's difficult personality had driven the original bass player out of the group just weeks before this recording, and it shows. The only worthwhile stuff is the solo acoustic numbers, which are great.

I initially didnt like it because like everyone else I was looking for a remake of the first CD but after a second listen I'm beginning to appreciate the CD and the musical talents of Sweetback. After listening again I got past the fact that this is not the original jazz/neo-soul of the first CD but good quality music none the less.After torturing my ears with the new wave of brittany spears/ 98 degrees sound of R&B; ie Chris Brown & Neo(sp) I decided to revisit my Cd collection and I gave this one another try. I'm glad I did!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"We waited 8 years for this???","review":"What happened to the unique edgy, soulful, trip-hop jazz sound of the first compilation. This CD does not even sound like the same bad. It's a watered down version of the most mediocre sounds you may hear as background music of a lounge. This CD will make a great cocktail coaster for my table while the first one will forever continue to be in heavy rotation on the stereo."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Amel, No Good","review":"I was highly anticipating Sweetback's 2nd offering, but after listening to it a few times unfortunately I must say that it was... boring. It seems that the artistry they showed on their 1st album is gone. I mean, take for example \\"Things You'll Never Know\\" which is just a laughably mediocre pop-rock tune for crying out loud. This is just unacceptable coming from Sweetback. I also really had high expectations for \\"Love Is the Word\\" since I read that it samples Isley Brothers' \\"Between the Sheets\\" and borrows the melody from Bobby Caldwell's \\"What You Won't Do for Love\\" (I was like, how could you possibly go wrong with that?) BUT, this was a huge disappointment since the song has this lame reggae feel when it would've been so much better with an r&b/soul arrangement.So if you're like me expecting another heavenly masterpiece like \\"You Will Rise\\" from their 1st album, forget it - you won't find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wait Wasn't Worth It.","review":"I waited all this time for Sweetback 2 and all I can say is that this CD really stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"8 Million Ways To Describe This Album...","review":"...but, why?

It was nothing like I had expected, nothing like its predecessor. A few years later and I'm in love. This album is all about experimentation, testing the boundaries of creativity and musicality. To expect Sweetback to reproduce the same sounds with just a slight variation with each album would be to stifle the very essence of artistry. So, listening to this album with a new perspective, a rediscovered love of creation, I am now able to say that Sweetback has created yet another gem for the true music lover's collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Sweetback","review":"Not as good as their first.

Sweetback will no longer be in my watch list anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"I, too, am surprised at the negative reviews","review":"I've also had my Cybersonic for 3 years. I've never had a single problem with it.After 3 years, the built-in rechargeable battery is starting to lose its life, and I'm not sure how to replace it. But, it can still run for 5-10 minutes on one charge, so it's probably got at least another year of life in it. It's lasted longer than my cordless phone battery, so who can complain?I've never had a problem with the brush heads. In fact, they last much longer than the literature indicated they would. Hint: put them in the dishwasher at least once a week to disinfect & prolong the life (top shelf). Maybe the reviewers below ordered generic replacements?For me, this has been a terrific investment.

Billed as a true story it isn't as the producer and writer later admitted. The costumes and props were semi-accurate. The horse furniture, weapons and personal equipment of the horse soldiers were right on with a couple of glaring exceptions. In 1935 enlisted men did not wear orniments on their campaign hats in the field and neither did officers. Those used in the film were grossly incorrect for any period.

This DVD had several new concepts that I plan to incorporate into my high school program and George Wares did such a great job explaining the why's behind his philosophy (why his team gets huge leads, why they slide head first and their drill progression to do so, why they bunt and run and the duties of both runner and hitter). Not only were there new concepts, but everything was covered in great depth - both technical and tatical aspects.

This book is a ... reference of Servlet and JSP snippets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very ligth book on Websphere...","review":"Do not buy this book if you are looking for in depth information on websphere and J2EE. The first 8 chapters are not related to websphere at all, html page, making a simple java app, simple debugging, a whole chapter on how to make an html link. If that was not all, chapter 12 is on Javascript. Chapter 13 is on simple java inheritance, if I buy a book like that I probably know about java/inheritance. Chapter 21 is on CVS and code versioning... In fact only 10 out of the 24 chapters are about Websphere and J2EE.

Silly me, I clicked before I read the reviews, thinking this book would be set in Venice. Not even close. This is tough stuff, at times well-written, but at other times, not well-written or edited. I seldom quit a read, but I'm done early on this one. This will teach me not just to read the reviews, but to take the time to digest a sample too. Not my taste, but if you're into tough, violent, depressing, hopeless post-World War II mysteries, you'll like it. To compare it to LeCarre is a stretch to me, but it's pre-Cold War, so perhaps it has historical value that eludes me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mystery, police procedural, a buddy book and a love story, all in one,","review":"Series off to a dramatic start.Inspector Emil Brod, new at his job, 22, is revealed to the reader and himself as a bulldog of a cop.He stumbles into or through obstacles, hardly knowing what the mystery is that he is solving.The author lays on atmosphere as thick as a mad painter squanders oils.The eastern European city, never named, is the strongest, most finely drawn, of the characters.A mystery, police procedural, a buddy book and a love story, all in one.Steinhauer's depressing and uplifting The Bridge of Sighs is one to remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice ideas","review":"about how to get your horse to actually *want* to do what you are asking of him. This book stresses humane, painless, fearless and fair interaction between horse and human. However, there are two things that bother me greatly about this book. First, the style of the writer makes this book more of an ego-trip than anything else (one can only say that many times someone is great and unbelievable). Second, as far as I know, the methods discussed in this book are largely from Monty Roberts, not from Richard Maxwell, and the latter seems to take all credit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Slice of A Cappella","review":"I love this CD.

Every piece in the set is very low quality, I would advise you to pick up a better set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Sound Quality, Questionable Track Choices!","review":"I guess I only have myself to blame for not doing enough research before getting this but the reason why I went for this and not the more popular remastered \\"Hits\\" is because I really wanted \\"Keep the Fire Burning\\" which for some reason is not there. I could live with the track selections that do leave out quite a lot of better tracks that are found on the \\"Hits\\" package but the poor sound quality is what really gets me. Definitely a misnomer as this is certainly not the best of REO either in track selections or in sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fits good, but holder sucks","review":"This Panavise bracket fits very good in my s2000.

However, even as someone who has completed an advanced degree, I found this book to be extremely difficult to follow. The topics covered are good; the photographs are well done. But the text itself is hard to understand. The logic of the author's argumentation is faulty in some places. Several diagrams left me clueless because there was not enough supporting documentation to interpret them. On the bright side, I did like his suggested portfolio assignments at the end of every chapter. If you can find a better book for your course, use it. Otherwise, this one will have to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second edition... very poor.","review":"Before I read a chapter I like to focus on key terms.

I respect Hunter as a writer, but no matter how much I listen to the CD, I still find it hard to listen to. Not being a great singer never bothered me, I've always been a fan of Dylan and Neil Young (not great singing voices never got in their way), but Hunter's voice has always grated on me.Oh well, some people get certain things, while others don't. I'm sure there are a lot of music I listen to that other people don't enjoy, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good selection of songs, over done performances","review":"I bought this CD on a whim because of the great song selection (Box of Rain, Brown Eyed Women, Jack Straw, etc.) and thought it would be good to hear them acoustically, but was sorely disapointed. Hunter's guitar playing isn't at all good, and his harp playing is worse. The singing is all over-done and over-emoted.

I didn't realize this is a book on short-row heels only! Since this style does not fit my or any other person's feet I knit for, and directions for this style can be found everywhere (books, internet) I sent this book back, being deeply disappointed. If it had some interesting patterns with photos I might have kept it, but just drawings put me off even more.

The sizing (and formula for sizing) in this book don't work for me at all. Every time I've tried to use Gibson-Roberts's formula, I've ended up with enormous socks that needed to be ripped out--one was sixteen inches in circumference. The directions for the short row technique themselves do work, but the pen and ink illustrations aren't very good. I'd recommend a more general knitting book with a chapter on socks, since the short row technique needs no more than a page or two to be explained."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Life Of Wings","review":"Garry McGee's Band On The Run: A History of Paul McCartney & Wings is a fine account of the 1970's musical output of a rock legend. McCartney's music with Wings is often overlooked and dismissed, but looking back, he crafted some of the most enduring pop songs of his career. Mr. McGee does a great job of chronicling the recording sessions that produced the music. If you a fan of Paul McCartney and Wings, then this book is worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potted history of Wings.","review":"This book really provides an overview of Wings' career. But it feels to me a little disjointed, like it is really just a lot of anecdotes and stories cobbled together from other sources, rather than a complete uniform work in it's own right. I also find some of the writing a little clumsy in it's phrasing and wording. That said it is an entertaining enough read for a night but I can't say that I learned anything new here.The album and singles sections in the back are good to have though. There are some photos of rare Wings material throughout the book which are interesting, but it would have been nice to have them printed in colur in a glossy photo section of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old School Snowboarding","review":"This video has some decent footage of old snowboarding circa 1994.

Freewriting if you will, to help get your imagination jump started.I, personally, find this very effective and fun. I have writen some really cute stuff using this, and some really bad stuff. And the joy of freewriting is that you don't have to stay on the same subject for the time you have set, you mind gets to wonder and your pen, or computer or typewriter, gets to follow it, and sometimes it is the pen, computer or typewritter that leads the way and your mind has to play cetch up.

Well, I have to lay most of the blame for this atrocity on the director and the script. The acting was incredibly awful, which I also blame on the director.

My list of bad attributes could go on forever so ill try to make it quick.The acting was laughably bad, not one person, attempting to portray a character, was close to being believable.Also... had the budget been any less for this terrible flick, it would have looked like it was filmed with a child's toy camera.Lastly, the plot was so confusing and choppy, it could'nt be salvaged by the best of Hollywood's directors. The first hour and 20 min into the film were intolerably boring and the last ten minutes were lacking any special effects. As Mary's ghost attacks 4 characters she is invisible to the human eye so there they are throwing themselves about ridiculously.I cant believe I watched this all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD a big disappointment...","review":"First of all, let me start by saying that I love this film. A true classic: very funny, great songs and wonderful characters. But the DVD looks terrible. Scratches, and even awkward skips in the transfer. Picture is often blurry and sound is muffled. I wish I could say that they had restored it, but it looks more like a bootleg transfer than a legitimate release. The old, out-of-print VHS version had a much better film transfer on it. At least that one didn't frame-skip in the middle of the dialogue like this DVD transfer does! Maybe someday this film will get the DVD treatment it so richly deserves.

I never saw \\"The Lemon Drop Kid\\" in its entirety before and considering how I sat through \\"Holiday\\" and others, this is one of the funner and funnier holiday films to come from the classic 1940s.

He did not expect to get a soft spot for the dolls nor that the $10,000 he owes would end up where it does!Co-stars Marilyn Maxwell as the love interest; in real life Hope did have an affair with her, per Wiki. Interesting. I love their chemistry as they sing \\"Silver Bells,\\" the first film to release this Christmas classic.Overall, fun if a bit dated film of gangsters, Christmas and some classy cars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your usual Christmas movie","review":"This Bob Hope comedy should be better known, if only because it is the original source for the song Silver Bells. But mainly it is a very funny movie if you want an alternative to the usual sentimental favorites. The great Bob Hope is a scam artist who organizes the small scale crooks to be street corner Santas. Not to be a spoiler, I will just say that there is a lot of cynicism (for example, Silver Bells here is a feel-good marketing song designed to get people to open their wallets to the crooked Santas) but also a fair amount of heart. All the acting is great and it is fun to see Fred from I Love Lucy as well as Auntie Em from Wizard of Oz in key roles. The little known Marilyn Maxwell is a charming and beautiful leading lady who can sing (yes, she is the one who does Silver Bells) and dance. My husband and I enjoyed it again this Christmas and our young son in law was laughing as much as we were."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas classic","review":"Funny film that often falls under the floorboards.

I'm a huge Bob Hope fan, but even my wife, who doesn't care for Hope's movies, watches this one. Must be the magical influence of Christmas.

I had read mixed reviews but took a chance on it and I'm glad I did. I wouldn't rate it as high as My Favorite Brunette or The Cat & the Canary, but it is entertaining throughout the film. There were a couple spots in which the writers had an opportunity to do some clever things with the plot, but instead seemed to go the simpler route. That's not always a bad thing, especially in a comedy. But in this case I feel like the overall plot was very good and they should have thought through some of the details a bit more, and they may have had a classic on their hands. Instead they have a \\"good\\" movie. As usual, Bob Hope's delivery and great timing carry the film, but there's plenty here to see by various cast members as all the actors do a fine job. It's cool to see William Frawley play a role other than his I Love Lucy role that he's so well known for."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's my favorite Christmas movie!","review":"I truly love this old classic Bob Hope movie.

For years we watched the VHS version. Then in early 2002, when I saw that it had been \\"digitally remastered\\" and issued on DVD, I ordered the DVD. It arrived in February 2002. Of course, we didn't watch it until the Christmas season returned this month. And we were shocked by how bad the disc looked. The image had a \\"washed out\\" look - - grey even. The sound was muddy, with pops and clicks and occasional lipsync problems. The tape looked much better and, indeed, since we gave away our copy of the tape, I have reordered it. Perhaps some day there will be a remastered version of this very funny film on DVD. Meanwhile, stay clear of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anything But Sour","review":"A WONDERFUL lost, (at least to me) Christmas movie that will now be firmly established on my list of must see Holiday films.I had not seen this film before and did not know it was a Christmas film (probably because of the title) but it is a warm and hilarious Bob Hope romp and a veritable who's who of great character actors including Lloyd Nolan, Fred Clark, Sid Melton, Jay C. Flippen, Jane Darwell (the Feed The Bird's Lady from Mary Poppins), Tor Johnson (the hulking giant from Plan 9 From Outer Space) and even dear old Fred Mertz or William Frawley who helps introduce the old holiday standard \\"Silver Bells\\". And that's just the tip of the iceberg!The writing is great. The direction top notch and the laughs just keep on coming. I suggest you put \\"The Lemon Drop Kid\\" right at the top of your holiday film list. And why wait until Christmas?

Oh and she happens to be the President's sister. (just when you thought the Kim Bauer type character was gone she comes back an rears her ugly head)!

Well, seeing how I am gonna buy the Season 6 box set anyways, and between the 'Premiere Set' and the coupon you break even, it's a pretty sweet deal!

It has some of the Philadelphia R&B of Young Americans in Sons of the Silent Age and the synth-pop of Low and Station to Station in V-2 Schneider and most of the second half. It also closes with a cool, pop song The Secret Life of Arabia. Overall, the best of the three by far. I can't give it a 5-star rating because that belongs on Ziggy Stardust or Hunky Dory. But this, along with Station to Station and The Man Who Sold The World, does deserve 4 and 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album","review":"Again, as Low was, half of \\"Heroes\\" is insrumental. But unfortunately, whereas the instrumentals on Low keep getting better and better on repeated listenings, those on \\"Heroes\\" lose their strenght very quickly. They're just not as layered and tend to become a bit boring over time. It's a shame 'cause the vocal tracks on \\"Heroes\\" are quite simply the best Bowie has ever recorded. A great deal of that is due to the guitar work of Robert Fripp; the man is absolutely amazing. I mean, even without him shredding his way through the songs, they would still be great, but he really takes things to another level.

The results of this collaboration were patchy but never less than interesting. 'Heroes' (the quotation marks are a deliberate irony) is a unique mix of fuzzy guitars, prototype electronics, murky vocals and delicate instrumentals. Highlights: the title track, one of the greatest love songs ever written; 'Joe the Lion'; 'Beauty and the Beast'. This ranks up with the Cure's 'Faith' as an album that transports you into a frame of mind that's oddly disquieting. Listen, and prepare to be... can't explain it, really.

Very few albums inspire me creatively the way this album does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kraftwerk echoes","review":"Working with the fabulous art-rocker, avant-garde musician Brian Eno (Roxy Music ex-keyboardist), Bowie gave birth to this terrific record. The opening song remains alive as a love hymn. It is said that the inspiration for the melancholic, electronic sounds of this album came from Bowie's observation of Turkish immigrants who lived in Berlin, their loneliness, and isolation feeling. This album's eventually became Joy Division's bible, and a guide for the forthcoming \\"cold wave\\". Touching, innovative, beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low, Part II","review":"Recorded the same year as the legendary 'Low,' 'Heroes' manages to rock harder than that album. And those \\"songs\\" are basically all top-notch, the best being the title track, \\"Sons Of the Silent Age\\", and \\"Beauty and the Beast.\\" Thankfully, these songs take up most of the album's length, because the instrumentals, except for \\"V-2 Schneider\\" (which actually does have vocals, but in a Kraftwerk kind of limited way), are way unengaging, if more experimental.

It's hard to get worked up about randomly assembled lyrics and bleak instrumentals, yet neither can you escape the visceral chill of Bowie's bleak Berlin soundscape. It's not all depressing though.

Jean Reno who I'm not familiar with and Juliette Binoche (she looks great without makeup), play travelers who meet at an airport when Binoche's character, Rose, somehow loses her cell phone in a toilet. Reno is Felix, a chef with his own frozen food company and a cell phone he's kind enought to let Rose continually borrow. Both their flights become delayed and what follows isn't surprising. They eventually spend enough time together that they develop a romantic relationship.What keeps this movie alive are Reno & Binoche, two professionals at their craft who kept this viewer involved every step of the way. I've read the mixed reviews from so called mainstream critics, and now that I've seen this funny, yes (I chuckled a lot), I can say those critics are wrong.

I expected a story of conflict, creative problem-solving, and triumph of the human spirit. [I feel that] What I read was about as exciting as reading the minutes of a smalltown civic club or the owner's manual for my VCR. [In my opinion] The characters were numerous and so poorly-developed that I confused them throughout the book.Almost as annoying [in my opinion] were several glaring errors that could have been easily checked. For example, the words to the \\"Irish Prayer\\" were incorrect. Another was one that a ninth-grade science student should know - the author incorrectly stated that the chemical number of an element is determined by the number of electrons (rather than the number of protons). It seems that either the author or his editor would have caught these.I never stop reading a book once I begin. Many times a book starts out slow, but \\"hooks\\" me after a few chapters.

The \\"book\\" ,if you can call it that,looks like it was slated to to be an addendum to a major volume, to be found at the end of the main body of work-really not worthy of being peddled as a history book.

He has very distinctive style in that he mainly stays in the bottom octave and half of the instrument rarely straying above middle C. That being said, he has always done a remarkable job at communicating inventive improvisations. Being a student of the trumpet/cornet I can appreciate the close-ups of Ruby's embochure, which is with a very light pressure.Howard Alden is a marvel. There is no need for a piano when he's in the group as he can solo and comp to himself. His effortless playing is amazing to watch.I was not familiar with bassist Frank Tate before, but I was very impressed with his strong melodic bass lines and improvs.As Shuma \\"Ralph\\" reviewed, there isn't much variety in tone colors with but 3 instruments, and his suggestion of listening in two sessions is a good idea, but if you listen closely to what's going on you will be rewarded."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"I'm glad to celebrate and enjoy Creation Records.

It is a nice, wholesome toy that she can play with, and I don't have to be concerned that it will be sending her the wrong message, or giving her a false sense of what beautiful and acceptable is.I'm hoping the dolls sell very well, and that there will be more accessories to come. The only drawback I have is the price. I think they are a little too expensive for what you are getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for kids, not collectors.","review":"I collect the Strawberry Shortcake dolls from the 80's. These dolls don't look a thing like the 80's version. They are dressed in more modern clothes, their faces are radically different and they have slightly different proportions. So if you're looking for a doll to bring back childhood memories this isn't it. However as a toy for kids rather than as a collector's item it would probably be a good toy. It still smells like strawberries and it has nice clothes and a few accessories. I loved playing with my original Strawberry Shortcake doll when I was a little girl so I would assume that young girls would enjoy the modern version. I have to admit that even though these new dolls are very different from the old ones I still bought two for my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves them!","review":"I missed out on the earlier version of SSC and her friends, but my younger sister loved them.

We just purchased Orange Blossom w/Marmalade and are waiting to receive 2 other dolls we ordered here. So far, our 5-year-old is doing something I did not expect - she is playing with the dolls. We have purchased other dolls hoping that she would react to them like she is with SSC and her friends. I think what appeals to her, is that the dolls look about her age and dress like her and her friends. She has a number of character toys, mostly from movies, which do not look like people. So, it is nice that she is relating to toys that don't have fur! We are looking forward to the videos and books. From the perspective of a mother of a young girl, SSC and her friends are wonderful toys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for avid collectors","review":"If you were a child of the 80's who played with the original Strawberry Shortcake, do not look to these new editions to inspire nostalgia! While cute, they do not resemble the lovable girl in the green and white tights. The new Strawberry is updated, wearing modern jeans, a striped t-shirt and her trademark pink hat. Needless to say, when I saw the new dolls at a local retailer, I was disappointed. If looking to recapture your childhood, best to skip these dolls and opt for other 80's nostalgic toys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strawberry Shortcake belongs in the 80's","review":"Had I written this review some 17yrs ago, I might have give it 5 stars across the board. Strawberry Shortcake was sweet, and adorable. However, I'm annoyed at the rebirth of all these toys that first came about in the 80's (ie: Carebears) These are not toys to be changed, updated & rereleased. The name \\"Strawberry Shortcake\\" holds a special place with many young adults, now we're faced with Strawberry Shortcake who were jeans & trendy clothes... the new Strawberry Shortcake is a shame. Nothing sets her apart from the rest of the dolls mass produced now in days. This doll could have easily been released with a different name, but then they wouldn't be able to cash in on all the young parents of todays times who \\"remember when\\". If you played with this doll growing up, please don't buy it for your child... let Strawberry Shortcake rest peacefully in the 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A highly recommended guide with useful advice","review":"John C.

The Director obviously feels that covering up the nudity with blue lighting, red lighting, smoke/fog, and deep shadows is artsy, but it diminisses the whole idea of NUDITY. The women are attractive, but do not know much about yoga or tai chi. The tai chi women have lots of tatoos (possibly fake, just for the video).

There are definitely better videos like one out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible - don't waste your $$$!!!!","review":"Even though I read the reviews that stated how poor this video is, I bought it anyway as a gift for my husband and me. I didn't think it could be nearly as awful as they said it was....but it was! The gorgeous bodies of the women didn't make up for the fact that there were NO exercise sequences to follow. We wanted to exercise along with the ladies, but there wasn't any way to do that. The ladies basically just pose and preen slowly while the camera pans up and down. There was a certain level of interest at first (their bodies are great to watch) but after a bit, we just laughed.

However, on the unintentional comedy scale ... it rates a 10! Picture it in your minds eye: buck naked blondes and brunettes with silicone inflated breasts, deadly serious, staring each other ... with swords. Could you script something more inane? I know that this was expecting too much, but I was hoping, from a guy's perspective, that this video would be a solid workout with a little pizzaz.

It is less than boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally USELESS yoga & tai chi","review":"If you were going to buy this DVD for the instructional value, buy something else. On the other hand, if you wanted it for the erotic value, once again buy something else. This DVD is a huge disappointment. An actual yoga instruction video (minus the clothing) would have been so much better. True, the women are flexible, but there is no instruction format and the boredom sets in quickly. It could be titled nudity with no sex and no point. The tai chi portion is so bad is doesn't deserve to be rated at all. It consists of a group of nude women who may have watched tai chi at a park once. Save your money for a real yoga instruction video, or real porn, because this falls in neither category. Don't they watch this stuff before they try to sell it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad on every level","review":"I have two motivations for picking this up. The first was to see athletic women working out in the nude. The second was to maybe be able to get my wife to use it. I'm not a hairy armpit on women sort of guy. I want to see women who are more than attractive. But these women, they aren't attractive women, they are homely women who have no flesh on their body except for the really bad ball shaped fake breasts in front. If you don't mind bad fake breasts on anorexic women my guess is you still won't be satisfied with these videos because they don't give a real payoff. It's not pornograpy, it's not art, it's not a sensual erotic tasteful workout.

I've been disappointed in other guide books that omit older planes. In my area, older planes and even biplanes are the most interesting things flying out of the small fields. It's also helpful that it doesn't try to cover the European types we just don't see here. The organizational scheme is also good.

After about an hour of drilling time (not, of course, non-stop drilling), the trigger developed a dead spot wherein when I squeezed with gradually increasing pressure (so as to gradually increase drill speed), a few seconds into the ramp-up it quit -- just stopped cold. When that happened the first time, it just would not run again. The next day I tried it again, but except for one burst of full-speed running, it would not come on.

I have a DeWalt drill with a keyless chuck and it stays tight in the same circumstances.For some reason DeWalt includes a cheap plastic storage case with some drills but not with others. The cases are made of very flimsy material with crude fasteners. Buying one for a drill that comes only with its cardboard box involves spending nearly $40.

The first time I used the drill I squeezed the trigger slowly, but it seemed to jump from no power to almost full power. I used the side handle and two hands as recommended, but the drill spun uncontrollably and caused a large bruise on my right hand and a bruised finger on the other hand. Fortunately I didn't suffer any permanent injury. The manual warns, \\"Always expect a stall. Grip the drill firmly with both hands to control twisting action and avoid injury.\\" But even with both hands I was not able to control it.

I even tried it a few times, just to see if he would get used to it, but no luck. I might have kept the product until he was older to see if he liked it then, but whenever I turned it on, the balls kept popping out and it was very annoying.

It's a good idea but there were several things that I didn't like about it. First, it's a very noisy toy. It has a blower on it (to blow the toys in the air) along with the very loud music. Between both, it's like having a blow dryer on. Also, it's very heavy. Much to heavy for a just walking toddler. My daughter was a little older and would try to pick it up and a couple of times dropped it on her toe...tears!! Furthermore, it really blows the balls around so of course you are fetching the balls from under the sofa or chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"The balls don't pop","review":"Bought this for my 1-year old's birthday. I seem to have a different problem than other reviewers. The balls don't pop out the top of mine. Either the fan is misdirected or not strong enough. Sometimes the balls come out the other end (at the bottom of the ramp) and you can't push them in because of the fan pushing them out. It almost works in reverse.I've emailed Playskool directly about the problem as I have already discarded the box & receipt. Not sure I really want a replacement because although it looks fun, the music is LOUD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very educational or interactive","review":"Got this toy as a gift -- I put it together, and it was LOUD like many people have mentioned. I didn't see the point of the toy actually because it didn't seem to be set up to engage a baby except to have a baby try to grab the balls when it's being shot up the tube.

She is so used to playing with wooden toys that she just started at this toy because of the high level of noise it makes. There is a motor on it that is so LOUD.

She plays with it at least once a day. Although it might seem too young for her I've heard that even four-year-olds still have fun with this toy.It takes a little putting together, but once assembled is low maintenance. My only complaint is that the balls tend to fly out of the contraption and get lost behind the couch, etc. They are very light and roll all over the place, easily getting lost.It is definitely not her most educational toy, but good for some silly fun (and a break for her parents!).

When I purchased this, I thought the balls were a little more controlled, maybe just popped up in the air a little and back down into the funnel thing, but NO! They go EVERYWHERE! All over the room!

The 4 yr old has autism and he loves to put keep the balls popping. The music it plays is nice to listen too and not real annoying. I must admit I like playing with the ball popper too.

The popper is great for hand eye coordination if you are looking for educational or motor skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to expectations","review":"While this toy looks fun and entertaining, it failed to live up to our expectations. The balls fly off the track ALL the time. My kids enjoy putting other small toys down the track more than they enjoy watching the balls.

My son is now 2.5 and I can't think of anything else that has occupied his time the way this toy has. He still loves it although we are down to about 2 balls. I just checked out HASBRO's site & YES PEOPLE THEY SELL REPLACEMENT BALLS!!! I was thinking about buying a new one and my husband sugfg we try ping pongs (oh - we have an 11 month old now as well and want to introduce him to this wonderful toy). I decided to try their site and low and behold you can get replacement balls.Of course this toy makes loud music - that is part of the fun! Oh and the balls going everywhere - what great exercise for those little legs chasing after them. The squeals of laughter are the best when your child plays with this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This toy is dangerous!","review":"I bought this toy for my son for Christmas. He is 17 months old. I rotate his toys so he doesn't get bored, and I pulled it out today for the first time in a month. He was so enthralled with chasing the balls that he somehow stuck his arm into the tube and got it stuck completely up to his shoulder. I had to dump a bottle of oil down his arm to remove it. Fortunately I was right there as it happened, because he tried to lift his arm with this large toy attached and it could have really injured his arm or shoulder. Beware of the risks associated with this toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has its moments...","review":"The concept behind this toy is great, but the engineering/design is not. Looking at the picture here, I believe they may have redesigned since we got our son one 6 months ago as the chute attaches differently as pictured. Perhaps this works better because the chute is constantly coming apart on ours. We've also had the problem of the balls getting stuck or just kind of swaying back and forth. The music is HORRIBLY loud. We have to turn it off if we're trying to watch TV and son is playing in the room. Many musical toys have at least a low and high volume switch. This one desperately needs one!!On the positive, our son does love to watch the balls and grab at them as they pop out or go down the chute. He will chase the balls when they go flying. He's not quite old enough to know how to put them back in the toy once they are out, but he'll get there. He'd probably play with it a lot more had I more tolerance for the music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this toy!","review":"This toy is something that we bought after my children (who were 4, 2, and under 1 at the time) played with it at a friends house. At first, it was tons of fun to watch them chasing around the balls. It became a nightmare when my children began to stick other toys down into it. Then my middle daughter actually got her arm stuck in the opening. I had to take the entire thing apart to get her arm unstuck. I also had to take it apart everytime another toy found its home in the toy. (No, holding it upside down and banging did not work - these toys were stuck). I will never again have this toy in my home and if it is somewhere that we visit my children are not allowed to play with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS TOY! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!","review":"This toy is extremely dangerous. My 5 year old was playing with her little brother who got this toy for christmas.

READ ALL OF THE OTHER REVIEWS WHO HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AS WE DID. For safety's sake-don't buy it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lot of work for parents","review":"This product is a lot of work for parents. The top part, where the balls pop out, is not large enough. The balls pop out, hit the side and go rolling over the floor. Within a couple of second, all of the balls are spread over the floor and waiting for the parent to collect them. Also, no matter how many times I try to adjust it, the balls get stuck in the track and need helped along. On the other hand, the music and noise definitely keep my daughter interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun, hard to keep track of the balls","review":"My daughter received this toy as a Christmas gift at 9 months old. She loves it. She wasn't crawling yet, so yes, we do have to retrieve the balls over and over again. She does get almost too excited, but she is not scared. Her favorite thing to do is tip it over toward herself and then the air blows in her face and any balls left smack her also. She is pretty tough and thinks that is hillarious. It is not too hard to hurt her.I have two complaints: the balls are very easily lost. I don't mind retrieving them, but we can't find two of the five and are waiting for the replacements from Hasbro. They are cheap (5 for $4, including shipping). The other complaint is that the dog loves to steal the balls but that is a problem with our dog, not so much the toy.Overall, an super-fun toy that would get 5 stars if I didn't have to order replacement balls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ball poppin' blast","review":"I was skeptical when my 10 month old received this at Xmas.

It was fun and kept her attention for 15 minutes or so (at a young age, that is quite a feat!)The bad:--the balls really pop out of this thing and if have hard floors, they will go bouncing and rolling around. Plan on spending a lot of time chasing after them if you child can't/won't get them herself.--there is no good way to dislodge things that get stuck in this toy. Like most kids, my daughter thought it would be *super* to see what else would fit down the hole and I spend a good amount of time trying to dislodge a cotton ball from the inner workings.--this is not the quietest toy in the world. While the toy isn't designed to make \\"fun\\" noises, the fan motor is fairly loud.--the fan motor gave out after a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"We purchased this for our son just before he turned a year old. Initially we thought it would be a great toy for him to practice eye-hand coordination and to learn colors, etc. However, we were so disappointed when we started to play with this toy. The balls do move through the tube as designed and the music is festive, but once the balls pop out of the top they go flying all over the place. I spent more time chasing after the balls than my son did actually being able to enjoy the toy. In my opinion, I found having to chase after the balls each time a bit annoying. This is not a well designed toy and I would not have purchased it if I had known what a problem it was going to be. Overall it is not such a terrible toy, but there are others out there that require less work and provide more stimulation for young children than this one does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best 1st Birthday Present!","review":"My Daughter got this ball popper for her 1st birthday this weekend.

Then when we moved a few months later, I was packing it up and turned it on, the motor went out, less than a year after getting it, and that was without it being played with.

Since he started walking, this is the first toy he alwasy runs to. He's happy to chase the balls all over the house and watch them pop up all over the place. When it came time for a gift for my great-nephew's first birthday, there was no question as to what I would get. It may not be terribly educational but it sure is fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good toy","review":"It is loud, but so are a lot of toys. Our son likes to play with it (he is a little over a year old) but he doesn't usually play with it for very long, and he doesn't play with it very often. It spends a lot of time on the shelf.The version we have is made up of a base, the long slide, and the thing on top. If he tries to pick it up, it comes apart. It snaps back together pretty easily. Since you are looking at in online I thought I'd add that in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the age recommended","review":"This is a fun toy, because the kids get to chase balls all over the house. It was a good buy, except that the manufacturer recommended age starts at 9 months, and kids are too young for it at that point. Of course all kids are different, but it's more appropriate for kids starting at about 18 months. I've noticed that kids at my house are nervous about the loud fan until about 1 year."},{"rating":"1","title":"should be recalled or have better warnings","review":"while i have to admit my triplets like this toy it is dangerous. you must watch your kids while they play with this toy and it should not be left for them to play with at will. my 10 month old got her foot stuck in the tube and my 6 year old neice got her hand stuck while trying to remove a toy that got placed in the tube. the babies love it but i know now not to let them play with it unless I am sitting there with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"there is no interaction and the balls pop out everywhere. my son was bored with it in 5 minutes. i couldn't even sell the thing at a garage sale!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea - bad design","review":"This toy can be lots of fun, but I would not buy this particular one again. The music is really loud and obnoxious. There is no way to turn the volume down or off. While this is annoying, my biggest complaint is that the design is top heavy. If a child tries to lean or crawl up this popper, as most will, it will fall over, along with the child. I keep this toy out of reach of my 10 month old and only bring it out when I can play with it with him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but Dangerous!","review":"Adorable toy that provides many hours of entertainment. However, if your child is curious as mine is, he or she may put her arm down the hole to see where the balls come out of. At which point, if there is the tiniest bit of \\"chub\\" on your child's arm, it is likely to get stuck in the hole causing a lot of pain and bruising. This has happened to not only my 15 month old, who is thin, but also my friend's 18 month old who is chubbier. Great toy idea, but needs some work and serious supervision to use. It will only take a fraction of a second for your child to become stuck in the hole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this if you have a dog...","review":"I just bought this toy for my 11 month old and it's going back. The first thing that happened when we turned it on is that she got scared - the balls popped out and across the room, and my child is not scared of anything so I was shocked that it scared her. Then, my labrador retriever started going after the balls because they shoot so high and away from the toy. He got so excited we had to move him into another room. Too much trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite at home and on the road!","review":"We got this when my son was about 8 months old and now at almost 14 months old it's still a big hit!! We always try to bring a familiar toy whenever we're going on vacation either in a hotel or at a relative's house and this seems to make him feel right at home!I just wish the balls could be bought separately in the store (our pets are always running off with them) instead of having to FAX the order in and wait 4-6 weeks. We've tried other plastic similarly sized balls and they don't work.It's a GREAT first birthday gift too!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun fun fun","review":"My baby loves this toy because of the music and because she can see the effects of her trying to stop the balls in various areas.

It did not take long for her to figure out just how to press the plunger to begin the fun. She is 2 1/2 now and it is still one of her favorite toys. Some have complained that the balls fly all over the place. For my daughter, this only added to the fun. She loves chasing them and running back to put them back in and start all over again.

It happened to my 3 year old niece, but we easily got it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must for 9 months and up.","review":"My daughter got the ball popper for her first birthday and loved it. I do agree that the balls go all over the place, but I saw a newer version in Baby Talk magazine and it has a cover for the in \\"tunnel\\" that may help with this problem.Also my daughter liked to stuff other things in the holes, like a play baby bottle and I had to disassemble and take it out.It does teach early math skills because she learned that when there were only 4 balls left that she had to find the last one. It is cute and she still plays with it at 17 mos."},{"rating":"2","title":"This really kept my nephew laughing","review":"This is one of the best toys I have bought my nephew who is thirteen months old. It only took a couple of times watching his Grandpa push the red lever before he knew exactly what to do to get the balls popping up in the air. He had so much fun laughing and giggling and running after the balls and putting them back in the top. The bright colors of the balls as well as the toy itself is beginning to help him associate the names of the color with the color itself. It had also helped to increase his hand eye coordination. I would not recommend this to a child under one year."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!","review":"My 19 month old daughter still loves this toy!

It can entertain them like no other toy can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Hit","review":"Got this toy for our granddaughter, who's a little over a year old. Not only did the music startle her, there's not much interactivity involved (aside from chasing the balls as they roll all over the place). From an adult point of view, the Popper is well made, but the music is really loud & annoying. I gave this one away and got her a Super Spiral Tower, which is kid- rather than battery-powered and which allows her to access the balls, etc., and drop them down the chute herself rather than just watching them move inside the Popper's clear plastic tube."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ball Poppin' and Chasin' Fun","review":"Bought this for our 1-year old. He was initially scared of it due to the noise, but that quickly changed as he now really enjoys playing with the Busy Ball Popper. He quickly learned to start the toy using the big red button and likes to intercept the balls as they come out of the top of the popper. As others have noted, you do spend some time chasing after the balls to put them back in the toy, but that only adds to the fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud and somewhat annoying","review":"We got this as a gift for our 20-month old, and I had wanted it for a while. Had I known how loud it was, I would have never asked for it - it sounds like there is a hairdryer in it. The music is really annoying and there is no option to turn off the music and still play with it (bad design IMHO).My toddler also would stick other toys in the there, expecting they would come out. Many hours were spent consoling our child as to why it would not work, and then hours trying to get items out of the curvy tube (skewers, hangers, you name it to push them out). We finally put the toy away and hid it. We couldn't take it anymore.If it had a straighter chute, and was quieter, and had the option to turn off the music, it would be fine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"should be recalled and relabled for a different age group","review":"My 23 month old daughter got her arm jammed in the tube and it took 10 minutes to get it out. (While of course she is screaming and crying.) If the yellow gaurd on the top actually stayed on she would never have been able to get her arm in there. But of course it isn't very child friendly when they can pull the whole toy apart. Thanks Hasbro for the very unsafe toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"This is the worst baby toy my daughter has. To start with, the fan used to blow the balls up the tube is extremely noisy - it scared my daughter, who was under 1 at the time and is still afraid of the noise at 2. Secondly, it blows the balls up and out of the toy, shooting them all over the floor. The music it plays is also way too loud and there's not way to adjust. Sometimes the balls get stuck, and its very difficult to disassemble the casing to remove a stuck ball. Simply awful invention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"My daughter LOVES this toy!

She looked at it for about 10 seconds, then got bored and walked away. There is nothing for the child to do but look, no interaction. On top of that the balls fly out constantly. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"This is one of the stupidest toys we've ever had (it was a gift).

He seems to be scared of the balls flying out, not the noise. We were surprised by his reaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hit with baby","review":"I have to agree with the others that wrote they were pleasantly surprised with how much their child enjoyed this toy. My little boy loves pressing buttons, and this toy provides the ultimate cause and effect entertainment from pushing its plunger esk button. My baby is entertained by this toy for long periods of time. The music the toy plays is also a bonus, he loves to sway and rock to the catchy tunes that the toy plays. I also bought this toy for my nanny's grandson and it was a total hit with him too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with this toy","review":"As you can see from the other parents reviews, the toy has some issues. I have an 18 month old who loves the toy itself. However, when the balls shoot up the top, they go absolutely everywhere. I have to keep catching them because they literally go everywhere. Now all five balls are all over the house and we can't find them. The machine is very loud, a loud vacuum sound, so it took her about 3 weeks to get used to it after clinging on to me every time we turned it on. This isn't one of the better ones but it also is not that expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter shrieks with joy everytime she plays with this!","review":"Oh, WOW! I was actually browsing for some other toys and came across this one, which I bought from a yard sale for $1!! I guess it was an awesome deal! Anyways, my now 15-month old daughter absolutely shrieks with joy every time she plays with this toy - as soon as the music starts she goes crazy! Even my 4 year old loves it and when some of her friends came over they found it fun, too! The only problem is not loosing the balls in odd places of the room, but otherwise is great. One other thing my daughter loves to do is put her face above the tube where the balls jump up from and feel her air pressure blow in her face and hair. This is definitely her favorite toy so far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even I enjoy this one","review":"My 14 month old daughter loves this toy. She likes chasing after the balls when they pop out and likes putting them back in. When she learned how to push the button to make it work, that was it, she did it over and over. So, the D batteries did not last long at all. That is my only real problem with this toy, the expensive batteries do not last long with it. Would recommend, keeps her busy for a long time. so stock up on batteries and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but other toys and balls can get stuck","review":"My 11 month old daughter received this as a Christmas gift and loves it. The biggest negative is that balls of a similar size but tad bigger from older Fisher Price toys fit in the ball popper, but once in can not get out without taking the toy apart. So be careful of what the kids put in the toy. Also the balls do fly everywhere, but that is where an older sibling comes in handy. My five year old tracks down all the balls for his sister and helps her with the start button. It is a toy that can occupy both children simultaneously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scared Silly","review":"I bought this toy for my one-year-old son.

While I was not thrilled to have yet another noisy piece of plastic in the house, she LOVED it. Loved it. After I had packed away almost all of her \\"baby\\" toys, this one managed to keep its place in her bedroom. We recently took it out again for our second child - a 10-month old boy. He too is in love with this toy. And the best part is that this is a toy that despite their 4-year age difference, they actually enjoy playing together. The balls tend to fly out of the top somewhat haphazardly (not sure if this is by design or flaw?), but when they do, our 4-year old is very happy to chase them down for the baby and put them back inside. The baby loves to grab the balls, dance to the music, and crawl around the kitchen after the balls. So while this toy may not be the coolest looking, it sure is a lot of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good workout for mom as I go chasing balls around the house","review":"This is a cute toy and when the balls pop up and actually land back in the yellow dish, it's a lot of fun. My 9 month old giggles at it, even though he doesn't get what to do with it really.My big beef with it is that the balls rarely go back in the toy, they usually pop up and fly across the room. I spent the good part of the first hour with this toy just chasing balls down in the hardest to reach parts of my house (the balls must have some sort of sensor that attracts them to the furthest corner under the couch).Since the balls are never near the toy, the kid doesn't get to play with them much. It's a good work out for me though.It's also really annoyingly loud and obnoxious in the sound effects department."},{"rating":"1","title":"A royal pain in the butt","review":"My nearly 2 year old twins love this toy but I hate it. The balls end up everywhere and they try to shove all of their small toys and their arms (up to their shoulders) down the chute. We have had numerous toys stuck in the popper and they are practically impossible to get out. The balls fly everywhere and the popper doesn't work as well unless all of the balls are in it. On the plus side, this toy plays fun songs and seems to be durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite - when it works","review":"This has, to my suprise, become one of my son's most prized toys. It never ceases to amaze me the random things that will hold a child's attention, but the prospect of placing balls in an opening and watching them roll from one end to another seems to be something that mesmerizes mine. It is truly a thing to behold to watch his enjoyment of this simple toy.Now, here's the problem. As others have mentioned the ball sometimes get stuck and you're forced to clear it out before allowing your child to return to their blissful self-contained fun. Unfortuntely, this undermines one of the great benefits of this toy: that you can just leave your child with it for 20-30 minutes and take care of other things. Instead, you're constantly having to dislodge a ball so that they can continue their playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE OF THIS TOY!","review":"My little man received this gift on his first birthday. It looked like a whole lot of fun! We took it out and it was not more than 5 minutes of playtime before his little arm was stuck down inside the toy! He saw where we put the ball in...he could see the ball down the hole, and he reached for it! He was screaming...as my husband gently tried to remove the ball popper, which was suctioned on to his arm at that point. Such a sad little face on the birthday boy! I contacted the company...and they replaced the toy free of charge...we decided on the pinball table, and he loves it! I just can't understand why they would make the hole the size of a babies arm??? Duh! Can't be smaller...choking hazard...why not bigger...or the chute not so long...I don't know. Hope this helps discourage everyone from buying it, I would hate to see this happen to another little one."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! What a GREAT toy!","review":"I first encountered this toy in a doctor's office and was amazed by its popularity. My 18 month-old son loved it as did ALL of the other kids in the office -- from about 9 mos to 5 years. The kids could not get enough of this toy. I got it for our own home, and its popularity remains high. I have given it as a birthday gift, and it has been a winner in those homes as well. The kids really do play with it endlessly. On that note, though, please know that this toy makes some NOISE, so if you are a person who can't stand noisy toys, this is NOT the toy for your house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun","review":"My 1 year old boy girl twins love this toy, from the crazy balls to the music to the air that blows to move the balls around. The toy has been dropped and climbed on and has held together, but the air flow is now inconsistent. That said, it's a favorite and I would even give as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent fun for 22 month old","review":"My 22 month old Daughter received this for Christmas. I was concerned that it would be too young for her, but she was definitely very taken with it. The music is fairly charming in small doses, and my daughter enjoys naming the colors of all the balls as they pop up.My low rating comes from the fact that the balls are very inconsistent. sometimes they stick in the channel part, so they just sit there and don't get blown up, other times they blow so hard they fly all over the room. Overall I'm just not very impressed with the playability of this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh.. not very safe !","review":"My 13 month old son received the busy ball popper for a b-day gift. We put it together easily and began to play and soon learned this toy is more trouble that its worth. My son has managed to get his arm stuck up to his elbow inside the machine, twice. He was stuck so well I nearly panicked thinking I couldn't remove his arm. He also managed to get another toy lodged in the chute so when I was unjamming it, it and a ball launched quickly directly into my face. I cannot leave my child unattended with this toy now since I worry he will get his arm stuck again or some other toy will get inside it and launch into his face. NOT SAFE! If I allow him to play with it I must be at his side the entire time to ensure his safety. I have since taken it away from him and it's put away. My son is 13 mths old yet this toy ia rated for 9 mths old? There are also no warnings about requiring supervision, arms or hands getting stuck or items including balls being propelled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute idea, but not very safe for 'explorers'","review":"I had read great reviews about this product other places but none of them had the problem I did I guess. My children 1 and 2 1/2 love this toy but they try to get the balls out of the chute when the toy stops. This makes them get their arm stuck in the chute. I was not concerned about the balls popping out because that is what the toy is for 'ball popper' but they come out pretty high and then you have to chase them all over the room. It is a fun toy though if you get past those two things. I do like that the toy does not stay on all the time it runs for about 30 seconds and then shuts off. I would not discourage anyone from getting it, I just wanted people to be aware of the issues I had. I am returning it though."},{"rating":"2","title":"After 4 years, it's still one of the best toys!!!","review":"I bought this toy in 2004 (is a little different than the newest model) for my baby and she LOVED it! We kept it and now it's as much of a hit with her little sister. Yes, the yellow piece can sometimes detach if it's intentionally pulled-off, but it's easily fixed and hasn't been an issue. I can honestly say that this toy has been the most played-with item in our household with both of our children. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but watch out for battery use!","review":"This toy is great fun for my 11-month-old. He was a little frightened of the balls popping out at first, but now loves to gather up the balls that scatter everywhere and put them in the funnel. My only complaint is that it uses up the batteries quickly. It will still run on weakened batteries, but doesn't have enough \\"oomph\\" to push the balls through the system, so the parent ends up forcing them through. But when functioning at full power, my son LOVES this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"Gave this to our grand-daughter for her first birthday and she loves it. Has no trouble pushing the plunger to start it. She sometimes chases the balls, or will sit and watch the movement or will put the balls back in. She seems to enjoy the music. I have to admit, I find it really fun, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems to have a design flaw","review":"I thought this looked like so much fun, but I'm really disappointed. When the balls pop out they either come back down on the edge of where they came out and fly across the room or, as they come down, another ball is coming out and they hit each other and both fly across the room. Within five seconds, every ball is out of the ball popper and the baby is left there waiting for something to happen. When he realized the show is over, he crawls off unamused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scares our little one to tears","review":"I see alot of good reviews for this toy, but that just hasn't been the experience for us. Our daughter has always been a bit sensitive to noises. She's terrified of the vacuum, electric hand driers, and this toy makes a very similar noise. She was frightened of it at 12 months, and at 22 months nothing's changed... in fact just the sight of the toy sends her running to the other side of the room. Otherwise it looks like a fun toy, it's just maybe not for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"balls don't pop out","review":"We can't get the balls to pop out!!!

We have owned this toy for over 5 years and given it as gifts to loads of kids. Of all the toys my kids have ever had I think this is their favorite. Both kids still happily will play with it although we do put it away now for a while and then bring it out again. If you have a younger child 6 months and up this is a great toy for older siblings to join in and play with. That we still have it around attests not only to its resilience and durability but also to its simple appeal and how much fun children have with it.

The airflow on this toy is vital to it's ability to pop balls up and then back down into the tubing. Sometimes they pop up and back the way they are supposed to, but most of the time one ball goes flying. After that the airflow is too strong and balls go everywhere. I hid this toy in my basement. It's more annoying than reading the same book 10 times in a row."},{"rating":"2","title":"we love it!","review":"My son got this for a gift last Christmas when he was only 5 months old. He enjoyed sitting up and watching and trying to catch the balls even then. It wasn't long before he learned to push the plunger to activate it, or at least try, himself. He still enjoys it at 16 months although he thoroughly loves putting things besides the toy's balls into the holes, we've been able to retrieve these items easily. My two other boys also enjoy the toy and they're 7 and 4!! I'm not one who's terribly bothered by the noise of toys, however I wish this one had an option for the softer/louder. And my one true gripe with it is that the yellow funnel piece does constantly fall off. It's a point where you naturally want to pick the toy up and it very easily becomes separated from the rest of the toy which is discouraging to me and the children. But overall, this has definitely been one of our most favorite toys! I DO recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you want to chase balls everywhere?","review":"The balls pop out all over the living room when my daughter plays with this toy.

My son started playing with it at around 5 months, just trying to figure out where the balls (and the wind) were coming from. At first he would try to stop the balls from rolling or popping up, but at 7 months he is figuring out how to get them back in so they will pop out the top again. Our friends bring their children over, and even at age three and four they play with it...and at age 27, so do I!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"This toy's music is a lot of fun. The balls are fun to chase around if your child likes to chase things. You will be in for much exercise after you buy this because the balls more than \\"occasionally\\" pop out of the funnel. It gets kind of annoying. The product is worth buying though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous toy!","review":"I bought this for my one year old son and not only does he LOVE it, but so does my 2 year old daughter! Great toy, only downside is chasing the balls, but once your kids are old enough to chase them themselves, they do all the work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Toy But Blower is Too Powerful","review":"This is the greatest toy. I got it for my son when he was about 9 months and he still plays with it now that he is 18 months. The only thing is that the blower is so powerful that the balls fly completely out of the toy (and onto the floor) and not into the tray to be \\"recycled\\" back into the chute. I was able to fix this by putting a piece of masking tape over 1/3 of the blower (limiting the air intake). Now it works like a charm. Also, I have seen some people (like my son's daycare) use the popper for other items than just balls. Dropping cotton balls and watching them fly out seems to be popular. This toy is definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe","review":"While the toy was turned off, my son stuck his hand in opening to just past his wrist and got his hand stuck. This was horrible. I thought we were going to have to break his hand to get it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Worthless","review":"I received the Hasbro Playskool Busy Ball Popper two days ago and was very excited about my son playing with it. Unfortunately the toy is completely unusable. First, there is very little interaction; second, the balls pop all over the place and the adult has to go and chase them all over the place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but a big hasel","review":"I received this as a gift for my 12 month old and my first impresion was that it was just too loud. She liked the balls in at first but after losing them and having to check every where for them I prefer to keep this toy out of site. Now at 18 moths she likes to experiment with different blocks and toys that are the right size to see if they fly out too. It seems like way too much work for both parent and child. I wouldn't have bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS TOY FOR CURIOUS KIDS","review":"This toy is appropriate for 9 months and up said the Playskool makers. My daughter(currently 18 mths old)and I both liked it until tonight. She was retrieving the balls herself from the tube and got her arm stuck in it all the way up to almost her shoulder. My husband had to quickly retrieve a screwdriver to loosen it while she was screaming in pain and panic. This toy needs to be recalled in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"TARGET IS UNRELIABLE","review":"TARGET IS UNRELIABLE, July 26, 2009By Y. Lin \\"Nikos\\" (DC) - See all my reviewsDurability: Fun: Educational:I ordered this item over 14 days ago for a birthday boy whose birthday is this coming Saturday. I despise leaving things until the last minute. Since I paid for the darn thing and it was in stock, I crossed this off my to do list. Today I review my to do list and realise it has not arrived. IT HAS NOT EVEN BEEN SHIPPED! Watch out for ordering things from Target as it seems to be highly unreliable"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned this Boring Toy","review":"I received this toy as a gift for my son's 1st birthday. I thought that the air blowing sound was loud and the noise scared my child. The balls would constantly blow off the intended track. Personally, I did not like this toy b/c I prefer engaging toys that require my child to use his motor skills or intelect to manipulate the toy. This toy plays all by itself - boring. If you want something for your child to simply watch - get a goldfish, it's not as loud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute","review":"My son is 7 months old, he looks at this toy like it's completely crazy. He just got it, so he's not into how it works yet. He does really like the balls and carries them around while he crawls. It's a cute toy though and seems like it's built well. It shuts off in a good time frame as well do it's not making you crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"I too, would give it zero stars if I could. I can't stand this toy. Not only is it loud, the balls ALWAYS shoot away from it. They never go down the spiral. Then my dog chases the balls and chews on them. And my son (1 year-old) just looks at it like it's the dumbest toy ever. I agree. I wish I read the reviews before I bothered buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of PVC in this toy","review":"I just returned this toy (& the Hasbro Busy Basics Busy Ball Choo Choo) after discovering it contains PVC. A Hasbro Playskool customer service representative confirmed the presence of PVC. As a new parent, I've learned that PVC is dangerous to a child's health and that many US companies are voluntarily going PVC-free and many European countries have banned it. Not all plastics are dangerous which is why I initially purchased this toy but when it arrived I was surprised to discover that characteristic smell (like shower curtains) and soft plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE this toy!","review":"I must admit, my daughter really likes this toy ... when it's working correctly! Most of the time, the balls just fly out of the toy, never to be seen again until I go searching under furniture for them. I do feel as if I'm \\"fetching\\" these balls for my daughter over and over again. If I don't, she gets frustrated because the toy doesn't do anything! I love Playskool toys, but I really feel like they missed the mark with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrified","review":"My son is 11 months old and is absolutely terrified of this toy. I had been looking for something new and there were limited toys for his age group. The fan is very loud as well as the music. He might be able to grow into it but I don't see it being much fun as he gets older. It sounds like alot of children love it, just be warned it may be a little too much for a younger child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never works the way it is supposed to","review":"I cannot stand this toy. The music is way too loud and there is no way to turn it down. If the pieces are not aligned perfectly, the balls bounce all over the place and then I have to go get them. My one year old likes it okay, but he can't push the button hard enough to start it himself. His favorite thing is when I get hit in the head with a ball. He has also begun trying to put other items in it. I guess that's educational, like yes the lego fits in the hole but no, the shoe does not. Playing with this toy takes so much effort from a parent that you may as well save your money and just dance around the living room for your baby. I have put this toy at the back of the closet and I will bring it out again when he is four or five. My sister-in-law gave it to us as a gift, and I think it was to get us back for when we bought her 3 year old a toy drum and cymbals set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like a hand vac","review":"I think my kids would really like this except my 2.5 year old son doesn't like how it sounds.

They love the [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"little potential for play","review":"I bought this toy for my child believing it would be a fun, interactive ball toy. I was extremely disappointed to learn that the balls moved fully on their own (air powered). I wanted a toy that the child could put a ball into motion and watch it move through the maze, not a \\"toy\\" that the child sits and watches."},{"rating":"2","title":"great toy","review":"my son loves this toy, even after having it a year. he is 2 now and has just as much fun. and i have more fun because now i dont have to chase after the balls as he can do it himself now. the music can be a little annoying but then it is not a toy for me, it is for the little ones and they love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasn't the reaction I was expecting","review":"We bought this and put it together. Started it up and the music turns on, the motor turns on, all good. As soon as the balls started flying out and going all over, it just scared the piss out of our little boy. No toy had ever frightened him before so we were surprised. In addition, we had only tried it again a total of 4 times and the motor died. At least we were then able to return it for a reason other than it freaked out our kid. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Our dog loves it ...","review":"Like others mentioned, balls rarely go back to the toy. So I always have to run to catch the balls before our dog does! My 9 months old son likes \\"Busy Ball-Tivity Center\\" better too. If balls are not missing (because our dog destroyed some already), I would definitely return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect","review":"this toy was the perfect gift for my friends 9 month old hes at the crawling almost walking stage so he goes and gets the balls him self and just loves it when they pop out :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"a fun toy when it works","review":"This is the third ball popper we acquired, each with the hope that the toy would work as promised by the toymaker. When it works properly the grandkids love it and want to play with it constantly. But for some reason the motor gives out quickly (we try new batteries) and as a result the ball popper can barely pop the balls. A big disappointment, again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HUGE fun and really LOUD","review":"This toy has been such an enormous hit at our house, it's hard to complain about it: we have children ranging from age 1 to age 7, and they ALL play with it, with great delight. BUT, it's so LOUD! It's like running a hair dryer or air popcorn popper, plus the frantic music and silly noises. It drives me nuts after about thirty seconds. But they LOVE it. I guess I'd call this a \\"play with it in your room with the door closed while Mommy puts a wet washcloth on her forehead\\" toy: worth every single penny, but a parental love sacrifice to allow it in the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun For ALL Ages","review":"I bought this toy in 2004 for my then 7 month old. Since then, it has been a constant fixture in our playroom. Now, it is great fun for our 11 month old son. In fact, both of them play together.It is quite durable, able to withstand heavy play for almost 4 years now. The batteries have been replaced only 3 times. The top yellow tray will come off with rough play, but we have had no other problems.As with all noise-making toys, if you cover the speaker with some clear packing tape, the sound will be muffled but still audible.I highly recommend this toy for ages 6 months to 5 years and maybe beyond."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hit Since Day One!","review":"My son received this a few months ago as a gift for his first birthday. The one we have is different colors than the one shown, but from the moment this was removed from its box, it has been a favorite for him. He quickly learned how to push the button to turn it on and enjoys chasing the balls all around his playroom. He also enjoys just putting his face over the top to feel the air come out. :) My only complaint is that when he puts something in the ball shoot that is not supposed to go in there, it is a little difficult to pull it apart for when I have to dig it out. I suppose it makes it good that they can't easily rip it apart, but makes it difficult for mom when you're trying to fix it and you have an angry 16-month old that just wants to play with it... Overall, I would highly recommend this toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun toy, but the batteries don't last long...","review":"My daughter got this toy as a gift when she was about 5 months old. She loves to watch the balls pop out and laughs really hard when her 5 yr old brother goes running after them. The only problem I had with this toy was the fact that the batteries die VERY quickly. After only about 10 plunger hits we noticed a considerable change in performance. \\"D\\" size batteries don't come cheap but we've replaced them several times so that my daughter could enjoy her toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too loud","review":"I wish I would have read more reviews on this... I bought it for my one year old's birthday. WAY too loud, obnoxious is more like it. Both of my kids like the activity but walk away before they're done being entertained because it's too loud. Plus it takes 4 D batteries, $$$. Getting rid of it and sticking to my wooden toy purchases."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"This toy was a major let down. We received it as a shower gift and eagerly awaited the time our son could play with it. The balls barely pop out of the tube and usually only if we push them through. By the time we get them moving enough on their own, the fan stops and the balls collect inside again. It's a major frustration for me let alone our son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balls everywhere!","review":"I bought this toy for my one-year old daughter and she really likes playing with it. I'm not sure if there's a design flaw or not, but a lot of the balls pop up in the air and out of the toy, which leaves me chasing them around everywhere trying to put them back in. Other than that annoyance, it's a really cute little toy at a good price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Air too forceful","review":"An interesting concept, but the balls get blown off of the toy by the force of the air coming out of the tube and my soon to be one year old grandson isn't at the stage where he is willing or able to run after the balls and place them back in the unit. It would have made for a much better toy if the balls did not fly off. This toy is a toy that requires constant adult supervision in order to keep the child entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy and Unpleasant","review":"I am very disappointed in this toy. The motor is so very loud, and it sounds just like a hair dryer. The motor noise even drowns out the songs and sound effects. I ordered this toy new from Amazon in July 2007. If I had it to do over again, I would NOT purchase this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring ball flopper","review":"I could not have been more discouraged with this toy and would return it if I could. The blowing air was the only thing my 12 months old baby liked. The ball get stuck at the botton and won't always pop up which discouraged my daugher. She would stick her arm down the hole and then fall over. I was afraid she was going to break or injure her arm so I put the toy up until she was older. She is now 21 months old and still has no interest in the toy. She has taken the top shoots off of it and only plays with the balls. Hopefully I will get a good price for it at the garage sale this summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"danger","review":"recall this toy, it is dangerous! recall,recall,recall,recall. before some innocent child really gets a serious injury. you as the store should stop selling this awful toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son likes, but is a little wary of it!","review":"My son really likes putting the balls in and watching them go down the ramp into the tunnel, but he is a little wary/scared of the loud noise (kind of vaccum-like) when you actually turn it on. It is a pretty neat toy though, and I think he will grow out of being scared of it (he is usually fine when I sit by him and reassure him...he is 11 months old)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"My 1 year old loves this toy and my three year old enjoys chasing after the balls as they go flying out of the toy. Fun Fun Fun"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fan does not blow out balls","review":"My friend's child had this toy, and my daughter wanted one. Maybe mine is defective, but it never worked properly. The fan is not strong enough to blow the balls out the way they should (even with new, high-quality batteries). I have to place my hand over the top to create some suction, then release to get the balls to blow out for a couple of seconds, then I repeat. My daughter loves the balls, but gets so frustrated with it. She and her her playdates much prefer to stick things that don't belong down there (little people, dinosaurs, balls that don't fit, and arms which get stuck!) Then I have to take it apart to get those out. I don't recommend this toy at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Get Enough","review":"As an adult, I'm not entirely sure what the big deal is but needless to say, my toddler LOVES it. We introduced it at about 9 months and at first he was scared of it but quickly came to love it. Now at 22 months, he still loves it and will carry around the balls even if he isn't using the machine. We've actually lost most of the balls so my only issue now is getting replacement balls! Definitely a favorite in our house. The machine does have a low/high/off volume control and you can turn it off too which at times is a blessing, as with any musical toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much fun for kids under 8","review":"Bought this for my four children, ages 8, 3, and 8 month old twins. They LOVE it!! Have giggled and squealed for hours in front of this thing. I have no idea why.I think this might help with hand eye coordination, for educational purposes. Maybe cause and effect also.In regards to durability, all four have dismantled it and keeping up with the balls is a daily challenge. The small fan produces quite an impressive trajectory.Overall, I highly recommend purchasing this. This will not get your kid into Harvard but is sure to produce laughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plays itself","review":"My 11 month old got so frustrated by this toy she almost started crying. She wanted to play with the balls, but as soon as they popped up, they rolled down the slide and out of reach. It seemed like the toy was playing by itself and there was nothing for her to do. I took it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE PARENTS!!!!!!","review":"I thought getting this item for my daughter's first Birthday was going to be exciting.. In fact it's was the total opposite. It was a nightmare. My daughter got her arm stuck inside of the hole where the balls come out. Not only could we not get her arm out the suction on the toy made it impossible to get her arm to move. My poor daughter First Birthday was ruined by that toy. I do warn you parents BEWARE of this toy. I emailed and contacted the manufacture of this toy and was given a brush off. I think this item should be taken off the shelves. Very dangerous!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This toy is WONDERFUL!","review":"I have two children, 2 years and 10 months. They both love this toy to death, and can play with it forever. My dogs do love to run off with the balls, but other than that, it is one of the best things I have ever purchased. Even older kids love to play with it when they come over. Highly reccommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ridiculous -- But The Kids LOVE IT!!","review":"We got this as a gift and I just cringed. Great, I thought. A loud, annoying toy that blows balls all over the place. And that's just what it is, but my kids (aged 2 and 6!) love this thing. It's just so ridiculous, you have to love it. I have to admit I even find it strangely entertaining to watch the balls go around. Just realize that you will be hunting for balls because the blower (at least on ours) is pretty powerful and sometimes shoots the balls way out of the toy and across the room.My 2 year old opened this gift at a party filled with family and kids of all ages. It quickly became the center of attention. Like another reviewer said, if you want something educational, go get a Leap Frog toy. But this is just pure, unabashed fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frightening music","review":"I thought this would be a lot of fun, but the music is so loud and aggressive. It is the thing my 11 month old has every been afraid of. There is no volume switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"So far, no go","review":"So far, I don't get the positive reviews. The toy sounds like a hair dryer with calliope music superimposed. It's pretty irritating to me; I can't imagine that a 9-mo-old would like the noise. It happens that my 25-month-old has never liked the sound or the blowing of hairdryers--that's the one part of his first haircut that made him cry--and he won't play with the toy as designed. He loves the light plastic balls and has created several games for them, and he has had fun dismantling the body of the toy, but he won't let me turn on the switch. I don't think of him as overly timid. He is very fun-loving and loves his music toys, but so far this toy hasn't worked for him. Maybe he'll get used to it. My husband, on the other hand, thinks the toy is a riot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids enjoyed, but balls promptly were trashed.","review":"I got this for my 2 year old. Both he and his 4 year old brother found it entertaining. It is also good practice for little ones to place an object into a small hole (fine motor skills). Problems with it though: my 2 year old, who still chews on things. promptly destroyed all the balls. This toy is intended for babies and babies mouth their toys, so I think the balls should have been able to handle it. This toy is also loud without volume control. Heads up--takes 4 D batteries that aren't included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Young Kids Under Four With This Toy","review":"I see alot of good reviews on this product so maybe this just happened to my son. The toy is very fun for him to watch, and grab balls however my son has a knack for testing things it seems. I was in the kitchen while he had this toy, and I noticed when I came out he had stuck his whole arm down the tunnel trying to grab a ball, and got it stuck. He is almost two, and boys are more likely to be rough with the toys. Anyway long story short I had to use baby oil to get his arm out. I will be contacting the company before I throw the toy out. Other than that the blue slide was constantly being taken off by my son. I rated five stars for fun because he had more attention on this than anything else for awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected For My 9-month-old","review":"We puchased this toy for our 9-month-old and ended up returning it to the store. The concept and the looks of this toy are great, but as mentioned in other reviews, this toy is pretty noisy. It's so noisy that we were afraid it could affect our daughter's attention or hearing. The toy does not come with volume control, and the music can be annoying to some people like us. Moreover,the motor to create the force to blow out the balls runs so loud that it ruins the whole fun intention of this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun for your little one","review":"We bought this for our 9-month-old twins. The two of them have a blast when they play with their Air-tivity Ball Fountain. The balls are little enough for even their tiny hands to pick and and play with. They both screech and laugh when the balls come flying up. Sometimes the balls can go all over the place, which makes it a little extra work to go and retrieve them all. It makes funny sounds and music, too. I was suprised when it said it needed four D batteries, though! I use that in our SWING which plays music, lights up, and has six varying speeds! Hopefully then, the batteries won't have to be replaced as much since they're so big. All in all, this is a fun and different toy that'll entertain for a long time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy fan....","review":"Very simply, if your child doesn't like to hear the vacuum cleaner or hair dryer, he won't like this toy.

My daughter is 10 months old, and doesn't quite get it yet, but I know she will!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOUD Busy Ball Popper","review":"This is a great toy with two draw backs........#1 There is no volume adjustment for the music. If there is, I wish someone would point out to me where I could find it. It is LOUD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#2 The balls don't stay in the tray at the top when the balls pop out. They go all over the place. So, I guess that's what they mean by \\"Busy\\" Ball Popper. Our daughter is busy chasing the balls all over the place....Over all a pretty good product that could stand to use a little bit of improvement. I'd still recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This toy was purchased for our 9-month old daughter, and not only did she hate it, but we hated it, too. First of all, the music is deafening. It scared all of us the first time we turned it on! Also, the motor that makes the balls pop out of the top is really loud. Oftentimes, the balls fly across the room, and you have to chase after them. (They really like to hide underneath couches and beds...) The first time we set our daughter down to see it, she screamed in terror. It's ridiculous to buy this toy for anyone under the age of 18-months, and I think it's very misleading that the box recommends the toy for 9-months and up. Unfortunately, the family member who bought the toy did not keep their receipt, and the day after we received it, we gave it to Goodwill. Good riddance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a pain!","review":"We received this toy as a gift and we should have returned it. This toy basically spits out the balls like popcorn which rarely fall into the track...you will spend so much time chasing them and putting them back in....what a pain! I don't care for toys that create a TON of work for minimal entertainment value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps 'em busy! BUY IT!","review":"When my son first got his ball popper he wasn't even a year old. I thought it was a waste of money because he wasn't interested. Then around 1 1/2 -2 years he started playing with it a lot more. I can put it in front of him when I have a chore or need to make dinner and I know it will keep him occupied. Sometimes he doesn't even turn on the blower! He just likes seeing how the balls go in and dumping them out himself. It's an early physics education that is way better than plopping him in front of the TV while I cook.WORTH EVERY PENNY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Buy It","review":"I thought this toy looked like it would be set aside after one cycle of play. I was so wrong. Countless hours have been spent at the popper. My 2 boys love chasing the balls. They stand on it, lay on it. It's tough, it's entertaining and not hard on batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kid's FAVORITE toy!","review":"My kids got this toy for Christmas, and they STILL enjoy chasing the balls around the room and they're 3 and 4! This was the BEST toy we had for our toddlers. Hands down."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun!","review":"We got this a year ago for our now 18mo. boy. He still plays with it almost everyday, and my 3 year old girl is pretty into it too. I think it's a great bargain considering how long it remains interesting. Another plus is that they can both play with it without fighting, which is quite miraculous. Like everyone else says it is annoying to constantly get the ball out from under the couch, but so worth it to have two happy little ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"instant infant favorite","review":"This became an instant hit with our 6 months old.

The idea is wonderful, but the balls don't land in the tray after they pop out - they fly and bounce out and roll across the floor instead. This toy will not function unless you are there to pick each ball up as it flies out and drop it back into the tray. My son still loves it, and although he can push the button, he cannot play with it by himself because all of the balls are out of the toy within about 10 seconds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Design","review":"Not the best toy...the balls pop up and fly out of the toy and are lost under furniture.

But it seems the balls get stuck in the tube all the time and never come out or just flout near the exit hole....frustrating my son and me! I don't know if the motor isn't powerful enough or we have a defective toy...but we hardly use anymore because it never works well for more than a minute or so...and when the balls do actually \\"pop\\" out they go flying all over the place....not impressed with this toy at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but not durable","review":"I bought this for my son and he loved trying to catch the balls coming out.

These are all fascinating and enlightening discussions, and at the least would fester further research and inquiry into interested subject matters with bibliographical materials included for such persual.If one seeks but a theological comparison of the two, one would be wise to check out the best source I have found: Norman L.

I think most people who trim their dogs nails will agree that time is a big factor. Even a well behaved dog doesn't really want you messing with their nails for a long time. This thing has to \\"read\\" where the quick is which requires holding it over the nail and waiting for it to tell you if it is ok to cut. No such luck in my household of four dogs. About the time it would think about reading... they would wiggle just enough to have to start over. The other problem is the style of clipper. This style tends to splinter the nail leaving rough spots or potentially breaking it off shorter than you intended. I use the scissor type clipper and love the cut - very clean. I guess this type would work with little nails, but all my pooches are large breeds with heavy duty nails. In fact, it wouldn't cut my bloodhound's nails at all.

This is ridiculously hard to use to cut the nail. My poor German-Shepherd mix was going nuts; I had to cut some of the nails approximately 5 times to get the nail off. She's only around 60-65 lbs, well within the limit. I'm not sure if the leverage/torque (whatever the proper term is) is poor, or what, but it just wouldn't cut cleanly through the whole nail.In short, I have the same complaints most other owners had.

I used it on one dog and the batteries had already died. You have to restart it many times in order for it to work correctly and the blade is so cheap that it couldn't get all the way through the nail without me having to use both hands to squeeze it.

So your dog is already in for a horrible experience. I took the small size clipper back to the store to return it for the larger size. I just got it home and had the exact same experience with the second pair - I could only get it to cut through one nail - it chewed up another one before I quit. DO NOT BUY THIS CLIPPER!

Our poor dog is now traumatized by this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for Version 2.0","review":"I bought this item a while back and was excited at the prospect of it helping me detect the quick so I would not hurt my dog. The problem is you need such a perfect touch for it to work right. You squeeze the handles to get it to work. But-- do it too far and it doesn't work. Do it not quite far enough and it doesn't work. All the while the dog is sitting there, not to happy about the situation. And the result was I probably cut off less than I could have because I didn't really trust the electronics.

She has an extra toe and due to her not letting anyone touch that foot, it became infected a few weeks ago. Our vet cut it and treated her and said not to let it grow again. This product was recommended during a PetSmart training class I took my other dog to a few years ago, so I got it to try for her. First of all, her nails are literally over an inch long right now and the light turned red when I got near her paw... not even had her claw in it. I obviously know her quick isn't that long, so I decided to ignore the light and cut her nails just a little. I fought this product to cut her first nail and it barely dug into the second nail. The point of this product is to NOT make cutting the nails painful by cutting into the quick. This product barely cuts at all and started to split her nail because the blade was so dull.

The dog would turn green only when you were at the very end of the nail, cutting much too little off. Also the blade seemed dull and was hard to cut, and the top and bottom blade were not held together firmly, so when you put the small amount of the nail in that the lights indicated and tried to cut, the two blades would separate and not cut.Not worth it.

I then watched the instruction video on the product website and followed the directions exactly. The device always showed red and never displayed a safe to cut green light.

At first, he loved this little drill. The only shortcomings he noticed in the beginning were the lack of a keyless chuck and the fact that the paddle-switch could be dangerous if you weren't paying close attention to what you were doing. In the end though, what became this drills downfall was the cheap construction inside the housing. After only a few jobs, a plastic component around the motor cracked, allowing the teeth to slip under strain. A DeWalt service shop charged... to fix this problem. The second hole it drilled after that caused the gears to give out. It was a great idea, but DeWalt needs to send this one back to the design board for more work... I wish now that I had spent the extra money on the bigger DeWalt right angle drill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed w/little features","review":"I'm an Industrial Technology teacher and have access to many new tools. I am very disappointed with this Dewalt Product. I still don't understand why they didn't put a reversable switch on this unit. It would have been great for installing and removing Kitchen cabinets. Moreover, when using spade bits to drill through flooring, you periodically need to \\"back\\" the bit up to remove it when it becomes bound. I think a better purchase would be a temporary 90 degree chuck that mounts to a portable drill. Be very careful when setting this unit on the ground ... it's super easy to hit the start switch and if you've got a large spade bit in the chuck \\"watch out!!\\" I also would like to see a variable speed adjustment as this drill does create a lot of torque and can easy twist and sprain you wrist if you're not anticipating it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sturdy drill","review":"Bought this drill while I was rewiring several rooms in my house. Got it to drill through floor joists, and it did just that very well. Compact size with good power.The handle/trigger is tricky, and I unplug it before changing bits or if I'm done using it for awhile. Otherwise you're likely to activate the drill accidentally. Did it once, luckily didn't get hurt.But, the length of the trigger is good for one thing. With 2 x 10 joists, I was able to get the drill bit up into the upper part of the joist without having to stick my hand all the way up there. No keyless chuck, but that may be why it's compact. Keyless chucks are about 2-3 times as long as a keyed chuck, so for size issues, I don't mind it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A drill for those who make no mistakes","review":"Horrible little drill!!!!

While this drill is certainly heavy duty, it has been a disappointment. It has a very dangerous switch which is easily turned on when you are working in awkward positions, as typical with right angle drills. Also, it lacks variable speed and reverse which was not clear in the description when I bought it. My brother has a Milwaukee (made by Sioux) right angle drill which is hands down better which I would recommend instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full time construction worker","review":"I own this particular drill, although it is a powerful drill for a compact right angle drill, the major draw back for me is the non-reversing feature. What I have needed to use it for mostly is driving in screws in compact areas such as the inside of cabinets. If there is a need to remove the screw for adjustment of what you are working with you are really up a creek. Other than that it is also not variable speed which is not critical but would definitely be a plus if it were variable speed. I would recommend the makita model although not as powerful it has all the things the dewalt model lacks. P.S. A friend of mine has this drill and while trying to change the bit with the drill plugged in accidentally hit the trigger driving the chuck key deep into his hand.

This Dewalt is solid as a rock and quite powerful for a 3/8 inch drill. The trigger action is smooth and offers full control. I do have two complaints about this drill. First, it is poorly balanced. With it's large chuck and metal housing the weight is shifted way forward and will fatigue you quickly if you are holding it horizontally such as to shoot screws into wallboard for example. Second, the drill should be more compact than it is.

The RPMs are too high for setting screws other in an open field (I found myself dropping this DeWalt tool and picking up my old cordless 3/8\\" Makita variable speed reversable all-purpose drill to set screw in corners and along joints where I needed better control and lower RPMs than the DeWalt would give me). This DeWalt may work for deck screws, but I never gave it a chance for that application before dropping it from my tool collection so frustrated with its drywall application. Hybrid tools are compromises - If you want a drywall screwdriver, buy one that's designed only for that purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"Bought this item new, never tried it because the nose piece was so cheep!!!!

I hope this isn't the way Dewalt is going with there products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enchanted","review":"Considering that Charlotte Church received a 20 million dollar contract, I would have expected something better from her for her 4th album. She attempts to sing songs which are the most difficult to date with a voice which is not as good as it once was. So I guess you could say that I am disenchanted. Charlotte needs to get focused and sing songs which her voice will support. With the exception of Carrickfergus, they were not to be found here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voice sounds strained","review":"She remade songs that have been remade a thousand times before. She will never be Barbara Streisand. Get some new material.

Charlotte Church has got a lot of publicity, but not much else in the way of talent. I was ready to scream when I heard her sing \\"Can't Help Loving 'Dat Man.\\" NOTE TO PRODUCERS: THIS IS NOT AN OPERATIC SONG! SHE SHOULDN'T BE SINGING LIKE IT IS ONE! As for the rest of the CD, her voice is too forced---she has no emotion in what she is singing. If that's your cup of tea, go for it, but I personally don't want to hear someone blowing out a voice that could be trained some more to be half decent. The only song that wasn't too bad was \\"Papa Can You Hear Me?\\", but i may be saying that just because I liked the lyrics. As for the final track, \\"The Prayer,\\" all I've got to say is that Church is not worthy to sing with a talent like Josh Groban. Buy his CD instead---it's worth the money. And Charlotte. . .I'm sure you have a great personality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs that require maturity","review":"Ms. Church has included on this album some of the most stirring songs every written. However, the lack of expression on her part is disheartening, though understandable. Ms. Church has wonderful potential to be a great singer, but she is not such now, and the overuse of her young voice is only to her detriment. Although many of these pieces are vocally easier than those in her classical repertoire, she lacks the emotional maturity to really be expressive. Like so many young athletes, dancers, actors, etc...she is more a pretty face at the moment than a mature performer. I don't think this album is worth purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I Rip out her vocal cords???","review":"Man, i am tellin you, this hshould be rated a quarter out of five!! (...)She sounds like an elf when she sings. She can't even go up that high, and she always changes her chords. DEF. NOT A SINGER, and i wouldn't be surprised if she didn't have any other talents. If anyone buys this cd, it would be like buying a skunks head in a tuna fish sandwich, dipped in mallasas, squished underneath a 1000 pound elephant's foot, with tons of 100 year old gravy, and a rotten cherry on top.

There is no interpretation, no texture or substance to her voice. She rarely is on pitch. Don't be mad at me -- or her. She's just a kid trying to sing grownup songs. I'm just trying to point that out. She should stick to what she CAN do -- falsetto-like ditties that won't offend anyone who thinks she's a musician. She's a kid. (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur Hour","review":"With so many top notch singers under contract to them, I can only wonder why Columbia would bring such an amateur sounding young lady as Charlotte Church in to sing some of the finest material to have ever worn its label. Charlotte will always seems out of place unless she is part of a choir. She simply does not have the emotion and vocal range to be a success as a vocal artist. I heard the song Habanera and wondered if she may have burst a blood vessel trying to reach some of the notes. While she can be somewhat pleasant when singing Christmas Carols, she appears incredibly inept when attempting anything else. The CD Enchantment is a total waste of your money. As for Charlotte, it would be nice if we could put her in a shiny box, tie a red ribbon around it and leave a note which says, \\"Don't Open Until Christmas\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Sound No Variance","review":"Probably a future star but she needs to learn to perform with range and variance in voice.

Relax Charlotte, show us your range and add some passion...not just the high range or you better stick just with opera otherwise another monotonous CD once again from a highly hyped young singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many Are Better","review":"There are many at my High School who can sing better than this girl Charlotte Church. I heard that she had quite a voice but it does not sound like it here. She would be O.K. in a choir, but doesn't have the strength in her voice or the range to sing the songs on this record album. I found this CD very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Child's Play","review":"For a school-age girl singing some songs, this CD would be passible. But for an alleged teen-diva, listening to Enchantment was an extreme disappointment. Charlotte seemed very tentative in her singing as if being graded by a teacher. For a middle school singer, I would have given her a B. However for a teen-diva, an \\"F\\" is the only appropriate grade. There is an acute lack of emotion here which causes the listener to wonder whether or not this is the first time through for this singer or if she is simply an unemotional person. In any case, this CD will be of value only to Miss Church's closest friends and fans. To anyone else, it will seem like simply child's play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Andreas","review":"At 12 her voice was as a miracle; however, at 15 her voice is only just promising.This work is suited only for the sort of person such as BBC's Keeping Up Appearances' Mrs. Bucket. It's Muzak for the pretentious. Not for the serious music lover.Miss Church, at a younger age, was precocious; however, one wonders if she can spell Bach or Mozart; never mind possessing the knowledge of who they were. She's failed to mature or to increase her talent.Time to either put this one out to pasture, or get her some training."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disenchantment","review":"After listening to about half of this album, I was shocked to hear how far Charlotte's voice has deteriorated since her 3rd album. Whether it came from abuse or puberty, the fact is that she cannot sing the type of songs which this album presents. A possbile exception would be with Carrickfergus where she seems to hold her own. Otherwise, what the listener hears is little more than a High School rendition. In the future she needs to be more careful in her selection of music if she is to keep the favor of the listening public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment not Enchantment","review":"I was very disappointed with this album. It was most certainly not the \\"best\\" of Charlotte Church! I was expecting the same quality that was found on her earlier albums but it was just not there. The singing felt very mechanical and had no depth. I would rather have heard the original artists sing the songs she did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strictly for fans only","review":"Some of the singing in this CD is quite pleasant. After all, Charlotte Church's voice has a sort of innocent charm. Unfortunately, she always sings in a sort of whitish and naive tone, which just won't do for many of the more mature songs. More worryingly is her tremulously tonal emission and the failure to develop into a larger and more solid voice as she ages. Indeed, vocal emission is often annoyingly constricted and the singing therefore loses its emotional force. The big error in the planning of this CD is in the inclusion of Carmen's Habanera and the Laughing Song. In the former, Church conveys the impression of an 8 year old girl trying to put on her mother's make-up. Her singing of the higher passages of the latter is extremely embarrassing for both the singer and her admirers. I take it that it's not intended as a joke and I really feel sorry for her and angry at the CD producers. Strictly for Church's fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Cannot Enjoy","review":"I have spent far more time reading the various reviews on this CD than I am spending writing one. The music critics take issue with Charlotte's ability to sing, while her fans say just listen and enjoy. I have listened to all that Amazon has provided and have conluded that Charlotte was way to young to have attempted the very complex (musically speaking) songs on this CD. This would be the equivalent of a Middle School boy in the roll of Stanley Kowalski in a Streetcar Named Desire. He simply would not be able to do justice to the role, which is why SND is never done in middle or high schools. Accordingly, Charlotte should not have attempted these complex Hollywood-type pieces. They require too much and I simply could not enjoy someone singing them who simply is not old enough yet to have developed the necessary skills to do justice to them. For fans who love her only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enchantment","review":"Like most of the rest of the people who have reviewed this record, I am not enchanted. 3 of my favorite songs, The Little Horses, The Water is Wide, and Somewhere were among the selections performed by Charlotte Church in this CD. In lieu of repeating what so many others have already said, it will suffice to say that Charlotte doesn't have near the maturity to attempt songs such as are presented here. I would like her to try again in about 10 to 15 years when her voice is matured much like Sarah Brightman's did. I'm certain that at least a few of these songs would then be acceptable. Until then, she should avoid such as is included here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just The Beginning","review":"I can't say that I was disappointed when listening to Enchantment because it was exactly what I had expected. At the age of 15, any girl (with a few exceptions) who steps up and attempts these difficult songs will come up with the same results. In other words, it will sound just like a beginner. I believe other have pointed out that in time, perhaps 10 years or so, Miss Church, like many of her peers, will have developed a more mature voice which will be able to sing all or at least almost all of the songs from this album with authority. Until then, by the number of 5-star reviews I have seen, she apparently has developed enough fans who like her juvenile versions of these songs to be able to sing them and sell them. This is all fine, but to an educated ear, these weak renderings most likely will be unsatisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"These Songs Are Over Her Head","review":"The songs on this album are out of the range of Miss Church. The original artists and some others have done them so much better. She should stick with the ethnic folk songs where she seems to belong. Not to be bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abomination","review":"I bought this cd out of sheer curiosity. I'm a follower of opera and classical music but this one is the most abysmal i have ever heard!Curiously, I thought that Church made this album as a past time but the strange thing is that I think she wants to be taken seriously as s soprano when her voice is so common that you would be unable to distinguish it amongst 500 amateur singers.Her voice is thin and very amateurish, this could actually be mistaken for a rejected demo tape. Whoever has conceived of making this album is a heinous crime punishable by death. She has insulted aficionados and fans alike, how dare Church sing Papa Can You Hear Me?(!)She has clearly no understanding of the text, everything is just coming out of her mouth and coming out badly.Miss Church should be locked in a dark room, with neither food nor drink and should made to listen to Renee Fleming, Maria Callas and Barbra Streisand."},{"rating":"1","title":"No voice, no technique....NOTHING!","review":"Get her some voice-lessons for Christ's sake! Some of the greatest arias had to be popped up so that she could squeak her way through it. It's not even belt-singing but naive Tralala. No sense for pitch, Pinched coloratura, ugly scooping, strained above the passagio, colourless, dull and one-dimensional...Popera? The cancer of opera, something every true operalover loathes. Have our standards dropped thus far? Have people become so shallow? Church is a fraud, made up by PR-Agents and other greedy idiots who never heard real opera it seems.

There are so many weak areas in her vocals that it is a wonder that she was allowed to sing such demanding songs at her age. Singers such as Fleming, TeKanawa, Battle, Brightman, etc. took considerable time to evolve to the point where they could cover the songs in this album. Its a shame that such great material was wasted on someone who is nowhere near the point where she would be capable of singing them. Hopefully Miss Church has taken note of those criticisms of her singing and will wait until such time as she is capable of an acceptable rendering before another attempt. This CD is recommended to music teachers and students as an example of how NOT to sing classic songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly an enchanting voice!","review":"I am a huge fan of Charlotte and welcome anything she does.Enchantment is a beautiful collection of music, including Broadway and Celtic. Whoever thought this cd up was brilliant!Charlotte's voice just becomes more spectacular as she matures and thankfully she uses her talent wisely.Her maturity is evident in such songs as \\"Bali Ha'i\\" and \\"Papa Can You Hear Me?\\". If you want chills up and down your spine, listen to \\"The Flower Duet\\". The version of \\"Tonight\\" had me longing for the theater. Every song is absolutely perfect!Enchantment is a gift for her fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Those who can't do, review...","review":"I'm tired of all these vicious reviews of this young girl's voice.

A bit like trying to fly an ultra-light alongside a B52. \\"Bali Ha'i\\" has the desired dreamy quality, and the orchestrations are marvelous.It would be interesting if Miss Church would re-record these in ten years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting!","review":"I was shocked to read CRITICAL reviews of this CD! I loved everything about it and thought it was the best Charlotte Church CD yet! The question really isn't \\"What is there to like?\\" but \\"What ISN'T there to like?\\" when talking about this CD. Charlotte has mixed beautiful songs of all types flawlessly-who else could have a CD that has West Side Story's \\"Tonight\\" side by side with a poignant Celtic tune? Last, but certainly not least, the accompaniment for these songs is pure delight-retaining the mood of the pieces but adding delightfully new flair and special sounds. To sum it up...you are crazy if you don't LOVE this latest Charlotte Church CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Obviously not for Christians","review":"Opera critics are low-class and prejudiced, and obviously don't believe in the mandate from Christ, \\"judge not, that ye be not judged.\\"For the rest of us, especially for myself who wouldn't normally give classical music the time of day, Miss Church has done a favor. I personally don't expect her to be a Denyce Graves or a Jesse Norman. I find Carrickfergus a beautiful ballad, and if she wants to experiment with other genres she has the right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever wondered who she is or which CD of hers to buy?","review":"This one will answer all those questions and is definitely the best of Charlotte's disks to introduce her. The varied musical and vocal styles as well as the arrangements will have you listening to her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Is She Singing For?????","review":"I listened to about 10 of the songs in this CD and without a doubt they were the most uninspired cold-sounding covers ever sung. It was if Charlotte was singing from a hymnal, learning the material as she went along. On some of the songs, it sounds as if there is a different singer singing. Or else Charlotte had a cold on the day she recorded those songs. I mean they are REALLY BAD. Also, I cannot imagine why she would try and sing a song like Habanera, where her voice is not even close to the octaves where many of the notes are sung. She sounds as if she is dying when she reaches for those notes. However, actually, you can assess her ability by simply listening to the last song in the CD, which is \\"The Prayer\\" On this one, she is literally blown right out of the studio by Josh Groban, who demonstrates what type of voice is needed for material which has been included in Enchantment. But Groban's voice on just one song is not worth the price of this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately Charlotte's Best CD","review":"I think this album is amazing. I could listen to it over and over again. The music changes but the one thing all of the tracks have in common are Charlotte's beautiful voice. I can't wait for her next cd to come out. As she gets older her music gets better as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rich, Growing Voice","review":"Ms. Church's voice is yet again magnificent. Her foray into the operatic uvre is impressive, though it belies certain vocal immaturity. Her interpretation of Haba?era is exotic. Though it deviates from the traditional repetoire of Bizet's work, it holds its own. Papa Can You Hear Me? is my favorite of the pieces in this collection, it is particularly rich and poignant. Her duet with herself seems to fall short in Flower Song, though. She is far too breathy in particular parts of this. Nonetheless, Ms. Church would do well to continue in operatic roles, she may be the makings of a diva."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Unimaginative","review":"Charlotte's voice is still great, but not great enough to justify spending any money on these covers of unimaginatively chosen pop and (Celtic)folk classics. There's no unexpected choice in this entire album and that goes not just for the songs selected, but for Charlotte's phrasing as well. It sounds like a technical practice session with her voice teacher (whom Charlotte mentions repeatedly in the liner notes). Most embarassing is her operatic version \\"Tonight\\". Its as bad a cover of a great song as I've ever heard. It reminds me of the old Ed Sullivan show where he'd have an opera singer come on and sing a current pop/easy-listening favorite just so the singer can appear to be a \\"regular guy\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voice of an Angel!!","review":"I enjoy listening to this cd by Charlotte Church!

Her voice is fine but the choices in songs are quite dull for her. The song choices are main problem with this compact disc. Church was still young and maturing with her voice. These songs aren't as passionate or delivered as they should be on this disc.I admire Charlotte Church and predict that her voice and her maturity will grove and evolve with the music over the years but this disc is pretty disappointing. I didn't really find myself in love with it. Church still needs to learn and work on her singing and sing songs that are more suitable to her age. The recording was done over 10 years ago and I imagine that she probably has learned so much more about music since then.I look forward to listening to her in the future but this is not her best. She still needs to aim for her best recording to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"True TNT","review":"I watched Charlotte on TNT Christmas in Washington. I had to go get her Cd's the next day.

It makes me happy and its addictive. Once I start listening I can not stop. It's good at home or the office or in the car. Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why This??????","review":"Considering the tragic manner in which Charlotte Church lost her voice, its a shame that they had to try and make another album with her with what little voice she has left. She simply doesn't have the necessary vocal components to sing anything in Enchantment with the exception of Carrickfergus.If she is intent on continuing to sing with such a pedestrian voice, then she should at least seek out material which is consistent with that voice. To try and cover some of Hollywoods most famous ballads with nothing more than a High School voice is a disservice to the entire music community and a black mark on Miss Church's career, assuming she still has one.Enchantment serves as an example of what music not to sing on an album when you don't have the voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOO, HISS!! Kid Butchers Repertoire!!","review":"Charlotte Church...the International sensation...SO WHAT?The kid, though with a lovely voice, butchers these songs, which some might I add, are way too difficult for her to be singing at this age ( Lakme's Flower Duet, Carmen's Habanera ). The rock beat interpretations, that I can handle, but not the complete disregarding of proper style, technique and singing procedures.The Bali Ha'i is WAY too low for her, and the high notes on the Habanera stink. It's obvious that they have been digitally enhanced.However, I suppose this is where music in America is heading, but if you want to hear a GOOD version of the Habanera ( though it won't have the synthesizer background ), check out Maria Callas's version. She does it correctly and it sounds better too...Poor Charlotte Church...hope she saves her money now...I'm willing to bet that her voice is shot by thirty...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough to Rate","review":"After listening to a multitude of different divas, including Streisand, Fabian, Battle, Brightman, & Fleming, I find it very difficult to rate Charlotte Church. The main reason is that none of the aforementioned Divas began any type of commercial recording at Church's age. It would stand to reason that she would improve in another 4 years (Streisand started at 19) but at this moment she is at the bottom of the roster, ability wise, at least with respect to the songs attempted in Enchantment. However, I would suggest to anyone seriously considering buying these songs, that they review some of the above adult singers first and then decide if Charlotte meets your expectations. I did not find her meeting mine, YET, on Enchantment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catch a Falling Star","review":"After listening to Enchantment at a listening station at Tower Records, I must agree with those who say that Charlotte is losing her voice. Both the energy and volume are lacking from previous works. The songs which are included in this CD from film and stage need far more attention than Charlotte now is able to give to them. The result is a rendering which just doesn't measure up. Even some fancy studio work is unable to mask the reality here and that is that Charlotte is no longer a legitimate recording artist like she was with her first album. Somebody needs to do something in an effort to salvage her voice before she can't sing at all. Hearing her in Enchantment is a tragedy considering that she was once on top of the world as a 12-year-old. I would suggest that anyone interested in hearing Charlotte when she could sing check out her Voice of an Angel CD. Then you will be able to relate to this review a little more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchantment indeed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"From the musical west side story comes tonight...her first song.The ending strain \\"tonaaiiight\\" is brilliant! The way charlotte enunciates her words in carrickfergus, the little horses and the water is wide is very emotional. Her voice obviously has matured.Her gypsy version of Haba?era is very straightforward.Now comes the best yet..The FLOWER DUET. This is the best song on the album.. the way she flows seamlessly to give a delightful,delectable,ubiquitous duet...The laughing song is beautifully done. A bit of earth if also good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stupendous intro to classical music","review":"I thought that this was a fantastic album for people who have just started listening to classical music, and the real aficianados too. 'Papa Can You Hear Me' is a cover up to scratch with Barbara Streisand's performance. 'The Little Horses' has an hypnotizing melody and an excellent drum background. 'The Laughing Song' is light and amusing, while 'Can't Help Lovin Dat Man' is a soulful rendition of this jazz classic. I commend Charlotte for interspersing broadway, jazz and folk music along with classical masterpieces. This is basically an album worth listening to. If you don't like classical music, you should try this and see if you don't change your opinion! This is Charlotte's best album yet and I'm looking forward to more, even though my favorite music genres are jazz and pop/rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hearing is Believing","review":"It was hard for me to believe that Charlotte Church had digressed so far from her earlier days, so I took a listen to her first album to see if my recollection was correct. And it appears that it was. She doesn't seem to have near the volume in her voice, nor the enthusiasm in her singing. Its as if she is depressed over the fact that she has lost much of her voice and is simply plowing her way through the line-up of melodies which has been prepared for her. She needs to regain some of that which she has lost before venturing into the type of songs in Enchantment. They take a lot more than what she is apparently able to offer right now. She needs to re-assess her career right now and make some changes if she is to survive."},{"rating":"1","title":"child labor laws, anyone?","review":"horrible what they making this poor child into. no way will she have a voice left by the time she's an adult."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Nice Teen Recital","review":"I checked out this CD at the Library and had my daughter listen also. Charlotte appears to have a nice voice for a teen and for a high school recital, this would be good. However, as a professional production, she lacks all of the necessary qualities of a mature singer; and that is what is necessary to deliver the treatment required for the Hollywood/Broadway songs on this album. I would like to hear Charlotte try these again in about 10 years and then we may have something worth reviewing.Simply not up to professional standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Learning Experience","review":"I bought this Cd after seeing Charlotte church on PBS.

Where do I go from here?"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than Opera","review":"As an opera singer in training myself it seems as if I am always training myself. I first took notice if Charlotte when she said \\"I sing opera\\". I thought that was presposterpoous, and of course she doesn't sing opera. She sings a few operatic pieces.

The problem with Charlotte singing solo is that she is not old or mature enough to sing these compostions solo. With some dynamic voices like Groban in there, it makes the songs commerically viable. I remember when they made duets with Frank Sinatra after he had died. They can do that here, tracking in additional voices on the various songs. My recommendation is that they try that approach and re-release this CD that way. That way, people will not get so turned off my Charlotte's voice alone and it will allow her to transition it later on to some solo's where her voice can carry the material. Otherwise, I cannot recommend this CD to anyone the way it has currently been released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Being a longtime fan of good conteporary music....

A natural voice is fine for local church choirs, but the idea of comparing this voice to those of the world's top sopranos is ludicrous. Perhaps by local choir standards her performance is enchanting, but by the standards of professional vocalists, her performance is... unprofessional. Her performance of show tunes reminds one of summer stock theater; her performance of arias from Carmen make an opera fan cringe. This recording of Habanera is spiritless and bland -- resembling no music better than New Age elevator schlock. If you are an avid collector of show tunes you might enjoy this cd; if you are looking for great music, pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I can say is wow","review":"What a day this is. My Enchantment Cd arrived and I was enthralled. I enjoyed her on PBS and this glorious mixture of songs shows an ever maturing Charlotte. It is a CD you will listen to over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't get me wrong","review":"Ok, so I really like Charlotte Church. But I have a feeling that by singing as much as she is at such a young age, she's going to end up doing to her voice what Liza and Julie did. Charlotte is pretty good, and I love it when she sings opera, but she lacks a little when it comes to the Broadway songs. It's pretty, but her inflection is wrong. I think she should just stick to the Opera and classical. She's good at it, so why not stick with it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Number One Cats Fan Speaks","review":"I spend a lot of time on Broadway and Off. I am always loking for good renditions of show tunes to add to my colection. I must admit that my tastes run to a very specific area, so I do not care for some of the songs on this CD, but that is not speak against Miss Church and her talents. The show tunes and one or two others I find very pleasant listening and I hope that someday she may find her way to the Bway stage. Even if you are just an old show girl like me the Cd is worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but Not the Best of Ms. Church's Vocals","review":"Okay, I'll confess that I should probably not have played Charlotte Church's CD in a shuffle with Sarah Brightman's CDs. I have other Charlotte Church albums, and nothing can detract from the fact that she's a fifteen-year-old with a twenty-five- year-old's voice. Enjoyed on its own, Ms. Church's vocals are enchanting on this CD, and she is versatile in the types of music she sings. She needn't improve at all to be good, and worth listening to, but she has done better than this particular CD. Still, I gave her four stars because she is good even at her worst! I recommend this CD for both its own merit, and for comparison with future works she produces as she matures. This young lady is going to be considered one of the best of all times, a real treasure, and a real pleasure to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlotte - Settle Down","review":"I have to go along with another reviewer who said that Charlotte is trying too many genres. She hasn't ever mastered any of them; even her early stuff as she had a lot of singing faults. Lately she has been changing genres as often as I change socks. She needs to get into a groove and stay there. All of the pop singers are successful because they idenitfy with a particular sound and stay there. Charlotte has no identification and no sound to call her own. She needs to find it and in a hurry. She is steadily losing fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"When I first heard Charlotte sing, I was expecting to be following her on the way up. After listening to 10 of the songs on Enchantment, it appears that I will be following her on the way out. Its difficult to believe that any girl her age could lose so much of her voice in such a short time. I mean she sounds no different than any girl who might step out of a choir.I have noticed in recent appearances that she appears with Tony Bennett frequently. Maybe the two have decided to go out together. Both are a shell of their former selves. At least we had her at her best for a few years. Its a shame, though, that she couldn't have grown up to be another Sarah Brightman. The music world needs someone like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did she go????","review":"In most musical scenarios, an artist may seem very impressive on a recording, but when you see them in person, they simply can't bring that recording studio sound to the stage. However, in listening to this CD of Miss Church, I get entirely the opposite impression. I had the opportunity to see her as a 13-year-old at the Hollywood Bowl. While she wasn't the reason I was there, I was impressed with her ability to sing loud and clear through the entire bowl despite it being a blustery day. I now have listened to her Enchantment CD and can scarcely believe that this is the same girl I saw. At 13 she looked like a child with an adult voice. In this album, she appears to be full grown with a voice of a young girl. Its difficult to know what has happened unless she has simply lost her voice via puberty. I'm very disappointed with what I've heard here. I expected better."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Soul","review":"Charlotte Church's singing is just like her character; no Heart and no Soul. Its not surprising that this CD is the last in her contract. She sings like she wants to be out of here. Good. Everyone in the music biz wants her out too. Please let this be the last of Charlotte Church"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Immature","review":"This was a good attempt by Charlotte Church to sing some really nice songs from movie's etc. But as others have said, she just doesn't have the strength or range to cover all 15 of the songs. These songs were tailor made for mature divas like the ones who originally sang them. I believe the only people who will enjoy this album are those who want to hear everything that Charlotte sings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite a Diva","review":"I'm a big fan of Sarah Brightman and was drawn to this CD by alleged similarities between Charlotte and Sarah. However, the similarities are outweighed by the differences at this time. Sarah is way ahead of Charlotte is virtually every aspect of singing; an observation which appears to be shared by many. I don't think Charlotte should have attempted this CD at such a tender age. Even Sarah wouldn't have made such an attempt. I would like to hear Charlotte try songs such as are included herein when she is in her mid-20s, but 15 is way too early in life. Mainstream music fans will not find this CD acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like her songs but not these","review":"I guess there should be more suitable songs that she could sing beautifully and that the listeners could listen comfortably like the songs in her previous CDs. I wonder why she had to choose Habanera. Is she going to shift her professionalism as a classical singer to other kinds?I hope she will be back on the right track in her next CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlotte's Losin it.","review":"After listening to this album at a listening post at my record store, I decided that Charlotte is losing her voice. The electronic enhancements which they are obviously giving her voice detract from the entire group of classic songs which were attempted in this CD. I believe that she attempted too much too soon in her career and that she needs a rest if she is ever going to regain the voice she had at 11. Also she seems to be losing it mentally as evidenced by those horrible remarks she made about the U.S., The President and The NYC Firemen. I think that she should continue her schooling and leave her music career alone for awhile until she matures both vocally and emotionally. The album Enchantment is a sign that its time to stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Incredible Mismatch","review":"After listening to all of the songs on this CD, two significant questions come to mind. First of all, what happened to Charlotte Church's voice??? It is pale and weak and certainly not the voice I heard when she was on TV a few years ago. Secondly, why in the world did the producers of this CD attempt to match her current voice with this collections of classics from bygone years??? It would be a shame if politics were involved here, but I can't come to any other conclusion. The songs and the artist are as incongruent a paring as I have ever seen offered to the public. I noticed that some reviewers were attempting to compare Miss Church with Sarah Brightman. There is no comparison based on this CD. Miss Church couldn't hold a candle to Sarah Brightman. If anyone feels an uncontrollable urge to purchase this CD, I would strongly suggest a used CD so that the pain will be lessened once all songs have been heard. I cannot recommend this CD to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"15 Years To Go","review":"When I was a young girl, I use to listen to those musical talent shows like rocket To Stardom. After listening to Charlotte Church's latest CD Enchantment, I felt as if I were listening to a reprise of that show. While showing promise, Charlotte has neither the Strength, Range, Control, or Emotion, to attempt the difficult songs in this album. Had she tried something less challenging, it is possible that this CD could have risen about the demo level. As it stands now, she appears to be about 15 years aways from singing thse songs successfully. If she follows in the footsteps of a singer like Lara Fabian and gets a similar education, we may yet see her as a diva on a world stage.You've come a long way baby, but you have a long ways to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Stinker","review":"I had the opportunity to listen to this CD today at Borders listening station and was I disappointed. Of all the classical and classical crossover CDs I have listened to (in the 100s)this is absolutely the worst. This girl has no business passing herself off as a classical singer. She is nothing but a classical choir girl whose voice is as sterile as a churchmouse. This girl is sure to go the way of the Edsel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Analogy","review":"I had been referred to this CD from the Sarah Brightman page after noting that one of the CDs purchased by people buying Sarah's \\"Classics\\" CD was this one. However from listening to the meager bites of the songs provided by Amazon here, I cannot see that Charlotte Church is anywhere near where Sarah Brightman is vocally. While Charlotte can reach the same high notes, she doesn't have the vocal control or the strength through the entire vocal range that Sarah does. Also Charlotte does not have the ability to show emotion in her singing. Its as if she is just going through the motions. There are some very good songs here, but this artist is not one who can do justice to them. If you feel enchanted by what you hear here, then you should definetly listen to Sarah Brightman's CDs. They will have you totally mesmerized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Singer","review":"I love the songs on this album, but the singing was terrible. Charlotte Church, whomever that is, does not appear destined to make a career with her voice. I give this 4 for the material and a 1 for singing. On balance, a 2 seems fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Not Good!","review":"I am going to have to break with my fellow CC fan club members who are giving 5-star reviews for this album. In her first 3 albums, Charlotte has sung some great songs which are well within her range and accordingly come across very well. However in Enchantment, she ventures away from those Irish ballads, Christmas,religious and classical songs into an area of show and movie songs which require a much greater vocal range than her age allows. It is easy to spot where she is straining to reach some of the notes. It was inevitible that she would come up with a stinker sooner or later, and it has arrived in the form of Enchantment. However, I do not think this album is representative of Charlotte's ability as a singer and would encourage readers to check out some of her earlier works so as to really understand the abilities of this gifted artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Generation To Go.","review":"I came over here from the Sarah Brightman pages because it said that people who bought her CD also bought this one. But after listening to this CD, I cannot understand why people would like them both. While their voices are somewhat alike, Charlotte Church does not have anywhere near the voice that Miss Brightman does. I believe that in time, she may but right now, she sounds like Miss Brightman's little daughter. I do not believe that Charlotte will be ready for any serious musical events for quite some time. At best, I see this CD as some kind of a preview of coming attractions."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Charlatan","review":"When I first saw the songs being sung on Enchantment, I was amazed that anyone could sing all of these songs at any level of competency. After listening to them, I am now convinced that they can't. However, if they were going to let someone try, why did they ever select Charlotte Church. She has no more business trying to sing these songs than I do. For example, the lack of fluidity in her rendition of \\"The Laughing Song\\" would leave anyone laughing, or maybe crying, depending upon the person's expectations. The bottom line her is that Charlotte should not have taken these songs for her own. With the exception of Carrickferges, they simply do not belong in her repertoire of songs. This CD has the net effect of being a cruel hoax on the public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost! Almost! Almost!","review":"I had doubted that I would ever see the songs on this CD on one album together. Naturally, I had to check out the entire album. However, even an array of classics like what is included here could not get me to buy this CD. Charlotte Church simply does not have the strength in her voice or many other requirements for that matter to sing \\"Tonight\\" and the others included herein. If this CD has sold as many copies as alleged, then hopefully the record label will take note and visualize what this CD could have sold with someone possessing a capably technical voice. I was Almost tempted to buy this one but it was simply too weak a cover. Give 5-stars for song selection, 4-stars for production and 0-stars for the vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enchanting Songs","review":"The songs in this CD are enchanting to be sure. However, they were meant to be sung by adults, like the originals, not a young girl. Maybe in time Charlotte will be able to do an adequeate rendering of these pieces, but at her age now, they simply sound like part of a high school play. I don't fault Charlotte here, but whomever made the song selections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is This Really Charlotte Church??","review":"After listening to Enchantment, it is hard to believe that this is the same Charlotte Church who sang Pie Jesu so many times on TV just a few years ago and suggested then that she was an opera or classical singer star of the future. That great powerful voice is gone and has been replaced with a muted, very average teenage-girl soprano voice. They say that nothing lasts forever, and with Charlotte's voice, it appears the end has come rather prematurely. Possibly she should have waited until her 20s before she began such a rigorous singing schedule. Even the softly sung ballads which have been included on this album can't hide the fact that Charlotte is not the phenom she once was. Only time will tell if she will ever be able to sing at that world-class level again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enchantment - Maturity is the Requirement","review":"This girl sounds awfully young to be singing the songs in this album. You need someone who sounds more mature than their age, not less mature. The young man, Josh Groban, who is apparently only 20 sounds much more mature for his age than Charlotte. I find myself more enchanted by his voice than hers.There must be songs for which her singing will be adequate, but these are not them. I recommend that you pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much for one singer","review":"Enchantment is really a terrific compilation of songs. It would have been a lot better, however, if they had left it as an original compilation rather than having a single singer trying to do them all. Charlotte Church does O.K. on some of these, like Carrickfergus and The Little Horses. However, I think she went way out of her league when she attempted Papa Can You Hear Me and Somewhere. Some songs and some singers are just not made to be covered. Also, her duet with Josh Groban on The Prayer suggests that she is a few years away from attempting duets with dynamic singers, the caliber of Groban.Some may find this CD worth purchasing simply because of the unique song combination presented. Charlotte Church fans may also like her covers here. I don't think, however, that mainstream people into these genres will want to purchase this. Charlotte spread herself just a little too thin on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlotte - Get Back On Course","review":"As a big Charlotte fan, I was shocked when she decided to go over to Columbia to do an album when she was doing so well with Sony. Carrickfergus sounds like the old Charlotte, but the rest of the songs have her out of place. She's not ready for those type of songs, nor is she ready to sing with Josh Groban yet. Its obvious by the record sales, that this is her weakest album to date. So, she needs to return to the music which brought her this far. There are an abundance of classical and christian songs yet to be sung and Charlotte should stay with them for the forseeable future. Things were going well there and needn't be changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved Her Last Night","review":"I am buying my second copy to give as a gift after last night's stirring, but lip synched rendition of the paryer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlotte Church Rox!","review":"In her new CD, Enchantment, you hear a new side of Charlotte. The music, which is, as always, amazing, now has a salsa-ish twist added to it. The guitar in the background is amazing, and the selection of songs is completely unlike the Charlotte many of us know and love. The soft vocals and peaceful, ringing melodies are stunning, and all I really can say is Charlotte, you've gone and amazed me again. She really does have the voice of an angel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Storyteller","review":"The songs which are being sung in Enchantment were primarily stories and messages being told to an audience. However, to tell these stories, an artist needs to develop empathy with his/her audience. That appears to be lacking here with Charlotte Church. To just go out and sing a song in a recording studio without a vision of what or to whom you are singing or communicaiting leaves a song as just so many words. Possibly Charlotte is not old enough yet to have developed these skills. But, if this is the case, she should not have been allowed to attempt these songs. It just leaves the listener with an empty feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Some Fresh Material!","review":"This girl has a good voice, but she wallows in rehashes of songs that have been performed better by other artists. Does she not have access to some original material? How many times can someone sing remakes of old songs and make them sound like opera and keep selling albums? The commercial for this cd on TV alone is stomach turning."},{"rating":"1","title":"enchantment","review":"She still has the voice of an angle. A couple songs are ok, But instead of selling charlttes voice the record companies want to sell her flesh instead. My hat is off to Lulu, Charletts' voice instructor she still encourages a full range of charletts voice, and that is at least evident in this cd. I hope this is a passing phase and that charlotts handlers wake up before she ends up like Wittney Hoston and Bitinnay Spears. It is pitiful that in a few of her songs the morons doing the arrangements think there is need for electronic manipulation of this young womans beautiful voice. I'll personally be praying her career continues but I beleive she will need the spirit of Joan of Arch to do so. I'll be a little more careful when buying any future cds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puh-lease!","review":"This CD stinks! Charlette thinks she can sing like Sarah Brightman--sorry, hun, but you can't. Sarah Brightman can actually sing and hit high notes without sounding like she's stressing her voice. Charlette, on the other hand, thinks she's got this powerful voice, when really all she's doing is screaming and moaning slowly. On all her CDs you can barely understand a word she's singing!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"15-year-old talent from Wales: what a voice!!","review":"Like most people I have been surprised by watching recently the TV commercial where Charlotte Church's album is featured. Where did this girl come from? Cardiff, Wales, and she's only 15 years old, but she sure has an incredible voice!Though the whole setup around her sounds a lot like a marketing scheme, who cares? She has what it takes to become a huge star down the road. The sound of her voice reminded me of a combination of Lorenna McKennit and Nana Mouskouri, though, another not-so-known name also came to mind (for her voice, and her actual story): Scottish, Hollie Smith. What a hit for Sony Music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AN ABSOLUTE GODDESS! WITH AN ENCHANTING VOICE.","review":"Charlotte Church can sing about your toilet overflowing and it will sound like a masterpiece of perfection.This young lady has a voice that puts Mariah Carey, Celine Dion and Christina Aguilera in a different class that does not even compare with Church.Charlotte Church covers such classics as \\"Tonight\\", \\"Somewhere\\" and \\"Papa, Can You Hear Me?\\", in which she actually gives Striesand a run for her money.This is an absolute exquisite CD, and I am so glad to see a teenager like Charlotte Church using her talent to its fullest potential as an artist, not as a slave (Britney Spears) or a hoochie (Mariah Carey).Charlotte Church uses her god given vocal talent and that is where the beauty comes out. Though Church is a strikingly beautiful young lady she shows you don't need push-up bras, big hair or tight torn-up pants, or 16 feet hair extensions to sell a song.A true treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun cd","review":"I love this cd and have had it quite a while. I was just enjoying it again today and thought I'd write a review because I do enjoy it so much. It's just a fun, enjoyable album. Pretty orchestration, a lovely voice, nice to sing along with. Especially at the top of my lungs in the car (alone when no one can hear me!)I really don't know why one would NOT enjoy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Part of The Cd","review":"You can listen to the clips of the first part of the CD. The second half is a mixed bag. I love the Water is Wide, neutral on the prayer. overall I would have liked the CD to narrow down on style, perhaps in the future, but still a worthwhile additon to a collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlotte, Go It Alone","review":"I believe that if Charlotte is going to impress anyone other than her fans, she needs to sing her songs solo and not do duets with dynamic singers. When I heard her singing \\"The Prayer\\" with Josh Groban, it made me reflect on the fact that her voice sounded weak and breathy. If no one has anyone with which to compare Charlotte to, then she will probably sound pretty good, given the quality of production with Columbia or Sony. Having Groban in this album was good for Groban but bad for Charlotte."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlotte Be My Valentine","review":"Great work by a budding superstar. When the world hears Charlotte and Josh at the Olympics it will be non stop for both of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchantment - the best yet.","review":"I have loved Charlotte Church's singing from the first time I heard her. I have all of her CD's. In my opinion this is the best yet. She is simply spectacular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been worse....","review":"I don't really want write about the whole album, there are things I liked and things I didn't. But, the thing that annoys me the most about this album is the song \\"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man.\\" Why have a little girl who sings \\"opera\\" sing a jazzy song like that? She doesn't have the vocal or emotional maturity to pull it off. With her high, head-voice singing this song just sounds silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Songs But Poor Singing","review":"I enjoyed the song selection on Enchantment, but Charlotte Church, in my opnion, was not the proper singer for such fare. He voice seemed weak and unemotional. They need an established Diva for an album like this like Lara Fabian or Sarah Brightman. Maybe in time, Charlotte may fit the bill but certainly not now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of Cultivation","review":"So she has a natural voice and sang at a young age. A natural voice is fine for church choirs, but the idea of comparing this voice to those of the world's top sopranos is ludicrous. Maybe by local choir standards her voice may be enchanting, but by standards of professional vocalists her performance is unprofessional. Her attempts at show tunes sounds like a high school version of Summer Stock. Her performance of arias from Carmen would make the writer role over in his grave. The recording of Habanera is spiritless and bland - resembling no better music than New Age Elevator schlock. If you are an old avid collector of show tunes, you might enjoy this cd. If you are looking for great music, pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED TO HER VOICE!!!!!!!","review":"Listening to ENCHANTMENT was the first time I really listened to Charlotte Church since her Voice of an Angel Debut. And what a shock! That voice which could sing to the masses unamplified is gone. Now all we are left with is a weak teenage singer who still has problems with range and control. I guess the soothsayers were right and she did too much too fast and has just lost it. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Her A Retirement Plan","review":"As a contemporary of Charlotte's, I have been looking forward to seeing Charlotte rise to become one of the great Divas of the world. However, she has never been able to match her first album and with Enchantment we are going in reverse. Her voice is much weaker than it use to be and that was her biggest strength. So it looks like Charlotte is soon to rejoin the rest of us as just one of the girls. Hopefully, whoever is in charge of the money she has made has put aside most of it for a retirement plan. It appears that she is just about ready to start using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Not a Fan","review":"I did not listen to this CD as a Charlotte Church fan, but simply as a fan of many of the songs included in this compilation. Unfortunately, I did not find Miss Church's renditions pleasing as her voice is just too weak and unemotional to fit the role of vocalist for these songs which require a lot more than she appears able to muster.She has obviously had success with other musical genres and I would strongly recommend that she stay in those areas in the future. She simply is not suited to the Screen & Stage Songs that appear here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Enchanted!","review":"I was able to obtain a copy of this CD at my local library and thus was able to give it a thorough review. At the first time through for all of these songs, I was pleasantly surprised with what I was hearing. By the time I got my second listen to each one, I began to notice shortcomings in all of them. To make sure, I was able to obtain and listen to the originals of Bali Ha'i, Tonight, and Papa Can You Hear Me Now. I concluded that Charlotte doesn't have the strength in voice or emotional expression to give these songs the character needed for repeat playing. The songs themselves are delightful and the musical accompaniment is first rate. If you have never heard this songs before, you may find this CD to your liking, but the original versions are so much better, I would recommend you hold out until they can be obtained."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Irish Needed","review":"Charlotte has always done well with singing Irish Folk songs as is evidenced here with Carrickfergus. So, it is a mystery to me why she decided to go off on a tangent and try these show songs on this album. She needs to remember what she told the world and that is that she doesn't have a pop music voice. That is obvious after listening to almost all of the songs in this CD. She needs to feel her Irish blood and sing accordingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Better Direction","review":"As a long-time Charlotte fan, I have to agree that most of the songs in Enchantment just aren't her thing. I mean she just doesn't have that kind of a voice. So, the negative reviews were not unexpected. However, with the kind of voice that she does have, i think that she can in fact sing pop. However, she will need someone like Kate Bush, who at Charlotte's age, had a similar voice, to write the songs for her. Anyone can sing pop if you have the material to match your voice. But with Charlotte's voice, she definetly needs someone to write for her. Other peoples material just won't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Downer","review":"Charlotte sounds like she's losing her voice in Enchantment. Also, she must be losing her mind if she thinks that she can take her school-girl voice and sing classics like Tonight and Habanera. She sounds rediculous. This one belongs squarely in the middle of the trash recepticle. Don't think twice about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid is as stupid does...","review":"I visited the local music store to sample her work (will NOT purchase), and I agree completely with Music Fan from CT. Like all novelty acts, Church should stay in her homeland and perform \\"tribute\\" concerts covering the work of true artists. Better yet, she should go abroad to entertain the British soldiers serving as peacekeepers in Afghanistan, if they will have her. Then she should grow up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much too soon.","review":"I always fear for the future of musical child prodigies, especially those whose vocal gifts are taken advantage of with punishing numbers of concerts and premature recordings. Certainly, I was impressed by Miss Church as an eleven-year-old and hoped that, after an initial airing, her voice would be nurtured and held back to mature. Unfortunately, this was not to be, and just a few years later, no longer merely precocious, she runs the risk of being judged on her scanty merits. How sad it is to hear the strain in her young, thin voice as she reaches for notes she cannot dependably attain, much less sustain. The \\"glam\\" CD photo of this young lady says it all. In a sagging music industry, it offers unknowing consumers the \\"buy me\\" temptation of a pretty face and a fashionable mane of blond hair. Miss Church's CD was anything but an \\"enchantment.\\" Such a pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Brit who should keep her mouth shut!","review":"She stated in public that us Americans should get over September 11. I hope she can get over me not adding this to my shopping cart! I think we should take a step back, realise she is not all that great, and start buying American."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Out Of Her League","review":"Charlotte Church may be O.K. for school-girl plays and the like, but having her try and sing the material on Enchantment was a tragedy. She cannot even begin to come close to the original versions of Papa Can You Hear Me and Habanera which was written for a Mezzo. The only song which comes across as listenable is Carrickfergus. She should stay with songs in this genre if she expects to get anywhere near passing grades on her next album. This album is recommended only to those who would like to have a collection of songs from the low point in Charlotte's career."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOCKED!","review":"I was asked to review this CD by a friend, who wanted a 2nd opinion before authoring a negative review. There is not much I could say that hasn't already been said. Given the studio and the production which went into this album, I feel that I could have performed equally as well as Charlotte. She simply is not a high level professional singer. She is a school girl and sounds like it. Save your $ for better music. It simply couldn't have been any worse here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Performance Drop","review":"I had been a Charlotte fan for quite awhile. However after purchasing Enchantment on blind faith, I can no longer support the level to which Charlotte has fallen. As others have noted, her voice is extremely weak and no longer at a major league level. IMHO, the only genre which her voice can now support is Celtic Folk. Carrickferges is not bad. But that was the only piece on this CD worth commending. Until and unless, Charlotte is able to regain that performance level she once had, releasing albums like this is a waste of time and a disservice to those of us who expect improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur Hour","review":"This will be a limited review since I limited my listening of this album to those songs provided by Amazon on this site. The vocal qualities of this artist are very amateurish to say the least. I feel like I was listening to a little girl instead of a mature artist. There was neither the volume nor the range of an accomplished singer present here with Miss Church. The only song where she seemed somewhat competent on was Carrick Fergus, an Irish Ballad. Based on Miss Church's choir girl/boy voice, I believe Miss Church should stay in Church to do her singing and not make another attempt to venture into the recording studio until she matures considerably. If this is the best she can ever muster, then she should seriously consider a career change while she is still young and in school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why So Soon???","review":"After her previous album, Charlotte had indicated that she would not make another album for quite awhile. After listening, to Enchantment, I can see that she should have kept her word. She is having great vocal difficulty and this album is really an embarrassment. Hopefully Sony will give her a rest so that she can recuperate and mature. I know that she is capable of better, but she needs to be given the chance. Otherwise we will end with another Enchantment which is of no benefit to the music world. Charlotte needs to take a lesson from Mariah Carey. Burnout is possible at any age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is This The Real Charlotte??","review":"After having seen Charlotte on TV so many times the past 3 years, it was hard for me to believe that this was actually the same Welsh Soprano performing on this album. Either she was not in her best voice, or she has totally lost the brillance of her younger years. The voice I once heard which could sing to audiences unamplified now sounds like a beginner in a cocktail lounge. Its simply a so-so voice which works it way through some very ambitious songs with little or no emotion.I noticed some other reviewers complaining of the low ratings given this album. I had previously rated her Voice of An Angel CD with 5-stars. But this work is so far below her initial effort that anything higher than a 1-star review overstates the performance. I would hope that her next album returns to that level we all heard just a few years back. If not, she might consider taking a break from singing for awhile. Not an album to be proud of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Folk Folks!","review":"I must concur with the others who say that Charlotte is singing the wrong genres of songs here in Enchantment. She just isn't cut out for these \\"Hollywood\\" type songs. I feel that she should try the folk songs like the Irish and Welsh songs she has done is previous albums. I remember when Sarah Brightman first started recording back in 1985, she did her first album of all folk songs and it sounded great. Charlotte should do the same until such time as her voice matures to where it can take on more challenging genres. Everyone is entitled to one mistake. So let Enchantment be it and get back on track with what you're good at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite Enchanting","review":"As a Charlotte fan, I was expecting a little more out of Enchantment than I received. Charlotte doesn't demonstrate the strength and dynamics that have puncuated previous albums. Her voice seems flat most of the time and the only time I felt that I was hearing the old Charlotte was on Carrickfergus. I think she should go back to the classical music type songs where she did so well. The Broadway songs on Enchantment are just not her thing. I will be awaiting album #5 in hopes of writing a better review."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a Different Charlotte","review":"As a child, Charlotte Church was enchanting. However, as a young lady, she is incredibly ordinary. Whatever she had as a 12-year-old is no longer there. What we hear on this CD is no better than any 15-year-old with any singing experience could produce. Its kind of a shame that she has to continue through and finish a long contract with no more than a mediocre voice. However, Frankie Lymon went through the same experience. So, I will advise listeners to check out her first album when she really was enchanting. You will only be disappointed by spending any time with this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgive And Forget","review":"I am very dissappointed in this album by Charlotte. She ventured way outside her comparatively limited vocal range into areas for which she may never be qualified. The result was a CD full of otherwise classic show tunes which sound as if they were being sung by someone who was simply covering them as an exercise rather than having them recorded. Other than Carrickfergus, this entire CD was mediocre and pedestrian. Charlottes strength lies in her high-octave range songs like La Pastorella and Pie Jesu. To go into areas designed for a Mezzo is only inviting failure. I would strongly suggest some of Charlotte's earlier albums if you would like to hear anything worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opera Not Popera!!","review":"I cannot quite understand why someone who has always been known as an opera singer would foolishly attempt pop standards which demand the type of a voice which she does not possess. Charlotte's attempt at such songs as Habanera and Tonight end up with a tasteless breathy rendition which virtually anyone could accomplish. All of the rest are equally muted. And all of this is compounded by the inserting of vocal sensation Josh Groban in a duet of The Prayer. That only served to attenuate Charlotte's conspicuously weak voice. Charlotte Church was never born to be another Barbra Streisand. The sooner she comes to grips with that fact, the sooner she will make progress towards what may be her life's calling and that is on the opera stage; assuming her voice can regain the strength it once had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Try But Wrong Turn","review":"It was nice to see Charlotte try and break out of her choir-girl image by trying something new. But trying to sing the classic show songs that are in Enchantment was a bad idea. As many have noted, she doesn't have that mature range or control needed for those types of songs. The Irish folk song Carrickfergus comes across O K so maybe she should have stuck with those types of songs. But the rest of the songs just don't cut it for those with any type of musical taste. Some people have mentioned pop and that is probably a good idea. However she needs to do something quick as most people have a negative feeling from Enchantment. Possibly another album this Summer doing some pop covers would get her back on track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Out of Fifteen is Too Few","review":"The only songs which I found on this CD to be enjoyable at all were Carrickfergus, an Irish folk song, and The Prayer, which was a duet with Charlotte and Josh Groban, a young Baritone who has recently arrived on the U.S. scene. Unfortunately, the only part of the Prayer which I enjoyed was Groban's part. Charlotte's voice was so much weaker than Josh's that it was shocking that they would attempt to pair this duo. While many, I'm sure, will enjoy hearing Groban on this song, hearing his voice only makes Charlotte's seem so much more weak and pale by comparison. All of the other songs included here were once hits, but Charlotte's cover of them is a low quality rendition. Despite a couple of bright lights, this CD is shrouded in dullness and is not worth purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Passing","review":"I disagree with those who say that Charlotte Church has ruined the songs in this album. However, she comes close. The songs themselves are classics out of Hollywood's and Broadway's past.And it would make no difference what if any volume that Charlotte no longer has in her voice. The fact is that she never possessed the range, the emotion, or the vocal control to tackle anything like what is contained in Enchantment. If you have never heard any of the songs in this album, then you may enjoy Charlotte's renditions. They would fit nicely in a High School Assembly program, but they are a far cry from what the original writers had envisioned. I would recommend this CD to those who have never heard any of the selections previously, as an introduction to what the originals may provide."},{"rating":"1","title":"She doesn't have it.","review":"I also have been brought over from the Josh Groban board in hopes that Miss Church could produce something better than she did in that duet with Josh which is also on this CD. As it turns out, that duet is the best thing on this CD. I must agree with some other reviewers who note the lack of congruity between Josh Groban and Charlotte's voices. She is totally out of place when she is not within a choir. She does O.K. on the Irish Folk song Carrick Fergus, but with everything else, she is struggling to bring her child-like voice up to the level needed to sing these Broadway type tunes. 2001 was a bad year for the record industry, and the CD, Enchantment, is a good example why."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Very Surprised","review":"As a music school student here in Argentina, I was keenly interested in hearing Charlotte Church's CD as a guide to what level of performance would be required of me if I were to perform in the United States. I was surprised by her limited ability which seems no more competent than many of the students here in school. I expected a much stronger voice (based on what I have heard of her)and a greater vocal range. While the songs in her CD appeared very challenging, either she was not up to the challenge or what is acceptable in America is significantly less that what I had previously assumed. While this CD does not present a level to which I aspire, it now gives me great hope that I can also achieve a recording status in America and hopefully will be the subject of your reviews sometime in the near future after my graduation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Shameful Production","review":"The fact that this album must be given at least 1-star, should not be a sign that it is worth any more than -0- Should I have awarded that much, it would have been for the production; the instrumentation as well as the background vocals and the mixing. However, the vocalist on this CD appears no more qualified to sing the pieces herein as would any of 1000 choir girls from either school or church. Whatever made Columbia use a vocalist with such an incredibly weak voice for songs with such rich tradition is a mystery and a SHAME. I suppose there was something in her contract which allows her to choose whatever she wants to sing. However she is doing herself and the public a disservice by attempting works for which she is so far underqualified. She will leave an indelible black mark on her record for which people will never forget nor forgive her for. Hopefully, she will have another profession to fall back on, as singing should be no more than a hobby for this young lady."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for her voice.","review":"Don't get me wrong, I think Charlotte Church has an OKAY voice. I'm not going to type a full scale review, but here is what I think: She sings songs that are way too high for her mezzo-soprano voice type. Take the Laughing Song for instance. This song was meant for coloratura soprano, a person with a high soprano timbre, but Charlotte was sitting there singing it in a mezzo timbre, and at the end when she came to hit the high D's, they were airy and strained! If she keeps up this trend of singing way too high for her voice, she WILL ruin it, and the only concerts she'll be giving then are concerts in the shower!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK 4 School But Not 4 Sale","review":"As a senior in High School here in Tucson Arizona, I have been in choir for 4 years. After listening to this CD of Charlotte Church, I can see that it would be nice to have Charlotte in our choir, but her voice is not that good so that she should be making records YET. I have made a demo of my voice so that I can try and get a scholarship to a music conservatory. After listening to Enchantment, I feel Charlotte should use that CD to try the same. If anyone buys this CD, it will be in spite of Charlotte, not because of her. Maybe someday, she will have the voice which people will find worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"S. O. S.","review":"It had been a long time since I have heard any of these songs, and after hearing these cover versions by Miss Charlotte Church, I wish I had waited a little longer. Miss Church has nowhere near the vocal ability to try and sing these songs. She is weak is virtually every aspect of singing; strength, control, emotion and range. I would be interested in knowing whatever possessed the powers to be, to have Miss Church sing these songs. It has the effect to taking great songs and denigrating them with an incredibly weak rendition. Hopefully the record companies will take note of this and in the future be careful who they allow to sing these beautiful pieces. We are trusting them to Save Our Songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked","review":"I had never listened to Charlotte Church before this album, but had assumed that she was a teen age diva based on all of the publicity I had seen her get. Unfortunately, after listening to the CD, I must remove her from the category of Divas. She simply only sings with school-girl quality, which makes me wonder how she would ever draw a paid audience. Its nice to get publicity, but a person needs to back it up with a performance worthy of that publicity. The singing in Enchantment is pedestrian and not worthy of sale for money. I read some of the other reviews which appear to love this album. The only thing I can think of is that Charlotte is a witch and has enchanted all of them with a spell which will cause them to do anything; even write a 5-star review. Chalk this one up for the wastebasket and pray that Charlotte does not enchant you to buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Mr. Stearns.......","review":"I am really enjoying Ms. Church's latest album and I can't wait to hear her next work....I doubt Mr. Stearns will ever read this but, I was just wondering if he would like to recant.Enjoy eating your crow Mr. Stearns, because I think you will be eating it for a long time to come. ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting","review":"Up until now I wasn't into Charlotte Church's music. My mind immediately changed when I caught a glimpse of a commercial for her new album \\"Enchantment\\". I was \\"enchanted\\" to be exact when I heard her belting out \\"Flower Duet\\". The song is just exquisite and breathtaking. Her interpretations of \\"Tonight\\" and \\"Habanera\\" was absolutely stunning to say the very least. Normally I am not particularly crazy about opera music but Charlotte Church makes this often annoying genre of music more palatable. I think the one track that I didn't think was all that great but isn't too bad is her duet with Josh Groban \\"The Prayer\\". I don't know what it is but I didn't think it was very good. Maybe I need a little more time to let it grow on me. Overall I really did enjoy this album more than I thought I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enchanted??? - I Don't Think So","review":"It is difficult to get enchanted, even with classic songs, when they are sung by someone who doesn't have a classic voice. In fact, the voice of Charlotte Church is downright juvenile. This album should have been sung by Lara Fabian. Then you would have been able to have heard some real singing. Some of these song writers must be rolling over in their graves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed after listening to many of the selections from the Enchantment album. I had been told that Charlotte Church was an opera star, but I could not see that from what I heard here. She does not have the strength of voice to sing opera. The singing here is very ordinary and not worthy of the popular songs which she attempts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Hip - All Hype - No Hope","review":"Enchantment gets the award as the album which has absolutely nothing for anyone, no matter what their favorite type of music is. There is nothing here for the classical/opera music buff and Miss church has seen fit to abandon those genres. There is nothing here for the ballad lovers and she has taken it upon herself to butcher these beloved songs from show and stage with a weak anemic voice that makes one wonder if she needs a transfusion. And the religious fans are also left out in the cold without a \\"prayer\\" save for Josh Groban appearing and attempting to rescue this futile attempt at vocalization with his portion of \\"The Prayer\\". Nice try but it doesn't help enough. A total -0- of an album"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Going Through The Motions","review":"Enchantment has some good songs in it, and I believe that Charlotte could have done better with her vocals, but it sounds as if she simply did one take of the song and walked off. The first take is usually a dry run just to see if everything meshes. However it is never used as the recorded version. But here it sounds as if Charlotte is just going through the motions with nothing more at stake than the dry run. This may be why so many others have commented that she seems devoid of emotion. If she is going to sing songs like the ones in Enchantment, she is going to have to get very serious about them and give the listener the impression that she really feels the songs and is conveying its meaning to them. I expected better from Charlotte and hopefully her next album will be that."},{"rating":"1","title":"She Just Doesn't Have The Voice","review":"I have heard most of the songs from \\"Enchantment\\" before and Charlotte's rendering of them simply doesn't do it for me. Possibly at a later time in her life when she has matured but certainly not now. There just isn't enough voice there."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOLY SMOKES!!","review":"I own all of Ms. Church's previous CDs, but this one is by far the best! Actually, as I am writing this, i'm listening to \\"Carrickfegus\\". It's beautifully arranged! It always gets me in a good mood! Well done on this track! Other highlights (and my personal favorites are):\\"Tonight\\" from \\"West Side Story\\"\\"Carrickfergus\\"\\"A Bit of Earth\\" from \\"The Secret Garden\\"\\"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\\" from \\"Show Boat\\"\\"The Prayer (with Josh Gorban)\\"This CD is so beautiful. I couldn't have said it better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Written for Older Singers","review":"For a girl of 15, Charlotte Church does a reasonably good job on these show songs on Enchantment. However, these songs were written for mature adult singers; thus Charlotte's very young sounding voice is conspicuously weak on most of the tunes. She seems to be O.K. on \\"Carrickfergus\\", a Celtic ballad, but then on \\"The Water is Wide\\", another Celtic ballad, she again sounds very weak and clearly inferior to the version done live on the Lilith Fair CD by Sarah McLachlan, Jewel, and the Indigo Girls.Charlotte is not ready to sing the songs on Enchantment yet and needs to focus on those songs her voice is NOW ready to accomodate. I do not recommend this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Gross Mismatch","review":"I decided to listen to this album because of the extraordinary compilation of songs from some of the golden years of Hollywood. I assumed that these songs could not be screwed up. I was wrong.Why they picked a girl who is emotionless, with little vocal strength or range to tackle these classics will most likely be a mystery of the age. Charlotte does OK with Carrickferges, which is suppose to be sung by a man, but the rest seem nothing more than a High School rendition. I'm not sure how often a compilation of songs of this level will be allowed to be sung by a single artist. However, when they are, they need to be given the treatment only a seasoned professional can provide; not the weak voice of a choir girl. This album has been ruined and should not be purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curious mix","review":"This album is a curious mix of music. I do find that Charlotte Church is much more pleasing to listen to than other pop Divas. I like the boy soprano quality from some of her previous works, and the traditional and Celtic folk music she performs can be quite charming. However, I feel that all works performed from Operas need to be executed with a reasonable amount of technical skill in order to show the respect that all great classical music written by master composers deserves. This recording can spark interest in classical music, but it does not do it justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Hollywood and More Holywood","review":"I had enjoyed many of Charlotte Church's renditions of some of Chistianity's favorite hymns, despite the fact that she needed a lot of improvement vocally. Unfortunately Charlotte leaves the realm where she had delighted so many and ventures into Hollywood Show type music where she is like a fish out of water. Others have noted the particulars of her shortcomings here in Enchantment so I shall not repeat. However, she has limits within which she must stay in order to be viable as a recording artist. Charlotte, take my advice and leave Hollywood until you grow up. Stay with what brought you here. Never change a winning combination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of Confidence","review":"There was something conspicuously absent from this CD which was present in many of the original versions of the songs sung here. To me, its best described as confidence which manifests itself as emotion in these very sensitive and delicate songs. Charlotte seems to be singing as if she is scared of something. Possibly she knew that she was quite a few years away from the age when she would have the mature vocal qualities necessary to do justice to these songs which rate among some of the best ever to be sung on screen and stage. This could be a preview of coming attractions some years down the road or, as one reviewer put it, just a Novelty Act."},{"rating":"1","title":"No enchantment","review":"There's no enchantment here. The shaky tone of Charlotte Church just indicates that she's running into vocal difficulties. As a result, she has to concentrate on trying to reach the notes instead of giving expression to the music. Her interpretations are thus failures. Besides some light Christmas carols, I don't think her voice and her technique are suitable to any other thing at this stage. She should really be careful of her own development. Otherwise, she will have to bear the risk to losing her voice soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kid Stuff","review":"After listening to what was provided of this CD by Amazon, I had a difficult time determining which rating to give it. If you were to compare it to todays divas, it is certainly only 1-star stuff. If you would go up against many of the unsigned singers roaming around local clubs, it might be a 3-star rating and if you were to compare it to school-girl performances, you might want to give Charlotte 5-stars. However since Amazon is asking you to pay the same price as if you were getting the CD of a diva, then it is that comparison which must guide my ratings. There are certain vocal elements which almost always come with age. There are exceptions suchs as Judy Garland, but Charlotte does not fall into that category. Possibly in 10 years, you may want to revisit some of Charlotte's music if she is still singing. However, Right now, this is still kid stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"She is Much Too Young","review":"Charlotte Church may have some potential in a decade or so to do some serious song selections, like those included in this album, but right now she is much too young. She does fine for her age, but I expected far more on a Columbia Album. One of the biggest mistakes she makes is to do a duet with Josh Groban, an up and coming American baritone. Groban whose voice seems beyond his years (20) appears decades apart from Charlotte when the two combine for The Prayer. Why in gods name the producers would choose to make her juvenile voice so conspicuous by combining it with Groban's is a mystery. They should have combined it with an inferior singer much like they do when they have her do a duet on Pie Jesu. The only thing which was accomplished on this CD was to promote Groban and his new CD which will undoubtedly surpass anything Charlotte has done to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Little - Too Late","review":"After listening to this entire album, it seemed to me that the producers were trying to find something that would please everyone. They tried Hollywood, and Broadway, and even Ireland. However, it wasn't until the albums final cut, \\"The Prayer\\" when they got my ear. Unfortunately, it wasn't the CDs featured singer, Charlotte Church that did it, but Josh Groban, a personality from the Ally McBeal Show. Groban has a voice which should be world renown within this year. Unfortunately, his voice is so good that it makes Charlotte's voice pale by comparison. And possibly Charlotte's voice really is the problem here. In any case, a single Groban cut was not enough to entice me to buy this album, but I will certainly give his CD a good listen. One song does not an album make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke?","review":"Is this a CD or a con game? This girl can NOT sing these kinds of songs. She used to be cute and could get away with a wispy, wimpy voice. But she's growing up and trying to sing grown-up songs. No way. She rarely is in tune. There's no feeling to her singing ... she's just being programmed by some people who are looking for a fast buck.If you really want a great classical voice, you will NOT get it here. What you will get is Ed Sullivan material minus Topo Gigio. Save your ears ... and money. You will do a LOT better elsewhere if you don't support this English mirage."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Longer Remarkable","review":"I'm sure other have said this same thing, but after listening to Charlotte's lastest album, Enchantment, she is no longer that remarkable 12-year-old, but just another 15-year-old who sings. Her efforts on this album are O.K., but nothing more than probably hundreds of girls her age could have accomplished. As many have pointed out, her duet with Josh Groban demonstrates just how normal her voice is as Groban exhibits what is an exceptional voice. In fact, its difficult to even call \\"The Prayer\\" a duet. If Charlotte means to go on singing, she needs to find good original material for which a voice like hers will suffice. Her voice is no longer able to carry an album by itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlotte - Avoid Pop","review":"There has been a buzz around town that Charlotte Church was breaking out of her Angel image and was ready to follow in the footsteps of her stable-mate Christina Aguilara. Well, if Enchantment is any example of her pop potential, she needs to reconsider that type of a move. She needs to have more volume and energy that what is demonstrated in this CD. The energy which she once demonstrated in her early work is conspicuously missing and all we hear are some breathy renditions of some songs from the movies. Its not surprising she has received so many negative reviews. They are well deserved. Unless someone can create some new type of pop for her, she needs to retreat back from where she came until she can generate the strength to give us more than just some Enchantment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breathy","review":"In the 4 or 5 times I have heard Charlotte Church sing, what always stood out from the time she was 12 was the clarity of tone in her voice. After listening to Enchantment, however, I have become painfully conscious of a breathiness in her voice. This type of malady would be consistent with someone losing their voice. Much like with Mariah Carey, Charlotte appears to be vocally stressed here. Its unfortunate, since she has selected some excellent songs to cover. I wish she would have sung these songs at age 12 instead of now. The quality here is unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"No imagination here.","review":"Charlotte's voice is only so-so and not good enough to justify spending any money on these covers of pop and celtic classics. There is no unexpected choice in this entire album and that goes not just for the songs selected, but for Charlotte's phrasing as well. It sounds like a technical practice session with her voice teacher. Most embarrasing is her operatic version of \\"Tonight\\". Its as bad a cover of a great song as I've ever heard. It reminds me of the old Ed Sullivan program where he'd have an opera singer come on and sing a current pop/easy-listening favorite just so the singer can appear to be a \\"regular person\\". Not recommended to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Law of Supply and Demand","review":"After listening to Charlotte Church's Album, Enchantment, I began to wonder why anyone would pay money to listen to such inferior singing. And then the answer came to me. There simply isn't anything else out there like this, so the people have no choice if they want to listen to these types of songs freshly sung. Its the good ol law of supply and demand. The record companies, thus determine what we are given to listen to. I will recommend this album only to those desparate and starving for the type of songs in Enchantment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A victim of Puberty???","review":"I'm not sure what happened to Charlotte from the time she was 12 until now, but she is not the same singer she once was. Maybe she was only good for a few years of \\"opera-type\\" singing. Whatever the reason, Enchantment provides the listener with nothing novel; merely weak renditions of some well-known show tunes. Fortunately there are tapes and CDs from her earlier years where she was worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its Been a Long Slide","review":"When I heard Charlotte's first album, \\"Voice of an Angel\\", I had expected her to be the consumate Diva by the time she was 18. However, her latest CD, Enchantment seems to have continued a downward slide where her albums are getting worse instead of better. As other have noted on this album, she does not have the strength or volume in her voice that she use to. If Charlotte is to continuing singing, then she will need someone who can write music for her so that the songs are equal to what her voice is. Otherwise, if she still trys to sing classic songs like which are in Enchantment without a voice to match, she will only continue to disappoint her fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Told You So","review":"Listening to Enchantment reminds me of all of the discussions about Charlotte, when each and every vocal teacher stated that if she kept wobbling her lower jaw to induce false vibratto, she would ruin her voice. Well, its obvious from this CD that the predicted result has taken place. Charlotte's rendering of the Broadway type show tunes is extremely amateurish and makes one wonder why Columbia wasted it resources if the best she can do is a choir-girl type performance. I don't know whether it is too late or not for Charlotte to salvage her voice and her career, but my best advice is stop singing and give your voice a rest, because you are not providing the musical world with anything worthwhile with the singing found in Enchantment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lost Soul","review":"I have read some of the other recent reviews which indicate that Miss Church has not lost her voice. However, a review of the selections from Enchantment along with that recent article in GQ Magazine serve to belie that disclaimer. The fears of many that she would lose her voice if she continued to abuse it have obviously come true. That volume she once had where she could sing, without the benefit of amplication, to the multitudes have gone. Its not that her pale soprano voice is bad, its just that it cannot be distinguished from 1000 other girls her age here in my home state of Texas. She will have to be far more selective in her song selection in the future and not attempt to venture in territory reserved for those Divas, which at one time we thought would include her. The songs of Enchantment were not meant to be sung by a choir girl. And accordingly, the result is something far short of what the writers of these timeless pieces had envisioned.Samantha"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Ending","review":"As an International Reviewer, it was very diffiuclt for me to listen to this CD after hearing Charlotte's first album and giving her glowing reviews. Charlotte has been losing her voice for quite some time, so it was with great surprise that I see her attempting material which would have been more than a challenge for her at her best. The result here is predictable; a very weak rendition of some of America's favorite classics. She does attempt to go to more of her traditional material in Carrickfergus. However, even there, she has to rely on electronic manipulation (ala Britney Spears)to make the song sound viable. One is better served by listening to My Lagan Love, from which Carrickfergus may be a derivative, from her first album, where it is definetly her unaltered voice. That is the work which she undoubtedly will become known for when she is only a memory, a time-frame which is not too far off."},{"rating":"1","title":"No enchantment","review":"This album is not enchanting at all. As others have observed, Miss Church's voice has failed to mature at all, and his singing lacks emotion as well as vocal finesse. How can one derive any enjoyment if she can't even properly sing the notes?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Place","review":"I have only heard Charlotte Church a few times on TV before listening to this CD. However it is obvious she is out of place with this type of music. I must agree with the other reviews which suggest she stay with Xmas Carols and the like. She has a choir girls voice which cannot possibly sing Show Songs like they have in this album. Hopefully, these reviews will help her return to what she does best for her next album. She is totally Out of Place in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stagnation","review":"Being the same age as Charlotte, I was anxious to watch her progress as a singer with hopes of seeing her as a major attraction some day. However, some 3 years from when I first saw her, it appears that I am seeing the same person; at least vocally. She has no more range at 15 than she did at 12 and all of her singing faults are still there. Enchantment is a good example of a child prodigy at rest. Not only is she still at where she has been for her entire career, but she demonstrates an unusual lack of emotion in this album. This is very unfortunate as the songs in this album are great ones and should have had her at her best to sing them. In conclusion, If Charlotte would put as much time and energy into improving her voice as she does criticizing the United States and everyone in it, she would be a lot more effective singer as well as a much more liked person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Genre's","review":"I was referred over here from the Josh Groban page and have just listened to what was provided by ... . I really couldn't get into Charlotte Church's singing because she attempted to sing in too many genres. She sounds O.K. singing Carrick Fergus, an Irish Folk Ballad, but she then tries various classical and show tunes for which she doesn't seem suited right now. I guess she gave it a try but if falls far short of what you might expect with material like this. Her duet with Groban is a good showcase for Groban, but she sounds overwhelmed by a far superior and more mature voice. She should stick with Irish folk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enchanting Songs - Impuissant Singing","review":"There are some beautiful songs in this album, but the vocalist selected simply doesn't have what it takes to sing them. Other than Carrick Fergus, an Irish Folk Song, I simply couldn't get into any of these songs with Miss Church's singing. Its a shame because you don't often see an array of songs like these out of Show Business's finest hours. Hopefully time will cure Miss Church's singing ills. But for now she should look towards the Irish Folk music where she seems to be confortable and her weak voice are not such a burden."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH!!!!!!!!!","review":"This will be a limited review as I could only listen to about half the songs on this CD before I began to get ill. At our talent show in High School, we've had better singers than Charlotte. O.K. so maybe her voice is changing because of puberty. But does that mean we have to accept it just because she was once better. I think not. For one thing she doesn't have the range for a Habanera. She simply cannot hit the low notes. On Bali Ha'i, she demonstrates that she cannot generate any volume at lower octaves providing for a very uneven rendition of that one. Charlotte may have some promise somewhere, but it is not in the selections which I reviewed.A voice on the way down (and most probably out) should not attempt songs, which most likely, were always outside her reach, even in her better days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get this girl some REAL voice lessons...","review":"This album is anything BUT 'enchanting'. The only good song on this entire CD is \\"The Prayer\\" and it's only saved by the amazing Josh Groban, who knows what he's doing with his voice.I admit I was amazed when Charlotte first came out with \\"Voice of an Angel\\" only because 13-year-olds usually do not have that type of range. I was also anticipating what was to come as her voice developped. Now that she's older, she trying to sound like she's a 30-year-old opera singer, which she is definately not. She sings from the very back of her throat instead of her diaphram so there is a definate lack of support and her vibrato is so forced it makes me gag.Charlotte's version of \\"Can't Help Lovin' That Man\\" was probably the final blow before I had to rip this CD from my CD player.Save your money and if you want an amazing classical singer, go for Renee Flemming or Sumi Jo. If you want popera, go with Josh Groban."},{"rating":"1","title":"ENCHANTING?? Well....... Yeah","review":"Enchantment seemed to be a pretty good title for this CD as many of these songs represented some enchanting moments in the history of Film Making. Bali Hi from South Pacific and Papa Can You Hear Me Now from Yentil are just a few. But Charlotte's voice simply does not recapture those moments. I think another reviewer mentioned that the fact that many of these songs came during very emotional moments in the films; and Charlotte just doesn't seem to be able to generate much in the way of emotion in her singing. I see some potential here with Charlotte, but unless she develops the ability to bring emotion into her singing, her songs will never be enchanting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Losing Battle","review":"I was drawn over here from the Kathleen Battle pages, and had hoped to hear one of musicdoms newest prodigies strut through her paces. However, what I heard was someone who apparently has remained in stasis since she came on the scene 3 or 4 years ago. It simply sounded like a child attempting to sing adult songs. For a small child, it was O.K., but on an adult scale, it was not satisfactory. Possibly Charlotte can be 12 forever, but if she is trying to reach an adult level of competency, she is losing the battle. Not up to traditional standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Maybe I was expecting too much from a 16-year-old, but this CD certainly doesn't deliver what Charlotte Church had the reputation for and that was a dynamic driving voice that could pierce the night unamplified. What I heard on Enchantment was a mediocre school-girl voice which seemed out of place on a Columbia album. I have heard rumors to the effect that she has lost her voice and listening to Enchantment does nothing to dispell those rumors. If she can't improve on her next album, she should seriously consider retiring from singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I have Charlotte's three other CDs, and I enjoy her work.But this is NOT her best effort. It has its moments, like Carrickfergus, a Celtic song which seems to fit Charlotte's talents well. But in general, it seems these are the songs that Sony wants Charlotte to sing, not those she would choose herself. And it shows ... her heart doesn't seem to be in them, as it was on the earlier CDs. My advice is, if you want to hear Charlotte at her best, get her Christmas CD (Dream a Dream) from last year. Skip this one. (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh!","review":"I have to agree with some other reviews on this one. I do NOT see what all the hype is about Charlotte or why she is taken so seriously as a singer. She's just a girl who has a nice voice, but it definitely needs to grow before she attempts to perform many of these pieces. She's not all that great, is often times flat, and I just don't understand why she's so \\"famous\\" or why she's been so heavily marketed as this \\"wonderful singer\\" she's claimed to be. She should wait about 10 years and then try again perhaps. Please, but a Renee Fleming album instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn good!","review":"Some poor song selections (Habanera, From My First Moment, Can't Help Lovin Dat Man, and Somewhere) keep me from giving this cd five stars. The aforementioned songs don't vary enough in tone and range to fully utilize Charlotte's voice. The rest of the songs on this cd make it well worth the purchase. Stand out tunes include The Flower Duet, The Water Is Wide, A Bit of Earth, The Prayer, and, best of all, Carrickfergus. I could listen to that one over and over. This is my fourth Charlotte Church cd, and as with the other three, I'm still impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlotte Churches's Enchantment","review":"Charlotte Church only gets better in this very versatile CD. In this most recent release this young lady shows that she can clearly compete in a number of different venues. I believe \\"Enchantment\\" is her best to date. I eagerly await further releases from this very talented teenager with an amazingly beautiful voice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CHARMING!","review":"I can't understand why there are people still slaming this sensational young artist.She sounds awesome!Opera potential is evident here.From \\"Tonight\\" to \\"Habenara\\" Charlotte proves she is growing musically.As the Beatles would say, \\"Let It Be.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"Definitely not one of Ms Church's better works. The choice of songs is uninspired, pitching her thin adolescent voice against some of the best who have done the same songs before (Tonight, Secret Garden's A Bit of Earth, The Prayer, Yentl's Papa Can you hear me) and coming out very disappointingly.If you haven't bought the album yet, don't!There wasn't one song on the album that I liked - and this is from someone who religiously bought her previous albums and DVDs"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enchanting? - In Part","review":"The songs in \\"Enchantment\\" are certainly so, however, the singing does not remind me of the originals. Charlotte needs to stay with songs more in line with her voice. She should stay away from Hollywood and closer to Ireland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Change Course - Please!!!","review":"There is an old saying that \\"If It Works, Don't Try To Fix It\\". Unfortunately, Charlotte strayed from what worked for her with her first 3 CDs and tried songs really not suited to her in Enchantment. She needs to either go back to those successful light classical/traditional folk/religious songs she has been doing or go to some Joni Mitchell type pop. The Enchantment songs are just not her thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting if you like Maynard","review":"The story is nothing new: Some guy goes to investigate an old death/murder in a strange town and the local helping him turns out to be the killer who then kills the guy as he solves the mystery. Brad Wilk does a good job, but Maynard James Keenan, singer for Tool and A Perfect Circle, is simply amazing. His talents seemingly know no bounds. You probably wouldn't even recognize him if you didn't know it was him. Not because of makeup or anything, but because of the earnestness with which he plays his character and because he plays a character that is so antithetical to the life and body of work of the artist playing him. Think about it: Maynard the deputy sheriff.The best part for fans of Maynard may be the outtakes and behind the scenes footage that provide a glimpse into the private personality behind the eccentric stage persona we've come to know. The behind the scenes footage introduces us to a down-to-earth Maynard with a great sense of humor and of himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid movie","review":"I read the other reviews and thought to myself \\"How bad could it be?\\" Well it is pretty stupid.

Up to her ears in debt, she takes a job as a waitress and is humiliated when her chief rival Vanessa's learns her secret and threatens to tell her boyfriend. Since his father is a wealthy politician, she fears that news of this will send her to social Siberia, and decides that two can play that game, and sets about stealing Vanessa's fiance. It's election year and Deans father thinks that he should find a more appropriate mate, but Dean thinks its just a lie, but soon finds himself alone since neither he nor Jane bothers to communicate (and he's a lawyer??).Sound juvenile? It is. And so is the writing. Between the constant designer labels mentioned, Jane's lack of maturity, and her inability to resist an overpriced pair of shoes, the story is just meaningless and trite. Even the love scenes are stale and unimaginative. Just goes to show you can't judge a book by a two sentence blurb."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"HARD!!!\\"","review":"All I'm gonna say is DO NOT SLEEP ON PISTOL!!! This is hard, but his follow-up, BALLAHOLIC is uncut dope!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For the locals only","review":"The problem with this book, and most of the others in this series, is that there is no overarching narrative to hold it together. When was Livingston founded? What prompted its growth? What differentiates it from the surrounding towns? So much of this information is left out. You don't even find out which of the famous colonial Livingstons the place was named after until 2/3rds the way through the book! The second-half of the 20th century section looks like a combination of people's photo albums. Why photos of the police chief or head librarian? I'm not saying they weren't important people but why are they spotligthed over others?Having said all that, there are some photos that illustrate the historic elements--the few existing--that make one realize how far back the place goes. One can seek out those structures that have endured time. But even then, there is no context to put them in. I suspect that residents of the place might find the book interesting, but not many others."},{"rating":"1","title":"parental advisory","review":"I bought this for my 8 year old daughter, assuming that because it was geared towards kids, it would be appropriate.

I read it about 5 years ago and it really did make a huge change in my life. Starting in middle school I became obsessed with dieting and compulsive eating even though I was not fat. I tortured myself by obsessing over my weight, and how many caleries I ate for years to the point that I forgot how to have fun. This book woke me up, and it made me realize that my favorite color IS red (you'll have to read it). Anyway, no matter your size, if you are constantly concerned with food, dieting, weight and so on, READ THIS. I can't even remember all of what is said, but that I was a different person after I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, dependable, muscular drilling and driving.","review":"Don't bother with the nervous-seeming Black & Decker or Skil 3/8\\" corded drills.

Simon and Schuster themselves refer to the the challenge of the little girl as having to deal with \\"animals and Indians too\\" all in the same breath.

It's bad enough that the sticker price is so high. The author manages to perfectly obfuscate the most simple topics that were already covered in a normal higher level calc course to the point that I wondered if it was even talking about the same topic.

Each of her main characters have some sort of hidden anger, which have underlying themes of sex obsession. \\"Because they wanted to\\" seems to be some strange, creative release to Gaitskill, telling so intricately about everyday accounts, or rather of harsh 'subburban cruelties' that one would not think to find worth reading in a story, much less a book of stories. Gaitskill uses too many extraordinary words that throw off the rhythem of normal, everyday language she gives to her characters. This book is not worth anybody's time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No power, no message","review":"This book was recommended by my writing professor. To me, her stories seem so shallow that I do not feel her authority and power. They are merely entertainment that you read before you go bed and not for readers to think.Another thing is, praising this type of writer makes American literature dull. No wonder many people today in the US do not read. So many books are just as boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Because she deflated us","review":"All I know is that I attended a reading Gaitskill gave from this book in Philadelphia on Valentine's Day, 1997 (I believe her selection was from the title story) and watched her manage to bore an audience of initially appreciative listeners to near-catatonia. It's amusing in retrospect, as Gaitskill happens to be a very attractive woman, dressed that evening in a provocative outfit with fake-leopard-skin gloves, and sexual tension was palpable in the hall as she began to read...and read...and read...The story just wouldn't stop, went here, went there, shapeless and endless and seemingly pointless...and she didn't even read the whole thing. Seriously, you could sense the air leaking from the room, the interest draining from brains, the blood departing from, well, never mind where. It was either a brilliant display of literary blueballing or the most fumbled public event I've ever witnessed. Either way, I've been afraid to pick this book up ever since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eng 255 Wierd Stories","review":"Gaitskill creates stories which baffle the reader. The first seven stories are about failiures who fail. Her characters start at the bottom and end up still at the bottom. In BTWT the character seemed to be improving her situation with a new job, I expected her to succeed but she didn't. In the end everyone's abandoned. All the stories end on a sour note. The characters seem to end up a little worse than they were. I think Gaitskill is trying to give us a view into the life of her disturbed and depressed characters. I didn't like her unrealistic portrayal of the characters and the endings were depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Because I wasn't sure...","review":"Most of the stories in this book were some what annoying, in a way that they didn't really draw any conclusions.(Was she fresh out of ideas?) They basically dropped the reader. The last story was alright though. It didn't really state a conclusion, but there was more substance for the reader to understand.Her usage of colorful eccentric words, althought suitable for the atmosphere, conflicts with the rough, downplayed dialog,making it a little irritating to read. If you don't have to read this book...don't read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking the other way","review":"The author seems to have a problem with the other side of today's society. She likes to add the issues that makes everyone look the other way. She also adds thoughts and ideas to the characters and in her stories that makes the reader think \\"what does this have to do with anything.\\" This book might be appropriate for the proud western society citizen or the devout catholic. If you like a lot of controversy in your stories with a touch of morbid thoughts then by all means read this book. This book, has some good stories with some good plots, but ther rest just destroys it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Timmid","review":"\\"Because They Wanted To\\", a short story collection written by Mary Gatskill, is not a book that I would reccomend to those who are shy or timmid in nature. A vast majority of her stories include scenes of profanity and profound sexuality that I found to be inappropriate and of bad taste. Although some of her stories had deeper meanings than just what was siting on the surface, one has to look pretty deep in order to find it. I feel that the true intent and message in her stories were hidden amongst all of the sex and chaos. I would only reccomend this book to those who are comfortable with material that is not very conventional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"If you like stories that end \\"happily ever after\\" this novel is not for you. Mary Gaitskill leaves her readers with too many open endings and stories that really have no point. Readers should be aware of all the dark and strange issues she covers in her novel, from slight pornography to constant charcters that are bisexual and or lesbian. Overall, don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Wild Ride","review":"Gaitskill takes the reader from the most perverse sexual fantasies to the pressures and problems associated with family life. This collection of short stories drags the reader, however, through a muck of sex, drugs, and profanity leaving the reader with an unsanitary feeling. She surfaces ideas and mental images into ones mind that ought to stay buried. I felt that nothing was benefitted from reading this book. A majority of the book I spent cringing my nose at the grotesque images and ideas that Gaitskill presents. This book was definetely a wild ride that I would not venture to take again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Light, Star Bright, The Only Star I Give Tonight...","review":"I give only one star because of Gaitskill's inate obssession with sex, homosexuality, psychos, dead-beats, and therapists. If you read one story you've read them all.Let's take sex and homosexuality. From a girl giving oral sex to a guy for $20 to a man who joins a gang bang on a girl at a bar, almost every story revovles around sex. 'The Girl On The Plane' has a man talking to a complete stranger about a poor girl who he gang banged. Along with the sex, all the women are lesbian/bi-sexuals. A mention, once or twice would be fine, but too much takes away from any meaning. In the last few stories about the middle aged, bi-sexual, friendless, Susan who has sexual relationship with a woman, there is no real point about going on and on about her trek that doesn't have a strong meaning. Every page is flooded with her pointless endeavours to have a normal relationship with her partner. There more to write about than just sex/homosexuality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent writing style, but with an ugly undercurrent","review":"Each time I read Gaitskill, I expect to like her better. The writing is so fine, but the underlying message and world view is simply ugly, barren and void of any depth or complexity."},{"rating":"1","title":"green light...yellow light...red light","review":"Gaitskill brings up controversial topics that are sensitive to the average person. She gets into details and paints a good picture for you to imagine but her style is like a stoplight: she gets the reader into the story, slows it down with the meticulous detail, then stops them with the controversial dialogue that doesn't fit in right with the mood of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"style not substance","review":"I'm not a big fan of this style of writing so this must be takenfrom that perspective. I wouldn't have read this book if it wasn't assigned by my teacher. The writing seems overly stylized. This book is basically full of metaphors. Thoughts are expressed metaphorically when they could have been stated more simply and matter of fact. Do people really think this way? I don't but I'm not so self absorbed in my feelings and thoughts. Some of her male characters have thoughts and perceptions that don't seem realistic. They are more a woman's idea of what a man might think or do. It's as if she projects what she wants men to do or say into her characters. The characters are interesting though. This would be a good read for people who are into this style of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"because i need to...","review":"Mary Gaitskill's short stories are of a dark nature. She writes about subjects which most tend to shy away from. The shorts stories give a very vivid tale but to me is distracted by shocking outbursts and out of charater dialogue. It's not my idea of great reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Because I had to","review":"forced to read this book, nothing ever seemed realistic in any of the stories. many ended without a decent conclusion, granted, great writers can do this, this author lacked style. It was like she didn't know how to conclude the story so she stopped, hoping readers will think it was done on purpose. the verbal exchanges between characters were unrealistic, especially between man and woman. it was like women talkin too each other but the author called one a male. This book almost makes \\"The Watchers of Waipuna,\\" a great novel. the one good thing about this book, it helps to start the grill at the beach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darkness in a modern view","review":"The author has a tight grip on what feelings that many people would consider as disturbing. She adds these ideas in this book causing the stories to drip in horror and disgust. Her stories are somewhat odd because she puts a lot of controversial items in it. She makes her characters so realistic, so realistic that it may be true but no one wants to admit to these thoughts. She passes the lines of normacy and lets the reader know that darkness does reside people like us. I think this book is bad because of the contents and how she portrays it. It could be better, but she downplays her characters with disturbing thoughts and ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Boring Boring","review":"This is not the best collection I've ever read. I felt as though I was reading some bi-sexual romance novel. The author's attempt at being controversial gets old within the first five minute of reading. There are some interesting emotional and psychological issues dealt with, however the weak ending of each story made me lose interest in the book as a whole. I'd recommend this book highly to insomniacs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Because it has a pretty cover.","review":"I basically agree with everyone's criticism. Gaitskill harps on a point till you want to say, \\"Shut up already! No one CARES.\\" Which I'm sure is counterproductive to her artistic crusade. I typically don't mind authors breaking from the beginning-middle-end formula if they do it well, or at least intend to do it well. If they fail miserably, then they deserve to be panned. Gaitskill fails miserably. It's like she didn't even care for her stories by the time she got to the end of them. She could have written one novella with all these crappy stories and still come out behind, but should could have saved a little face that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking piece of work!","review":"Having read Bad Behavior, I couldn't wait to get my hands on Mary Gaitskill's newest collection of short stories. Because They Wanted To is everything I'd expected. The stories are beautiful and lyrical in a profound way. My favorite ones are \\"Orchid,\\" \\"Because They Wanted To,\\" \\"Comfort,\\" and \\"Turgor.\\" However, \\"The Girl on the Plane\\" is the one that spoke to me the most. The story of how a married man stumbles upon the woman he'd raped years ago was food for thought. I was duly impressed with Gaitskill's disarmingly perceptive takes on male and female relationships in Bad Behavior, and she has outdone herself with this effort. The characterization and story development are second to none in this book. Are you in the bargain for thought-provoking stories? I suggest you pick up this wonderful piece of modern literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a rival to Bad Behavior","review":"I thought I'd try this one after reading Bad Behavior and another short story of the author's in The New Yorker's love story anthology, and I was sadly disappointed. The stories here did not seem very real to me, the third person style in most of them was unexciting. I liked Turgor best. I thought the last paragraph in the title story was unnecessary. I am at a loss trying to rationalize the type of movie they decided to see in The Dentist, and why they didn't end up in bed after viewing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice dyes","review":"wash your hair with clarifying shampoo, do not condition then comb through and let dry until it's just damp.

Alas, I found that the art was off-putting, the characters unengaging, and the story a big, bizarre mess.

I would not recommend this series to anyone, save your money for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great letdown","review":"I was greatly dissapointed in the novel.

I guess Dad thought I would end up the same way, but I didn't.That is why I always associate this CD with Christmas. Lots ofpeople get music for Christmas and make that connection.As for the CD, it is not a great live album. Yes, the band sometimes sounds like they just woke up, Dave's voice is OK thenbad then OK, but it was over a period of 3 nights. But this CDis like a brick in the wall of my life, I gotta play it duringthe holidays.The picture of Dave on the cover will scare the hell out of you!Taken in 1974, this was his walking corpse on cocaine phase.So it turns out I have a very rare CD, cool!

We are plunged into the very place where all of his personas, ideas, feelings and musical energy come from. Listening to it is like writing a song through Bowies eyes, we see what he sees, we feel what he feels.The danger with this album is that, after listening to it, there is literally nowhere else to go musically.

You will hate yourself if you do.1 star is the lowest rating possible, this movie doesn't even deserve that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost awful","review":"This movie is very bad, infact nearly awful. Yes the chimp does do somethings like make cereal on his own, however he isnt in any of the hockey scenes. All of the hockey scenes are edited and have a pee-wee hockey player doing all of the chimps moves and shots. The characters are just as bad as the chimps skating, and were often laughable. On point sticks out is when the main character puts his 10 year old deaf sister in a junior hockey game (with 20 year olds) so the he can help the monkey escape the evil college. Stay away from MVP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go to the circus if you'd like to laugh at majestic animals.","review":"A silly little wobble of a film. I don't find these type of films enjoyable at all. Even as a child, I found it hard to laugh at the exploitation of animals if only for the sake of a low-brow audience. If you enjoy low-class comedy (i.e. fart jokes and the like) then by all means check out this movie...it will surely tickle your \\"dumb bone\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"MVP movie","review":"This was purchased as a gift so unsure of quality of product. However, received very quickly. I believe they have watched the movie and enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Courage Of Champions","review":"A fantastic, wonderful story involving feelings and attitudes. Virtues from honesty to courage to perseverance are personified, rather than preached. The characters play the story straight instead of wholesale slapstick. Sends a clear message of acceptance. It won the kids over, every one. They definitely would watch again. \\"Funny, crazy, exciting, terrific. Hilarious in places.\\" Portrayal of hearing-impaired sister impressed them. \\"Even if you are different you can still do things.\\" \\"I want to learn sign language.\\" Best for ages 8 to 12."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],B={key:0},W={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",W,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const M=d(x,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-9eb8e20f"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/35.md","filePath":"quotes/35.md"}'),j={name:"quotes/35.md"},P=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(M)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
