But, it is more suprising finding out who he is.This book was full of morals, misunderstandings, and romance. It was also different from other teen romance novels I've read. Now I won't go that far and say it was original, but it was different. Most teen romance has sex in some part or another. This book shows affection and love without having to prove it through sex.If it had to have a flaw I would have to say the ending was predictable. But, it is made up in the charm and comedy of the book. I highly recomend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good design","review":"We purchased these gates after being pleased with the purchase of some other Summer Infant products. I am an experienced carpenter and installed these gates exactly per the instructions. The latch mechanism of this gate is a fundamentally bad design. First, the latch really can't be operated with one hand-- you need one to press the latch lever at the same time you need to use the other hand to lift up the gate at the hinge side (using a significant amount of force). The gate is also very loud when it closes-- you need to use a lot of force to engage the latch. Not a good design if you are carrying a baby or have a sleeping baby around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and sturdy","review":"This gate works great and is solid as a rock. The trick is making sure you screw the gate into a stud. If you don't have studs, I wouldn't use the weak, cheap, plastic mollies (anchors) that come with the gate. I would highly recommend you get 4 of those big metal screw type augers that hold 50-lbs. They will support the gate especially if the gate is extended to 40+ inches. Also take your time installing the clips on the opposite side, make sure they line up with the gate so that when you swing the gate closed it just clicks right into the clips by itself. I only gave this item 4 stars because the directions suck and could have been made much more clearer. Luckily this product is not too hard to figure out how to install it. I highly recommend this gate for pets or toddlers."},{"rating":"1","title":"My two year old can pull this gate open.","review":"This gate is fine for infants, but is worse than useless for toddlers. My two year old pulls on it (back and forth), and it pops open; sometimes, it smacks him in the face. This is due to the design of the latch.The screws that come with it are also of poor quality; the heads sometimes bust off even if you you have drilled a pilot hole.Considering the cost to purchase and work involved to insall, plus screw-hole damage to walls and banisters, this is a very poor value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardware breaks, Horrible Summer Infant Customer Service","review":"We have four of these gates in our house because we needed extra wide gates and wanted gates with hardware mounted into the wall. Now the hardware is starting to break and Summer Infant does not offer replacements. They want you to buy a new gate instead of offering replacements. When the hardware does break, good luck getting in touch with customer service, they don't respond to customers. Now, I have a broken gate, holes in the wall where the hardware goes and they want me to buy another gate. I won't be buying anything more from Summer Infant!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"This gate is so poorly designed and way too heavy. Unless this is going into a stud it won't work. The latching mechanism is cheap plastic. We had to put this in an area without a stud and had to use larger screws and anchors. Even after that it was still too heavy so we used toggle bolts. Even after this its still too heavy and I'm afraid it's going to come off the wall!! Taking off and going right back to the store and purchasing a better one.

It will say, \\"they used to paint the rooms blue-green, grey or yellow\\" but the book doesn't show what these colors looked like or even what the color range to begin in. That is my only criticism.

If I could have the last 3 weeks of my life back, I'd wait for the Reader's Digest version.Too much detail, a kaleidoscope of characters and locations coming and going, and no real overview. The maps are poor and the descriptions of battles are limited.To the author, who has been immersed in the subject, it may seem like a summary. To someone who picks it up for a read over Christmas, it's a 500 page list of events which take place over decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read with Alexander the Great's Art of Strategy","review":"Kagan's book is a thoughtful, accessible, recounting of Thucydides' work for readers of all ages. Few have the intellectual insight and elegance of thought as Kagan does, and this ought to be a must for all school and college texts on classics, history, military history, as well as the study of civilizations. I also found the recent Alexander the Great's Art of Startegy to be a book that takes off where Kagan leaves off and weaves together a compelling, insightful, and timely story about the way Greek history since the Peloponnessian Wars affected the way Alexander the Great approached his conquests, and, which, in turn, changed the way we approach issues related to conquests, invasions, and co-existence of cultures. I would not have thought about the implications of the Peloponessian Wars had I not read Alexander the Great's Art of Strategy. I am thankful to the Tokyo bookshop which had prominently displayed these books side by side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the Greeks","review":"Given the sources for this material I see no reason to let Kagan filter the original material to the reader. In my opinion, he makes the traditional error of supposing the ancient Greeks were just older versions of ourselves. Herodotus may have pulled our legs sometimes but he did show that they were in reality very different from ourselves. I see this problem everywhere in Greek scholarship. Especially in the works targeted to the general public. It is hard to beat reading Thucydides and Xenophon and the others for ourselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fun read","review":"I picked up this book after hearing an interview with the author on NPR. My interest in this era of Greek history is a recent one, sparked by an excellent documentary on The rise and fall of Sparta on the History Channel. So I'm a true layman. Kagan fails to make the story of the war fun to read. The narrative is dry, the descriptions too factual. I'm not sure what the audience for the book is. For instance, Kagan doesnt bother describing daily life in Athens or Sparta. So as a casual reader I have no idea what this war did to ordinary people, what was the effect on lives, how did people cope with the upheaval. I recently read books on the making of the atomic bomb by Richard Rhodes and evolution by Jonathan Weiner and both managed to take a difficult and dry subject and make reading about it a joy (both won the Pulitzer Prize). I wish someone would do the same for this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, dull, dull...","review":"This is a great book for those desirous of a single volume reference to the Peloponnesian War. All the facts are here, and the maps are excellent and numerous. As an entertainment, though, forget it. Kagan is obviously bent on providing a simple, relatively brief history (short chapters make for easy reading), but his writing style is so pedestrian and bereft of passion that it is a challenge maintaining your interest. Every page reads like the bare bones summary of an interesting story, one that I'd like to read a good book about some day. But Kagan is definitely no story-teller. Anyone looking for an engaging, immersive read might want to pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for the Peloponnesian War","review":"I picked up this book after listening to author Donald Kagan's lectures on the Peloponnesian War (available on YouTube) and reading Thucydides. Kagan's book was a fantastic follow to Thucydides as he provides scope and context for the incidents recorded in primary source histories of the Peloponnesian War.Kagan argues that the Peloponnesian War still has lessons to teach us about human nature and international relations, and he does a good job of making his case while also explaining the particulars of what happened between Athens and Sparta that drove them to such a devastating war."},{"rating":"1","title":"V7.5 not intuitive","review":"I've designed some simple pages over the years from share and freeware programs, the last using Namo Webeditor V4.

(Hand smacking forehead) While this option can probably be turned off or adjusted, I am forced to dive into help menus to understand the \\"characteristics\\" of this program.Maybe version 7 was simple to use. I have tried working with V7.5 for the past couple months and have not been satisfied with the integration of the features. It does have some nice aspects but if I have difficulty doing simple stuff, the complex features don't matter.To me this has a moderate learning curve. I'm tired of trying to figure out the thinking behind NetObjects Fusion V7.5 and will keep searching for another web page development program. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use","review":"Having read many of the reviews, I believe that the high ratings given to this product are given by people who are already using Net Objects products or have experience in building sites.Never having built a site or used any program like this, I find Fusion difficult to use and the help available is poor at best. The \\"Getting Started\\" book is very limited and the \\"Help\\" that comes on the cd is hardly helpful. Many times, the help section simply states what can be done with the software rather than describing how to do it. I have contacted the \\"Support\\" at Net Objects only to receive conflicting answers to the same question.I have been trying to learn Fusion for two weeks now and have yet to figure out how to change a background on a site page.This software is very frustrating and in no way easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate This Program!","review":"I bought this program based on the reviews that it recieved on Amazon.com, but I wish I would have investigated further! The program is easy to use and the graphics are different. But, While working on my website with this program I lost weeks worth of work because of some glitch in the programming. The first time I lost evrything that I saved. Everything was just gone when I opened it the next time. After starting over from scratch, I lost everything a second time when it saved all my pages as My Home page. I lost my photo galleries and everything else! I do not reccomend this for some one with a low tolerance for frustration!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT software!","review":"I HIGHLY recommend this product. I was a Fusion MX user and upgraded to 7.0 3 months ago. This is hands down the best web-design tool. I learned web design the NetObjects way. Now I have Dreamweaver and Adobe GoLive and I almost exclusively use NetObjects Fusion 7. It is FASTER, EASIER to understand, and LOGICAL. Easily the most logical web-design software I have used. Fusion 7 is way more than adequate for 90% of all individual, small business (and most large business) websites. The best thing is virtually anyone can learn to use it almost immediately and after using it for a couple of weeks you will be a virtuoso. Of all software I have used (not just for web design, but across the board) this has been the most pleasant surprise ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars!","review":"When I began looking for webdesign software, of course I considered \\"Frontpage\\" and \\"Dreamweaver,\\" but both were not within our budget. Not only is NetFusion less expensive than them, but, I can't believe why this isn't a more popular web design program. I have a very basic understanding of html, but, you do NOT need knowledge of html or CSS to design cool (or, if you prefer, \\"kewl\\") pages.The interface is intuitive and simple. Take a few minutes to tinker with it. . .and you'll see that you don't need to read the entire manual. If you have any trouble with the program, which I doubt, the online support has the answers, as do a few books about earlier versions of the program.This is one of my favorite software programs.

Then, it occurred to me that Jesus came to save us from our sins. Nonetheless, this image of Diana Krall at Christmas prevents me from adding this cd to my Christmas collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic","review":"First off, I love Diana Krall, however, this CD is generic sounding and boring. I heard her sing a Christmas song in the past and it sounded great, so I really looked forward to this CD. When you listen to it, though, it does sound forced, like she doesn't want to be doing it. Her voice does not sound as good as usual, and I just found it to be dissapointing. We would have been better off with the music alone.The cover is no big deal, I don't think its in bad taste at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too cold for me!","review":"If you long for the sound of someone just going through the motions this may be the disc for you. I was thrilled with Krall's first album - I even used it when shopping for a new set of speakers. Since then I've been lukewarm on her releases. My wife purchased her Christmas album and after listening to it in the car for several hours I know what a very talented artist sounds like when they are less than enthused about a project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Show Me Your Legs For Christmas","review":"Ms. Krall apparently aimed for \\"Ella Wishes You A Swinging Christmas\\" but her uninspired performances miss the mark. I'm left with the impression that she was bored with the whole idea of a holiday album, but was dragged into producing one to raise a few bucks. Cool detachment may be stylish, but when it comes to this subject matter, please, leave it at home. On a positive note, the backing arrangements and musicians are excellent - hence the two stars. Can we get a version with the vocals stripped away?Oh yes, and the cover - rarely have I seen one that gives a more accurate idea of what you'll get inside - no clue about the subject matter. Do yourself a favor, if you want the best jazz-vocal holiday collection, skip this disc and get Ella Fitzgerald's early '60's classic instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissenting view","review":"Well, I disagree with most of these reviews. I own all of Ms Krall's cds and this is, I believe, her poorest. Her voice is so coarse and so often off key in these arrangements that I felt compelled to listen carefully to a couple of her early cds as a reality test. The same vocal issues are there too in the beginning, but just a little bit. Her voice has changed to my ear, and not for the better. And that little bit in the earlier cds is covered up by her solid, swinging piano, which clearly gets her into the music--her brio carries the day. Not here. A real disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Jazzy Christmas","review":"I love Diana Krall anyway and the Christmas music is wonderful on this CD.

But she needs to stick to jazz standards and torch songs where her smoky voice and sultry execution are highlighted. With perhaps a couple of exceptions, she seems uncomfortable with. . .something. . .on most of these Christmas standards. I don't know if it's because they don't lend themselves well to jazz interpretation and almost require one to sing them in the sing-song, strictly metered rhythms, or what it is about her delivery on these, but the album is a disappointment for the most part. I bought it because of the recommendations on Amazon, but I'm afraid this one is headed for the donation bin after Christmas is over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does it sound tinny to you?","review":"It doesn't seem like her voice is warm in the recording.The songs are a bit boring as far as jazz themed music goes.She seems like she's sleepy while singing it or doing her impression of a soulful lounge singer.When I look at the cover I ask why is she trying to use sex to sell it with that frizzy ball of hair hanging and her dress hiked up her thighs? It's a sad attempt and you people who purchase it and Amazon who keeps putting her CDs on my front page perpetrate the idea that there's actual music in the CD.This is not very good in my opinion.

The DVD of her concert in Paris is fabulous,and you Krall fans know what I am talking about. I have a 2-disc set of her best tunes and the CDs are a joy to listen to. She is superb--when she is singing JAZZ!I had high hopes for this new CD. I thought, with the right arrangements, she could pull it off. Unfortunately, she didn't. Knowing how good she really is, this was painfull to listen to. The only thing more painful to listen to was Stevie Nicks singing \\"Silent Night.\\"Some Christmas albums are great, like Bing Crosby's 1950s classic, but that is going back a bit. On this disc, Diana just seems out of her element. She could have changed the arrangements, the pacing of the songs, to be more in line with her singing style.I am afraid I won't be listening to this one again. Be warned, Krall fans--you may like it, as some reviewers have stated, or you may find it very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I really like her, but this was very disappointing. I thought . . . Diana Krall, Christmas songs, it's gonna be great, right? Not. I really don't like her style on this at all. I have it in my holiday rotation, and actually turn it down as I find it a little annoying. Just sing already! She has a great voice, but this cd is very choppy sounding. You'd never give her a second chance if this was the first exposure you had to her music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas songs the way they are supposed to be sung","review":"Diana Krall sings the classics, she does not try like others to write a new classic Christmas song and it's fine like that. She delivers great versions of all the songs and gives us one of the best Christmas albums in the recent years by a major artist.She gives all the songs freshness although they are half a century old or maybe more and she sings them the way they are supposed to be sung with the jazz mood.Christmas is a special time of the year and it's great when a fine artist like Diana Krall brings all the songs back to their original form. It sounds fresh and new although we know all of them by heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diana talks her way through this snoozefest","review":"I'm a big Krall fan AND a sucker for X-mas albums, so for me to not like this one is saying something. First the rhythms and arrangements are all just so wrong: forced, inappropriate, not good. Second, no holiday spirit, this feels like an album recorded in the dog days of August. Lastly, this sounds more like Diana doing her impression of Rex Harrison. Hon- try sustaining a note or two here or there, listening to you speak your way through old chestnuts is as dull as dirt. When I pay, I want a singer to SING, call me crazy! Don't waste your time with this one or you'll have a blue christmas, that's certain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price for an amazing collection","review":"These are the some of the most beautiful Christmas Classics that are there.

Off key, strange phrasing, and a disregard for becoming one with the orchestra. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok","review":"Having heard of Diana Krall from friends that are fans, but never having listened to her music, I thought this would be a nice addition to our family's christmas collection. After 3 or 4 listens I can say it's just ok. There aren't any standout tracks here and it just isn't very much fun. I might add a song or two to a christmas mix but don't think I would put this disc in just to listen to on its own.

I have all her CDs and they're great. So, when I got this CD at Christmas 2005 I was really disappointed. Look, it's OK, I guess, but not up to her usual standards. There's no enthusiasm here (except for the false enthusiasm of her fingernail-on-chalkboard tittering \\"I'm just crazy 'bout hooorses\\").Rather than write it off as just average I decided to give it a whirl again for Christmas '06, and had the same reaction. Guys might like this CD for her recumbent \\"come hither and unwrap THIS present\\" look and posture on the CD packaging, but there's little to come hither for inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who told Ms. Krall she must record a Christmas album?!","review":"I loved the editorial review of this album when it began saying, 'as the song goes, \\"Merry Christmas\\" has already \\"been said many times, many ways' but I disagreed when Ms. Leah Weathersby said \\"Diana Krall's Christmas Songs is a worthy -though not particularly unique -addition to the holiday catalog.'In fact there is nothing worthy here beyond the beautiful photos of a beautiful woman set by a marketing department which seems to be selling cosmetics or alike. Maybe they think music is just a plus. A not worthy plus containing the same old Xmas repertoire with a neglectable approach.Sounds like a false variation when Ms. Krall engages in pretending she is creating something that's nothing on her funny approach with no fun modifications in 'Jingle Bells' wrapped in a band swinging that does not convince.Who told Ms. Krall she must record a Christmas album?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classy Christmas","review":"The trouble with Christmas albums is that by December 26th they are usually consigned to the CD rack for 11 months -- I fear this may be another.

Diana Krall always exudes CLASS and this album is no exception. It\`s also \\"cute\\" that she finds it difficult to pronounce her \\"R\`s\\" (Cwistmas; awound etc).

Tried other brands and Braun leads my list."},{"rating":"2","title":"braun shaver","review":"I have always used Braun shavers and this latest doesn't disappoint. Price was the best I could find. Cleaning mode works as well as advertized. Carry case is pretty cheap looking though compared to older models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"While the unit does run hot after a few minutes of use, I found that to be its' only flaw. It took about 3 weeks for my skin to get used to changing from a normal razor blade to this electric but now it shaves great. It isn't as close and I have to shave every day, but overall its a great time saver; I often shave during the drive in to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Shaver","review":"For the last five years I used a Panasonic wet/dry shaver; it was excellent for all but the last year (got noisy and did not shave as well as it did, even with new blades), so I searched for a replacement. The Braun is a dry shaver but it's really very good. It's relatively quiet (even though it uses a vibration technology to raise whiskers), shaves close and is very comfortable to use. I was surprised that I don't need any pre-shave to get a good shave and although fast, I don't get any razor burn from shaving longer when I want a really close shave. The pop-up trimmer is the best I have ever used and the cleaning station (which I had doubts about) works very well. It's somewhat expensive but worth the cost. Whereas I don't know how well less expensive razors work, my Braun works well on my heavy beard and boney jawline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun pulsonic system 9595 w-LCD screen","review":"I bought the latest model of Braun 9595 razor for my boyfriend's Christmas's present. He wanted a new electric razor so I did some investigations. If you haven't visited Braun's website to see their video advertisment on the 9595, check it out. It's worth the time investment. As for the razor, there is a significant difference is smoothness. I'm really happy I purchased the Braun 9595, I love the feel of his face against my skin. The only downfall of the product is the design of liquid reservoir in the base unit. If you pack the base or tilt it, the liquid will spill. The work around is, just take the razor and not the base unit if you're leaving out of town for a few days. Other than that small design flaw, I highly recommend this razor over the other designs available today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulls whiskers","review":"I previously owned a Braun 8595, which was the best shaver I'd ever owned. I replaced it because the battery seemed to be dying. After using the Series 7 790cc Model 5671 for 2 months, it stills pulls a whisker or two every time I use it. I'm replacing it with a Series 5, in the hope that the \\"Pulsonic\\" or \\"Flexing head\\" feature is the problem, and that the Series 5 performs as well as the 8595. Whisker-pulling was the reason, decades ago, that I was never able to use a Norelco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"I got this for my husband - it looked great and I know he was not happy with the shaver he had - the blades seemed to dull so fast - He does NOT like it. I was going to get replacement cartridges but he told me not to bother - the problem he was having was not with the shaving performance - that seemed ok - his problem was the charger/cleaner - most of the time the shaver would not sit in the cradle right - in order for it to complete the cleaning cycle he had to hold it in place the entire time - almost seems like the shaver does not have enough weight to keep it situated right in the cradle - needless to say, he does not want to deal with that every day - he has coarse red hair and reviews the shaving capabilities so-so - will try to get with Braun to see if they can do anything"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed","review":"I almost never review products on Amazon, however, given that I relied on the reviews to buy this product I felt the need to comment in this instance. I have been using a Braun electric razor for many years, probably 3 or four models over time, and was in the market to replace my 8985 which was getting on in years. I figured rather than replace the blades for the third time on the 8985 I might as well upgrade to the \\"latest and greatest\\". Big mistake. I have been shaving with the 7-790cc for about a month or so now and within 8 hours of shaving it feels as if I never shaved. I waited over a month to write this review to give my face / skin a chance to adjust to the new razor as suggested, however, I am going to go back to my old 8985 since the shave was much closer. I would have expected a major improvement when spending over $200, however, unfortunately this shaver was a step backwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"best shaver on the market","review":"this is the most i have ever spent for a shaver and it was worth the money the self cleaning function is better than i thought it would be i would recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Braun Pulsonic 9595","review":"Shaver works ok, had an older Braun shaver that actualy did a better job of cutting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Shaver Indeed","review":"I've used several shavers over my lifetime. I would rate this one among the best I had. The thing that amazes me most is how quickly it works. It shaves as quickly as a rotary razor while keeping the closeness of a foil shaver. I also like the fact that it's not too loud like many foil shavers. I have a Panasonic wet/dry foil shaver as well. The Braun shaves as closely as it, but you get the job done in about 20% of the time. Don't judge it by the first shave it gives you as it takes time to break-in. It took about two weeks before it shaved as close as the Panasonic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Liked Electric Razors Until Now","review":"Ingrown hairs were always a real problem with the Mach 3's of the world but electric razors never gave me a close enough shave. Until now. The Braun Pulsonic is as close to a razor shave as possible without any of the irritation. Sometimes you need to manually shave a random hair or two when you are done but the Pulsonic is very impressive. I'd highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I have been using this shaver for a month now and absolutely love it. I am 40 and have been shaving electrically my whole life. This is the best shaver I have ever owned. Before I had to have 2 shavers, one for my neck(a Braun) and the other for my face(a Norelco). I just couldn't use a rotary shaver on my neck because it would leave shaver burn badly. So I decided to get this shaver cause I use a Braun for my neck already and the lower end model I have now wasn't fast enough for my face. This one is fast and I can use it on both my neck and face. Nicely built and the head on this thing pivots very nicely. The side burn trimmer cuts very close as well, the only thing is that when you have it popped out, the shaver and your hand is in the way to see where you are shaving on your side burns. Not a big deal though. Well worth the money. I only use the cleaning feature a couple times a week. Still on the same cleaning cartridge, should last a while yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not excellent","review":"When my trusty Norelco bit the dust, I looked for a replacement and came across this Braun Pulsonic. The really nice thing about it is the self cleaning system. The only negative is that for some reason I expected a closer shave than I actually get. All in all, it's a nice electric razor but perhaps a bit over priced."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE WASTE OF MONEY...BE WARNED.","review":"I decided I did not care about price because I wanted the best electric razor on the market....to put it simply this does not create even close to a CLEAN SHAVE look. And I still have to use a straight razor under my chin because this electric razor does nothing for that area. This did not work for me...good luck to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy, you have been warned","review":"***WARNING, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT***I have had this for 2+ years, and as with what others said the shaver will lose contact with the base due to the contacts on the base being cheap. The metal wears away in just a short few months of use from the vibration of cleaning. Braun needs to redesign those contacts better. I had to pull mine apart and solder the front contacts so that it would charge/clean again. That is POOR design for such an expensive setup.Also, after your face has adjusted to the shaver, it makes the blade/shaver not cut as close as it used to, even with a brand new replacement blade, it just doesnt cut like it used to. I have to go back with a flat blade/disposable razer to get the rest or else it will leave stubble. That could just be me, however others are reporting the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE Braun Warranty Issues!!!","review":"I purchased this Braun Shaver directly from Amazon more than a year ago. It came with a 2-Year Warranty. A few months after I began using it I noticed that the cleaning base and the shaver were defective. I tried contacting Braun customer service on April or May 2009 so that I could send my shaver for repair or replacement. However, it was extremely hard to get a hold of them. They finally answered one of my emails yesterday, which was September 22nd, 2010.I DON'T RECOMMEND anyone to purchase Braun products. I'm surprised Amazon is selling Braun products since Braun has such horrible service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Braun Sucks.....not for First time Electric Shavers","review":"For first time users...stay away...

I called them up for a price differential credit, which was refused by 2 customer service reps and their supervisors. They said that on September 1, 2008, Amazon had eliminated their 30 day price differential credit policy. When I asked where I could find this change detailed on their site (they have had this policy since Amazon opened), they said it wasn't there.I wrote to Jeff Bezos. His assistant replied to me, and politely refused the $5 refund. I asked where the updated policy could be found, and was told that since there was no longer such a policy, no mention of it can be found on their website.I suggest you buy this product from a merchant who is both more upfront about their policies, and more concerned with customer satisfaction, which sadly at one time would have been Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not shave all your hairs on your neck","review":"Costs about 200 bucks I'd say they spent half of that on the packaging. It shaves most of your hairs fine its just some on the neck dont get cut. Also can't be used in the shower which is a great place to shave hairs. I've only used it once and I don't like it.

However it seemed to be getting much noiser and I decided it was time for a new one. The Braun Series 7 does a great job for me. Gives me a very close shave for an electric razor and is much quieter than the old model. Cleaning is also quieter and faster. Very satisfied with this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Charging/Cleaning Stand Broke / Braun Customer Service Horrible","review":"10 months into owning this shaver it stopped being able to charge or clean in the stand. This because the shaver would move around during the cleaning process, tricking the stand into thinking it wasn't in the stand at all. I called Braun and was told that I had to ship the unit, at my expense, a few hundred miles to the nearest service center. I also had to call the service center myself to set this up. They would provide no time frame for resolution of the problem. They wouldn't guarantee that it was covered by the warranty, so once the service center got it, I could face charges for getting it fixed. And in the meantime I had to buy another shaver.Check around. This is a common problem with this shaver. For this much money, Braun should treat its customers better. I won't be buying from them again, and I suggest you not either."},{"rating":"2","title":"shaving","review":"This Braun pulsonic system provides the closest shave for an electric shaver. I agree it also has a nice handle, even for a lefty. My only complaint was the mechanism for changing the mobility of the head. It is a small silver plastic switch that broke after three shaves! Fortunately, it does not change the closeness of the shave. But the head is stuck in one position. For the heavy price tag I expected a better product. Hope I do not encounter any other problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Braun Pulsonic System 9595 with LCD ScreenI have been using Braun electric shavers since I was in the army in Germany in 1951 and was always satisfied. Over these many years I've tried other shavers but always went back to a Braun. A few weeks ago I purchased the Model 9595 and WOW!! The best yet! It gives a close shave and the self cleaning feature makes shaving a breese."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbeleivable for an electric","review":"This is a must buy. I know the price can be a turn off, but I could not have gotten a much better shave from my razor. The shave is very very close, fast and clean.

This is the only electric shaver I will ever buy.If the price deters you, think of all of the shaving cream you won't need to buy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shaver","review":"Have used this shaver for a couple of weeks now, bought it on Amazon for a good price (although Walmart carries it at about the same price, you save on taxes in most states on Amazon). Its a lot better than Philips shavers I have been using for the last 5-6 years, gives me a closer shave with lesser irritation. The shaver did leave some rashes though, I guess its perhaps a case of me getting used to the kind of pressure it needs for a good shave. Great product, highly recommended.Update 2/4/2008:I have been cleaning the shaver every alternate day, or when the LCD only has two lights, whichever happens earlier, and its only after 2 months of use that the cleaning fluid is showing 'low' level. Pretty happy with the cost of cleaning this shaver as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Braun electric shaver is Amazing","review":"I haven't tried an electric shaver in many years, remembering how poorly they worked. The Braun 790cc is--in a word--amazing! It truly results in a shave so close to a razor that I had to have my wife verify it by rubbing her cheek against mine and she agreed.It is expensive and the cleaner cartridges add to the cost, but as for results--if that is what is important to you--it's there. Now everyone needs to decide for themselves how important cost is. That simplifies the decision at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Braun not for me","review":"Tried this after many years with Norelco. It pulled and grabbed my chin hairs and it was painful.

Back to Norelco and everything is much better...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Shave","review":"I expected an outstanding shave with this \\"top of the line\\" razor. As it turns out, my 7 year old Remington MS3-4700, which has 4 year old cutting blades, shaves closer than this Braun did out of the box. I will give it points for giving an extremely comfortable shave, but that becomes meaningless when you have a shadow 2 hours after shaving. With all the outstanding reviews this model has gotten, perhaps my beard just doesn't go well with this razor - who knows. My Braun foil shaver I had before my Remington (about 10 years ago) gave a much closer shave, for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this shaver 6 months ago based on the great reviews in Amazon. My experience has not been that great. The shaver has trouble picking up longer hair, and I find myself going over rough spots in the evening. When I left the shaver at a friends and had to use my \\"worn out\\" Norelco I was stuck by how much closer and more comfortable the shave was. The Braun is also pretty noisy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad ... as long as it works ...","review":"I used this for about two years. It was fine for a while, and then the charger went on the fritz. While I was waiting for a replacement, I went back to using old-school blades and cream and haven't looked back. I hadn't used a non-electric razor since 1997, but things have really changed. The Gillette Fushion Proglide is excellent, permitting a much closer shave (than this Braun or any electric razor) and not nicking your skin as the old razors did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"The razor gives a great shave. I especially like the self cleaning feature. Each use is just as good as the first. The blades are clean, fresh and sharp after each use.The only regret is that there is no blade for trimming sideburns or mustaches."},{"rating":"1","title":"After using for a year or more","review":"I always thought that the Braun shaver would be a great product, so when my Norelco shaver died I purchased this model. At first the shaver wasn't that great, but the directions said if coming from a rotary shaver you wouldn't get great results at first. After using for three months I still didn't see much improvement. I put it aside and used a Gillette razor and shaving cream. I started using the Braun razor again just recently and I am still disappointed in the results. Shaving cream and a razor for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive and poorly made","review":"I bought this product to replace a Philips shaver that I had used for 15 years before it died. I bought the Braun to give the foil heads a try (as opposed to rotary heads of the Philips). The shaver worked well for about 2 years. The part which I am most disappointed about is the cleaning system called 'Clean and Renew'. The unit is cheaply made and cleaning solution seems to evaporate rapidly as the seals are not that great. This means you have to replace the cleaning solution capsule too often. In addition, the power cord does not sit firmly in the socket on the cleaning unit and thus does not make good contact. Shaver itself works reasonably well although hair stubbles seem to leak from shaver chamber occasionally even after cleaning. For the price, the unit is a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed- Returned to Braun","review":"I've been shaving with the Braun Syncro 7680, and can honestly tell you that it's provided the best shave ever. I decided to give myself an upgrade this past Christmas to the new 7 series Pulsonic expecting that the new shaver would provide an even better shave- especially for the hefty price tag. The new system seems to shave a bit quicker, but would irritate a lot more and shave no where near as close. I could go two days with the old shaver before \\"needing\\" to shave again. With the new Pulsonic, I would need to shave everyday- bummer. After hoping for the best and allowing my face to adjust for 4 weeks, nothing changed. What a disappointment- I've since returned the shaver under the 60 day money back guarantee. I'm sticking with my old Braun- the grass isn't always greener..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Braun Pulsonic","review":"I got this shaver for a Christmas gift from my fiance. I read all the reviews online and on Men's Health and decided to get this instead of the Phillips.Let me start by saying that I have VERY sensitive skin.This razor did nothing like all the ads states. It was a rough shave. Had to go over my face numerous times and even dig the razor into the the neck to get at some whiskers.It left my face red and bumpy and my skins burned for hours after the shave.I ultimately returned it to Braun being very disappointed and now am searching for a new razor and looking at the new Phillips.I would NOT recommend this shaver to anyone-especially if you have a soft sensitive face and skin.Sorry Braun....Sorry Amazon but I am just being very honest to try and help the other consumers who may look at this.Hope this helps......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I read the reviews, I've had 4 or 5 electric razors over the years, and I was ready to pay for the best razor out there. This isn't it. I have an ultrasonic toothbrush and I really liked it. That's why I tried this out.It still takes several passes to catch hairs, no different than my cheap electric razor and maybe not any better at all.The clipper on the side is at a 90 degree angle, meaning it's hard to trim eyebrows or beards with it, or get under hairs that the razor misses.The LCD is nice for showing the battery level, but the hygiene one is B.S. It just goes by the run time. I'm sure they make money on the refills and that's why it goes down so fast. I just rinse it with water and do the auto clean in the base once a week or so.I really wanted to like this thing, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much!","review":"I bought this razor after my wife said I needed a new one. It cost $200! It doesn't work any better than my 5-6 year old norelco, not to say that means it's bad, just not any better. I've needed to do little with the norelco except rinse it out under the tap. Never replaced original blade wheels even. The pulsonic wants to give me it \\"hygiene\\" and wants me to clean it when IT decides that's needed. It goes through a little song and dance as it does so, with flashing lights and various sounds. You'll also have to buy the hygiene solution about monthly, and it costs a lot more than tap water. I cannot understand why any sane designer thinks this kind of crap (excuse my anglo-saxon) and also spoiling the relative purity of a quiet early morning with 'hygiene' paranoia will appeal to anyone with much cortex left.

Braun won't just send replacement, advise you to mail it in for repairs (with original receipt) or take it to 'licensed service center (also with original receipt). Complete pain.

My wife commented that she didn't feel it shaved as close, but by evening it was obvious. I used it for 30 days just to make sure. It does fine on the cheecks, but the neck is a pain.After 30 days I went to return it. Good luck with the 800 number you call. Also, there is no information on the Braun website to help you return it. I had to call 4 times to get the address right to ship it back. Anyway, I am sending mine back.

The only reason I replaced them was because the battery no longer took a charge. After 2 years of light use, the trimmer broke (it no longer was able to stay open) and the cleaning fluid dissolved the cheap silver sticker behind the shaver. This shaver shaves no closer than other brands that I have used in the past. The quality of construction is very poor. I would definitely not recommend this shaver to anyone.

I had a Braun shaver similar to this one before this but it was a few years old. This one definitely gets the job done better.I had to take a star off, however, because every time I shave three or four times in the process I will get a sharp pain where I am shaving like someone hit me in the face with a rubber band. It doesn't cause any nicks or irritation or anything like that, so I'm not sure why it feels that way. Kind of like the shaver is ripping the hair out instead of cutting it.Overall though, HIGHLY recommended if you want an electric shaver. My face is smoother than ever in a shorter amount of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointing. Don't travel with it and no customer service","review":"Shaving is OK when it works but not as close as my previous Braun. When on the road, not using the cleaning system, the razor gets hot and auto shut-off after half shaving. I contacted Braun customer service (e-mail and phone) and got no support at all except the \\"we are sorry you don't enjoy ...\\" There is a real technical problem and Braun refuses to even acknowledge it.Too late to return.

After 20 years of using Braun, I will switch to another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Cleaning Station, huge downgrade from previous models","review":"I have been using Braun shavers for over 7 years now. The last one was terrific and gave me a close shave every time. The cleaning station left the shaver feeling like new every time. This one lacks in comparison. The shaver took some getting used to, like all shavers do, but I still feel like the other one got me a closer shave and less irritated.My biggest gripe is the new cleaning station. Yeah, it looks cool, but it does not do it's job. After a clean, when you pull out the shaver, you'll notice the dock is covered with hair gunk/residue. It's like its not properly draining into the cleaner cartridge.Braun needs to go back to selling their older models, the new ones are terrible.

I am dreading the hassle I know awaits me of trying to get this fixed. Sorry Braun, for years I used your products but $200+ for 11 months can by me a lot of disposable razors. Before buying read the reviews (1 star and 2 star) to balance out the higher scores. I rated it highly too, at first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and fancy","review":"It comes with a fancy nice box, lot's of accessories and a travel box for the shaver. My bf loves it and the nice thing is the automatic cleaning option. You can choose when to clean it and it will shut it off automatically. There is an indicator showing how clean your shaver is and you can decide when to clean it. Apparently according to him the shaving is nice, close and clean shave, but you really have to get used to the pulsonic thing and the rotating shaver. The cons is still the noise that it makes. It's really loud when the shaver is working including during cleaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun Pulsonic","review":"I was disappointed that my husband wasn't THRILLED with the shaver, given the hype and the price. He says it does a good job shaving, but he says it is so large that he isn't sure if he wants to take in when we travel, which is fairly often. I am happy because it cleans itself, so I feel it is much more hygenic this way.

The cleaning feature is very nice but not worth the extra $130 you spend on it from a lower series Braun.The main reason I wrote this review is to warn people that if you buy it and have a poor experience like I did YOU CANNOT RETURN IT THROUGH AMAZON. Because this shaver comes with the cleaning fluid which is flamable, Amazon will not allow you to return it. You can return it to Braun within 60 days but you have to ship it to them in either GERMANY or AUSTRAILIA. The shipping charges are really high.So just be warned before you purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT buy this at AMAZON. You cannot return it.","review":"I bought this as a present for my husband. It is quite nice, but broke after 1 month of use (the 'lock' button snapped off). If you, like me, like to order from Amazon for the quick shopping & ease in return, you will have better luck going to your local department store to pick this up. Because of a tiny cartridge of cleaner, this only ships via ground package AND they will not allow you to return this. The latter is a BIG problem when a $200 razor breaks. I'm disappointed that Amazon has not seemed to figure out that if the cleaner cartridge is not being returned that there is no issue with this being shipped. It seems very idiotic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate Cleaning Dock","review":"This shaver does a great job. It is clean, efficient, overall I give the shaver itself a 5 star.However, once you use the shaver, you have to put it back into a plastic cleaning dock that cleans the shaving heads and recharges the battery.The fit of the shaver into the dock is so inadequate that the blue led on the shaver (the one that shows it is charging) sometimes flashes intermittently. (the dock does fantastic light shows while this happens...) You start the cleaning cycle and the shaver vibrates away from the charging contacts. So the cleaning cycle stops. The only reliable way I can get it to clean is to hold the shaver into the dock for 19 minutes. Doesn't that defeat the purpose of the electric shaver?Shaver is great. Cleaning system sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desgin Defect: Braun Series 7-7900cc Pulsonic Shaver","review":"Just received the new Braun Series 7-7900cc Pulsonic Shaver via Amazon.The shaver locking mechanism fell apart on the side of the head, just hanging there, keeping me from using the cleaning base. When I contacted Braun Customer Service per the manual at 1-800-272-8611 I was informed me that their money back guarantee has been rescinded for defective products. This is in spite of that offer printed in the owner's manual that I received.Their offer now is that, upon receipt of the defective Braun shaver, they will offer a customer credit in eight to ten weeks for future purchase of Braun products, but they are not in a position any more, due to a new policy change, to refund my money.I am irate that they will not stand behind their guarantee anymore on a product that I just received a day ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does an excellent job","review":"In the case of this shaver, the hype really does match reality. The shaver is by far the best electric I've ever used, and it's very nicely engineered--from the ergonomics of the shaving unit to the self-cleaning/lubricating mechanism that comes with the shaver. It's a bit pricey, but you get your money's worth out of this one.----------------------After nearly two years of using this shaver I can update my original review (above) as follow:(1) Have replaced the head once, which is right on schedule(2) I stil love the shaves I get from this shaver.(3) The trimmer works, but will no longer stay closed (cheap mechanism here).(4) I'm surprised by the number of people who try to save cleaning fluid by only cleaning the head once in a while. The fact is that you can get as many cleanings as you want until evaporation requires a new cartridge. By not cleaning, you're not saving anything.Still give it 5-stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going Back to Panasonic","review":"I bought this after reading so many good reviews - and at $300 it MUST be good, right? Well not if you have a relatively soft beard and face. It just leave behind way to many hairs - and never gets close to the skin - so my face still feels like stubble, right after I finish shaving. I even bought a New head ($45) but still, just not good. I tried for 6 months - plenty of time for face to adjust. Still not a good shave. Really a disappointment. My old Panasonic razor (5 years old now) is WAY better - at least for me and my face. And it was only 1/3 of the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT RETURNABLE!!!","review":"I ordered this as a gift for a friend. He thought it is too complicated to use, also that it takes up too much \\"real estate\\" in the bathroom and asked me to return it.

I wasn't quite sure whether it would shave as close as a razor like some reviewers indicated. I was pleasantly surprised that it not only shaves as close as a razor but also does not cause any irritation. I have no doubt that over the long run my skin will be much better off. Please note that I do not have a real thick beard and mustache but shaving is much more pleasurable now than it was with a razor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beats any shaver I have used so far","review":"I was just a little disappointed with the results as I have a very tough beard.

My beard adjusted within a few uses, and now I get a great smooth shave. It doesn't hurt to use it every day like my rotary did. I just had to get used to using a different motion on my face to make it work (lines instead of circles). I have a goatee so the trimmer is important and it works well, though it takes a bit of getting used to the new sight line because it extends from the front of the razor (as opposed to the top). Cleaning system does the trick, but you do have to reserve some counter space for it near the outlet, as it needs a secure base. All in all, I am very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best razor ever!","review":"My goodness, this is the best razor I've ever owned. With my old razor, I would shave for a half hour or more and I'd have stubble by the end of the day. With this one, I shaved 3+ weeks of beard growth in 15 minutes and three days later I still have hardly any stubble! I used to hate shaving and always had somewhat of a beard, but I think that'll change with this new razor!It even has an electric display on it that tells you how dirty it is and comes with a cool charging/cleaning station. This is probably the best electric razor available today. When you look at it that way, the $260 price tag is a bargain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Shave","review":"Gives good shaves.

When I feel my face after the shave, it feels close, but I can still see some beard imbedded in my skin. However, I can still feel some beard on my neck area.

The trimmer is not very good either and you cannot see where to trim as the shaver head is so big it hides the trimmer.. The shave was rough and the head heated up and I don't like that feeling on my skin.. I had to go over spots multiple times.

First of all the Pulsonic is easier to handle and actually feels lighter than the 7526. As far as the shave is concerned it took less time for me to complete due to less repeat strokes needed in hard to reach areas like neck and adams apple. The hightech look is what turned me on in the first place and you won't be disappointed with it's digital readouts and cool blue light. The cleaning base is also quieter than the older 7526 model with the multi colored readouts as an added bonus. The trimmer function works well also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another electric shaver","review":"After reading some of the reviews I got excited and started to think this might be the holy grail of electric shavers. That wonderful piece of machinery that will free me from the shackles of the morning showers necessary to shave with a blade. Alas, I was mislead. The instructions tell me to give my face 2-3 weeks to get used to the electric shaver, but I surmise that this guideline is really meant to close the door to product returns as I am now stuck with this $220 knight in shining armor that slays dragons like a peasant boy. My face is no smoother than it was with any other electric shaver and have a 5pm shadow by 2pm.

Panasonics have consistently offered shavers that have quieter, faster motors (13,000 RPMs) than Brauns. The best part of Panasonic shavers is that they allow you to shave with water and shaving foam or gel, which lends to a closer, more irritation free shave. If you have sensitive skin and are looking to make the switch to an electric shaver, or if you just want the best shave an electric can provide, I highly recommend a Panasonic Wet/Dry.

It didn't seem like the \\"pulsonic\\" feature helped at all. On my neck, there were spots that I just could not get. I tried shaving in all sorts of directions, but I just could not get all of my neck closely shaved. Generally, it was good enough, but if I wanted to get a really close shave on my neck, I had to bust out the Remington. I saved the best for last: This shaver pulled my hairs.

The fit and finish is poor and the razor doesnt dock well with the base. It took three times for me to even get it to charge. I would suggest saving the extra $100 and going with the 8000 series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed, don't buy by price alone","review":"this razor was a dissapointment. commercials...reviwes.....stats all sounded good. truth is the base in smelly and noisy, shaver heats up fast and kinda bruns your skin. the floating head was nice the shave was no good. i use to have a panasonic and replaced it with this....not good. i went back and bought a new panasonic model. so i shaved with the braun and still had stubble in some areas....went over the stubble with my new panasonic and wooosh....GONE!!! so please do yourself a favor...buy a panasonic!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great for me","review":"I have an average beard, and this razor did a great job on my actual face.

I have now gone back to using my older Braun, the 7526 which still works a lot better than the 9595 model for me.-If you are not shaving daily which I never do, it can be very uncomfortable, the razor pulls hairs all the time, and simply misses a lot too.-If you have a goatee or something you are trimming around, the way this razor is designed it makes it difficult.-This a very loud razor, not just for cleaning which I can deal with, but when you are using it.-Really the only nice to have was the LCD.-I can't believe I paid $225 for this, at least Braun gave me a refund when I shipped it back to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had looked forward to this shaver, but it does not shave my beard well, and has also cut my face as well as caused me severe razor burn.

The Series 7 is ergonomically superior and feels great in your hand. It will take me a while to get used to the side cutter as it is narrower than on the Series 5 but the quality of the shave is a definite improvement. I find it to be significantly closer than the Series 5.

This has given me the best shave I've ever had which is far superior to the Mach III razor or Norelco. I have a very dark beard and this leaves me smooth as silk and I can go longer between shaves. I've had the Braun since Christmas 2007 and it's great. I can go a little over a month before I need a new cleaning cartridge.

That being said this product doesn't shave as well as my old Remington and cost 3 times as much so I will be going back.

I think the much faster pulsing of the cutter heads helps. But I still like my older Braun better for other areas like my neck. I'm hoping my neck just needs to get used to it as well.

The Series 7 provides an extremely close shave and is much quieter than the other Braun models. I have tried other brands of electic shavers and nothing comes close to this one.

After shaving with the Pulsor I frequently use my older Syncro Braun which is needed if I want a close shave. So I'm telling myself, just because its new its not better.So I am about to retire the $200 plus Pulsor and go back to my old Syncro.So much for my $200 lesson.

The pictures are plenty and of high quality. The somewhat limited amount of text deals mainly with concept and layout and not so much with construction techniques and materials. Twenty-three houses from around the world are featured.This is a good coffee table book. However, if this is what minimalist architecture is then it might not be for the typical future home builder looking for unique but livable concepts (ala the not so big house).

What I received was a selection of a few very good projects amidst a lot of mediocre architecture. Minimalism is a catch all word...just because a house has white walls and a lot of glass does not make it 'minimal'.

The author is a former professor of mine whom I learned much from and helped me to choose an Old Testament emphasis for my master's work. This book is detailed and can be used to topically search tough passages from the Old Testament Law. An excellent tie to the New Testament is done throughout the book as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toshiba; in a state of decline","review":"Briefly, I purchased these headphones 2 yrs. ago (2009) for approx. $100.00 from Toshiba direct.

Despite it's billing, it has no tie-in with the Lodoss world besides a 2 minute history intro and a couple of names thrown out at the very beginning.Beyond that, the story is indifferent, and the animation is poor. It has none of the sharp style and bright contrasts that typically makes for good anime, coming across blurry and dull instead (and that goes for both the animation AND the story!).Imagine that someone took a water-color version of the Lodoss War, erased the story, and then left it out in the rain overnight. This is what you'd have left. Go see the original again, or try the 'Chronicles of the Heroic Knight' (now out on DVD). Give this one a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not as good as it should have been...","review":"Though I was giving it the benefit of the doubt, Legend of Crystania proved to be quite a disappointment. The story line is less than underdeveloped. In the short length of less than 1.5 hours, there isn't much time to make good story plot, but they managed to put forth very little effort. I was pretty disappointed about the fact that they even have a BIO section for all of the characters and state that Ashram and Pirotess are the same people from lodoss war, but act/look nothing like themselves. I have not yet seen the series, but i might imagine it to be a little bit better due to fewer time constraints... but I won't get my hopes up quite yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this video","review":"This is listed as part of the Lodoss setting.

I regret buying this dvd VERY MUCH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way below expectations","review":"I bought this video in hopes of finding a good sequel to one of my favorite animes of all time: Record of Lodoss War. Not only did the animation look like it had been washed out by the rain, but the plot was definitely in need of something. If you are a die-hard Lodoss fan, like I am, it might spark a tiny flare of interest even after you've seen its horrible plot, but if you're just a normal anime-goer, STAY AWAY! This is an insult to the original series."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not Lodoss War...but even then...","review":"Ok...if you are looking for a sequel to Lodoss War, then this is not where you wanna go. It's nothing like Lodoss War, and you only have Ashram and Pirotesse returning from the original. But even putting that aside, it wasn't that great of a movie. First off, it was a good deal bloodier than Lodoss War was, so if you're squemish, don't bother. Secondly, a lot of parts of the movie, even though I tried and tried to make sense of them, I could not. It was not very well written, and from beginning to end, just made little sense. Don't get me wrong; it wasn't entirely bad, but it was more bad than good. I say don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"Very bad... not much of character development... not much of a plot... Aviod this is you are a Lodoss fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read a lot of people trying to defend this movie...","review":"But let us be perfectly honest. What made Records of Lodoss Wars so great was it was a classic Fantasy with a few kinks thrown in and AMAZING art. Legends of Crystania has...shall we say...lazy art, terrible dubbing and, worst of all, little of the lore that made Lodoss work.And again, we need to look at this in a harsh light! How does Legend of Crystania compare to other anime? Anime worth 5 stars is like Akira and Cowboy Bebop...truly masterfull peices of work. Can you honestly say this movie compares well with these titles? I am going to go out on a limb and say even the great Lodoss, as good as it was, does not compare well with Cowboy Bebop. We, as reviewers, need to not inflate scores of these films. Even if you liked this movie, you have to admit it doesn't hold a candle to great anime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crystania is quite good","review":"A simple story of a battle between good and evil, pits young prince Radon against shape-changing adversaries in a far off land. Being written by Ryo Mizuno, you can expect a lot of bright visuals and fine acting (though almost every single word is screamed or shouted), though at times it is a bit intense for the younger kids it is aimed at."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was simply awful.","review":"I thought Record of Lodoss War was fantastic on many levels. However Crystania bears virtually no relation to Lodoss at all other than the fact that Ashram and Pirotesse are in it. When did Pirotesse become a weakling that couldn't defend herself? When did Ashram become one of the good guys? The animation is as similiar to Lodoss as Peanuts is to Disney's Fantasia. I have to disagree with the other reviews about the voice acting, it was bad also. The story was terrible and seems to have been concocted by someone's 10 year old nephew. Do yourself a favor and rent this movie first (you will see I was so disappointed) if you are truly interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crystania - :sigh:","review":"Although the music is pretty decent, the voice-acting fair, and the story interesting, the Legend of Crystania simply isn't worth it. Record of Lodoss War was fantastic, and Crystania simply doesn't earn the title of 'sequel' for Lodoss. The animation was poor (Lodoss' animation may not have been fantastic [ie the dragons] but it was still great), the shading / color scheme was terrible, and the story did get rather dull at times. It's as if they were trying to leech off Lodoss' fame to bring in a few quick bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"No sequel to Lodoss Wars","review":"I was very disappointed in this video, as it was represented as a follow up to Lodoss Wars. The art is only okay and the coloring pastel, much like the personalities of the characters. The only two characters continuing from Lodoss are unrecognizable and are not in leading roles. I'm sure I'd have liked this better if they'd left it to its own merits and not tried the flimsy tie in to Lodoss Wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a very medicore sequel to a fantastic show","review":"This story takes place long after the Lodoss series. Ashram leads the Marmo to a new home and makes a deal with a god spirit to save them. He is possessed by the spirit and becomes an evil tyrannical ruler.This series disappointed the heck out of me. The only character that you will recognize from Lodoss is Pirotess. Her appearance and attitude are completely different. She may as well be a different character all together. The animation is not that good and the voice actors are awful. The whole premise and story are not bad though; but the bottom line is I don't think you should spend money on this anime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't understand anything!","review":"I absolutlely hated this video.

However, in each succeeding edition I was required to use, I have found some of the most effective essays replaced by those seemingly less related to the the themes of the sections they are in. Further, as we all know, textbooks often are extremely overpriced. I find it disheartening that this anthology is needlessly revised so often that re-sale value is short-lived, which is a hardship for many of my students. Most of my students need to sell back texts outside their majors. Instead, they end up being stuck with books that inevitably will languish on shelves, collecting dust, or in adding to a landfill.

It has these tactics on an individual and team level. So, there is quality stuff in here, timeless basics even. However the presentation is so archaic that you will be left wondering what you paid for. I would recommend a more modern manual. There are probably better purpose built SWAT manuals out there or most of this information can be found in military FMs with better production quality.

Volf's a deep thinker, but he doesn't have his head in the sand. He writes from a place of humility and grace. And his understanding of the Gospel and what it makes us capable of becoming is so illuminating and life-giving. I hope I don't sound too enamored with the man, but his insights have proven to be very wise. I feel that I am in his debt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful lessons from a man who's walked the walk","review":"In this practical and profound book, Volf gets down to the nitty-gritty of what it means for us as Christians to forgive those who have wronged us.

General Zachary Taylor and roughly 4,500 American army regulars battled General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna with a force of 20,000 Mexican soldiers. Superb maneuvering and regrouping tactics caused what should have been a rout of the American troops by the Mexican forces, into military battlefield draw, and which would ultimately compelled Mexico to sue for peace. An absorbing and informative survey of military tactics, combined with a compelling narrative of the dynamics and relative morality of a war that was ultimately an American grab for more land, Climax At Buena Vista reveals the enduring impact the conflict had on subsequent Mexican and American histories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exposed to the Skin Game","review":"Joseph Wilkins has a free and easy writing style that shifts easily from anecdote to anecdote.

For awhile, there is skepticism about whether he should get to play or not because he doesn't have a high school education, and his mom doesn't want him to do anything but stay home.I recommend \\"The Waterboy\\" to anybody who likes good comedy movies so you can see how it turns out and how far the waterboy will be able to take his football team. \\"The Waterboy\\" does have a few parts in it that are kind of stupid, but most of the movie is hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was painfully boring to watch!!!!","review":"This movie was boring, slow, and poorly written. Watching this movie made me sick. Adam Sandler is usually very funny, but in this movie he played an extremely lifeless character. Overall, I would have rather watched a Golden Girls marathon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest Movie","review":"Loved it. I especially liked Adam Sandler. I think he's the funniest person alive. Adam I hope you are reading this. I loved you in this movie. I will write to you when I have the time... this week maybe. This is the funniest movie I saw since Mars Attacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adam's Best Yet!","review":"Even though Adam Sandler has made America laugh with all of his videos and music, I have to say that this is the best of all. The cast was histerical! If you like foosball and foosball players or if you just want to laugh then ask Mama if you can get this movie. You'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS MOVIE WAS THE FUNNIEST!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie was one of the funniest movie I've ever seen! It's about Adam Sandler who plays Bobby who's a waterboy. After getting fired from his old team he gets hired by a new team. And the players are making fun of him and the coach tells him to stand up for himself. So when another player teases him he tackles him and finds out he has a talent in tackling. Adam Sandler is pure funny in this movie. I would reccomend everyone to see this movie right now!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!!!","review":"This movie is one of the funniest I have ever seen!!!

Totop all that, the sound goes out of sync from chapter 15 onwards, which makes it look like a cheaply dubbed movie. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny unless you are under 10","review":"This show was a real disappointment. I wasn't able to sit through the whole thing. The humor is easy to describe: it's not there. It takes more than being stupid and unrealistic to make good humor. This show is an example of a good idea ruined. Watch one of Adam's other movies if you want something good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even worse than \\"Billy Madison\\"","review":"I've always liked Adam Sandler. Being a \\"Saturday Night Live\\" fan, he has provided me with some of lifes funnier moments. But unfortunately, it was \\"The Waterboy\\" that propelled him to superstar status. \\"The Waterboy\\" was a nothing of a film. When the best thing about the film is the tackling scenes, you know you've been cheated. \\"The Wedding Singer\\" is his best so far, in which he plays a \\"real\\" person with sincerity. I'll be in line to see \\"Big Daddy\\" as well, but I hope his character isn't as onedimensionally stupid and gimmicky as the one he played in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie ever to gross over 1 million dollars","review":"Adam Sandler, while hillarious in Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore, is absolutely boring in The Waterboy. The moronic plot is shared by all three of the Sandler vehicle movies to date but this one is without origionality or humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's great","review":"waterboy was great it gave all the guys who thought that they can't play football a look at just how they could go out and play i wish them luck"},{"rating":"1","title":"not his best work","review":"I was kinda hoping that this movie was so stupid it would be funny.

They are a lot less stupid and a lot more funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure it's stupid, but so what.","review":"If you want cheap laughs, The Waterboy delivers. If you want classic though provoking cinema, get The Battleship Potemkin."},{"rating":"1","title":"SANDLER IS FUNNY, NOT IN THIS MOVIE THOUGH","review":"Adam Sandler. Loved him in the Wedding Singer and Happy Gilmore. What the hell happened to him here? Just stupid, really, stupid, stupid comedy. Knocking people out in Football. Now that's dumb.

Pure classic. Many memorable scenes. You'll will laugh your socks off during some scenes and feel compassionate during others.Adam Sandler was at his best during this era along with Big Daddy and Billy Madison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughs That You Don't Grow Tired Of","review":"To this day, this is still my favorite Adam Sandler movie. Here we find him playing the misfit in a comedic analogue to \\"Rudy\\". Kathy Bates gives a great performance of the Southern Louisiana Cajun sterotype. There are many quotable lines such as, \\"You can do it!\\" and \\"Mama says that alligators are ornery because they got all them teeth and no toothbrush.\\" It follows the standard formula, if you will, of most Adam Sandler movies: The plot moves along the happy path for about 2/3 of the movie. Then there is a crisis followed by resolution and a happy ending. It's not rocket science, but it works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The Waterboy was greatly hyped, but, in my opinion, was greatly disappointing. I think the reason the Waterboy was such a big box office hit is that it came after the Wedding Singer which was a much better movie and many people thought they would get more of the same with the Waterboy. I can only imagine that the hard-core Adam Sandler fans would really like this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie ain't the devil, THAT'S for sure!","review":"This is one of Adam Sandler's best comedies. It had me in hysterics until the end credits. Kathy Bates sometimes steals the show as the mama who thinks that girls, football, and Benjamin Franklin are the DEVIL. Fairuza Balk plays her part well as the young woman who falls in love with Sandler. Henry Winkler may be past his prime, but he is still capable at giving a great performance like this one in particular. A typical cameo by Rob Schneider adds a nice touch to this movie. If you can sit through a comedy without looking for social or political commentary, then this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs up, give you meaning on odther levels","review":"The comedy was retarded or was it? Looking deeper in on this modern comedy we see that this movie has something special. I saw it recently for the second time and watched the whole thing all the way through. So, it has the ability to go through time and still be a classic. The dialogue is Freudian in context and parts of movie use surreal sequences in creative juxtaposition. Thumbs up to a movie that at first glance seem throw away worthy, but it ain't easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch it over and over again and each time laugh until your sides ache!","review":"This is my favorite of all of Sandler's movies. It is among one of the few movies that I cannot count how many times I've seen. I could never grow tired of watching this movie! If you like movies that are just plain FUNNY you'll love this movie. Kathy Bates did an excellent Mama. There are a few lines that will stick with you, and if you are like me years later will still laugh hard every time you hear them. \\"You can do it!\\" is my favorite. Sandler's character is simple, sweet, and lovable. Mama is more multi-dimensional than I expected her to be the first time I watched the movie. His girlfriend would seem like the worst match on Earth for him, but they make a great comedy compliment to each other well. The coach is another lovable character. You'll be rooting for the good guys and laughing like you haven't laughed in years (or since the last time you watched Waterboy)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adam Sandler Is THE WATERBOY","review":"THE WATERBOY is a comedy starring Adam Sandler as a backwoods Cajun man who lives with his overbearing mother and has a day job serving water to the local football team at the local college. When he gets tired of all the football team members making fun of him, he let's his rage out and tackles whoever direspects him. When the football coach find's out about The Waterboy's special 'talent,' he offers The Waterboy a chance to play football...now sit back, get something to eat, get something to drink, and prepare to laugh yourself sick! Any Adam Sandler fan must see this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh... Okay...","review":"This movie certaninly does not live up to the Sandler hype. I loved Wedding Singer... but to be honest... this movie just isn't funny. Yeah it has it's moments, and I really enjoyed Ron Sheinder as the \\"you can do it guy\\".

Adam Sandler did sooo good. If you are thinking of buying it and you like comedy BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FUNNY!","review":"Adam Sandler has a great movie here! The humor never seems to let up from start to finish! Bobby Boucher is a waterboy, who is obsesed with water. When the team he is working for fires him, he goes to a team who hasn't won a game in years. He can sack so well, he is now on the team! Well, the team now is winning every game because of Boucher.

I found the only one funny scene. This is boring. Billy Madison is alot better as well as Big Daddy and The Wedding Singer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I bought this movie from all the hype that I've read. I lasted about 20 mins before I couldn't stand it anymore! I guess I'm beyond the slap-stick stage. At least the Wedding Singer had something to offer in terms of having some kind of a plot, and something believable. And yes, I love Football, but this was ridiculous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I thougt that it was the most hilarious movie ever!!!!!","review":"I loved the movie soooo much that I went back and saw it 5 times with my friends that had not seen it yet.

I am a Fairuza Balk fan, and this is the best showing of her that I have yet to see. Bates is excellent as usual, playing an oddball with professionalism. Reed and Winkler make for an interesting mix just to see how they've aged. Sandler is not his usual \\"look at me\\" stupid that marks most of his roles, so he is bearable even for a non-fan like myself. A bit of modesty suits him very well, even if it is to display backward antisocialism.But I must reiterate, this movie is for Fairuza Balk fans! She is incredibly beautiful, and here she's not hidden by the black garb of the occult. Something about her is irresistable. I encourage anyone to watch it for her, and not for Sandler, just to marvel at a work of art. I'm saving my fifth star for when she turns to the camera while she unzips her top :-).Adam who? This is Fairuza Balk's best movie yet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie","review":"This movie was so bad, watching it was a waste of time, and Sandler wasnt funny at all"},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"watered-down\\" version of Happy Gilmore","review":"It seems that Adam Sandler took the funny sight gag of him tackling his caddy in Happy Gilmore and decided to make a feature film out of it. His stutter/accent in this film was distracting and probably unnecessary. Adam Sandler has great comedic talent, let's hope his next film rises to the potential shown by his previous, more hilarious films."},{"rating":"2","title":"very very exellent","review":"i think the water boy was the best films i have ever seen. its funny,its sad,its nerve racking and best of all is the best film in the universe if i would i would give it more 5 stars about a million or more.i recomened this film and is the best film in the universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought it would be!","review":"I've never particularly liked Adam Sandler on Saturday Night Live, but he was good in \\"The Wedding Singer\\", and I really liked him in this one!

I can't believe this film was even released. First of all, I was never a big fan of Adam Sandler (except on SNL), but WOW, was this one bad! His lame accent, his stupid outfit, and his attempt to make a good movie. Well, I don't think that'll ever happen if he continues with THESE KIND OF FILMS! The only thing worth seeing this movie for is Kathy Bates' cameo as Sandler's mother. All in all, \\"The Waterboy\\" is horrible movie, starring a horrible actor. Two thumbs way, way, WAY, WAY DOWN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Adam Sandler: Funny the first time","review":"The title I used on this review is true. It also applies to Jim Carrey. The first time you see this movie, you will laugh, unless you have no sense of humour. But after that you question why you laughed, and then not laugh again. However I gave the movie two stars because Adam Sandler is funny (just not in the waterboy) and Fairuza Balk and Kathy Bates were great. But why the Fonz?

Aparentemente The Waterboy es un buen ejemplo de que si.

Adam Sandler no sorprende, una vez mas, en un rol sin gracia al estilo Jim Carrey en The Cable Guy. Lo rescatable es, sin ninguna duda, la madre de este jugador improvisado interpretada por la genial Kathy Bates, que maneja maravillosamente el rol de una mujer sure?a exc��ntrica y disparatada.

The funniest thing about adam sandler is that the baby voice is actually his \\"real voice\\" which you hear during his off camera interviews which are few and far between because his grammer and sentence structure in real life also sounds like a fourth grader at best.

What better way to fill the football-less void than with this classic of comic cinema from the late 1990s? It goes without saying that any fan of Sandler or slapstick comedy will get a kick out of \\"The Waterboy\\". However, another demographic will surely get just as much enjoyment from it... those who love big hits! In \\"The Waterboy\\", Sandler's character delivers the most wicked, bone-rattling hits ever recorded on film. Sure, they're spruced up a bit by special effects, but damn! That water boy can HIT! Sandler's antics and interactions with the wild, whacky cast that was assembled for this gem is a real treat.

Ok recently i watched the DVD version of this film, expecting Sandler to live upto his phenominal sucess in the box office already, boy was i wrong, not only was he not funny, but he was boring. It actually tested me to see if id sit through such a badly low budget movie. Im not going to put down low budget movies, as some are good. Come to think of it theis probably wasnt even a low budget movie, but it sure could've been. I just didnt like the style, the was no real story behind the \\"funny man\\".

The movie is about a misguided kid named Bobby Boucher who lives in the Louisiana marshes with his strict mother who doesn't let him do anything but be a waterboy. Then one day at a team practice, he tackles a player down to the ground and becomes a linebacker for the team! The movie is excellent and funny as Bobby Boucher practically murders the opposing players, goes to school, hangs out with that chick Vicki, and disobeys his mother all at the same time! I also like the part when Bobby tackles his college professor during class! Seeing Fonzie as a football coach is also quite hilarious, because Henry Winkler goes from the coolest dude around to a coach known to have a nervous breakdown at any moment!

He plays the water supplier for a losing college football team. After tackling a player after he was teased, he is wanted by the coach to play. But his mother (Kathy Bates) has sheltered him because she doesn't want to lose him. She doesn't want him to play. Fairuza Balk is his girlfriend and stands beside him even though he isn't popular. Most people thought he was stupid or slow, but he really didn't develop people skills because of his mother's sheltering. The movie tries to show that parents need to let go of children a little to help them to learn to survive.

In the past this has been subordinated to character & plot. But not here. There's not much plot -- a few elements here & there -- & it never really drives the story. Far too much space is given to the standard left-wing caricature of the rich & the repetitive, boring stereotyping of 'family values' as just so much plutocratic hypocrisy. Ms Paretsky, we _know_ you hate the American rich, & they're probably as hideous as you paint them to be. But here they're just cardboard cut-out characters. And of course the book is just a long, boring wait to see just how the filthy rich committed the crime & how they'll get away with it. Plus the satisfying way in which the horrible rich are (once again) forced to cough up the money they at first (of course) refused to give.

It can't be.And it can't be that the plot so far is that the idealistic teenage heir (Romeo) of the rich bad guys--who own a not-so-veiled Wal-Mart-like retail giant--has fallen for the poor Latina (Juliet). Sadly, though I'm supposed to, I don't care for Romeo or Juliet.Nor do I care for any other character at this point, even Vic, who's doing all the same stuff she normally does (pissing off rich people, having Lotty tend to her wounds and then dining with her, taking the dogs out, arguing with Mr. Contreras) but to no end and exceptionally boringly.

Sadly, \\"Fire Sale\\" never grabbed my attention.

The Physics of Star Trek succeeds where this book fails simply because it is written by a scientist who can see the mistakes in the logic of Star Trek yet is able to admire the prescience and veracity of its many writers. X-men is mostly based on a biological phenomenon, yet this book is quick to point out how all of their powers are so mysteriously derived. And when the authors are stumped, they owe the powers to mini-wormholes within the characters' bodies. This book is interesting to fans because it features characters they know and love, but it is a horrendous atrocity to anyone who would like to ponder the origin of mutant powers.

The villain's tentacles spread through everyone's lives, yet on the surface he seems to be a respectable man. Portia, the protagonist, is the villain's daughter and the most affected. Her story is tragic and everything she does is acting out her pain. I am unsure whether her story is really resolved or not. I guess it is \\"to be continued.\\"The sex was frequent and quite steamy, and the sights, sounds, smells and visceral were uniquely descriptive. The author has a nice way with words. The only thing that distracted me was the head-hopping where the point of view would suddenly change from paragraph to paragraph.The storylines are deeply rooted, colliding and crashing at the end. More secrets remain hidden, and who knows how much more pain Portia can endure before all of it is over.Secrets was a fast read/page turner and I finished it in a couple of hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Secret's Portia's Story","review":"This book was one of my book club selections.

She said this novel was based in KitchiLand. So, I got this book without asking what it was about or in what genre it might land. And like high flying ducks over Leech Lake, it takes a while to land. But when it does, it is a wonder to behold. It's about life. And death. And the bonds we make on our journey between the two.Author Nathan Jorgenson has taken major artistic liberty with Walker geography. We do not have a street named \\"Main Street, \\" the main street - named Minnesota Avenue- does NOT abut the Lake and there is no such restaurant/bait shop there. Some of the characters in this firstbook lack depth and explanation. But those are small fish compared to this monster Muskie of a book.

Set in the north woods of Minnesota with the outdoor lifestyle of hunting, especially duck hunting, as the string that ties the story together it is not a hunting story.

I really only got through half of it, but I could see it wasn't going to change, and moved on to another read. It began to turn into a romance novel with some hunting trips thrown in.

The characters don't develop themselves and the reader does not get to imagine what is going on around the characters - because the author spells it out for you! Every nuance is decribed in detail. I did think the interaction between the 2 main hunting buddy characters was pretty accurate, but the level of detail everywhere in this book was stifling.

BTW, they all liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and cliched","review":"To be honest, I didn't even finish this book - that's how bad it was. The writing is on par with a sappy romance novel, ie, dialogue is stilted, character \\"development\\" is attempted via point-blank statements rather than the characters' words and actions, and the story itself is cliched and just plain silly.

The organization of the topics, the method of presentation, historical background at the beginning of each chapter, lucid examples, comprehensive and detailed proofs for almost all Theorems, useful MATLAB exercises for almost all the computational methods presented in the book make this book very suitable for classroom adoptation. Datta has given lots of good references (books and journal articles) at the end of each chapter, which are useful for further research on the major topics. It is a very nice and well-written book.

I had high expectations of this one because of how good those two were. To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. Billingham really did not seem to know where he wanted to go with this one. Is it a gangster book or a serial killer mystery? And where does the 'burning girl' of the title fit in? The banter and investigative wit that was evident in the previous novels were totally absent here. Thorne and co. barely seemed interested in the case (or cases) they were supposedly working on. Definitely a blow to the Tom Thorne novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a big fan of organized crime books and this one is no exception","review":"Even characters I liked didn't save this book from the tedium of organized crime. If this weren't part of a series, I wouldn't have read it, but I like to read series in their entirety, so. . . I thought the parts focused on figuring out who set Jessica Clarke on fire were interesting, but not enough to make the entire novel.

I can see that it will lead to more angst in Tom's mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Burning Girl","review":"Every one of the Tom Thorne mysteries that I have read have been outstanding.

His own mother dropped out of high school in grade ten when she got pregnant with him, and his father left both of them before Dylan was even born. Hostility and mutual blame bounce back between Dylan and his mother. When Dylan is kicked out of his house and lands up on the street, his day to day survival is portrayed in searingly real terms. It is all the more powerful because Dylan seems like the kid next door. I could imagine my own son or other kids I know in Dylan's situation, which is of course the author's intent.Read this book.

Here, the author's glowing nostalgia mixes easily with sparkling snow of the story.

However, apart from Updike's literary marvel, I came away entertained and impressed, but not profoundly touched."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mixed Bag","review":"The conceit of Greek mythology in this novel sometimes subtracts from the plot. Here, Updike is trying to create a Joycean novel with a Bloomian Every Man at its center. Despite the sometimes artificial feel of the trick, it sometimes works. Updike is able to paint, in very subtle shades, many degrees of feeling between a father and a son. The Greek myth as the counterpoint to this primal relationship may add little to this great work, but it doesn't necessarily detract from it; one can always read the \\"mythology\\" a little more quickly than the other finely written sections on what it is to be human and to struggle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa...","review":"I was in a senior AP class last year in high school.

Although it was well read, it was very difficult to follow as the narration jumped from past to present (to what from some perspectives is the future) and from the father's view to the son's. Add to that bites of greek mythology, that did not tie very well to the main body of the novel.I also grew weary of Updike's far reaching literary blather, such as the twigs on on the snow were calligraphical, and using the word \\"ambrosial\\" numerous times.I felt the book was weakend by the forced interweaving of a Greek myth that most modern day readers aren't familar with.

One of the cotter pins had been pushed too far in and so it interfered with the cage. I had to manually bend it open to fix this.Actual use was pretty simple and it DOES pick-up nuts. My daughter loved using it. But after just two or three uses, when I spread the wires apart to empty the nuts out, they stayed open. This makes the tool useless, and I couldn't fix it. I ended up returning it.The construction is very cheap. The central wheel is a rough cylinder of wood, and a single coil of wire is wrapped around it, held in place by a cheap metal pipe clamp. The whole thing was painted green, seemingly with cheap spray-paint.

However, as a scholarly work, it fails to answer the question it seeks to demystify. Basically, it says that nationalism rose in industrial societies where people \\"needed\\" a new standardized form of identity -- which the \\"high culture\\" of the nation happily provided. It is a great macro-theory, but when put to the test of historical evidence, it falls short. Why do people love and die for particular national identities? If they just needed some modern standardized form of identity, most any form that enables dynamic communication and interchangability in society would do. In short, Gellner fails to take into account the specific historical cases where group identity, rooted in previous historical experiences, has acquired a national character that has withstood enormous historical changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"Though Anthoney D. Smith and others have attacked Gellner's classic work, it still remains THE book explaining the birth of nations. In brief, Gellner's theory holds that the rise appearance of capitalism made national formations necessary. When people from radically different \\"low cultures\\" came together in the new industrial cities of Europe, a cultural bond became necessary. Grouping society into national units served this need by creating \\"high cultures\\".Smith, who provides the principle opposition to Gellner's theory argues that nations \\"have navels\\"--that is, they are created from previously existing \\"ethnae.\\" Unfortunately for Smith, historical evidence actually suggests that nations do not, in fact, have navels. Thus, Gellner's theory is correct. Well written and accessible to the non-academic, Nations and Nationalism is a must read for anybody concerned with the creation of the most important political ideology in the world today."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what you would expect","review":"i ordered this book, anticipating it would be a humorous gift for someone who likes to take and read in the bath. the book is not a medley of sensous stories. it is a how to book, ie, how to fit two people in a bath, what oils or other items can be added to a bath to sooth and relax. also, the size of the book is a joke. it is two inches by two inces and an inch thick. overall, a very misleading title and disappointing purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"According to Chitwood, salvation is conditional","review":"Chitwood is a prolific author of the \\"Word of the Kingdom\\" movement.

The ghastly trenches of World War I were never more alive than in Testament of Youth, which might seem amazing, given that the author is herself far removed from the war. That, to my mind, is the genius and the beauty of the book -- it conveys like no other the terrible lifelong pain and tragedy caused by war for those who lose their loved ones. Vera Brittain never got over it, and you will never be able to forget her grief and strength if you read this wonderful book, which few Americans seem to be acquainted with."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"This book was the subject of a PBS drama in he early 1980's. However as good as that BBC television play was the book itself is far and away a better experience. If you are interested in the \\"Great War\\" and it's effect on the battlefield and Western culture then this is a must read. Vera Brittain was born into a upper middle class British family, exactly the generation that so willing risked their lives for their Country, King and Empire. The effect upon her, her family and friends as well as her generation is overwhelming and gaves a human face to the great events of this last century. You will not be able to read this without feeling the overpowering effect that the Great War had on those both at the Western Front and at home.

So far, this is undeniably the best. Brittain's book really is a testament to future generations about the \\"Great War\\". The content is far too diverse to summarize in a few sentences; let us just say that Brittain managed to capture the spirit of a whole generation.I might add that I think that World War One is the perfect showcase of a futile conflict. Those dealing with world war literature would do well not just to read the literature of one side. For the American reader I can recommend Remarque's \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" or (less known) Kraus' \\"The last days of mankind.\\"In fact, many of these authors (and also many of the war poets) voice the sentiment that the real enemy wasn't the soldier in the opposite trench - it was one's own general staff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still relevant","review":"I am fascinated by what led up to World War I and the events during and the minutae surrounding it. Like Robert Graves' fantastic Goodbye to All That, Vera Brittain's work speaks for her generation, for her class, and for her sex. The work is engaging and honest, and with her use of her own diaries, Brittain has remained as true as possible to how she felt when the events were actually happening. I highly recommend it to readers interested in personal accounts of the war, those intrigued by late Victorian and Edwardian middle class life, and students of early 20th century feminism. This is one of the best non fiction books I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves Wider Readership","review":"This is a fascinating, insightful book that it would behoove many of us modern folk to read.

This book, sweet liar, was the first, and the best romance I have ever read. Since I read this book, I have read hundreds more, and none can compare. I have read Sweet Liar so many times, that the pages are worn, and the cover has fallen off. All of Ms. Deveraux's novels are good, but this one is her best. It is suspenseful, romantic, an all-around Great book. A must read for romance lovers. True to form, her characters are amazing, believable, and charming, the kind of people you wish you could know. Mike and Sam sweep you away on an adventure you never want to end, and thankfully, Ms. Deveraux mentions them again in other stories, (She includes them in both of a Holiday of love and a Gift of love, which are collections of short stories.) A great plot, lots of charm, and hot romance, this is a great book"},{"rating":"2","title":"enchanting","review":"my roommate and i are avid readers of romance novels, lending each other our new purchases (after reading them first ourselves of course) rather than buying duplicate copies of great books. but this one is an exception. from the very first page to the last, i was finally brought into an understanding what it truly means to have a book that you \\"just cant put down.\\" i could not recommend a book any more so than this one! do yourself a favor, when you get this book in your hands, make sure you dont have anything planned for a while..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the BEST book!","review":"From the moment this couple meet, they show great passion. The storyline is very interesting too. She is trying to find clues about her grandfather. She stays with him, and he helps her gather information. I loved this book. It is a must-read for any romance fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"great love story","review":"If only every woman in the world could meet up with a Michael Taggert. I once actually knew a real person by this name (now deceased), and although he didn't fit the description of DeVeraux's Michael Taggert, he was a handsome man and a fine human being. Unfortunately, unlike DeVeraux's fiction character,I don't think he was nearly as financially fixed or debonair as her Taggert. But then isn't the hero in most romantic novels supposed to be rich, handsome and debonair. Readers have come to expect it. Regardless, DeVeraux's talent shined through with Sweet Liar. I recently went into a used book shop and found several of this author's hardback books, which I purchased and brought home. Sweet Liar caught my attention first and I'm glad that it did. I really enjoyed the trying times of Samatha Elliot. And like all love stories are supposed to end, to no surprise this one ended happily. To romance readers and DeVeraux fans, this one is a keeper. Go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooring","review":"Based on the good reviews here and on .co.uk I downloaded this to my Kindle and now I would like to find out how to delete it. I found the plot seriously dated, the heroine's attitude irritatingly prissy and illogical and the hero was just a cookie cutter character and one-dimensionally nice. It read like some school girl's attempts at novel writing, nobody's feelings or actions made much sense but because we were told we were supposed to believe. The gangster plot was ridiculous and convoluted and frankly the whole thing went on too long and was boring beyond belief. At one point I thought that it must surely be nearly over and when I checked I'd only gone one quarter through it. Finally I skim read just to see what happened in the end. Maybe it would have been a better read in the 90's but frankly it would still have been badly written in the 90's even if the social attitudes would have made more sense read in context. I really regretted time wasted reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Liar is Great","review":"This is one of my favorite Jude Deveraux books, besides the time travel ones. I would definately recommend this book because it intertwines mystery with romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Man!","review":"Honestly, could there be a more perfect man than Mike Taggart? Ms. Deveraux really outdid herself this time! Her words bring such vivid pictures to mind that I can see visually everything that is going on. I love Mike's tireless pursuit of Samantha and how he gets when he finally gets her in his arms. It's a very touching story of finding out who you truly are and it's done best when there's someone who loves you by your side. A definate keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"No ... thats all I can say ... No","review":"I've been a fan of Mrs Deveraux, she writes most captivating novels to make my imagination in utter delight, but unfortunately this novel did not do it for me this time.I tried so hard to get into this book and give it a chance, after all it has 4 1/2 starsbut Samantha just so totally got on my nerves she was too dis-trusting and just such a flake!

Another great book by Jude Deveraux.Couldn't put it down, I enjoyed the references to the old days."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's not to like?","review":"I truly enjoy Ms. Deveraux's books and one of the main reasons is the happy ending. No matter how bad things are/get for our main characters, I know that all will be well in the end. More and more, happy endings in real life are rare so when I pick up a book, I want that happy ending. The fac that she references La Reina in the book is a nice connection. As long as she keeps writing, I will keep reading.Vlasta"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was good","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. I've read this author's books for years and usually always enjoy them. Just fun-loving with some mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet Liar","review":"I bought the book used, at a great price. I'm a Jude Deveraux fan, but this is not her best book. The main character has \\"issues\\". I'm reading until the end, but only for closure.

All sushi recipes have photo's and at the beginning of the section there is a step by step guide (with photo's) on how to roll. Excellent book for a person getting into sushi."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful book","review":"The photographs in this book are beautiful. Some of the directions are a little hard to understand, giving both too much and not enough information. For example, we're told to adjust the amount of water used to cook the rice based on, among other things, the age of the rice. But more water for older rice? Probably, but maybe it's less?This is a minor flaw in an inspirational book, showcasing the visual appeal of sushi. There are also helpful notes on traditions and ettiquite of preparing, serving, and dining. Many of the dishes are unusual or unexpected, especially the fruit recipies. We haven't prepared any meals from the book yet, but the instructions seem consistant with our limited experience of preparing sushi (vegetarian and cooked versions at home, and raw in a cooking class). I admit to being nervous about preparing raw dishes at home, but even if we do not, there are plenty of recipies to keep us busy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible book for those wanting to learn the \\"how to sushi\\"","review":"After this book all you have to do is create your own combinations. I have hundreds of cook books but, this is the only one I need for making and understanding sushi. If you are an expert perhaps this would not be so exciting.....aside from an accomplished sushi master....... I loved this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice book","review":"a good book. It explains sushi etiquet. and gives a good explanation how to make them. I realy liked this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely pictures","review":"The explanations are pretty good, but what sets this book apart is the pictures: large, beautiful and varied. After reading reviews for this book and for the rather unlikely Sushi for Dummies, I elected to purchase both, this one for illustrations and admittedly decent content and the other book because, after all, \\"dummy\\" pretty well describes me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unhappy With This Book It has None Of The Main Roll Recipes","review":"Today I received this book it has none of the main sushi roll recipes (spicy tuna roll, normal california roll, hawaiian roll, tiger roll, dynamite roll, pizza roll, crunchy shrimp rolls, etc. etc. etc.) mainly vegitarian rolls, and sashimi.It does have nice pictures too bad it doesn't have good recipes.

This book is a great investment for the sushi lover. The author's recipes are complete and her directions for making sushi are impeccable.Especially helpful were her directions for making sushi rice - it came out beautifully! She provides instructions for making perfect rice whether you have a rice cooker or not. This was especially valuable because you do not need \\"special\\" rice for making sushi (I've seen so-called sushi rice in grocery stores for ridiculous prices!).The most difficult part of the process for us was rolling the sushi. She explains how to do this very clearly.Overall a great book with gorgeous pictures and helpful directions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read pictures.","review":"I am beginner, so this book had great pictures and was very easy to read.

The volume has been prepared for English-speaking readers who could not care less about the variety of fish available for sushi. The \\"selecting fish\\" section consists of TWO pages! That's it. The most basic Japanese terms -- uni, toro, hamachi, etc. -- are nowhere to be found. Anyone visiting a sushi bar in NYC would be baffled by the extent of the selection. This book provides no help. In spite of the colorful photos, a total disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, nice pictures!","review":"This sushi book was very complete.

It was given as a Christmas gift and the receipent was very pleased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very complete coverage of Excel","review":"Running Excel 2000 provides a very complete look at using Excel in most day to day situations. The general usage information is well structured and each topic is covered in detail.For me the real value in this book comes from the section on analyzing data. The author discusses the worksheet functions but then delves into common analysis situations. Their coverage of financial analysis discusses all of the different financial functions and how to use each of them. The statistical analysis section talks about each of the different distributions supported and when each should be used. Finally they present a what-if analysis section that shows how to use Excel's solver and scenario manager.The book even touches on Visual Basic, but only enough to get your feet wet with Excel's macros.All in all a very good book.. much more than I was expecting from a general \\"how to use Excel\\" book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke quickly","review":"I bought the flystepper because it was advertised as being consistent with the more expensive Sharper Image stepper. It was not. I had a sharper image stepper for over two years before it was broken in a move. I had the flystepper for three weeks before the plastic parts that made the stepper move broke into many, many pieces. The calorie/step counter no longer worked after five days.

I am very glad I didn't save it for his birthday. First and foremost, Lightning McQueen doesn't come with this playset! You have to have a spare Lightning on hand for your child to be able to play. I'm not sure how Mattel thought they were getting away with selling a playset touted as \\"Lightning McQueen's action-packed home on wheels,\\" without actually including a car for a child to play with.Secondly, the \\"amenities\\" are seriously lacking. The \\"7 play features\\" are simply levers that move in different directions.That said, Mack himself is well-done and is a nice size for little hands. It's not a huge toy, which doesn't make it a burden to store.I, however, would not buy this toy again, nor would I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours of fun","review":"My two year old loves everything about Cars, and Mack is by far the greatest addition to his collection. He got it about 2 months ago, and he still plays with it for hours every day (which says a lot since he has tons of toys). We just gave one to his friend for his 4th birthday, and the friend just told us that it's his favorite toy, as well.The inside of the cab is designed as Lightning's apartment, complete with lots of little tiny parts that are loosely attached (his toothbrush, hose for his water bottle, etc). This is not a toy for \\"very active\\" children who are in a destruction phase or for those with babies nearby because the little pieces do pop off and could become choking hazards. Our pieces have easily popped back on, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun For Toddler","review":"My 3 yr. old son absolutely loves this truck. He plays with it daily.

It looks great but the truck has a lot of little pieces that pop off and and can be reattached if they are not lost. The truck is REALLY hard to open and all the pieces have to be tucked in the right way to close. I find it hard myself to open. It is poorly designed. My son would have enjoyed a much simpler version of this truck. Perhaps an older child would find this toy less frustrating. I also wish they made it more durable like the cars."},{"rating":"1","title":"i would NOT recommend this toy","review":"We are pretty big fans of the Cars movie. We have all of their little metal die cast cars. I thought we would add this to the collection. My kids got it for Christmas and it was broke within 5 minutes of opening it. The plastic is really cheap. the toy is not well made at all. I was really disappointed since all the die cast cars have been well made. This toy was a piece of junk. It went in the trash the first day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely a waste of money","review":"I bought for my 2 years old boy and one small piece had been broken within 2 weeks. And my son seems not to be interested on it after a few days' play. I seldom regret so much.Yet the difficulty of opening the truck is a good design. This make sure that my brutal son plays the inner part only with the permission of an adult. Thus, the risk of damaging the components is somewhat lowered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the age group on this toy","review":"I got this toy from Amazon for my B/G twins because they love the movie Cars. My kids are 35 months and that's younger then the age requirment on the toy. But it's to easy to break. My daughter pulled off one of the foam car wash rollers and was chewing on it. The door on back comes off easly all the time but it can be fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much","review":"The items does not have to much for my son to play with.

The Kindle version is terribly formatted."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"We loved \\"One Hundred Hungry Ants\\", written and illustrated by the same team, but \\"A Remainder of One\\" is flawed by having language that is more advanced than the mathematical skill it is intended to teach. I would recommend it for a child who is advanced enough in language to have no problems with the meanings of words such as \\"former\\", and \\"infantry\\", and yet slow enough in math to need the lesson that 25 leaves a remainder of one when divided by 2, 3, or 4, but not 5. I spent more time explaining to my six-year-old child that the sergeant is Joe's boss, and that \\"former\\" means what he used to be but no longer is, than I spent on reading the book! The attractive block-print illustrations lack the clever jokes of those found in \\"One Hundred Hungry Ants\\", as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction to division","review":"\\"A remainder of one\\" is a good introduction to division. Second graders enjoyed the story yet the concept of division was too advanced for them. Third graders were intrigued by the explanation of division through out the book.

Overall a good book to read- it keeps the students intrigued and keeps them thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book","review":"The storyline of this book is adorable.

I haven't particularly noticed a stability problem (Win2K SP4 + OP12 SP1/2). However, the deal with the PDFs is this: when OP12 reads an image PDF, it will only save such PDFs as grayscale (if you ask for image/image+text), and OP12 can only save grayscale/color PDFs at 150dpi. Hence, if you have bi-level input PDFs at >150dpi resolution, you get enormous, ugly 150dpi grayscale output PDFs. On the other hand, OP12 can handle high resolution TIFFs just fine (i.e., it will save them as image/image+text PDFs with the correct resolution).

Sorry, but not many undressed middle-aged people can convey an alluring sex appeal in the presence of youth without revealing an obvious predatory motive.All of the performances were excellent. Unfortunately, the story stunk. But then, years ago, after John Irving gagged me with the first one-hundred and fifty pages of The World According to Garp, what did I expect? For John Irving fans everywhere, go ahead and eat it up. For discerning film viewers everywhere else, ask yourself if there is a scene in film history more unbelievable than the endlessly grieving Marion(Kim Basinger) seducing a young man who was around the same age as her deceased sons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"The Door in the Floor is the worst film of 2004. I was expecting a seductive and tension-filled drama but all I got was adults acting like petty children. Kim Basinger performance is so wooden and Jeff Bridges is just terrible. Elle Fanning is the only actor who shows promise (the younger sis of Dakota Fanning). This film comes off as a heart tugging drama and then all of sudden tries to be a dark comedy.

The plot insinuates all over the place, but leaves all factors dangling except for a truly heart-wrenching bit at the end when you find out how the crucial deaths occurred. If you are not asleep at this point, you will scream obscenities, I guarantee you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This ain't the John Irving from Cider House Rules","review":"This is simply a warning for those of you, like myself, who absolutely love \\"The Cider House Rules\\", and are interested in seeing what else John Irving has to offer. This film is an adaptation of Irving's book, \\"A Widow for One Year\\". As with all of Irving's works, he loves writing emotions. This film deals primarily with the emotions of sensuality and sexuality and with a swift broad jump, crossed my comfort line quickly. The film is getting mixed reviews, some overwhelmed by Jeff Bridges' performance, others appalled by the lewdness of the film. If you want to see Bridges act, there's plenty of great films out there for you to enjoy. Take a pass on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enigma, but worth seeing","review":"I hope you have the same type of experience I did with this movie. At times it seems outrageous, and other times subtle in it's representations of soul-wrenching sadness.

Parents lose teenage sons in automobile tragedy (been there done that); young aspiring writer comes to aid alcoholic and philandering children's novelist and ultimately falls in love with the novelist's wife (Summer of 42?); little girl whines and squeals about the pictures. Based on John Irving's novel, the movie moves so leisurely and has such little \\"oomph,\\" one can only hope the movie pays off in the end. For me, it didn't. Kim Basinger sleepwalks through her role; Jon Foster adapts an arrogance unfitting his limited knowledge of the world; and Mimi Rogers gets to show her boobs, butt and other vital parts, and run around chasing Bridges with a knife.

Does she need money that bad? Her breasts are super saggy and her pubic hair is unattractively shaved so it seems to reach up to her navel in one line. Why in the world would anyone submit themselves to this on film?Tom Cruise's first wife has always been a mystery, with her strange, twisted mouth. When she was younger, she got away with it, but it is just sad now.Then there's a scene where Jeff Bridges has to be nude in a scene with a female child. That must have been tricky to film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did it say R rated?","review":"The mainly reason I put only one star, it shouldn't be saying \\"R\\" rated when there too much of nudity and a child would say thing to daddy \\"your p_en-- ...\\" go figure! Yea!!! he does let daughter see him naked but what is that? It is really tacky. I consider it as a child abusive or incent. She aint even a baby.There also a young man shows how he mastubrates twice and few sex goes on. I really don't pay attention later on, because it is just so senseless with a lot mature things going on.It should be in XXX or something. It aint something you would want watching around kids, It definetly aint a romantic movie. Its scene only happens for a few mins then profanity/sex such as nudity goiing on longer. It happen over again after normal scene. So don't watch aroung anyone that is uncomformatble w/ nudity. You never know when it may pop up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different but Good","review":"If you are shocked by sudden unexpected scenes of sexual nature, you may find some parts offensive. This film says a lot about loneliness, desire, love and loss. The acting is marvelous. An egocentric novelist played by Jeff Bridges is the central character. His \\"strangeness\\" reflects on everyone else and makes for a cast of characters who are not quite psychologically upright. We feel for the characters as they try to right their wounded lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explores the raw pain of marital dysfunction","review":"I remember how searing and raw this film was when I first watched it. Kim Basinger and Jeff Bridges do a remarkable job of showing how a happily married couple can fall prey to blame, guilt, shame, drinking, infidelity and more after a tragedy befalls them. Having another child does not make the situation better, either. Everyone suffers in the end. Still, it has bits of humor and unpredictability that make you want to keep watching. Little Elle Fanning, who turned five during the filming, possesses a lot of gravity and sadness for one so young. She is never annoying the way most child actors are. Also watch for Mimi Rogers as the woman Bridges has an affair with, at least for a while.

It absolutely captures the visual sense, the emotional tenor and the bizarly acceptable first 200 pages of the book. They go together beautifully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't do justice for the novel at all!","review":"The door in the floor is based on the novel, \\"A Widow for One Year\\" by John Irving which was an amazing novel and one of Irving's best to date. The book is broken into three seperate sections, or time frames, and \\"The Door in the Floor\\" covers the first section, or more elaboratly, the first 100 or so pages of the 500 plus page book. For the section of the novel that was covered in the two hour movie, it was a great movie, however this is the type of movie that really irritates avid readers who like to see the characters they read and love on the screen. The movie doesn't even touch on 400 plus pages of the novel leaving anyone who read the novel bitter and wanting for more and for those that didnt read the novel there is a sense of wanting as well as the starting section is a huge build up to what is to come latter in the novel that viewers will never know about or how important what they saw really was."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor copy, not a used original","review":"The video came on time and undamaged.

Most of the story could have been written in two long chapters and a lot of if seems to be filler. While the story has an ending, it was sort of unsatisifying as if there will be a sequel in the future. To be honest I cant make heads or tail of this book. I sort of liked it, but it was too short, too much of it dealing with the sexual escapades of the principals and then seems to end at the point where it could get interesting.If you like the Conrad series, I would buy this book just to know how the time machine came to be and who is Conrad's American cousin.If you never read the Conrad series, please dont read this book until you read the series first."},{"rating":"1","title":"adolescent male fantasy","review":"At least the Conrad books had an interesting hook to them. Modern engineer back in medieval Poland, with only 10 years before the invasion of the Mongols. The big weakness was that everything went so smoothly for Conrad, so there never was much tension in the plot. And the endless supply of young women who wanted to have sex with him became boring (even maybe to him!).This book, a \\"prequel\\" of sorts, has all the weaknesses of the Conrad books and not a single one of their strengths. If you contrast it with a good book about the invention of time travel (eg. Thrice Upon A Time) it also loses any interest it might have been able to generate due to the subject.If you are a 15-yr-old boy who can't get a date, this is the story for you. Otherwise, give it a skip.

The adhesive holding the fastener to the front and back is weak, causing the fasteners to fall apart. Also the coating does not cover the tips, where I most frequently experience cuts on my fingers. Basically, this is a cheap piece of crap. The other folders have the fasteners woven into the actual folder so they don't fall off. They need to improve the coating on this product and make it so the fasteners don't come off. Sometimes folders show up without the fasteners at all because they're already fallen off before they are packed into the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the faint of heart","review":"I took a data strutures course that used this book.

You have to rely completely on your instructor to spoon feed you the explanation and if your instructor sucks, then you are out of luck.

I had a regular 60 watt bulb in the coop, but it was so bright the chickens couldn't sleep at night, so I searched for something with less light, but strong heat. This fit the bill perfectly!!

However, I was disappointed that this is not really a book about \\"No Money Down Franchise Financing\\" at all. The first half of the book talks about basic business plan development and the second half talks about different sources of financing. But it approaches the issue of financing at a very, very basic level. In my opinion, a lot more attention should have been given to describing what lenders really look for and how to effectively structure your balance sheet, partnerships, etc. The section on SBA loans, for example, is dreadfully thin and, what's more, I have not found anything in this book that really truly explains how to get \\"No Money Down\\" financing. The issue of collateral is only briefly touched upon (a major obstacle for most borrowers). In summary, this a good business planning book for beginners, but a creative financing book it is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too flowery without substance","review":"This is written in very flowery language without getting to the point.

It's locking steel blade make it all around a perfect knife, and it has held its edge for years. I usually sharpen it about once a year, but it's rare that it actually needs it.

However, this may be one of the worst albums ever made. First of all, Brian's voice...What was once a beautiful instrument is now an emotionless drone devoid of all feeling. He sounds like he's had a stroke. And it's not his age. Paul McCartney is the same age, and can still sing as sweetly as he ever did. His contribution to this album sounds like it was phoned it. Why bother? The layered harmonies are even more disturbing. The songs are sub par, to say the least. How can Brian's people sleep at night knowing they allowed this sad, pathetic album to be released?"},{"rating":"1","title":"You must be kidding!","review":"I can't believe how bad this album really is. Lyrics seem to be written by a child, and the music is forgettable. If this is the best he can come up with after a 6 yr lull, give it up. The master in masterpiece is gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This is my least favorite Brian Wilson solo cd. It just comes across very flat with no real energy. The only highlight is Eric Clapton on \\"City Blues\\". \\"Soul Searchin\\" may have been a nice idea but lifting Carl's Wilson's voice just does not work. I was looking forward to hearing the collaboration between Brian and Paul McCartney. \\"A Friend like You\\" is a very ordinary song and McCartney should have been used more. Also, the few seconds you hear McCartney it is obvious that Paul's voice has aged better. Finally, Brian is one of the greats and I am glad he is still creating music. It is just that this is not one of his better efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brian is back...again.","review":"Some casual Beach Boys fans (and casual Brian fans if there is such a thing) may be a little put off by the childish undertones to some of the songs here. That said, Beach Boys/Brian fanatics are in for some great music. \\"Make A Wish\\" Carl Wilson's beautiful \\"Soul Searchin'\\" and \\"A Friend Like You\\" featuring Paul McCartney are some of the stand out tracks. This is not Pet Sounds, SMiLE, Today or Sunflower. However, it is some beautifully honest music from THEE pop music genius of our time. What he's endured is nothing short of amazing and he finally sounds comfortable in his own skin. Congratulations, Brian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album","review":"This is a good cd, contributions by Elton John and Eric Clapton are a plus. My favorite songs are the last 3 songs which I would rate them as better songs than \\"How could we still be dancing\\" and City Blues. Carl's contribution in \\"Soul Searching\\" is something any Beach Boy fan would cherish and A Friend like you is a very personal song. To really appreciate this cd you need some headphones and play it over and over. Instrumentation is very rich, something new is the violin and harp parts and how the vibes, piano, flutes, harmonica, keyboards, brass etc are played like colors in a great painting. Buy it if you really have time to listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guess this makes me a \\"synchopant\\" too... :)","review":"... but I think we have a classic here.

Clapton could have stayed home too, and unless you're Nat King Cole, well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss the old Brian","review":"I did not purchase the CD but listened to the samples, so this isn't an altogether fair review. After listening to the samples, I was happy for Brian that he can still churn out some fun songs, however, the voice is no longer appealing to me and I won't be spending any money on the albums. I miss the Beach Boys sound from the 60's and 70's and will continue to enjoy that era's music. I feel a bit guilty for abandoning the contemporary Brian's music, but people and times change and we sometimes only want to visit the past. However, he is to be praised for what he's given to popular music and the sweet memories he's provided."},{"rating":"2","title":"ear candy at its best !!!!!!","review":"It is so refreshing to hear music again! No, Brians voicedoesn't sound like it did in 1965 (who's does?) In fact Brianhimself has said he has lost the timbre that he had then.But the man can turn a song can't he! Hooks, chords, key changesthese songs have it all. Try \\"Don't Let Her Know She's An Angel\\"and the title song for starters. And he's singing harmony too!If you would have told me in 1980 when I saw the Beach Boys inconcert with Brian wandering aimlessly backstage that one day I'dhear this I wouldn't have believed you. Rock on Brian !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brian is back......thank God!","review":"Brian Wilson returns with his first new studio CD for six years and it's been worth the wait. The voice may be a shadow of that in his youth and every day may still be a battle but this is why this record has to be appreciated. Listening to Elton and Brian sing \\"How can we still be dancin..\\" has you asking the same question whilst the genius of Brian Wilson shines through on the true gem on the album, \\"The Waltz\\". This song wouldn't have been out of place on \\"Smile\\" and it not only has a brilliant tune but the lyrics are full of humour. With Brian toruing again this summer and autumn and a studio release of \\"Smile\\" coming out this is a great year for us fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brian Is Back","review":"When I saw Brian Wilson in 2000 for the unexpectedly wonderful Pet Sounds tour, he promised that his next album would be good old rock n' roll. \\"Gettin' in Over My Head\\" pretty much delivers on this promise. No, it's not as good as Pet Sounds or the upcoming, and very belated release of SMiLE (assuming it's as good as the live recordings I've heard), but it's right at the level of Beach Boys albums like Summer Day (and Summer Night's), mixing a few bona-fide classics with some amusing filler. \\"How Could We Still Be Dancing,\\" \\"Soul Searching,\\" \\"Gettin' in Over My Head,\\" \\"City Blues,\\" and \\"Desert Drive\\" all deliver on the promise of Wilson's genius (even if it's no longer contemporary). The other tracksare a mixed bag, but they manage to create a satisfying album. This is a disc for the already converted, but it's light years beyond the crumbling Brian Wilson of the 1980's. We should be happy that Brian's back and making great music again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I'm probably the biggest Beach Boys fan I know...but this to me was VERY disappointing...First, I've never heard of a singer songwriter who turns the first two songs over to other lead vocalists...and, sadly, the second song, \\"Soul Searchin'\\", is both the best vocal (by Carl, not Brian) and best written song (co-written with Andy Paley) on the album. The 'superstar' duets are the lowpoint, with it being a close tie between Brian doing the 'blues' with Eric Clapton (?), elton John's 1974-sounding pastiche and a wasted use of Paul McCartney's talent (a big fan of Brian). I happened to listen to Brian's first (self-titled) solo album, which made this PALE in comparison, from cover to singing to songwriting to production! Andy Paley, we need you now!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor Has No Clothes","review":"Brian Wilson is a living legend. But if it was anyone else releasing this album, it might have been rejected by the record company. The one high point is Carl Wilson's lead vocal on \\"Soul Searchin\\" ( check out Solomon Burke's version released a couple of years ago). Wilson certainly deserves all the accolades that have come his way in the last decade, but this is sad and sometimes painful to listen to.

She's better at the extremes, but perfectly adequate as actor and dancer in this middle ground. If you've seen samba, you'll find that the one referred to in other reviews is really nothing special; the terrific dance routine, also mentioned elsewhere, is the solo by Marc Platt, itself worth the price of admission. Hayworth always did her best dancing with a partner; sadly, later vehicles, like this one, had her without one.

Unfortunately, the author spent a great deal of time conversing with his future selves and past selves (time travel) as well as talking about being a tree in a previous life, leaving his body when he wished, and other topics that I found not only annoying, but also interrupted the flow of the book and muddied its message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love is Simple -","review":"I have read this book at the perfect time, a time when every word held soaring relevance to my life.

I am in love, very much in love, and I have all my life believed I would find my soul mate, but this book makes me embarrassed to have ever been associated with such an idea! He has obviously given hope to thousands of lost and lonely souls, however, who are now probably wandering around starry eyed and bumping into telephone poles looking for \\"that perfect someone\\".

The pictures in the book keep things even more interesting and serve a great purpose as tools to teach and explain to the reader how the theory directly applies to the pictures being taken.For me, the only way a book like this is worth it, is if it helps me improve my pictures. The pictures I was taking before reading this book were terrible. It still looked like I was using a point-and-shoot camera even though I was using a new DSLR camera.

Not only does this work inform, it entertains at every word along the way. If this was the first history book that everyone read they would never think of history as dry -- it is simultaneously informative and like eating fine cuisine at that same time.

Influences are fine, but I can't listen to this without feeling sick at how not only the overall sound of the band, but all the little things that sound like jawbreaker. The guitar riffs, bass riffs, the vocal tone as well as the melodies. Right down to the jawbreaker-esque drum fills. Now, I know Jawbreaker isn't the most original band in the world, but they definitely have a unique sound that you can tell right off the bat that it's them. You might call it a \\"signature\\" sound. Slowride has blatantly gone ahead and created musical forgery.

The dreamy vocals over the pulsating beats and oneiric melody line remain as irresistible as ever. Donna Summer was part of an electronic music trend in the 1970s, also represented by Giorgio Moroder, Cerrone andSylvesteron the dance side and by Kraftwerk, David Bowie,Suicideand others on the rock/experimental side.

Be aware that the book has numerous factual errors. For example, Meredith says that the W113/Pagoda cars had black engine compartments, including the underside of the hood/bonnet. This is WRONG. Those areas should be the same color as the exterior of the car. There are other errors as well.

It has a few pages on supplemental lighting in case you want to add some of that and some info on gazing balls etc. Pages 18-30 talk to specific plants and then the last pages are on container moon gardens.

I workout on a regular basis and was hoping to add dance into my routine to change things up. However, this was not the DVD to start with.The other reviews did a good job of explaining the different sets on the DVD so I won't talk to much about those. i will say that I feel like I got the best workout from the first routine, the Latin routine, which was focused on abs. The other two didn't do much for me.But the real issue I has was not being able to keep up with the steps. I am no a dancer at all, but my sister has been dancing all her life and is in a show choir now and she had a hard time keeping up with the steps. Often times you only see the steps once before you do them at tempo. I also felt like I needed a lot more space than would be available anywhere in my home.If you want to learn the dances this may be a good DVD for you. If you are a beginner or are looking for a good workout I would suggest skipping this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"Somehow the creators of this DVD managed to find BORING latin dance music!

They are telling me moves to do, but for the life of me I can't follow along. This video would be SO much better if they would take the time to show you how to do the moves slowly before they start bouncing across the stage. I was hoping this would be fun, but instead I'm just frustrated.

Verduin successfully seperates the wheat of peaceful Christianity from the chaff of civil-religion and demonstrates how vastly more wise step-children can be from parents. Anyone who has ever been surrounded by a person who believed they had a divine mission to govern the world will get a kick out of this book (no pun intended). A must read for religious libertarians, but be prepared to have your saints soiled. \\"The Reformers and Their Stepchildren,\\" reads like a horticultural digest, and Verduin, the Sunday morning tv-religion gardening expert, demonstrates that in the war between weeds and crops, you better be scared.

The video is blurry, out of focus, grainy, and the worst I have ever seen on a DVD. There are numerous skips and stops, and I don't think those are due to damage to the DVD. I think that's just a part of the production quality. I've never seen anything like it, except maybe for a home-made VHS video on overly-used tape.

This movie stole nearly two hours of my life I will never get back. This movie was utterly terrible. Where do we start? OK first the camera work was shoddy. The script was the worst piece of dung I have ever witnessed. The acting was vomit worthy, seriously this bunch of actors makes Britney Spears and K-Fed look talented. The set's were cheap and the worst I have ever seen in my life. The special effect's where where they? The director and the producer's must have been nut's to think the abomination was even good for a B movie. I could go on for hours about how terrible this movie was.

This is the worst movie I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply AWFUL","review":"I gave this one star only because I coudn't give it anything less. This was perhaps the worst film, even by low-budget horror standards, simply for the fact that nothing ruins a production faster than bad acting and bad dialogue. And this film exhibited both. The dialogue, the writing, the acting, especially the lack of character development, which did nothing more than to create an ensemble of pasteboard characters, was so poorly done that I would have to say that this was written by fourth graders for third graders. **Seriously, even if you like low budget horror films no matter how bad they may be, stay away from this one.

Then during the 50's I saw The Return of Monte Cristo (1946) on TV and enjoyed it as much, if not more than the original movie. For fans of the Dumas story, there are 4 must have movies: The Count of Monte Cristo (1934), The Return of Monte Cristo (1946), The Count of Monte Cristo (1975 Richard Chamberland) and The Count of Monte Cristo (2002 James Caviezel).

As hero Stone Hopper (Taylor Kitsch - John Carter) and his naval buddies do their duty for country and for Earth against mysterious aliens, the action builds with the technology of both sides providing spectacular effects. The film makers did a decent job of including the human elements of heroism, duty, humanity, and humility, as the characters fight the aliens in bigger and bigger battles. When the battleship Missouri is brought into the conflict, you can't help but feel proud that a few of these awe-inspiring ships still exist.

There were amusing and entertaining parts of the movie, and the effects were really impressive and reasonably believable.

This movie tried too hard.","review":"This movie was so bad I walked out of it and I haven't done that since Vanilla Sky.There was a scene in the first half of the movie that went on for probably 20 minutes - where all that stuff is crashing into the ocean, into the ships, etc. It just went on forever and ever, just for the sake of what was supposed to be terrifying. It wasn't - I just wished it to be over so we could get on with the movie.The acting was amateurish and unbelievable. Everyone on the ship looked like an idiot who didn't pass the 4th grade.This is the type of movie that would appeal to junior high to high school and those with minds like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than I thought it would be","review":"I didn't honestly think this would be good because of the fact it is a movie about the battleship video game and because the critics bashed it but in all honestly after seeing it, it was not bad at all as a matter a fact it was entertaining to me!

Taylor Kitsch started out as a hippie who has disappointed most everyone time and time again, and later on saves the world and became the hero. How predictable is that!Things I don't get:a) how was he promoted so quickly in the Navy?b) how aliens who has technology to travel light years can't figure out our \\"Art of War\\" strategy?c) why the alien's weakness was so easily unraveled?d) how the Missouri and crew were so easily moved out of the harbor? How was the ammunition obtained?e) why the aliens didn't have their own long-distance communication device and had to use ours?f) if extinction was the goal, why won't the 3 alien ships just blast away all the destroyers trapped in the hemisphere to begin with?Verdict: not the effort to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battleship","review":"Story, lame.

Oh, and by the way, the ship was completely filled with live ordinance. One Veteran even said he was \\"Ready to rock and roll???\\" Give me a break! How many 70'ish veterans do you know that go around saying that... even those who are not U.S. Veterans.

Hooper (well acted by Taylor Kitsch), who is facing a less than stellar future. Things definitely change when scheduled War Games get interrupted by alien invaders bent on establishing a foothold in Hawaii.Over analyzing why the aliens didn't use their vastly superior technology in different ways will take the fun out of this feel good movie.

It's a good idea about aliens responding to our signals then invading the Earth. Too bad they didn't use competent actors, more realistic characters and dialogue, as well as character development (come on, a 20 ish unemployed, loser, alcoholic bum all of a sudden a US Navy Lieutenant with 3 rows of ribbons in charge of the Weapons system on board a DDG) Nahhh!! Very poor movie. If you want my Blu-ray copy with the extras disc, etc and are willing to pay the postage I'll be glad to send it to you.

I found the story line to be disjointed and without believable continuity. Anyone who has knowledge of any warship decommissioned and now serving as a museum knows all major mechanical parts have been disassembled, the 16\\" guns have been permanently plugged and all ammunition has been removed long ago.Also the aliens had placed a force field around their position, only the three guided missile ships inside the field where able to engage the aliens. Yet the Missouri was able to engage the aliens when it was not inside the shielded area before the force field was dropped.There were many more inconsistencies which combined gave me a very disappointing viewing experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've been Decked!","review":"Great movie, especially in HD!

I think it has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzz.......","review":"Disturbingly predictable even down to the dialog! We were quoting the movie lines before they were spoken! Terrible CGI, acting and script. Truly a movie marketed for 11 year old and younger boys. Pete Berg is better than this! C'mon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This one Sunk","review":"This movie is bad. The script, acting, editing, and cinematography were all awful. I get the idea of bringing the board game into it, but it's way out of the box and totally unbelievable. The only points it gets is for some of the special effects (I almost believed some of what was on the screen). But just as soon as I get into it, Some bad editing ruins the moment. 1.7/5 Stars. Don't waste your time (unless you really love Rihanna)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome messages","review":"Humans send out a space bound hello and welcome. Aliens send a crew to mop up humans and send a message home when it is done. The Navy is running games in the ocean near where the aliens land. Some of the ships are caught in an alien perimeter. One of the Navy men is a bit of a non-conformist which usually causes him problems. He gets extremely angry when the aliens kill his brother. He and the remaining Navy people, along with his g/f and a man who is learning to use artificial legs set about to make this raid on Earth as difficult, read here impossible, for the aliens as they can. There is a lot more to this movie than I have put here. This is just bare bones. It is an entertaining movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I heard","review":"I had seen horrible reviews for this movie. It was not groundbreaking in any sense, but I found it witty at times. The special effects were cool, and it was just fun to watch with my wife and daughter. Lots of action and good for a little escape from daily reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battleship","review":"Battleship received a lot of bad reviews from the press and from some movie-goers. This is not meant to be an Oscar-caliber movie. It is pure fun and entertainment. I rented it looking for enjoyment from an action movie and I was not disappointed. Sure you needed to suspend some level of belief - it's about aliens invading Earth. You don't need to nitpick the details of the plot. Overall, it was a fun movie to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boringly inaccurate CGI fest that's not worth your time.","review":"Lots of action, not all that much plot. Most of the story line gets lost within what action sequences that take up the majority of the film. Originality is definitely lost in the beginning of the movie where an actual youtube video of a guy breaking into a store is \\"remade\\" into comedic relief for this flick. I couldn't believe it. Shot for shot, frame for frame. I hope the criminal who suffered through the original robbery actually got some money put on his books for it. Or perhaps the convenience store that first posted the video got some sort of royalty. I highly doubt it. This movie is also considerably inaccurate about shipboard situations and how sailors actually react in the Navy. But then, It's a movie. You only need 3 people and a couple extras to simulate a ship run by hundreds of people on a daily basis in a movie. Right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"ACTION packed..!!!!","review":"...in the genre of hostile-alien-earth-invasion flicks, this one ranks in the top five...!!...the special effects were top-notch and the futuristic alien weaponry was very believable and not as far-fetched as most Hollywood productions go...my ONLY complaint was the very little screen time that was afforded Liam Neesom, as he is a truly powerful screen presence, and I thought he'd have a bigger role defending us from the newest crop of humanoid oppressors.GREAT flick...!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A turd of a movie","review":"The script is so predictable it's not even funny -- Pearl Harbor with Aliens, and to make sure it's not offensive, there's even the Japanese Navy helping the good guys. The first 5 minutes give away that you are about to utterly waste your time with this one. Sadly it's not bad enough to be funny, it's just plainly mediocre. Not much to say about the actors' performance because it's so formatted, it makes Transformers 3 shine in comparison.Abysmal; you've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battleship","review":"This was so an awful movie! I was really hoping to like it seeing as it was filmed in Pearl Harbor where I'm stationed in US Navy but it was just too outlandish to go with.

I'm one of those people who makes up my own mind and doesn't rely on critic's reviews. I went to the movies to see this because I like Taylor Kitsch, who plays the main character. He was on Friday Night Lights. It also stars Liam Neeson. With those 2 guys, how can you go wrong?This movie made me laugh, cry and kept me on the end of my seat. As soon as I left the theater I knew I was going to purchase the movie. Watch it with no other thought than to have a good time. You'll like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I didn't think I would like this movie but because of Taylor & Alex were in it I thought I would give it a try. Rented from Redbox Tues and loved it! With the exception of killing Eric Northman :) My favorite parts were when they got help from the old timer vets and the old battleship.

The story is laughable, derivative and falls flat on its face. The two redeeming features were watching Rihanna and the (presumably) CGI Battleship. This film tries to be a summer blockbuster exploiting the proven formula of predecessors such as \\"Independence Day\\". However where Independence Day had a witty and at times quite clever script along with over-the-top acting, memorable characters and outrageous CGI, Battleships had none of these attributes. It is plain stupid. Liam Neeson, who is an entirely believable Command figure, is completely wasted in this miserable production. I did like Rihanna but I really can't say she was given an opportunity to prove her acting abilities. I do hope we see her in more films. Message to Hollywood. You need to cast your net wider for engaging stories, and stop poaching the talentless writers from the SyFy cable channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corney plot. Alien space ships are rediculous.","review":"It took 6 hours to download this movie to my TiVo. I couldnt watch it when I wanted to and the movie had an amateurish plot. The alien spaceships are some combination of snake and alligator that jump through water like a dog trying to swim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best visual effects since the Transformers franchise","review":"OK, I'll fess up, I'm a big fan of movies with stunning visual effects, almost to the point of forgiving a cruddy plot and low-budget acting. I thought Battleship might be one of those that needed a lot of forgiving. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The story line was engaging and the actors brought believability to a very fantastic premiss, particularly surprising given the thin acting credentials of some of the main characters. Over all, a great 2-hour escape with solid acting and superb production values. We streamed it first, and liked it so much that we bought it and watched it again two nights later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally entertaining....","review":"movie is wall to wall action - a good flick.

Good solid flick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and your mind from going to mush!","review":"Cannot believed how much this movie sucked! The best part of the movie (spoiler alert) is when the retired navy came and helped saved the day.

Was willing to over look some silly things. However, without giving away the story, the scenarios are so completely unrealistic as far as the personal relationships, how the Navy works, and just common sense. It just ruins it. Everything Taylor Kitsch touches since Friday Night Lights seems to be just awful - John Carter anyone?Clearly the movie was not reviewed for any concept of common sense. Even Liam Neeson couldn't keep the stink away from this movie. A little bit more effort they might have had a decent movie. Wait until it hits the dollar bin at Wal-Mart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another sci-fi movie that fails to deliver.","review":"Really, aliens who fly all the way here to destroy us will be much better at it, again. Everything in this movie is only OK. As a whole it adds up to less than OK.

I didn't think the story line was going to be cohesive and just thought this movie was going to be some good eye candy.I was pleasantly surprised and I like the movie a lot. It was a bit slow in the beginning, some of the characters (as opposed to the actual actors) were a bit over the top, but seeing Brooklyn Decker always keeps me interested. I even caught myself pumping my fist in triumph when the good guys succeeded (trying not to spoil anything here, so I'm being generic)!I would watch this movie again and again and recommend it to anyone interested in seeing an action movie.I can't wait to get it for my step-father who's a retired Navy chief.

A few cool scenes, but for the most part this was a fairly lame film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Visuals .... And Nothing Else","review":"I gave this 2 stars because it is pretty to look at. Other than that, expect a litany of cheeseball one-liners, a whole lot of predictability, and ridiculous acting. As far as the plot goes, this movie offers you everything you've likely seen many times before. There was no real attempt to give you anything new in that development. I'll admit I didn't expect much from Rihanna branching out into acting, but it was still a little disappointing I just couldn't help it. She didn't offer anything to the movie by her being there other than throwing her out there like 'Here, have Rihanna.' And if her role had been entirely removed from the script there wouldn't be a hole left behind.Don't expect there to be any memorable characters in this movie, but in the fashion of Transformers, if you enjoy CG explosions and little else, some parts of this you're bound to find entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The trailer was excellent, the movie dismal. I was surprised liam neeson was in this poor film. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better than expected","review":"Okay, to start with I expected absolutely nothing from this movie. I bought it with the full and absolute expectation that I would get nothing out of it but a waste of two hours. What a shocker. It was funny, entertaining, enjoyable, well done and over all not bad. This movie will never win an award or critical acclaim, but that makes it all the better IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"BattleShip","review":"I liked this movie, but it still did not have the on the edge of your seat from beginning to end that I like.

Yes, there is a lot of logic left at the door but this movie isn't about that, it reminds me of old Will Smith 4th of july movies that were just meant for fun.THIS IS AN ALIEN INVADES THE WORLD MOVIE!!! for all of you that don't understand what that means and actually think there now has to be every piece of logic explained to you.This was a fun watch and a good time. Simple yet spectacular.If you liked Independence day, John Carter, and #1 or #3 of Transformers. You will like this movie.But please don't walk into it with a bunch of questions.....just enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brooklyn Decker's breasts...and some human vs alien stuff","review":"Plot? nope. Character development? nope. Things blowing up? yep.Willing suspension of disbelief is severely tested in this one. Aliens are basically the same as the aliens in Independence Day, albeit a little less goopy. One scene featuring a captured alien is pretty much stolen from ID:4. The Mighty Mo still has live ordnance on board??One redeeming quality: Every time Brooklyn Decker runs, it seems the camera angle changes to get a bouncy cleavage shot.overall an amusing 2hr diversion, provided you don't have high expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Special Effects - The Plot was awful","review":"The special effects were excellent and that is why I gave it 2 stars, however, the scenario was completely unbelievable.1. Burglarize a convenience store, get tazed by the cops for running from the scene...2. then, at the request of your brother <who just happens to be a Ship's Commanding Office> become a twice promoted naval officer...with a felony burglary on his record.Oh, did I mention the reason he broke into the Convenience Store??

And YES, you too will be cheering at the final battle scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really, really good","review":"It's a lot of fun to watch and producers, director and actors went all the way out.

What was I expecting, this is a movie \\"inspired\\" by a board game that I played when I was a kid back in 1978. My primary mode of transportation back in those days was a Schwinn Stingray. I really tried to like this movie. The action sequences were very well done and the special effects are FLAWLESS. Especially the scenes where the CGI Battleship U.S.S. Missouri fires on the alien Mothership. However, the cliched hero, the hopeless dialogue and the typical stock characters just made this a bad Transformers rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad...It's good","review":"This movie may well become a cult classic. I watched- no endured it, and then found myself talking about it for the next week.The first 15 minutes were genuinely funny, I completely enjoyed the beginning of the movie, but as it continued, I was amazed at just how bad it got.The acting was so bad, that they should give Oscar's to the actors for their impersonation of actors.The scene where the disabled vet asks the girlfriend, \\"How good are your driving skills?\\" made me laugh out loud for days, but I don't think it was meant to be funny.And, Rhianna just wasn't credible as a military weapons specialist...But having said all of that, I am now thinking I should watch it again... and I will say that the SFX were definitely impressive, but as a previous reviewer said, you can't allow yourself to think when watching this movie, or it will most definitely ruin any possibilty for enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battleship","review":"I liked it when they got the USS Missouri out to finish the job!

We missed it on the big screen (cue the screaming baby), so were eager for the video. To our surprise, it was much better than we expected from the previews. The plot is pretty good. Great action, although it does get a little Transformers-esque over the top a few times. Fun characters with enjoyable dialogue, which for me is what makes a show. We liked it enough that we rented it a second time to watch with friends. If you like Sci-Fi action with some jokes, this is for you.As a warning, while waiting for Battleship I rentedAmerican Warships. It is a bootleg version of the same plot (using a WWII museum ship to fight aliens) but with cheesy acting and almost no special effects budget. I would only recommend it if you enjoy MST3K-ing movies. In that case, American Warships is a prime candidate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transformers in the ocean","review":"Battleship is a thoroughly enjoyable movie. It is true entertainment. Don't look for any depth in the plot or characters; don't have any expectations that this movie will have a profound affect on your philosophies of life!

I've really liked Battle - Los Angeles and was hoping for more of the same type of action. You won't really find it here. The action is too far fetched to be anything but laughable...but then, maybe it was supposed to be comedy. I guess I like my action to be just a little more realistic - I mean, come on, get an old battleship commissioned and ready to fight in hours - it would take months if not years. And to run it with a handful of personnel - impossible. The script was 'see-thru', you knew what was going to happen in the movie from the opening scenes. Guess I was just expecting more.

I have never, ever, felt so cheated out of my money or time than at the end of this pathetic excuse for a movie. ANYONE who rants and raves about its qualities, and/or gives you a detailed plot description is a movie spammer, paid to write reviews. I am a 37 yo male, who went with my 26 yo old brother to this flick. We love action movies, super hero movies, war movies, apocalyptic movies...you know, man movies....action, guns, fun movies. Smart movies and no-brainer movies. This, this movie is so, so, so bad we were appalled we stayed. I can not over-state the HORRIBLE-NESS of this movie.And to emphasize this point, I have taken time from my evening, with my wife, before watching another movie, to finally write this stinking review. Go ahead, don't believe me, spend your _.99 they want for it, you'll see. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining!","review":"Good thing I was not dissuaded by the \\"professional critics\\" to stay far away from this movie. Sure, this is no art movie and it is not the best movie ever made but I enjoyed every minute of it, well almost every.To me, the acid test of a good movie is how quickly time flies (during the movie) and when the movie is about to end, I'd hope it'd run another hour or two - in my book, this is one of those movies.Yes, this movie could have been better, have fewer holes, have more \\"soul\\" and not so bloody loud but still it is good enough for now... till The Avengers?Bottom line: This movie sure kept me wanting more... like Battleship II and III!P.S. To give you an idea if you should give any weight to my \\"review\\"... I loved Source Code, Iron Man (Iron Man II not so much), ID4, The Incredibles & The Rock. Absolutely hated Inception and True Grit.

No acting to speak of. The two women are known for singing and posing for SI respectively, and can't act. First forty minutes could have been eliminated since this isn't From Here to Eternity, but a vehicle to use special effects and the characters being 'developed' have nothing to do. Liam Neeson, who is great in action flicks lately, basically has a cameo. The only thing that 'caught' me off guard was when the guy in charge of the Hawaiian communication site (I thought the most interesting character) was stealing something (not sure what), and the alien lets him go...with a nod to ET. Best laugh for me was when the hero gets a silver star. I'd of thought he earned the highest award possible for saving the earth, but maybe that's just being picky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome! Fun! American! Proud! Watch and enjoy this movie...","review":"I should have purchased this movie when it first came available. Hello Hollywood! Don't be the first blockbuster of the season, the looser cirtics was laying in wait. FUBAR to the early reviews. You critics are children who have no ability to put together the layers of this movie. I am 52 years old, far older than the ignornat critics who couldn't understand the complete beauty of this movie. HELLO! lame-critics! Are you too stupid to recognize the actual war heros that were HONORED in this movie! If you listen to the critics but are a proud and older American, watch and LOVE this movie..."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as advertised but GREAT","review":"I bought it because i expected a transformers spin-off but it wasn't. Thankfully it wasn't a GI Joe spin-off either, or so i guess since i couldn't watch more than a few minutes of it--no army officer can or will walk around with a day beard without reprisals.Anyway back to Battleship, i say it is a mix of Steven Spielburg and George Lucus with James Cameron directing. It starts out fairly slow, 20 minutes or so, enough it made me wonder about its a value, but it is worth it and understandable when BANG it takes off with the best alien vs. man fight ever, or so i think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faux Michael Bay","review":"A poor man's version of a Michael Bay movie (except it's even worse than that). Ineptly directed and yet inexplicably arrogant about its own virtues. A real head scratcher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish the movie...","review":"Not quite sure what direction they wanted to take with this movie. It was a love story/drama/action flick and all around cheesy film. The story itself doesn't come clear until about 30 minutes into the movie. By then, i was totally uninterested. Concept is simple. We (humans) beam messages into outer space. Eventually they get an answer. From there, it's pretty cut and dry. Hostile aliens, etc., etc. Even though they had some decent action and good actors like Liam Neesen, they still couldn't save this sinking ship. And Rhianna's role was laughable at best. Overall grade is D-. Rent it if you must see it. Not worth a buy. Glad i didn't see this debacle in the theaters. I would have walked out. I couldn't even finish this film. I stopped watching at the hour and half mark and fast forwarded some parts at that. I had enough of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a great choice if you like alot of action and no story.","review":"My headline pretty much sums it up. I mean I like action films but this one only has action. Oh, and gratuitous shots of big-breasted women.While I saw that some of the reviews of this movie were bad, I figured Liam Neeson is in it so how bad can it be. He usually doesn't pick bad scripts.Boy was I wrong. Without much meaningful dialogue, it was very hard to follow this movie. I did watch it to the end just to give the movie a fair shake. But even at the ending credits I was just left scratching my head. I didn't like Cowboys & Aliens either but at least I could follow the movie.If you're looking for another aliens vs humans aka Independence Day-style, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battleship","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

It seemed an awful lot like a transformers type movie. I think that even some of the sound effects were the same. But overall this is just a plain no frills action movie.

The only guy they may be to take is Orlando Bloom. Rhianna is ridiculous as she saves men that weigh twice as much by simply pulling them up and shoving them as if she has the strength to do it. Even better, when punched in the face repeatedly by a super robot with super metal fists, she simply shrugs it off and gives the big meanie a dirty look.The effects are over the top silly. If it was not for Brooklyn Decker, I would have turned this garbage off.The nod to the WWII Vets was the only good part.Hollywood makes real garbage lately.

What kind of person says they like a product without even using the thing? Well, he can play with his little chain. I've used these cutters. For average steel, the monster leverage will slice through like a hot knife through butter. So, a standard chain is easy game. But put the blades against a relatively small 1/2 inch thick seriously hardened steel bar and you'll end up getting dents on the surface of the cutting blades. The design of the cutter is ok in most respects other than this serious flaw of inferior steel in the cutting blades.You get what you pay for. If you're the type that buys quality, move on. Don't buy this. I'd normally give the cutter a 2 star because it has some utility.

She particularly stresses the lifelong relationship between Chirf Justice Burger and Blackmun which changed from a mutually adoring friendship to an ideologically competitive one, finally culminating in open rupture. Had she included interviews of other justices or friends and family members, would the book have shown more dimensions of Blackmun's life and also been a bit more of a page turner?Probably the strongest point in the book is her emphasis that the original majority (7-2) decision handed down by Bluckmun on Roe vs Wade was not about a woman's constitutional right to have an abortion but about a doctor's constitutional right to practice unfettered medicine.

But W.H is a masterpiece: a work of genius, which the \\"Jones\\" novel is not. The way W.H is written is profoundly difficult:the third-handed report of second-hand accounts.

But they're also released so that her fans can continue to enjoy her magic, especially in the concerts many of us were unable to attend. So in that spirit, I bought Spread Your Wings and Fly, and I think it was in that spirit that it was released. It's quickly become my favorite of the live albums I own. Maybe because it's so intimate a performance, just Laura and her piano with an appreciative crowd. Maybe because it's got such a range of material. The 12 tracks contain 17 songs (a few are medleys), including 6 covers, 2 originals never released elsewhere (the title comes from the lyrics to one of these, \\"American Dove\\"), and spanning 5 albums and 10 years. Maybe because it's just more of Laura's magic, which I cannot get enough of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving all the Live Recordings made by Laura Nyro","review":"I am a big fan of Laura Nyro, and have found this C.D., Spread Your Wings & Fly,and this time period to be highlights from her career.

There are also two new songs never recorded in the studio,\\"American Dove\\" and \\"Mother Earth\\" that one must hear, and best to listen to with headphones.

Trading off long battery life for the vibes would have been worth it to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable achievement","review":"This controller works as well as the wired ones and it also appears to be just as durable. Moreover, the batteries don't need to be replaced very often. For an additional 5-10 dollars, it is definitely worth choosing this controller over a wired one. In my view, this controller is a huge advantage for the Gamecube over the other platforms as wires no longer takeover my TV room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Wireless Now!","review":"The normal controller was already the greatest one ever, until Nintendo decided to make it even more perfect.Now we've got the Wavebird. An enhanced version of an already perfect controller.When you buy the Wavebird you really can't play with the other Controllers anymore, because it's so good to be wireless! You can move much more, if you have quick movements while playing, the wire won't pull the GameCube and many other advantages.Yes, the Waverbird Controller is a little heavier than the normal one, and bigger too, but don't worry, that's nothing when you're playing.The controller has sixteen frequences, so if you're playing with a friend with another Wavebird Controller, you guys will not control each other's characters, which would be funny but really disappointing.Overall, this Controller is much better than the normal, even though they're both awesome.I just wished Nintendo could put out more colors for the Wavebird, because I don't like grey. But that's nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"a gamer","review":"Works great and the best part is there is no cords to get tangled.

We have to be very close the the game cube for the controller to work. So we don't use it, instead we gave it to our 2 1/2 year old who pretends to use it. Instead of the wireless, we use the wire controller with the optional extension cable. We also had trouble with wireless internet in our house, so I guess for some reason our house is not very wireless friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mama Gamer","review":"I was worried when I bought this controller. I thought it might have problems if you were not facing a \\"specific\\" way. Boy was I wrong!! It is FANTASTIC!! I have bought two of these now, and plan on buying a third. They work just as well as the corded ones, and you can sit in your recliner without putting the console on the floor. Love it!! My only gripe is that they should come in cool colors!! I am sure that they will soon!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise","review":"I know what most people think of one they think of wireless controllers. They think back to the NES days when you got one based on a bad Ad from a comic book and the darn thing had to be an inch away or it wouldn't work. The wavebird, however, is amazing. The GC doesn't even have to face me to work. While this might not be a must for everyone, the layout of the room my GC is in makes this perfect for me. The only, slight, detraction from the controller is the lack of a rumble pack. On the other hand, I don't miss this feature at all. Running on only two AA batteries, this is a great item for someone with a few extra bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poo on Known Gamer","review":"Known Gamer, who wrote the review below, is an idoit! The Wavebird looks amazing! the only thing he's right about is that ign is the best source for info.

EGM said that when it was first shown off, it was used facing awaw from the gamecube from like twnty or thirty feet away, and thee was no delay! that can't be bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Controller, a Solid Investment","review":"Out of all of my controllers, this is my absolute favorite. Forget the PS2 controller, forget the Xbox S, and forget the normal Gamecube one. Wavebird is the way to go. With its compact size, and no lag whatsoever, this is a truly revolutionary gaming controller. Sure it takes batteries, but all you have to do is replace them when the run out, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out how to open a battery slot. The freedom from cords is intoxicating. Once you use it, it's hard to go back. After using my Wavebird for the first time, I found it hard to use my PS2 controller; I couldn't lounge on my couch while playing! I know, it's so sad.If you have a Gamecube, give up the [$] and get yourself a solid piece of gaming equipment.-Out"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the controller!","review":"The new Wavebird controller is a dream! You can be up to 20 feet away from your system and still be able to play. There is no wire for you to trip on and plus there is 16 frequencies so friends can play with Wavebirds too. I use this to play before I goto bed or just lounging somewhere further away. I might have five controllers now, but this thing was worth the investment. It reacts just like a regular controller, but there is one thing wrong. There is no rumble feature so it gives it more life. That isn't really a bad thing though so its really really worth it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This wirebird rules!","review":"I was showing my dad the wirebird. First, I turned away from the gamecube. It worked. Then, I turned the gamecube the other way and I turned around so I was facing away from the tv. It still worked. No matter where you are in the room it will work (within 20 feet.) even if the gamecube is facing in another direction. If you dont have it, you MUST buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is The Wavebird Worth It?","review":"I heard about the Wavebird on 5/22. Now, even though I only have two controllers, the cords of the two get tangled up frequently. Not only that, but they get tangled with the two other cords on the Gamecube. When I heard this controller was wireless, I was very ecstatic. But I hadn't seen a picture yet. When I saw the picture, I was not pleased. I hate X-Box. Don't get me wrong, because I know its a good system, but I hate the controller. Its too big. This controller looks about the same size as it. But you should never judge a book by its cover (unless it shows a picture of Barney on it. In that case, tear it to pieces.) Anyway, I tried it out. It ROCKS!!! Buy it. Buy two. Its worth it. Here the pros and cons of it.Pros- No more tangled wires.Cord not too short.Cool looking.ITS WIRELESS!!Cons- Its expensive.Its big.People will fight over who gets it (or at least my friends do.)All in all, you should definetly get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"it\`s a steal","review":"I think the wireless controller is great beacuse you don\`t have tobe to close the system and get a headache like i do.Another goodthing about the wireless is that they are affordable and are durable.But I gave it 4 becuase you need to keep changing the batteries and it begins to cost money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Llewellyn Fan","review":"Richard Llewellyn came to mt attention from the film version of \\"How Green Was My Valley\\". As great as that film remains, even after reading the novel, it is the novel that provides the richness od detail about Welsh coalmining-life, but the film still provides vivid imagery. The novel, by nature, tells a more detailed and involved story that transports one to that time and place. So does \\"None But The Lonely Heart\\"; and, I have not seen the film with Cary Grant, so this experience is still better. Llewellyn is virtually unknown today, like many writers not currently on bestseller lists. So do yourself a favor and search out one of these near-obscure authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Which Version?","review":"This is a great book, but Readers, Beware: there are two versions, with two different endings--the version published in 1943 must have seemed insufficient to the author (whose lovely Welsh name I can never spell) because at some point he went back, wrote another few chapters and re-published it.

It is not 'Wicca' as an American audience might understand it, but at the very root, nature based religion. That caveat aside, this is a wonderful and gentle text for really deepening one's bond with divinity. She doesn't offer the usual love spells and magical correspondences--you can find them almost anywhere, probably on line at this point. What she does offer is a system of contemplation in service of harmony. Her meditations and prayers really resonated with me--they may not with everyone. I've always been a tad uncomfortable about the Wicca 101 \\"and now you pick a pantheon!\\" thing, and her version, which uses just the Goddess and God, spoke very deeply to me.

He certainly has proved to be a singer that can cover a wide variety of styles, from the screaming rock of \\"Steppin' Out\\" and \\"Let Me!\\" to the lush balladry of \\"First Hymn From Grand Terrace\\" and \\"Silver Bird\\". He, just sounds like he is trying to sing these songs in a....<ahem>...unique way...and failing.

Much of the vocalization nearly sounds like a drag queen trying to imitate Carol Channing. This is definately one to pass on, but DEFINATELY pick up his \\"Arizona/Silverbird\\" two-fer from 1970-71, that shows this man in his prime, with impeccable songs, great production values... and most importantly, a voice not ravaged by time and hard living."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Though I respect the NY Times for their cerebral and informative reviews and commentaries, this is not a book that is going to enthrall fans of the show.

In the end I bought the Arizona style again as its just the most comfortable for me. It takes a week or two for the soles to mold to your feet so they feel a little funny at first, but within two weeks they feel like part of you. All pros and no cons for me.

Pick size, pick width, pick color and material, but no options regarding the footbed. So now I am packaging them up and sending them back, which is a waste of my time. Yes, I am annoyed because I think this is deceptive. Amazon should get it right. The reason they are cheaper may very well be because, in general, people don't want the Soft Footbed, so they are trying to get rid of them.

In addition to that on the average 99% popped. The Black Jewel had like 25% not popped and anymore then 2 min in the microwave made it burn. The popped kernels were very small, hardly nothing to eat.

I ordered 6 bottles based on statement that it contained the original ingredient Phenyltoloxamine Citrate; it DOES NOT---it has diphenhydramine (Benadryl). It's bad enough that you can no longer find the original, but to falsely advertise the original,only to ship the \\"replacement\\" is worse.

Then Hannemann can step in and release a charity CD to raise funds, but more importantly ... awareness.Hanneman is a tremendous instructor and talks to you in a language you'll probably recognize.

A proper diet, including an adequate consumption of protein, and enough sleep are the best supports of a healthy lifestyle. Even though my diet has always been smart, as an athlete, it is difficult to take in enough protein through food alone. Thus, along with a diet of chicken or salmon and vegetables, I add Rose Acre Farms' Dried Egg Whites to my fruit and yogurt and my banana smoothies.

Unfortunately, I gave up the struggle in 1975 and did nothing about it until 1992. From then on, I slowly managed to desensitize myself to the world outside of my neighborhood. I can now make trips of hundreds of miles without a reaction. It is my own fault for not trying harder or sooner.

The author is down to earth and even funny (\\"index finger constantly poised over the pulse...\\" You who are suffering will understand this) and knows just how to describe this horrifying condition.

I found the mask too bulky, making it very difficult to position comfortably for side-sleeping. It also wasn't particularly comfortable even when flat on my back. I had ordered a \\"Sweet Dreams\\" mask at the same time which worked much better for me (thinner construction made it easy to use for side-sleeping). I've since purchased the \\"Twilight\\" (also a thinner design) which is even more comfortable and room darkening for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for stomach sleepers!","review":"I bought this thinking that for $30 this must be a really special sleep mask.

It is pricey but well-packaged and well made. It's very comfortable although the velcro strap is kind of strange but again very effective. I never forget to put it on at night. There's a soft roll of cotton padding all around the edges of the inside of the mask which serves multiple purposes - it makes the mask very comfortable, there's no sweat factor, and you can open your eyes with the mask on and see utter pitch black darkness. While the mask is extremely lightweight and doesn't feel like a burden at all, it's still bulky and I find it hard to sleep on my side without knocking the mask off kilter. Because of how it moves I can usually see some light eventually, but I'm just one of those tossers and turners. Overall I think it's quite great, amazingly comfortable and highly effective in terms of blocking out light.

It follows Mace who lost his wife to an accident but isn't convinced about the corporate line he is given and continues to dig into the details. Along the way he meets an interesting woman who unknowingly embroils him deeper into the past.The story is well-paced and is just the right mix of tech, human emotion and mystery to keep the pages turning.

Well-established American Indian authors are already naturally suspect of any newcomers on the scene; the sad fact is that for some reason Native American culture and identity is misappropriated by more misguided white writers--whatever their individual agendas might be--than any other race or ethnic group. The sad truth is that, for every Forrest Carter and Timothy Barris who manage to secure a publishing contract, there are dozens of truly deserving Native voices that are going unheard.And thanks to these imposters making the buying public- as well as agents and editors- increasingly suspicious of anyone claiming to be Native American-their chances to be read and heard are only going to diminish."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shameful fraud","review":"I read this book last year, and was moved by it, though I often found it rather fuzzy on certain details, and the chronology seemed to jump around. Now, I learn this guy is a total FRAUD: He's not Indian and Tommy didn't exist. He's apparently lazy, too: I've read that his descriptions of Navajo culture don't fit with reality, either. This is disgraceful, both his lying about his heritage, and inventing this sick child, as well as the other people he made up. What a waste of time.So many literary frauds have been exposed this month (Jan 06). Now, I'm wondering about a few other memoirs that have been popular the last few years.

Each story he tells is not just a story, but a web connecting his own past with his people's past and the constant struggle between his white and Navajo blood. He shares his experiences from adopting a son with fetal alcohol syndrome and the joy and pain that it brought him, his own difficulties with fetal alcohol syndrome, to his alcohol tainted childhood moving around with his migrant worker parents. With every experience he draws associations with other people's struggles and it all being a part of the big picture. His writing is very beautiful and lyrical which sometime causes it to be difficult to follow, but overall it is a moving collection that is not only his story, but a story both native people and mixed bloods past and present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I would of love to really share an opinion in this section, yet the item never arrived.

Murray's plotting is fantastic, the work of a real pro, and yet it fits extraordinarily well into the known facts about how Hitler actually conducted his end of World War II (and I'm a WWII history buff). Once you accept Murray's fictional stance that Hitler was assassinated in a daring British commando attack on his personal train and then replaced by a middle-aged second-tier British actor with an amazing facility for imitating him, you're in for a wonderful ride. I was constantly kept wondering how in the world this very frightened amateur spy was going to keep up the pretense of being the leader of Germany without getting caught and at the same time keep throwing spanners into the works of Nazi war strategy. It's a great read for straight spy/adventure enthusiasts as well as very subtle alternative history.

It seems well researched historically and is an interesting what if tale.I have a couple complaints, which I attribute to whoever edited the book (if anyone does edit with an iBook deal?):1 - There are jarring changes in location in the story, jumping from one string of the story to an other mid-paragraph which made me say \\"Huh!\\" go back and have to reread of a couple sentences or paragraphs.2 - Further, in the first section of the book, which is a modern day lead in to the past tale, there are several changes in the point of view. For example, the majority is in first person, then shifts to third person to explore his thoughts/state of mind.The bottom line is that this is a great tale, but expect to have to stop and figure out what's going on occasionally.Thanks, Ricci"},{"rating":"1","title":"In the trash with you...","review":"I didn't have a problem with the story line.

I counted the times Craven mentions the status of the Soviet submarine. In chapter fifteen Dr. Craven states that the Soviet ballistic missile submarine K-129 was either rogue, or had the highest probability of being a rogue, no less than SEVEN TIMES!I'm not a submariner, but I am a retired naval officer and history buff. As far as I'm concerned, a submarine would go rogue for only two reasons, to defect or to start a war. Soviet submarine officers were the elite of the Soviet Navy, dedicated family men, loyal to a fault. I don't believe this submarine was defecting.I found that Red Star Rogue made a solid case for the failed rogue submarine attack on Hawaii. But after reading chapter 15 in Craven's book, The Hunt for Red September, I've elevated its credibility to a ranking of the highest probability."},{"rating":"1","title":"This could have been a written as a decent thriller (fiction)...","review":"Instead, the authors claim it to be non-fiction. The book is so full of technical and chronological errors (many quite basic) that all possible credibility is destroyed. For example, the book states that the one-megaton nuclear warheads carried on the K-129's missile have a yield equivalent to 1000 tons of TNT; in reality, one megaton = one million tons TNT equivalent. Another simple, verifiable error is that the authors claim that the crews of USS Parche & USS (Richard B.) Russell received awards for their part in the K-129 recovery efforts in late 1968/early 1969. These two subs weren't even built yet! Also, the authors repeatedly use presented hypotheses as facts later in the book - a cardinal flaw in any form of deductive reasoning. The end result is just populist conspiracy theory trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conspiracy Theory #1003","review":"An interesting story if you don't forget it is pure fiction.

At a time when Red China had no operational submarines armed with nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, we are supposed to believe the Soviets were dumb enough to develop a plan to fire a ballistic missile from a submarine and incinerate a US target in Hawaii with megatons or perhaps kilotons of nuclear explosives because this act would convince the US to retaliate and nuke . . . China? Ah. . . how devious of those Russkis. But my gut feeling is that SAC would have went after Moscow and Beijing a tad later. I don't think the Russkis were this stupid. Recommend someone consider Plan B. The Golf Class subs were junk. Someone or something on board this particular Golf-class sub failed; and a lot of sailors died horrible deaths under the sea. But in any event, if a sequel is planned, the KURSK disaster would make a great plot device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin on facts, repetitive, not enough glue or gold","review":"I've served on subs, read a lot of books on subs, and do a lot of intel gathering on historical and current submarine events. While the overall scenario is plausible, the author stretches about 17 facts across 300 pages. The story could have been told with just as much intrigue in a 10-page short story. I would have even rather had the author more embellish some (unsubstantiable) character development rather than repeat the same old assertions, chapter after chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent a movie instead.","review":"The many technical errors have been noted by Mr. Feldman's review. However, if the authors had wanted to write a novel, they should have. How on earth do they describe the weather, the moods, the actions of the crew without evidence to support it. Also, the Cray computers which they state the Navy owned in the 60s weren't built until the 1970s. If you want some conspiracy theory thrills, go to the video store.

I am a submarine veteran as well. It's worth the read. You be the judge about the author's plausible conclusions.The last chapter is a 'wake up' call, warning us that what may have happened then, (i.e. a nuclear attack) under stringent controls of a more or less rational potential enemy, is far more likely to happen in the present day with Islamist Fanatics unconcerned about the deaths of innocents or their own, trying to get their hands on such weapons.

It is painful to read a book so haphazard in its language, especially since it is a book about a man who was so eloquent and prolific in his own lifetime. The author spends many pages on unnecessary tangents, such as the strategic importance of the Philippines, for example.

I definately agree. Maybe if I had not read anything by this author before I would have enjoyed this book. On the other hand it is entirely possible that I would not have read her other books thinking them to be like this one - and that would have been a major mistake. Having read her previous books (the trilogy which she wrote first yet which take place in the distant future as far as this book is concerned) I was expecting a lot more. Yes, true this is only one book and not a series, but that still can not excuse the flatness of the characters and the plot. I was looking forward to reading this book on the premise that the auther would maintain her standard of writing and to my dismay I was let down.

The Invisible Ring is set in the same universe,a couple of hundred years before the trilogy takes place.

It follows the story of a Warlord Prince who must try toregain his honor and find a reason to still believe in the ways of theBlood amid the abuse and taint he has endured. I thought this book wasgood, because it shows this point clearly throughout the book. It hasadventure, magic, treasury and romance. And the appearance of DaemonSadi in the book was an added bonus.

I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The book is based in the same world and time as that of the previous books of The Black Jewels Trilogy. This is a independent 4th in the series. Unfortunately the author has been there and done that. The plot is therefor predictable and the settings and character development are both sad shadows of the original trilogy, which had both a strong storyline and unexpected twists and turns. If you are looking for something with the originality, strength, and emotion of the previous books adjust your expectations. I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a light \\"re-run\\" of the universe of the black jewels. Hey Ms. Bishop!

I had been expecting a master piece from this book the moment I laid my eyes on it, I am a big Anne Bishop fan, her books are usually detailed to the point that you find your self in them, this one was a dissapoint.

If you really want a Master Piece from this author try The Black Jewels trilogy, now THAT is a master piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"The author's first book was intriguing and introduced a few characters that I immediately wanted to read more about. I have been disappointed with her subsequent books however -- the prose is unimaginative (some words & phrases are overused) and the plots were not captivating (because they were not as tight and/or contained annoying implausibilities). I conjecture that her first book was so successful that her subsequent books have been rushed through with less revisional work than would otherwise have been required by the editorial staff. If you feel similarly about her initial trilogy, I am sorry to say that I would recommend not buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A precursor to the blood trilogy","review":"Another excellent story from Anne Bishop. The Invisible Ring is set during Dorthea's long reign and before Witch is born. There are a few visits from the sadist otherwise, it stands alone with it's own storyline and characters. Having read the Black Jewels trilogy will enhance your enjoyment of the story, but is not strictly necessary. Ms. Bishop, if you are listening we'd love more of Witch's saga. You left her barely alive. Surely you can squeeze out one more book about her and the lands recovery. Whatever you choose to write we'll look forward to enjoying it and, hopefully, many others."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it but","review":"The Invisible Ring is an enjoyable book and I advise anyone who enjoyed the Jewels trilogy to buy it. But the story is told through the eyes of the hero and I never got a chance to really know any of the other characters. And since the males in the first series had so much power, Jared seemed a bit of a weeny.My only serious problem was that I felt too much time was wasted on the bad guys. The same thing bothered me about the other Jewel books.I hope Ms. Bishop continues to write stories in this world she's created."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!

The Black Jewels Trilogy had passion and icy hatred mixed with dark obsessions and unwavering loyalty, but this strange prequelish continuation? Almost every character in this book seems like a washed up reflection of someone else in the amazing novels it's based off of. Jared seemed like he was meant to be somewhat of a mix between Daemon and Lucivar, but it just didn't work for me. He just didn't have enough... personality to carry the male end of the story.Still, I am in love with the world that Bishop has created. I forgive the book for the majority of it's rough ends. Any story even remotely related her rich, detailed world is definately worth my time.

I had been looking forward to The Invisible Ring for months before it hit the stores, and kept track of its publishing dates through Amazon.com, ( )and the Penguin Putnam publishing group--and bought it the first day it was available. While not a bad book by any means, The Invisible Ring fails to live up to Ms. Bishop's first trilogy. The characters are less interesting, and the plot more predictable. Unlike the first series that led the reader through a complicated world of dangerous predators and luscious descriptions, this one reads more like a romance novel with a fantasy plot thrown in.

Brutal set would be Kreators last full CD on a major label in America. They really only got heavier on Columbia records, which was amazing. People see 'Pleasure' as their heaviest, but i disagree. Especially given that CD's weak production. The 'Aggression', 'Coma' years were much heavier musically, and much better sounding sonically.This set smokes. Must have for metal-heads. Kreator never got their due in the states, but they were and still are great at thrash. Just great stuff. I have come to only appreciate them more as the years go on.And speaking of thrash, it doesnt get much better than on tracks like 'Agents of Brutality', 'Hidden Dictator' and 'Twisted Urges'. The straight forward stuff like 'People of the Lie' and 'Coma of Souls' is excellent as well. The lyrics didnt much matter, as this was German thrash, but the heaviness and great production and sound quality of this disc cant be denied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coma completely destroys Extreme Aggression","review":"I personally hated Extreme Aggression.

This unit is better suited as a last resort emergency device. The unit, when it got a little wet, totally died (it's supposed to be water proof!).

A call to the 800 number yielded a 15 minute wait through a local radio station's rock music,then an invitation to leave a recorded message because no tech support was available. This was three hours before the end of their day. The call was not returned by the end of their day.

Written by an Indian national, it has the resonance of that culture, which to me is unique. The story is all about Bollywood and young film-star, Ashok, who seems to happily stumble into just about everything in his life -- he goes to Bollywood, and becomes a star, and eventually also has a political career. The book combines styles, including film play format. I laughed out loud at descriptions of Ashok's movies. At the end I was left with a lot to ponder. Tharoor's subtle satire of the culture of Bollywood and the political scene of India is reminiscent of Rushdie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quotes, but ...","review":"This book has been one of my daily prayer books for close to ten years. The quotes are beautiful, powerful and short -- just right for the purpose of meditating on one per day.However, the thoughts are not in logical sequence.

Afterward, their ordeal was forgotten by all but themselves.

Unfortunately, he hasn't brought it all together in a cohesive and readable manner. His narrative often meanders on tangents that are superfluous to the story, filled with anecdotes and trivia, that while demonstrating Carlson's keen grasp of his subject matter, add little to the story of Tom Horn.

If you want to see the ultimate example of PTV in their acid house phase, this is it. This disc is part concert footage, part imagery, in one tripped out swirling video collage. Even for when it was produced, it still maintains as a visual masterpiece and is amazingly creative. I will say that it takes a certain type of person to appreciate this... namely it helps having been on drugs before to be able to relate. And if you haven't, well, watching this video is about the same thing.The only reason I give this four stars is because of its narrow audience. It's not for everyone, but very much worth it if you're a fan.If you CAN relate and you're a Psychic TV fan... this disc is a treat and a wonderful flashback to my favorite incarnation of them.

Since most American teachers will not have had training in Math Recovery, many will find this book difficult to use. It is worth the time one spends, however, because the book is filled with performance assessment tasks that can be used to help teachers uncover gaps in young children's early number sense. While the small font size and technical jargon are somewhat tedious, the book is well written and informative. I would recommend this book to teachers already somewhat familiar with children's number sense development who wish to further their learning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Numeracy: Assessment Teaching and Intervention","review":"This book clarifies what children really need to know.

You will find quite close agreement (within a couple of percent) of the odometer reading on your car and the Sportrak. Now walk the same course holding the unit in your hand. My unit would record approximately 0.8 miles on the odometer on the same 1 mile course. I have conducted this experiment with a Garmin unit (the Foretrex 201) and found this unit to have the same accuracy at walking speeds as at highway speeds.

The glossary of terms is so easy to use, and students can refer to it immediately without having that lost look on their faces.It's a great class starter for that punch of grammar without it looking like those boring grammar drills we went through in school.The material is very relevant to teenagers, and the sample work is written by students themselves which gives my students more confidence to write.I plan on using this at the beginning of the year, and carrying on throughout the year.Highly recommended if you're floundering over those class starters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love for new grammar/language standards","review":"We have very detailed language standards and this book was awesome with preparing students for our state assessments and regular grammar assessments. Love it. I use transparencies for the week, and parcel out the information weekly. Meaning I can use one page/sheet per week. You can break the information down to however you need it.ETA: I wanted to clarify that I use this for my warm-up activities and for my EOG (End of Grade) test prep sessions. I can expand on the topics and key points to my own liking, and it forces students to read material (told from their perspective), review or learn new English terms and techniques, and find techniques (i.e. metaphors, similes) and ask students to use context clues to determine/find quotes, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is alright, but not right for my use.","review":"At first I rated this a 3, but now find I won't be using it. It is not right for my use. It is designed in sets of 5, one for each day of the week, rather than 180 separate activities. The school year is not arranged in nice neat 5 day weeks. It starts on a Tuesday, and gets days off here and there, throwing those nice, neat 5 day bundles off. I went with using Daily Warm-Ups instead.My big complaint is Amazon shipping. I had free shipping, so was slower. But, when I checked 5 days after ordering, it hadn't even been shipped! So, I changed the shipping, paid and it went out that same day.

It must be said that while it covers all the major variants and it's very photo intensive, the book isn't very big and only spends a few pages on each version.I'd call this a great follow-on reference for Su-25 enthusiasts, but it's far from the end-all-be-all reference it could be."},{"rating":"1","title":"review","review":"this is a good picture book, but very little real information is provided.

In this world, laurel-wreathed maidens sit on the wooden porches of their mountain cabins, weaving their colorful tapestry and humming tales of doomed love. Nadler's second album is sparse, but the two main instruments-her delicate, yet intricate guitar and her crystalline soprano fill it up. The songs she writes are part Appalachian murder ballads, part the musings of a young girl who's absorbed the works of Poe. This dark, dreamy album is an artifact from the Bronte sibling's imagined world, full of ghastly beauty and tragic romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved everything you saw","review":"There is hardly an album these days you can listen from the beginning to the end without the urge to skip ahead some songs. \\"The Saga of Mayflower May\\" is one of the rare exceptions - when you put this disc in your player, prepare yourself to the journey to some other strangely beautiful, sad and nostalgic realm, narrated by mesmerizing voice of Marrisa Nadler.Unfortunately, the journey will be pretty short - just a bit over half an hour, which is probably the direct result of excluding any random songs from this homogeneous album.Another disappointment is the ascetic design of the CD - there are no pretty booklets or other eye candy included, just barely readable lyrics and other mandatory stuff printed in the spread of the CD case."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is good","review":"but I like 'Living and Dying ' betterI heard an interview w/her on radioShe is very shy and awkwardat one point the obviously taken -by-her -beauty DJ said-\\"so- does Marrisa Nadler have a funny side?Youre not all dark and depressing are you?Do you know any jokes?\\"\\"Yes!\\" she stammered outDJ \\"OK, Let hear a MN joke!\\"she shyly stammers out something that she already knows has fallen flat before the last word comes:\\"What did the bird say to the farmer?\\"DJ \\"Tell me!\\"\\"Nothing-it was dead-the farmer ran over it with his tractor\\" she said sounding like she wanted to melt under the nearest bookcaseTHATs OUR MARISSA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictively Beautiful Music","review":"Not since 1967 when I first bought Joni Mitchell's Song to a Seagull have I played an album over and over and over. This album is gorgeous in much the same way. While folk music's fair young maidens turn into tough old broads, it's nice to know the universe is still producing fair young maidens who know how to turn a broken heart into deleriously beautiful poetry and music. You have squint to get at the words printed in such tiny letters on the CD cover, but if you do get to know Mayflower May you will have to agree with her that, \\"everyone who feels at all has got something to say about the wayward sovereign ways of every wild day.\\" Thanks to Marissa!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken","review":"The petit fours were received on time, but 1/2 of them were broken and the fondant was cracked.

I certainly would not recommend this cd to anyone. First of all, the vocals are unbelievably bad. If you're able to get past the singing (a term I use loosely here), dealing with the bassist is almost equally undesirable. Less is more sometimes. However, the overly self-indulgent bass player for BA obviously doesn't see it that way. His over-the-top playing actually takes away from the songs, and the listener is force-fed a heavy dose of his noodling that's far too prominent in the mix. The guitars leave nothing to write home about, they're just rather boring. I get the feeling that this is the bass player's band and these are his hired incompetent lackeys. This 6 song cd (which includes a cover song I won't get into) is a laughable attempt at the \\"NU-METAL\\" genre. It makes a nifty Frisbee, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"my grandson's birthday gift.","review":"I gave this to my 5 yr old grandson 6 mos ago.

Craver worked with Welles in the last 15 years of his life, and wanted to tell us about it. In fact, he mostly tell us about himself, which is not interesting at all. The people he interviews do the same thing. What we learn about Welles is futile stuff about food, the shooting of \\"The other side of the wind\\", and \\"the-first-time-I-met-him\\" stories.

This listing was silent on the place of manufacture, so I believed this muffin tin, like the Kaiser products I have purchased in the past, was still being produced in Germany. I was shocked to see that the tin was labeled \\"Made in China\\" when I opened the package. The place of manufacture was unacceptable (and, in any case, the tinning was of uneven quality I had never associated with \\"Kaiser\\" products). I immediately sought to return the product--and was then advised by Amazon that my only remedy would be replacement of a product I would never had purchased had \\"Made in China\\" and \\"replacement only\\" been disclosed on the listing page.

The CO amount doesn't make any sense, but I went ahead with it anyways, thinking that the author is sure to know better than I do. The completed hat (size 2-3 years) wouldn't fit a cat, let alone my niece. CO 49 stiches with 22 st/in couldn't posssibly yield a hat to fit 17in. circumference. None of the sizes work out, and I used the recommended yarn, and knitted a gauge swatch. ANY IDEAS??? Has Ms. Guy put out a correction?

This is no book for beginners, as I believe all of the designs require the use of intarsia. I would also recommend enlarging the charts before sitting down to work, because they are TINY! My only disappointment was the emphasis on working with the charts.

My install went quickly and all I needed were jack stands, a nice hydro jack, deep 19mm socket with wrench and vice-grips for shock bolt nuts, a knife to cut the old bags out, liquid wrench to loosen shock mount bolts, a tire iron for wheel removal, and a bud to help out. Should only take you a couple hours to install. The result is a great ride that I preffer to the air-suspension. Feels more solid than the squishy bags. Stance is also good. I don't know about the sets that certain companys sell for almost three hundred dollars, but I do now know that this is all you need for a direct replacement to your air-suspension.

Installation took about 2.5 hours by myself in the driveway.Ride quality is comparable to the stock bags and dramatically cheaper.

Details the extensive Serb involvement in the plotting and arming of the assasins, and the reasons (territorial expansion). Points out the trial, a very fair one, of the captured Princip and other members of the plot, and what happens to the Serb assistants, including the Head of the Serb Intelligence Agency.

I am nineteen years old and still enjoy reading it so much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A totally engaging book for young children.","review":"The Jolly Postman or Other People's Letters is an incredible book for young children. I am a student teacher who is currently studying this book for a group project and the children we have used this book with have been absolutely delighted. I found the book to be thoroughly enjoyable and quite amusing. The possibilities for use in a classroom environment are endless and we found that children are so enthusiastic about writing letters after reading this book. Children I feel love it so much because they can delve in to the lives of others by reading their mail which is normally considered such a private thing. It also includes rhyme and a variety of different writing formats that will help children to develop as readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Review for THE JOLLY POSTMAN: OR OTHER PEOPLE'S LETTERS","review":"This is a wonderful story of a postman's route to deliver the mail to well known fairy tale characters. This book is unique because its pages form actual envelopes with letters in them. They are addressed on the front of the page. Some of the characters receiving the letters include: The Three Bears, THe Wicked Witch, The Giant, Cinderella, The Big Bad Wolf, and Golilocks. This story could be used in the the classroom during a lesson on letter writing and addressing envelopes. The story would interest the students and motivate them to write their own letters. Also, the book could be read during a unit on community helpers when discussing the jobs of a postman."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Jolly Postman","review":"So what kind of mail do you think the postman delivers to the Wicked Witch in her cottage in the woods? How about a flyer from Hobgoblin Supplies Ltd., advertising bargain basement prices on a Cup and Sorcerer tea service (it washes itself!) and Big Brooms (for the larger witch, as seen on TV!). Such are the delights that wait inside this tale of a postman on his bicycle delivering the mail to the occupants of an enchanted forest. The Three Bears get a letter from Goldilocks, apologizing for breaking into their house. The Giant gets a postcard from Jack, who is using golden eggs to pay for his and his mum's vacation. The Big Bad Wolf gets a stern letter from Red Riding Hood's attorneys, demanding that he vacate Grandma's cottage (and stop wearing her clothes). What's more, this is mail you get to take out of its envelopes (and check out the postmarks and the stamps) like you'd just taken it out of your own mailbox. For kids of any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!","review":"We have checked out this book from the library so many times that I am just going to buy it! Plus the book has envelopes with letters inside that have got lost by the other hundreds of kids who also love this book. It is going to be worth the cost of the book just to see the letters we've been missing! My 5 yo daughter has loved this book since her early 4's. She really adores this book and talks about it often and we check out library books in HEAPS!

This is probably the most boring Neil Young record ever made. There's a curious monotony to Young's vocals that comes off as a lack of passion. And the lyrics are generally ho-hum, or as everyone else here has pointed out, simplistically offensive (\\"Let's Roll\\"). I will buy and keep everything Young releases--I even still have my vinyl copy of his rockabilly monstrosity (\\"Everybody's Rockin'\\"). But I am glad I got the sublime Caitlin Cary solo debut \\"while you weren't looking\\" in the same shipment so I have something intelligent and passionate to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neil Young Rocks!!!!!!","review":"Between Bob Dylan's new album and Neil Youngs new relase \\"Are you Passionate' I'm pretty well covered until the end of the year. You should buy Neils new album just for the guitar tone alone. Those old soul albums had some great guitar work on them,which you won't find in today's fluff, pretty packaged lack of talent so-called R&B soul. Pop Staples where are you when we need you. Well, you can find it here on Neils fantastic new album.The songs are not to political,just simple love stories and a few history lessons.The band is relaxed and groove hard on all the tracks.The album is wonderfully produced. It sounds like you are sitting in the room with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I didn't feel this way...","review":"I have been following along with Neil Young since he came down from Canada. He certainly remains one of the great artists and his early writing and recordings obviously bear that out... without question. As a result, I am VERY reluctant to offer this negative review. Having said those things... it is an OK record with OK songs... recorded with a GREAT group of players, all of whom have nothing but excellent resumes. (Hey, Booker T? Donald \\"Duck\\" Dunn? All these guys ARE music). The record has echos of STAX and some nice lyrical ideas and some nice hooks but the bottom-line for me is that it's just OK... not great. If it were not for the words Neil Young on the piece... it would be a stiff in two weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are You Passionate?....The answer is No on this one","review":"Neil should have asked himself that question before churning this one out. Neil has recorded with a lot of different people but Booker T and the MG's just isn't right. I give it two stars for the song \\"Goin Home\\" which is just truly incredible. And I think he did that one with Crazy Horse. IT's a blast straight off of the Zuma era. The rest of this CD is so incredibly lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not Great Neil Young","review":"Several of the reviewers who trashed this CD missed the point. Neil Young was trying for a different sound and did so on some of the tracks. For the reader considering buying the CD, it is well worth the price of admission. This is still the Neil Young sound with the electric sound instead of the acoustic sound. The most accurate description is that of a mellow electric sound. There are some great songs which are consistent with his earlier work including; \\"Mr. Dissapointment\\", \\"Goin Home\\", \\"Two Old Friends\\" and \\"She's A Healer\\". I give it 4 out of 5 because it is a good, enjoyable listening CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's Roll","review":"Neil doesn't have the greatest voice. He's not the worlds greatest song writer. He may not be the worlds greatest guitarist but in this CD Neil showcases all of his talent. Neil has had many topics that he's covered in the past, some expressed well, others somewhat self indulgent or experimental. In this CD I expected the haunting song \\"Let's Roll\\" to be the only standout. The radio stations have been playing it tenuously. I still cry when I hear it. This CD is much more than I expected. I made the purchase expecting to listen to it for awhile and then trade it.This CD is a keeper.If you have ever enjoyed any of Neil Young's songs, then buy this CD. I feel I should've paid much more for the listening enjoyment it has brought me.Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sometimes eclecticism is plain old self-indulgent!","review":"Hey, don't get me wrong; you'll not find a more ardent and dedicated Neil Young fan than yours truly. But for all his longstanding brilliance and outright genius Neil continues to confound with a real stinker thrown in every five years or so. To wit: Journey Through the Past, Landing on Water (Ugh), that mid eighties embarrassment \\"Everybody's Rockin'\\", Road Rock, and a few more memory's been kind enough to let me forget. \\"...Passionate\\" moves right to the top (or is it bottom) of this ignominious list. C'mon Neil, don't waste your (and our) time with this drivel. Finish up the long-awaited Archives ferGodssake!! Stay away from this awful CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I was very excited to aquire Neil Young's newest CD; however, I was very disappointed in the CD. The song \\"Let it roll\\" was very good for the purpose it was written for, however, there was only one other song that was similar to his older style. I was very upset that the style of his music had changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad....so, so sad....","review":"This cd might (might, I said) deserve 3 stars, but I just can't get past what a terrible, terrible song \\"Let's Roll\\" is. The riff is ridiculously bad, the lyrics are totally pathetic, and I just can't believe Neil would jump on the patriotic bandwagon like that! This is coming from the same guy that wrote \\"Southern Man\\" & \\"Keep on Rockin in the Free World\\"!?!? I'm in utter shock. \\"Let's Roll\\" aside, the cd is not all that bad. Neil is going in a new direction with this soul stuff, and it's definitely not as good as his old rock or acoustic stuff, but he can pull it off fairly well..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Neil","review":"And this [stinks]. The record sounds like it was recorded in two days, which is not necessarily a bad thing, as Mirror Ball so eloquently proves, but that was a passionate album and this was mailed in. Neil's guitar tone is a sonic wonder, the band sounds warm and fluid, but the lyrics, usually a Neil strong point are simplistic at best, and in the case of \\"lets roll\\", asinine. The song structures and singing are not up to the standards Neil usually hits. I bought it and will buy his next one too, even Neil can [mess] up, and that does not diminish his fabulous body of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, but Neil can't write albums anymore.","review":"This is not a very good album from one of the best songwriters, Neil Young. I hardly consider this or his last album, Silver and Gold, to be \\"comeback\\" albums. Neil Young decided to go soul now, and it just doesn't fit him. However, ther are more rock songs on this album than the last one, but that's not saying much. Horn sections and female backing vocals never really suited his kind of playing. However, there are a few good tunes. \\"Going Home\\" is another great jam with Crazy Horse that harkens back to Rust Never Sleeps. She's A Healer is a decent song, and Let's Roll is actually quite good for a 9/11 song. (I'm getting REALLY tired of those songs however). But the album is filled with dull or just bad songs. Hopefully, Greendale should be better, what with Neil playing with Crazy Horse again."},{"rating":"2","title":"see silver and gold","review":"John mayel, jack johnson and a host of other \\"singer song writers with their acoustic guitars DMB included\\" don't even hold a candle to our rusty horse Mr. Young. he doesn't just write songs, he tears life into tiny pieces, then puts words to the memories"},{"rating":"1","title":"To quote Neil, its \\"a piece of ...","review":"Neil Young has always, for me, been one of the most intelligent and serious musicians around. He has always attacked themes with integrity and robustness. When I heard the first song on the album, the postcard to his daughter I thought that this album was going to be a winner... And, yes, there are a few songs that stand up on there own. But together, the album is weak and light-weight. I'm sorry I bought it!The other day I had four new CD's by old rockers in my car - Mellencamp, U2, James and Neil - and I am sorry to say that Neil comes a very distant fourth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alternate title: \\"Are You Still Awake?\\"","review":"There are reasons why this album never made it to the top echelon of Neil Young albums. He didn't exactly come roaring out of the gates into the 21st Century.It's turgid, it's sluggish, it's...oh, I don't know, get out your thesaurus and come up with your own descriptor.Even a song like \\"Goin' Home\\"...which echoes prime Neil & Crazy Horse...isn't as good as prime Neil & Crazy Horse. It makes you want to put on \\"Zuma\\" or \\"Ragged Glory.\\"The post-9/11 song \\"Let's Roll\\" is a sign of the times. \\"Are You Passionate\\" was released on April 9, 2002, almost 7 months after everything changed. It's definitely no \\"Ohio,\\" but it's Neil's take on the events of 9/11.Backing is from Booker T. Jones (organ, vibes, vocal), Duck Dunn (bass), Steve Potts (drums), Frank Sampedro (guitar and vocal), Tom Bray (trumpet), Neil's wife Pegi (vocals), and his sister Astrid (vocals)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really helps if your a Neil Young fan...","review":"This is a great Neil Young CD. It's not easy to classify Neil and you never know what to expect so, it helps if your a Neil Young fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not great, but some keepers","review":"Not among his best as a total work, but a couple of cuts are keepers for burning onto a \\"Neil Young favorites\\" CD : \\"Definitely\\", \\"Are You Passionate\\", and \\"Going Home\\".

It's perfect late night- I had to listen to it before crashing for the night on several camping trips this summer. Basically I like all the tracks, especially \\"Mr Disappointment\\" \\"Differently\\" \\"Goin Home\\" \\"Dont say you love me\\" \\"She's a healer\\" and the title track, which is haunting. Overall laid back but very worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, Guitar-driven Neil","review":"Personally I like it when an aged rocker revisits a period of his career and updates it with wisdom. Bowie has done it a few times and taken some critical lumps for it. But in my opinion he, Van Morrison, and Neil on this new album, keep it fresh. \\"Are You Passionate\\" seems to recall Buffalo Springfield with its Motown-tinged hooks. Nearly all the songs have a signature guitar riff that, like Mick Ronson's contributions to early seventies Bowie songs, is often more memorable than the vocal melody. But this isn't the kind of stuff one should dissect; Neil pulls it off with his usual ease and the performances are masterful, yet seem to come from someone's garage. We need to appreciate how hard this would be for anyone else who has recorded as much music as Neil. Cherish this guy while you've got him; and keep buying the new stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Listened to this once, then sold it.","review":"A Neil Young album should not be this boring.

(Ah, the \\"supergroup\\"!) And now this chowderhead--who's spent much of the past few decades living down his quip that he had, in fact, voted for Reagan--turns out to be a jingoistic naf after all.... Surprise, surprise.

That's the best way to describe this disc. Neil used to be a fairly consistent purchase. Between this and his latest CSNY effort, I'm not so sure anymore. Better to burn out than listen to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldnt even get past 4th track","review":"I thought that with Silver and Gold, Neil had just reached a new level, but this album is a disgrace.

I just never saw it before on Amazon. It is an amazing CD. The opening symphony is an absolute delight, on par with early Mozart and Haydn and the performance is sheer perfection. The clarinet concerto is a very simple piece but quite enjoyable. The double flute concerto is much more interesting. The second symphony here, the one by the father Stamitz, is pretty boring.

My batteries only last a week. I have tried everything to prolong battery life. I turned the unit off. I took the battery out and stored it separately. Still I got a week (max) out of a battery. I even tried adapting the battery holder to use the lower cost (non-petsafe) batteries- but the hassle involved with using this collar are so significant that I am just sick of it. I would welcome any advice on other collars that work with this unit- but have longer life batteries. Right now the unit is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't working for my dog","review":"We bought this collar at a local pet store and it worked at first. But now it doesn't really phase him. He doesn't like to wear the collar so just showing it to him is effective 25% of the time. But if he is already worked up by someone in the house or knocking at the door, forget it! I will continue to try and find a way to train my little dog to stop the barking.

The company said that having it against metal will diminish battery life, so we got a harness instead (no tags). This still didn't work. We turn it off at night when we take it off. It's too much of a hassle to turn it on only when she is outside. We have gotten to where we let her use it without a battery and she seems to still know the boundaries. Then, we replace the battery to switch it up. Good product, bad battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be informed!!","review":"The only way to keep this collar from eating up batteries is to literally turn it off when the dog is not outside. It has an on/off switch where you insert a coin to rotate it to the off position. They don't make this clear enough regarding battery, if they had I wouldn't have bought it. I got it because of the levels of correction. I already had collars and their batteries lasted up to 12 months but one dog needed something a little stronger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product - not always easy to train (re-train in my case) the dog","review":"This is a nice small version of the product. I love the invisble fence that we have, but I re-did my yard so I had to run a new fence wire and it changed the location of where the dogs could go. The 'retraining' of them to the new border has been challenging. I ended up returning this and getting the stubborn dog version.This one worked fine, but my one dog still did not pay attention to it. So, give it a try, this is certainly the cheaper location to purchase the product from. It was significantly more expensive in the local retail stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer be aware of the hidden costs!!","review":"As with all the other reviews (which I wish I had read BEFORE I bought this money pit) the unit is a battery draining hog. It does not work as well as the larger collars either. Due to the units smaller size our dog has to be right up on the wire to get a warning unlike the larger unit which can give anywhere from 3-10 ft of warning.

The replacement batteries are specially made by the company to fit the collar and run about $10.00. Therefore, once you buy the collar to keep the collar operating for your dog you are looking at spending about $120 a year. The company has a slightly larger collar that does not have the flashing light that we use on our other small dog. Those batteries are also specially made by the company, but the battery lasts quite some time (over a year). Although our other dog is bright and once he got popped a time or two does not come near the boundaries. I wish I would have never bought this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"eats an $8 battery each month","review":"I've had one of these on our little dog for 3 months now and have gone through 3 batteries.

You can hack the little battery holder apart and put in a standard CR-1/3N battery and save about $2/month, but it's not easy cutting the battery holder apart. I'm looking for a small 3v rechargeable battery I can sneak in there.Petsafe.. recall these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design - Greedy Business Model","review":"We have 2 small dogs and tried these collars. We were shocked to find that the batteries would only last 3-4 weeks and cost $10 each. With 2 dogs, that is over $240 a year in batteries. This week one of the collars broke and I called their customer service line. To send a replacement collar for warranty repair would cost me an $18 non refundable deposit.

Maybe I shouldn't have named him Drifter, LOL. But it is probably as small as it can get and still work, and you can use other cheaper batteries and replace them into the battery holder. You have to snap off the black plastic ring, but save it because you have to set it in the exact place it came off in order for the battery to go back in the slot. And do not trust the flasher, it would flash red at me and then change back to green for a week. I got almost 2 months out of the first battery. So I wish I didn't have to use it, but i am glad he is not running the neighborhood any more.

The good news is that you can re-use the plug and just replace the battery inside for $1.50. Here is a video I made, showing how to replace the battery: [...]Flags:Pet-Safe provides little flags to show your dog the boundry. They are ok, but your dog must learn that they can't go between the flags either. Instead of flags, we used a rope. This made is really easy for our dog to know the boundry.

Also, this item is sold under multiple manufactur's names. The model number, IDVD16DDME is identical. One business doing trade with multiple names? Makes one think a bit...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time line history of Randall Knives and the Randall Family","review":"This is a nice history of Randall Made Knives. The book gives a time line history of the Randall knife production and an historical perspective. The various models and the history of how they came into being is presented. The story of the development of these knives is excellent and a lot of details are included. A nice set of photographs of the different models and configurations is included along with excellent photographs throughout the book. What is missing is a discription of the knife making process, an explanation of the different sheaths and the meanings of the different markings. There is no discription of the changes in the knives over the years that would help in establishing dates of manufacture, etc. A very informative and enjoyable book for any knife collector. A must for anyone interested in Randall Made Knives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moscoe in Space","review":"Mike Moscoe's \\"The Price of Peace\\" is set in a future that is not too far away. The pace is quick, the style is friendly, and the characterizations are believable. Whether it's peace or combat, the book is a page turner for the beach, plane ride, or nightstand. If you like Asimov and/or Clarke, Moscoe is the place to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Upper and Lower Body Strength Workout","review":"In addition to YogaWorks Beginners' AM/PM, and YogaWorks Fit Abs DVDs, YogaWorks has the BodySlim DVD whose focus is on weight loss. After trying out the other two DVDs, I was excited to work out to this DVD. This is an intense and challenging workout that increases body conditioning and strengthens the core. During the workout I could feel all of my muscles shaking and my heart rate going up. I like to challenge myself during this workout, but afterwards I feel so energized that it is all worth it. I am convinced that if I keep on working out to this DVD, I will continue to lose weight. I usually bring this DVD with me when I travel to help me maintain my workout routine and use it as an alternative to going to the gym."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Yoga Weight Loss DVD","review":"For someone who is not terribly experienced in yoga and is looking to tone up and lose weight, this video is perfect! I love that there are both cardio and slow burn sections woven together. Even though I'm not very flexible, I could do all of the poses and sequences. If you can't keep up with the video, there is an easier version that is shown as well.Overall, this video is great. The instructor is motivating and very precise. I can already feel a difference in the way I feel since I've started using this. I would absolutely recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Workout","review":"This is a good yoga workout video for cardio and weight loss. It is a 60 minute moderate work out, with cardio moves and slow burn for muscle strengthening. The instructions are clear and slow, which you can follow along easily. They also provide modified poses for beginners. I use this video at least three to four times a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"I workout between once and twice a week with the yogaworks body slim video and it always makes my body feel like it's gotten a great workout. I like how it starts off with easier cardio and slow burn sequences and works up to more challenging postures. It has also helped me with stress and tension; my upper back feels a lot better (I am in front of a computer most of the work day). Would highly recommend this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not center you as real yoga does","review":"This is yoga as a workout, not yoga as a mind, body & soul centering practice. She alternates between cardio, using vinyasa flow moves, then switches to stretching poses. It is not appropriate if you are aiming for the process that calms the mind, aligns the body and enlightens the soul. Her voice is in a mode of a cheerleader, of a 'you can do it' actor. She elongates a word every few, like streeeetttch it out, reeeeaaaach it up. It gets annoying. Her voice is also very FAR from a calming, soothing meditation voice of many yoga masters. The meditation phase was a joke. There are very little hatha yoga stretches in here as well.Choose this dvd if you want a work out that involves stretching. Do not choose it if you think you will get the full benefits of yoga. I give her credit, she knows the sanskrit words for each move and she does match the breathing with the move. But I do yoga 7 days a week for a different reason. This dvd will never be played again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is actually a workout!","review":"I have tried a few other yoga dvds and this one is the best. Its great to be able to tone and get some strength training when you do not feel like using weights. The instructions are clear and the pace is not to fast but just right to increase your heart rate. I hope they will make some additional body slim dvds."},{"rating":"2","title":"YogaWorks BodySlim","review":"This video is friggin amazing. I was using it through Comcast OnDemand until it got removed. I love it. It's a mix of cardio and intense yoga poses.

F.M. Busby's characters are vividly drawn, and you leave the book wanting more from these characters. It was easy to get drawn into their lives, to root for the good guys and hate the bad guys. I'm glad that I have the first one, and I am determined to get all the rest. If you love a good sci-fi romp with great characters involved in vivid imagery, I suggest you do what ever you can to get your hands on these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"thrilling story about a young mans rise to control of power","review":"Busby twists a wonderful tale of Bran Tregare, who is abandoned by his parents in a apace academy where tyranny rules supreme. The author tells of Bran's gradual hate against the system and his rise through the ranks and the eventual rebellion that places him in power of his own armed spaceship. Busby's force on the emotions of the human mind as he describes the torments of Bran's life keep the reader sitting tight from cover to cover"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for Sci-Fi buffs","review":"Busby writes a tale about the graduale corruption of an innocent to a \\"monster\\" from someone just wanting to survive to a force of change in his own universe. He create characters that you can believe, you hate them or love them you can believe that they are real people who have been forced to become who and what they are. The slaughterhouse is an example of horror of a corrupt system that has only one goal to instill obdience at all cost, Busby does an incredable job at makeing you see it and beleive it in your minds eye.

Now the full size 16 oz container was $15.00 bucks so I wanted to see if it was worth the money. I decided 700 miles later in Mt Vernon Washington to separate my truck/trailer, and to my surprise it was nicely smeared across the plate. I couldnt believe a 2 oz sample bottle could do that.

Thanks Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The bride I'd be glad to take.","review":"Black Tape for a Blue girl is brilliant. I found them quite by accident and I'm glad I did. Not only is the music incredible, but the lyrics are brilliant and soulful. Now a days 'music' from groups that lack any kind of merit whatsoever are so common, it's hard to even get excited about a new release or a new single on the radio.This simply does not apply to Black Tape for a Blue Girl. Their lyrics say something, their music is thought out and masterfully put together. I recommend very highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I own this and have heard the vocals (not on samples)","review":"I think that the instrumental half of the music is beautiful, but the vocals aren't very impressive. Great musicians, bad singers. What I mean by bad singers is that you can tell the vibrato is forced. They must know the boundaries of their talent, because the free samples fail to let you hear the vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Vocals/Lyrics and Barely Passable Arrangement","review":"This cd is not worth the purchase. If you are a diehard BTFBG fan then stop reading now - you're gonna buy the cd anyway.If you are interested in BTFBG and looking for an a good example then don't buy this cd. This cd has horrible lyrics and a bad impersonation of Peter Murphy. Buy Ashes in Brittle Air, Before the Buildings Fell or even First Pain to Linger - but don't get this cd. It isn't worth your money.The sound is a bit mundane and badly mixed - sometimes the vocals are too loud and too strong to even hear the music, and if you do hear the music it is repetitive and banal.The two stars come from the overall feel of the album. It isn't nearly as bad as it could be but it does not measure up to the standard they have set.Caveat Emptor."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is so incredibly good.","review":"I've liked Black Tape for a Blue Girl for some time now. I wanted this CD of theirs ever since it came out, but being broke, could not get it. I played sample songs of theirs off of a few compilations for a friend. She fell in love with their music as quickly as I did. I finally went out and bought their CD as a present for my friend. It was amazing, and I loved every single track. We listened to it every day until she had to leave and return to her home in Norway a few days ago, and now I have to get myself a copy as well. But again, the sound, the music, the lyrics, the voices are all astounding. It is pleasure the entire album through. I highly reccomend this album, I have friends who claim to hate goth music, that adore this CD. A must for any Black Tape for a Blue Girl fan. Highly reccomended for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"If all marriges were as beautiful.","review":"Brilliant, simply brilliant.

Their scenes together are very beautiful, and their chemistry is evident for all to see.Shelley Duvall and Jeff Bridges also portray Rapunzel's parents at the beginning of the tale, which is a nice touch.Filled with dazzling costumes and an intelligent script, RAPUNZEL is worth a look, as are all the other great FAERIE TALE THEATRE's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Drawn-Out","review":"For whatever reason, I vividly remember watching this FTT episode as a child. Unfortunately, watching it as an adult (with a younger sibling) did not live up to the billing.The first half of the episode is so drawn out to be boring, while the second half is filled with cheesy dialogue and weird (often disturbing, for young children) special effects.The main guest stars in this one are Jeff Bridges, Shelley Duvall, and Gina Rowlands.Skip this installment and move along to better ones that indeed exists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish mine worked","review":"I was so excited when I found this deal.

The show itself is extremely well made, and well done. Each episode tells a different story, that parodies \\"serial\\" novels/shows. The stories range from tales of war, horror, suspense, coming of age, adventure, action, exploration, romance, and it's all parodied by Michael Palin.

This is not the sort of floating consciousness sketch writing that was so prevalent in the Monty Python days, but we did see some hints of this type of whole show sketch writing with the Python episode \\"The Cycling Tour\\" where the entire episode had a central theme if not to say plot.I personally wish there had been a bit more Terry Jones in front of the camera instead of always behind it. Palin is a very gifted comic actor with a great range of character types.These shows are not the same caliber or quality as \\"Monty Pythons Flying Circus\\".

These feelings are expressed exquisitely in the paintings which bring to mind photograhs of that period in history. In addition, there are many springboard opportunities for discussions. The photographic paintings elicit questions from your children that will begin conversations about methods of travel, different regions of our own country, differences between cultures, and differences between the time that is illustrated and the time we are living in now.

It is truly wonderful---one of the best picturebooks I have ever seen.The watercolor/illustrations have a dreamy quality to them and they make you want to get in a car and drive across the US to meet the people Grandfather meets and to see the cities, deserts and landscapes he sees.The story is also deeply moving. Say does an incredible job illustrating the ways in which people who move from one country (or even one region of a country) to another feel both a love for their new home as well as a longing for their old. Having lived abroad and felt that pull, I have often found myself in tears as I read the book.For my nieces and nephews it was a wonderful way to introduce them to the experiences of their immigrant great-grandfather and great-grandmother.

We sat down to watch it, fearing it would be like EVA and have the world end as a puddle of tang.We were so very mistaken.Rah-xephon runs on many of the same lines as EVA, with many episodes that are almost copies. But the plot, and the storyline are so much more compelling and captivating that it is astounding. Things are actually explained with enough detail to answer some of your questions and enough clues to let you find the others on your own. The ending actually makes sense. The characters, even those that fall under the category of 'bad guys' still have such personalities that you love the character even if you hate what they do. The English voice acting is amazing.

Or wait for the rest of the collection?Thanks for your helpBenjamin P Cruden"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Its not that the art is bad, or the action is dull, it's simply a matter of poor plot developement. There's no manga to go with it either, and that's already a sign pointing towards a chaotic plot line. It's almost like it was being written while still in production. It's also surprisingly emo and makes too many failing attempts at being philosophical n such (a common anime thing, but most at least have a foundation to which the idea is represented). So, this isn't an anime I'll watch again when I can just go see the very anime it copied off of, but is well worth the time and money, Evangelion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Body Betrayed","review":"Well written, easy to read book that is helpful for people trying to understand eating disorders, especially anorexia and bulimia."},{"rating":"1","title":"not one of my favorites","review":"Explosions in the sky are still better than 95% of the music that's out there but I was rather disappointed by this album after falling in love with their last one.Unfortunately, none of the tunes were very memorable. I found the second cd (with remixes of the songs by artists like jesu and four tet among others) more engaging.They're still a band with vast potential and I'm still waiting for their next release but I just wasn't pleased with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"A huge let down. Completely lacks the graceful dynamics and seamless transitions that The Earth Is Not A Cold Dead Place and Those Who Tell The Truth... do. The themes are so fragmented and little musical exploration is done. The album feels choppy and disconnected, uninspired and scattered. The profile of drums has drastically changed and really contributes to this album's disapointment: they are so blaring, unchanging and uncreative. The nicest addition is the piano theme in the track \\"So Long Lonesome\\" (track 6) but besides that there are few gems."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH!!!","review":"Why do so many of this bands songs become a frenzied barage of cymbal smashing!

This album reconfirms why they are one of the greatest bands in the genre. When they went to the studio again they were faced with a tall order, having legendary productions such as \\"The Earth Is Not A Cold Dead Place\\" and \\"Those Who Tell The Truth...\\" under their belt.Their traditional sound, which typically hovers around intricate guitar parts that intertwine around each other, can still be heard in here, but they also incorporated more ambient (quieter, if you may) elements such as the case in \\"What Do You Go Home To?\\" and the closing track. The final product makes for one of 2007's best albums to date.If you are curious about the double album with the remixes in it, I haven't found it to be worth the extra money, except for a couple of the tracks, so you're better off with this edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic.","review":"I was terribly surprised to see this album not rated an overall 5 stars, and was thus compelled to add a review. The top reviewers actually cover it quite well except for saying anything to the like of it being the same as their other work. This album ranges from haunting to enlivening, and to hear it live is cathartic. I don't care what kind of music you listen to, Explosions will take your breath away if you take the time to sit and listen. Their music leaves me the the drive to do little else but listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"I own this book and I don't like it.","review":"I'm sorry for even buy this book.

The most interesting parts of the book were the chapters \\"ASW Process and Operations\\", \\"Submarine Observables and Indicators\\" and \\"ASW sensors and their deployment\\" which cover about 70 pages. The rest is outdated account of the submarine balance between the US and USSR and some scenarios of nuclear exchange. It would be better for someone interested on the ASW matters, to read the excellent books \\"Submarines\\" and \\"Anti-submarine warfare\\" published by Brassey's in the 1980s, which are much more general in scope and content more technical and tactical details."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFULLY HORRIBLE!","review":"I wish I could return this book if I had not spilt coffee over it...

After a hundred pages it stops being quite so clever. Actually I would say it wears thin after about 2 pages. The book also seems to treat men as if it believes its title, it comes off dumbed down and spends as much time on really quite dull jokes as it does conveying any real information. Its only real use would be as a funny gift to a friend, who could then go and buy a real book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant insults and bad jokes obscure good info","review":"This book does contain many helpful facts, but sadly the title is not just a one-off tease. The reader is constantly reminded that he is an oaf, and that probably the person who gave it to him thinks so. Well, me thag give bad review. To ladies who might think their partners might benefit from this book, the book assumes and reads like you are an idiot who knows nothing about science, fixing things, cooking or modern living. So you'll be suggesting that your partner is a loser. Just don't get angry if he retaliates by saying you look fat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok book, wouldn't recommend it though","review":"I purchased this book thinking it would be full of useful information for a first time dad (but presented with a little humor).

I thought that it would be a good resource for him since it offered comic relief while providing important information. Unfortunately, that was NOT the case.

It wasn't funny, just stupid. The \\"caveman\\" theme was done to death within 4 pages, but dragged on the entire book. My husband couldn't make it through the first chapter it was so bad. I think it's the male twin of \\"The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy\\" in how it stereotyped a whole gender.Did this really need an entire chapter on sex? And a recommendation that the man pressure his at-term wife or girlfriend into sex in order to trigger labor even though it admits that she probably won't be up for it, implying she should do it anyway because the guy's been really good about not insisting on instant sex throughout pregnancy, so he should get a reward? What is this, Maxim?Also, more and more men are able to cook, so an entire chapter on cooking, with tips more suitable for jr. high home ec students is just insulting.The \\"medical\\" advice was pretty out of date and useless.

While the essence of the book is sound, there is too much gimmicky \\"caveman/ cro magnum\\" jargon to sift through. It's quite off-putting for the average intelligent man to adopt the guise of a caveman in learning about what he and his partner should expect during pregnancy and childbirth. I'd leave this book alone in favour of \\"The Expectant Father\\" or for something conscise and humourous, try \\"My Guys Can Swim\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Treats men like idiots","review":"I was given this book as a gift and was so turned off by the overuse of caveman analogies, I couldn't finish it.I think this book does more harm than good by re-enforcing negative stereotypes about men being uninvolved spouses and fathers. I understand the purpose of the book is about trying to \\"evolve\\" unenlightened men, but I am not one of their numbers.I tried to have a sense of humor about it and felt I gave the book a fair shot, but when the first handful of chapters are all about trying to impart some kind of wisdom or sense of responsiblity unto the father-to-be, you feel like you're being talked down to. It's not funny, it's not insightful, it's a whisper-thin concept a couple of bozos tried to hang a parenting book from.If you look at a lot of the positive reviews, they are written by women who bought the book for their spouses and boyfriends. Of course THEY think it's great. They're keeping their men like pets.

It's the story of an 11-year old boy who accidentally kills his 10 year-old friend. I was expecting something deep and moving, an examination of grief and guilt. Not so much.It starts off with Nancy, 11 year-old Danny's mom. Her point of view is first person and is pretty clear, what I would expect from a mother and a woman of that age. Then it moves on to Danny's POV, told through a journal-like writing. Chernoff is WAY off in what I would expect an 11 year-old boy to sound like. She comes off here sounding like an adult trying to write like a child. Not good. Then, the story moves on to Frank, the murdered boy's father. His POV is told in the 3rd person, and the twist it takes at the climax is totally unbelievable. The ending is even worse- or, lack of ending, I should say.I was pretty disappointed with this one.

It easily fits our stroller with no problems and some extra things we may want gate checked. The big issue we ran into was EVERY time we gate checked, because it was not one of those bright red bags, it ended up being sent to the normal baggage claim. It was a challenge, as we did not want to leave the gate until we knew for sure it was at baggage claim and we would have liked to use it to roll our son out of the airport.

I love the durability of my stroller, and I am very disappointed that the bag did not meet those same standards. I expected that the Maclaren brand bag would be of better quality.

I was tired of sweeping and vacuuming every day not to mention the amount of lint rollers I was going through. I was a little hesitant to give it to her as she is rather sensitive to certain foods but she has tolerated this well and likes the taste. It seems to be helping as I'm not seeing as much hair on my floors and clothes as before. I also use a furminator. The weather has cooled some also so that may have helped with the shedding. I will keep using this product. Her coat is soft and shiny. My only real complaint is the bottling. No matter how hard I try to get it poured out, it still drips down the side and makes a mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"My dog, Ace, coat is thicker, softer and shiner","review":"Since my dog, Ace, has been using this product his daycare and I, both, notice his coat is thicker, softer and shiner.

He's jumping up and down begging me to let him open just one present early.Then the morning arrives and he tears into it. It was so difficult to remove from the carton/packaging that something broke and the propeller never worked right.

Additionally, they were all written for a newspaper column and as a result of the poems sometimes feel longer than they should have been. Thus, while this overall collection of poems has some great ones in it, I would only recommend it with the reservation that it is perfectly okay to skip poems if they feel repetitive, and also to say that these poems were meant to be read once a week over the course of years, so, should you get tired of reading them, try taking a break and coming back to it later.

It was one of their later serials, borrowng heavily from footage of Republic's glory days. Regardless, this serial is fun to watch in any format. This DVD edition has a fine picture transfer, especially since it did not come from Republics original master. My only problem with this Roan release is that I purchsed it more than twice. Each time I purchased it I got the first 6 chapters on both sides. Until they fix their production problems I can't reccomend this edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling quality but fun","review":"This review refers to the Whirlwind Media DVD of Radar Men. I gather from other reviews that there was a Roan version which I'm sure was better. As for the serial itself, if you grew up watching Commando Cody and dreaming of flying with your own rocket suit, you'll enjoy this. Acting and dialong are, well, passible and there are some great Art Deco props left over from Flash Gordon & Buck Rogers. Alas, the video quality is wretched. Perhaps not as bad as a Madacy DVD but close. Still, the flying scenes are great--Commando Cody is surprisingly graceful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stock Footage From Republic","review":"Track down Republic's memorable \\"King of the Rocket Men\\" (1949) and skip this cost-cutting chapterplay. Despite new visual effects from the Lydecker Brothers, the lackluster \\"Radar Men From the Moon\\" (1952) relies heavily on Republic stock footage. Roy Barcroft and Clayton Moore (who temporarily left \\"The Lone Ranger\\" in a salary dispute) provide solid villainy, but George Wallace's heroic Commander Cody is a total stiff. Though more sci-fi oriented than \\"Rocket Men,\\" the routine exploits of \\"Radar Men\\" mark a regrettable decline in the Republic serial tradition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off The Scope","review":"There are good, fair, merely okay, and down-right bad serials.

For some reason, elastic was too short and I couldn't even stretch it over a 3rd corner when trying to put on the fitted sheet. Then on the 4th try (having turned it several times to make sure I had it on the right way), with a gentle tug, the elastic snapped. Also, prior to washing, I noticed a small stain on one pillow case and a smallish \\"pull\\" in the sheets, but disregarded.

With all of the trash out there being made for kids, you won't want to miss this one. Enjoy! P.S.

I liked the way the DVD was professionally produced, and the fact that you can select a section of the trail from the menu without searching through the DVD if you want to review a certain part.

I am a day hiker and have read a few AT books, but this was the first time I watched a documentary from a real thru-hiker's point of view. I liked it. I agree with other reviewers, this one is very professionally made. However, maybe it is because I am too interested in the subject, I felt like it could have been longer -- it certainly did not fill up each DVD. Maybe adding another 20 minutes to both halves would be nice. Overall, good job! Now if Mark can do the Pacific Crest and Continental Divide (we know you are reading these reviews, Mark!) ... perhaps I am being too harsh giving it a 4 star (I would give 4 and half), but I will give a 5 if Mark does the other two long distance trails :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must see DVD","review":"I have just finshed seeing the DVD three times and I could watch it again.

My 7 yr. old especially loves \\"Broken\\", \\"Wrong Turn\\" and \\"The 3 R's\\" (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle).

Having loved all of Jack Johnson's previous CDs, I wasn't quite sure what to expect with a children's album. But needless to say, I gave it a shot... and I absolutely loved it! There are some songs that are geared more towards children than others (like Jungle Gym, Sharing Song and 3 R's) while most are just cute and playful. My personal favs are Upside Down, Broken, People Watching, Questions and Supposed To Be (if you have macromedia flash player, you can listen to sample clips at http://jackjohnsonmusic.com/CGplayer/CGplayer.html).

I wouldn't be surprised if he falls asleep in the middle of recording sessions; or maybe they just wheel his entire bed into the studio.

This probably would have been a mediocre album had there not been an attempt to cover a song by the White Stripes. Consequent this attempt, and Jack Johnsons miserable failure, I'd have to say this is a downright bad album. Jack Johnson sounds mechanical and as a man who lacks a soul.

It is notNadja, but something different.My thought while I read was this: \\"Reading for a glint in the darkness, you find something beautiful, but even with it in your hands, you cannot tell anyone what it is or not as a deficit of your descriptive powers but because there is nothing you can describe it with.\\" A thing of fleeting and ephemeral beauty you have to hold."},{"rating":"2","title":"PUN MAN DOING WHAT HE DOES BEST....","review":"(VIGILANTE,) THE PUNISHER GOES BACK TO BASICS AND WIPES OUT LOADS OF GANG MEMBERS IN ISSUE ELEVEN OF THE WAR JOURNAL !

Unlike most dog-training books, this one was interesting to read and made you feel as if you were taking on an adventure instead of a chore. You can tell the authors have a great love for dogs, and great knowledge in the subject as well. They tell what to do right from the start, from the best breeds for the family to what kind of supplies you'll need.

That was in 1972. We started with a beautiful and well-mannered Collie. Then in 1985 we embarked on our first adventure with a Bichon! For over 12 years our Bichon ruled the roost -- he was definitely the leader. When he passed away we were hesitant to get another dog because of the challenges we had with our first Bichon. So I set out for the bookstore and found \\"Puppy Preschool\\"! What a life, furniture, carpeting, sanity, everything saver this book is! I'm confident not only am I a happier pet owner, but my new Bichon \\"Bailey\\" is also a happier, more well adjusted pup!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book w/ great ideas","review":"These guys really know what they are talking about and have helped us immensley with our new puppy.

I definately recommend reading this book BEFORE you bring your new puppy home. It's not a book to read if you have an older puppy with dominance or other problems. The idea behind this book is to prevent unwanted beahavior with positive reinforcement. If you have behavior problems you should address spend your money on a lesson with an experienced trainer and not books.There is one area where I don't agree with the author - using a choke collar. Choke collars are not humane and there are much more effective ways of training your puppy. I am also not crazy about the section on good dogs and bad dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Puppy book You'll ever need","review":"I bought this book by accident in 1996.

I loved reading the book- highlighting all the important details and methods. Before attempting to apply the methods, I would definitely have given the book 5 stars. However, I've now had my puppy 4 days, and the \\"growling\\" behavior that is so prevalent in the book just doesn't work. I'm disappointed because the book makes it sound so exciting and foolproof. I still refer back to the book for many other good ideas, but I will be having to find another training method other than \\"growling\\" for a feisty little pup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that helpful","review":"I was excited when I got this book but after reading many books on dog trainning and behavior I found this book to be not so helpful or to the point. I was having many problems teaching my dog how to walk on a leash and stop mouthing everyone in the family and this book barley addressed these issues and didn't say how to handle them at all. all it did was explain what mouthing was and why puppies do it. Yeah well that didn't help me. Save your money for a shorter book that will work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is just ok","review":"I grew up with dogs, and bought this book because I had never raised a puppy on my own before. The book made a couple good points, but overall was a waste of money. Maybe this book would be better for someone with absolutely no dog experience.

I definitely recommend buying this cd, it an album you put on nice and loud on your stereo, kick back and relax...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picks up where Play left off","review":"Where \\"Play\\" was innovative, \\"18\\" is subtle. Proof of this is the song \\"Great Escape,\\" a beautifully crafted song that shows what Moby can do with nothing more than remarkable vocals laid down by Azure Ray. His songs start out with a amazing vocals, then he adds a piano, guitar or whatever. After this he adds a beat, then some warm strings and then ends with vocal only. He has this down to a science, and it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mellow Moby's \\"18\\"","review":"This is definitely Moby's most mellow, chill-out dance release yet. I bought the album because I wanted to hear other songs that sound similiar to the catchy, cool pop sound of \\"We are made of stars.\\"Strangely, there were not any other Moby songs on the album that resemble it. The mood and style of Moby's 18 is urban jazzy, slow tempo. The album's mood is basically for the listener to either relax, meditate, or fall to sleep to. Just be prepared that if you decide on adding 18 to your collection, there isnt a part of this album that has any uptempo dance beats like Moby's last album \\"Play\\" contains. My album summary: Overall, Moby does'nt seem to create any inventive sounds, but it's competent music when anyone's in a laid-back mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing and beyond","review":"Moby has blown your mind with his self titled cd and Play. Now he has come to kick you in the face and right into a trance where it feels like you want to sleep for days! His music is the greatest thing to happen to the lazy sleepers in the world. It is so soothing to hear that it makes you fall asleep. Guys, this is the kind of music you want on when you bring a girl to your room. This music is sure to please anyone. Go help yourself and get some sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely not Play 2","review":"Let me start by saying this, if you liked Play for the upbeat fast songs then you may not like \\"18,\\" but, if you enjoyed the slow jams as much as the fast ones of Play then 18 will be great for your money. 18 is a very melancholy record, however it is very beautiful. I could see many classical music listeners liking this album because it is very easy to listen to, it does not contain a \\"Machete\\" type song like Play did. In fact, the closest it gets to fast is the song \\"Jam For the Ladies\\" which is pretty mediocre when compared to the fast songs of Play. But every other song on this album is great. Just don't listen to this on a long drive that you need to stay awake because you won't, this is mean to soothe your soul and make you feel a little better about yourself, and possibly smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Moby's popularity puzzles me. He takes a rather weak \\"hook\\" and repeats it over and over and calls it a song. Lyrics, same thing. Almost every one of his songs follows a \\"Moby formula.\\" Perhaps it is because he goes for the \\"lowest common denominator\\" that he appeals to so many people [ NOTE: Back in the 70's when I tried to get some people to listen to Emerson, Lake & Palmer's \\"Tarkus\\" they complained that it was too \\"complicated\\" for them. ]The only good thing he has done is show that with an Apple G4 computer and ProTools it is possible to record a CD and have someone listen to it. I hope that it inspires some budding \\"composers\\" to reach out and go for it... and write some really good songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"wandering among the stars","review":"a balanced work by a visionary artist: balanced in the sense of delivering the delightful pop, gospel and jazzy electronica elements without going \\"over-bored\\" with politico musings or hyperkinetic metal wanderings.Overall a very enjoyable album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Play encore","review":"This CD is a lot like Play, but the ingenuity has worn off. A lot of the songs sound the same. The best track is \\"Fly So High\\" but that's about it. Moby has made a point in the past that he doesn't want to keep doing the same thing (he did techno, then rock, now pop), but this album seems to be the exception to the rule.Moby: leave Pop behind, and come back to Techno!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No, it's definitely not 'Play 2'...","review":"I loved 'PLAY', I thought it was a genius record. 18 is a lot less involving to me, more personal for Moby I'd assume, more lonely, much more sad with an echoing wail. He sounded like someone very disappointed on their deathbed on 'Play', now he sounds like he's ready to die. Everyone notices the 09/11/01 aspect, apparently 3000 dead really put a damper on Moby's birthday party. It's not really a tribute to anyone, but a strange, detached commentary of how social/political issues hurt Moby. Kind of like a lighter, softer Korn, with dead female singers. If you want to know what the odd track is in this disc, it's easily 'Jam for the Ladies' where Moby raps with a lisp. In my opinion, a bizarre misfire, but artful nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"8, not 18. A lot of bland filler.","review":"Sure, Moby's terrific. Very talented. If only he'd put that talent to use on this album. Many of the tracks are just droning synth strings, some with bland and boring vocals. It's as if he stood in front of his keyboard, punched in strings or pads, and leaned on a few major chords for 3 or 4 minutes and called it a song. Come on, man, we're paying for these discs. As always, I uploaded the CD to my computer, but out of the 18 tracks I copied only 8 that I thought were worth repeat listens. Surprisingly, the best tracks were the ones where Moby sings -- and he's not a great singer. Bottom line is I guess I'm glad bought it, but at the same time I feel a bit cheated cheated and let down. Start with his other albums, like Play, first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next CD Please....","review":"An Insipid and bland collection of songs. Relentlessly mediocre and completely forgettable. Tedious and hard to listen to all the way through. With all the good music out there, you can safely skip this one. \\"We are all made of Stars\\" will probably appear on a compilation next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair","review":"A Decent album with decent material but nothing else. Moby has become one of the most annoying musicians in the music industry to day and there is no wonder why everybody has gotten sick of him. This album sounds exactly like Play and most of the songs are just so boring just like he is in real life. Please try to make good music and stop thinkin if MTV is going to play your videos. Moby ranks with Eminem as the most boring and most unentertaining artists in the music business today thanx."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bordering on ...","review":"What a difference between albums - the last one nearly every single track was excellent while on this one 2 of the 18 tracks are ok with the rest as filler. Shame on Moby who is talented but seems to have lost sight of what makes a good album. And 18 tracks are way too much - should have focused on doing 8-11 great songs. Give this one a skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"its the same old stuff","review":"I was a fan of moby back before \\"Play\\" was popular. I thought moby was my secret artist that no one else knew about. A couple years later he wins some grammies and even my most mainstream-listening friends have his album. It looks as if on this album instead of using his eclectic/genius mind to create something out of this world and futuristic, he goes with the exact same forumla as he did for \\"play\\". Old gospel recordings with boring piano riffs accompanied by drum beats. It was great to do that on \\"play\\" because no one had done it before, but it looks like now moby has REALLY sold out to his stardom. This album is like a sequel to Play, and not near as good. His first single, \\"we are all made of stars\\" i thought was a terrible song from the get-go, and hoped the rest of the album would be better. Well, after many repeated listenings, i can say that this album isnt any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Moby fall asleep at the wheel?","review":"This doesn't sound like Moby, where did he go? I guess I was expecting something better than \\"Play\\", but I assume those days are over. Here it is: short but sour... to mellow and slow. Oh well, at least Crystal Method released a new album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Moby","review":"If You Loved Play then you must own this album. 18 is more of an extended session from Play than a new album. 18 is full of classic tracks that has made Moby stand out from the crowd. Standout tracks are We Are All Made Of Stars, In My Heart, Extreme Ways, Look Back In and Sleep Alone. Moby is a genius and this album only cements my view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired","review":"Up to this point, inspiration and creative energy have hallmarked Moby's efforts, making every listen a new and renewing experience. '18' falls very short of the standard Moby has set for himself in his previous work. The first track is a corny radio edit that fails to sustain interest for any significant period of time. The rest of the album appears to be B-side and editing room floor material from 'Play.' What is most disappointing about this effort is the apparent and utter lack of emotional commitment in the music. Sustaining the intensity typical of previous releases must no doubt be difficult, but I'd rather have gone without a new album for awhile than suffer the immense disappointment I have with this half-hearted (if that) attempt."},{"rating":"2","title":"No, not Play..","review":"I continue to be amazed at the criticism this music release receives. No, it's not Play. It is different than Play, but it is just as good. I enjoy the various artists that make up the CD and it's refreshing to have some exposure to some non-mainstream music. I have since purchased an Azure Ray CD due to the song 'Great Escape'...the music and vocals are beautiful. So, from a fan who is glad this not another Play (what would be the point?), this CD is worth the cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds Good To Me","review":"I (like many others) got on the Moby bandwagon with PLAY, his last release. I thought that Play was an extraordinary CD. 18, I feel is (just?)a very good one. Moby does not exactly follow the same path in the making of this release as PLAY, however there are definate parallels. The use of soulful vocals layered over synth washes and funky beats are a constant. But whereas PLAY featured old gospel vocals, 18 goes with a R&B feel. 18 is more of a subdued recording, but plays well as a whole. Not being a techno or electronica purist I don't see Moby as a sellout, but as someone who is blurring the boundries of that genre and making it more accessible to the non-purist. Also his essays included in the CD jacket always provide interesting reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chintsy production","review":"I wouldn't classify myself as an audiophile, but I can't listen to this without being annoyed by the cheesy-sounding instrumentation. It sounds like someone in a music store playing with a mid-range synthesizer and a reverb unit. And the \\"cello\\" on Great escape just makes me cringe. I think electronic strings can work wonderfully when they're supporting a larger piece, but to have just a synth cello and voice sounds, well, [not so good]. It seems like Moby can appreciate the contrast between old grainy samples and crisp digital rhythms, and I wish he'd gone to a little more effort into using a similar contrast between analog instruments and synth."},{"rating":"2","title":"18 tracks of electronic music, packaged for your protection","review":"I've been listening to several CDs I've borrowed from a friend at work. One of them is Moby's 18. Moby is I guess one of the big electronic music artists these days. This type of music is not necessarily my default music style, but I decided to give it a shot.Surprisingly, I liked listening to the album, and found I'd actually heard several of the tracks before. \\" We Are All Made of Stars\\" and \\"Extreme Ways\\" are pretty good stand-out tracks off of the album, but there are other good ones as well. On the whole, the music is sombre, introspective, thoughtful...not necessarily big dance tracks. Pretty good, well worth the occasional listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"same but different","review":"My expectations were high and I was, honestly, underwhelmedat first. Maybe my mistake was playing it first at high volume onmy car CD player. Played at home at low volume it sounds better witheach listening. The sampled soul voices are less unique than on PLAY. When did gospel start sounding like disco? Optimism, somehow, rises above the melancholy."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Play part 2\\" - nothing less and nothing more","review":"if you liked the ambient/electronic/pop masterpiece that \\"Play\\" was you will surely love \\"18\\" too.if you don't like the new moby sound you will not like this.because the fact is...that \\"18\\" is simply a musical continuation of previous hit album.the album features smoe great songs and mostly it leaves you satisfied.it is a bit more depressing and sad but it is not much different from \\"Play\\".\\"One of these mornings\\",\\"In this world\\" or title track are suiting fine there too.but while his previous album was totally perfect,this has a small flaws.these are - \\"The great escape\\" - sounds too much like filler, and \\"Harbour\\" made with sinead o'connor.\\"Harbour\\" sounds good in hte beggining but after 6 minutes it leaves you bored and you think only when will it end.the rest of the album is good and typical for moby.if you like this musician you will like it.as i said Moby haven't discovered any new territories but he continues making pleasent and good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is REALLY terrible!","review":"Many times, I need to play a CD several times to understand and appreciate what an artist intended to express that wasn't apparent on the first listening. Every time I play this CD, however, I wonder why I wasted my money on it. This has got to be some of the most bland, uninspired music I've heard in a long time. Moby's formula of using repetitive loops with found vocals lifted from obscure gospel or soul artists is very stale to say the least. His original compositions are so amateurish, I've heard more polished, interesting electronic compositions from complete unknowns who post their music to web forums. ... I believe his previous CD, \\"Play\\" was possibly just a stroke of luck in that it was reasonably decent. He is reverting back to the marginal lack of talent that he showed in his earlier efforts. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst excuse for an album that Moby has ever created....","review":"Alright, I consider myself to be a big fan of Moby. I've been listening to his music since the very beginnings, over 10 years ago. He's created albums that I consider to be masterpieces. This album, however, is a complete disaster. I knew Moby was on the way to becoming a sell-out, when all of the tracks from the album Play were sold for commercial purposes. This was something I eventually came to terms with. But the total lack of creativity that this album is comprised of is truely astounding. This is clearly evident in the song, \\"We Are All Made of Stars,\\" a total and complete travesty. He should be ashamed to put his name an album that is soo comercialized and mainstream. My advice, but any album by Moby EXCEPT THIS ONE!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very Average","review":"I got a chance to hear this disc all the way through Courtesy of MTV 2&I was amazed at how the amount of Numbers He does.I think Personally He is a Good Re-Mixer but as a Artist&Producer??

Moby has compiled an awesome mix of everything. I have yet to find a song of his that I don't like. Moby's albums are the type that you can listen to for hours on end and never get bored with or wear out a song. Some songs have an upbeat kind of feel, and others have more of a depressing note. Good for relaxation or dance music...it's a bit of both. I would recommend this album to anyone who loves good music!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much to Cheer About","review":"I am sure Moby was under incredible pressure to match the success of his hugely popular Play. The pressure must have got to him because this effort falls short. I admire him for not trying to duplicate his sound on Play, but the fact is that most of this album sounds uninspired. I enjoyed listening to a couple of the tracks, but the other 16 wee little more than white noise. Hopefully Moby will be back with his next effort and offer something with a little more meat to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moby at his best...","review":"Being a die-hard Moby fan, I would expect nothing less than excellence from his most recent album - and it delivered.A lot more subtle and ambient than it's predecessor \\"Play\\", it actually reminds me more of his album, ironically titled \\"Ambient\\". There is an unmistakeable quality that stands out among Moby's work and \\"18\\" is no exception.Just as inspiring as the music he produced in this album is the message that he wrote on the inside cover.Kudos, Moby - keep up the good work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected better","review":"After the sucess of his album Play, Moby followed that pattern in his new album 18. However, his songs started to go in the wrong direction. What set Moby apart originally was his techno/electronica dance beats that reverberated around a room. Sadly, his music has gotten away from his initial sound, and though he has found greater sucess, it's not what I had come to like so much about Moby. His 1996 album \\"Everything is Wrong\\" is in my opinion his best album. It contained all of the innovative, catchy beats that his music is now lacking. If you'd like to hear what a slightly more techno version of the Killers would sound like, pick up this album. If you're not, or if you're looking for classic Moby, you'll be disappointed. I expected better."},{"rating":"2","title":"18 . . . and if I could give this 6 stars I would","review":"Listen . . . you gotta buy two, that's all there is to it! You'll wear the first one out. This disc is tremendous. I never get tired of MOBY! He gives of himself everything that's inside. His unselfish collaborations with other artists are priceless! 18 is soulful, funky, melodious, hypnotic, creative brilliance in a small plastic box. From start to finish this is, by far, Moby's greatest disc. From the first song he draws you in and he doesn't let go til the end. Moby is a GENIUS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes sticking to what you know best may be the worst","review":"I bought this CD right when it came out and I was very disappointed. This is, in fact, Play Part 2. There is nothing fresh here and the played out melodies heard on \\"Play\\" get quite old here. This album may work for those of you who haven't heard the critically acclaimed \\"Play\\" because it takes the same formula and basically kills it when comparing the two albums. The first single \\"We Are All Made of Stars\\" does budge and it does work on certain levels, but it isn't anything to rave about. The appearance of Sinead O'Connor on another track on the album isn't that magnificent either. My recommendation is to definately get \\"Play\\" (if you don't already have it) and forget that this CD was ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT!!","review":"This is a great release!

Great traveling, or music at work too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old, same old...","review":"I was waiting for this new release for a long time. So much hype, so much exciting. But when I finally got it it was a big disappointment. I understand Moby has to make remixes, and I do understand that every DJ has his own style. But in this case you don't hear anything new or different from what you heard on his old albums. Just recycling of old tricks.Save your money, wait for the next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"i do really like it.","review":"i've noticed a lot of reviewers saying this cd is too much like 'play' and that they expect more from moby, since he's been known to really throw a curveball with some discs. having followed him since the 'everything is wrong' days, i have to say, when i put this disc in for the first time, it made me smile. it made me feel good from the first listen (it usually takes me longer). sure it has elements from play (particularly the soulful samples), but it brings together aspects of all his past music which i really like. it pulls a lot of the orchestral, cinematic, and piano types which i liked, particularly on 'everything is wrong.' this disc has a much more mellow, melancholic feel than 'play' did, but at the same time, makes me feel good. i'd almost consider it a more feminine version of the more masculine 'play.' if you like moby, you will like this cd. listen to the intricacies of it and you'll realize it definitely has its own moby flavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play...Continued","review":"\\"18\\" is a follow-up to Moby's breakout disk \\"Play\\" . This is not a bad thing. If you think you haven't heard \\"Play\\" you are wrong. Moby's music was in every media outlet imaginable in the past year and a half. With \\"18\\" he continues on his stylistically eclectic path by sticthing together music from bits and pieces gathered from the bins of used LP stores and fringe music downloads. He runs these found audio objects through his home studio adding his own musicianship and considerable DJing skills to produce occassionally stunning and always interesting, but non-threatening music. I liked this album a lot, but I wonder about its playability. Will I still like it after I've heard it a hundred times? I think so. Buy \\"Play\\" and buy \\"18\\", they are bookends. Very nice bookends. Now the challenge for Moby is to move on to new sonic ground. Beck reached this point with \\"Midnight Vultures\\" then...nothing. Lets hope this doesn't happen to Moby."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"collection of songs\\" for the times","review":"Take Moby's own advice from the liner notes. Sit and listen to this record front to back. Listen to it randomized. But listen.This is a record that quiets you, turns you inside out and takes you on a trip. It's also a perfect CD to play during work. It helps me think. I use Play to get me hyped up. I use 18 to help me settle down. Nature seeks balance.Your expectations were just trumped by the \\"little idiot.\\" Of course, I prefer to call him \\"little genius\\" -- anyone who writes, produces, records, mixes, and plays all the instruments on a record this incredible is on their way to legend status.According to Moby himself, again, referring to his liner notes essay -- he has written 3,000 songs, most of them he claims are \\"bad.\\" I only hope we get to hear the other 2,982 someday, because these 18 are just spectacular."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It","review":"I bought this CD based on the buzz about Moby -- shame on me. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, but after four attempts, still I find it too dull and repetitive to listen the whole way through. Maybe the guys in Guantanamo can use it to crack button-lipped \\"enemy combatants\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moby and his 18 Failures","review":"Unfortunately, I must agree with part of Mr. Eminem's new lyric which berates Moby's ability to create music. I found 18 to be quite horrible and I suppose we shall be haunted by these tracks for many months to come with car companies scrambling to scoop up the hottest pop-techno tracks. I desperately want my money back for this CD. Furthermore, I will not join in this pitiful jubilee of kissing Moby's behind. I honestly do not care if he is supposed to be this great DJ/Producer. There just isn't any talent there. The man layed some new, yet very simple monotone rhythms over old soul songs. I like to dream of a world where music is somewhat original. Rob Dougan has a CD coming out that is phenomenal and original. St. Germain is original and worth buying. Let them cast me down for my slanderous speech here, but I think Moby's glory days have long since faded into the background of American pop music."},{"rating":"1","title":"We are all made of 1 star.","review":"Uggh. When will you all wake up and realize this person is a hack? Am I the only one who notices that Moby's primary songwriting technique is stitching a few paltry loops together and playing them OVER and OVER and OVER until the listener wants to scream? It's pathetic, especially when there are so many artists out there with actual talent who are starving while this moron is raking in the bucks like there's no tomorrow. Wise up. Pull your heads out. Stop and think for a minute and see if you can actually think up two or three concrete reasons why you really \\"like\\" this drivel. Moby is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep your pillow close","review":"18 is a complete 180 from Play. Where Play kept you on your toes, 18 will barely keep you on your feet. Most of the CD is ambient filler with monotone vocals. Gone are the body rockin' beats and groves that kept Play alive and the listener glued. Track 9 was the only one that was palatable. 18 is a big disappointment for Moby fans. Every song on Play was an individual creation. The only way to tell if your listening to a different track on 18 is when your CD player differentiates it. I think that Eminm has it right when he said that Moby is done. If you like your beats consistent and repetitive this is the CD for you. It is not for me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"something missing","review":"I enjoyed Moby's Play, but this album was boring. It feels empty, like nothing is really driving it. I gave it away to a friend who likes Moby, and soon they too found little reason to listen to it. Unfortunate...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avant-Garde to Old-Hat","review":"In these days of accelarated time, one can go from avant-garde to old-hat in the blink of an eye. The most famous and commercially successful ( and we mean that literally, as half the cuts from his last cd, \\"Play\\" became, in fact commercials) music collagist in the business has done a brilliant job virtually recreating the sound and feel of that album. The music here, like that of its predecessor, is rooted firmly in deep soul and gospel. Moby records some of his singers live while exhuming others buried in the vaults. Add his tinkling piano and lush orchestral arrangements and we have the ingredients for another deliciously satisfying, if no longer innovative, platter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Loud","review":"The volume is way too loud on this, nor does it work right when you point the arrow to the specific animals. It works as a distraction during diaper time, but other than that, it's just way too obnoxious."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad","review":"not a dull and boring book about ancient times. herodotus put in stories along with his account of the wars between greek and persia. if you like old books this is one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't believe I finally read it!","review":"I picked up a copy of this book over ten years ago and it had been collecting dust ever since. The size alone kept me at bay plus my other experiences with ancient authors had led me to assume reading it would be a dull, tedious chore. BOY WAS I WRONG! I had SO much fun reading this book it was hard to believe. I finished it in less than a week (no mean task!). Anyone interested in early Greek culture or the wars with Persia might find a modern work to be more accurate but you'd be hard pressed to find a more ENJOYABLE piece than this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Read From Ancient Greece","review":"Herodotus' account is vivid, pertinent, exciting, insightful, and often hilarious as he recounts the people, places, customs, and occurrences in early Greece leading up to the Persian invasion.His account of the customs and manners of foreign lands, the behavior of kings, and the politics of battle will keep you engrossed.Perhaps the most significant portion of this book deals with Xerxes and his invasion of Greece. This story contains the famous Battle of Thermopylae in which the 300 Spartans hold the Persians at bay.I have compared this translation with about six other translations and found it to be as accurate as any and more readable than most. I highly recommend it, it is by far my favorite piece of early Greek literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"sadly if youre reading this...","review":"you are the owner of a D-1 diatom filter.aside from the filter leaking and being poorly designed these bags are a pain to change/clean and pretty expensive to replace.it does what its supposed to but honnestly i dont think its worth more than 3$"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Sequel","review":"This movie is so bad that is not fun.

The sectioning,layout,and presentation were cumbersome. There was no new information (for me) and the writing and editing were labored, and overwrought.

Even the class instructor was not thrilled with her choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Place to Start","review":"Differentiation is one of the current buzzwords, and lots of people talk about it...in theory. It's really difficult to find ANYONE who talks about it in PRACTICE. Heacox, while still heavy in theory, goes farther than any other authors I've read so far on the subject in actually giving teachers usuable tools for curriculum writing and developing. Could there be more immediately applicable things? Of course. Still, it's come the closest to giving teachers some tangible strategies and activities that I've found."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this book last winter, hoping it would provide additional valuable insight into ways to differentiate within my 5th Grade classroom. I was sorely disappointed, however. I found the book to only \\"skim the surface\\" of the entire concept of differentiation in general. It was more of a broad-based introduction for a new teacher, rather than a valuable reference tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific book!","review":"This was used as a textbook in one of my graduate school courses, but unlike many textbooks, it is actually well written and interesting. I found it also has a lot of useful practical information and was able to put a lot of what was in here into immediate use in my classroom. Definitely one of the best textbooks I've ever used, and if you are in education it is more than worth buying and reading even if you don't need it for a college or grad school course."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!!!","review":"MY FAMILY IS ENJOYING TO WATCH CHARLIE CHAPLIN.

This is a collection of Chaplin Mutuals and Essanys. The movies are greatly restored and as hullarius as ever. My favorite movie on the collection is easily The Cure which had me and my friend cracking up. The other movies are great too. The only bad parts about them are that some of the movies are color tinted it looks bad but you can still see. Another bad thing is the music isn't the same the music is still really good but nothing can beat Chaplins original music.

Thirty pages printed with 3\\" by 4.5\\" of typescript does not make for a thorough explication of the main thesis.However, that being said, perhaps the book would be more meaningful to some people. I just wanted a fuller explanation and guide--but I probably should have researched how many pages the item was before I ordered it--caveat emptor--as always.I recommend that one read the title and meditate on what that means and save a few dollars. Other books by Christian Larson would be a much more worthwhile read, but if a person needs to have everything he's written, I suppose purchasing this pamphlet/book would make sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Junior Brass Lantern","review":"I like this lantern a lot.

It is the most insightful and informative personal account of the whole problem in Europe during the Nazi period. Not only does Dora Sorell tell us about life before her internment, but also the problems that the end of the war created for those who lived under the communist rule. That is one thing that has been sorely lacking until now. We must never forget, and must tell our children and our grandchildren.

Furthermore, every religion but the publishers' - that of Jehovah's Witnesses - is subtly ridiculed. This is lightweight propaganda, a little more articulate than Reader's Digest, yet more biased than the World Book Encyclopedia. For the same mental energy you could read \\"The World's Religions\\" by Huston Smith and come away with informed RESPECT for your neighbors' beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"All along the watchtower","review":"\\"Mankind's Search for God\\" is comparative religion... from a Jehovah's Witness perspective. While its denunciations of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam are to be expected... and one could find in Protestant tracts as well, its critiques of Protestants and Catholics are from its unique theology. For a Jehovah's Witness, Jesus isn't God;he's merely the only directly created creature by Jehovah. He didn't get crowned in Heaven till 1914,and only 144,000 belong the exclusive Heaven's Club while everyone else lives forever in paradise on Earth. For a Jehovah's Witness,there is no \\"clergy class\\",no weekly Communion,and Mary certainly most isn't the Mother of God. For a Jehovah's Witness, the Trinity is a pagan invention.\\"Mankind's Search for God\\" is a fascinating take on comparative religion. It's done in a very patronizing, condescending way... but it's educational for anyone who wants to know the Watchtower's perspective on things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased view of other religions.","review":"It is quick to point out the errors & so called false teachings of other religions.

There are other books out there that do a better job of covering the worlds religions & from a more positive viewpoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"No boxed set?","review":"As discussed by other reviewers, this was a great show. I never tired of watching reruns on the Disney Channel. Great stories, great acting.I'd probably guess that the transfer to DVD is exceptional, either in black & white or colorized.So why only 1 star?Please..... Eight 1/2 hour episodes released as volumes @ close to $50 bucks a pop? Where on earth is the logic to this for the consumer. I must be missing something here, and i'd hope someone could enlighten me and other consumers. Boxed sets are the norm. Disney could charge $100 for the season and i would still buy it. But 8 episodes for 50 bucks? Hey, don't do me any favors."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Show is Great--The Packaging is Not","review":"I love the Zorro episodes!

I was hoping to up my skills/techniques a bit, so it didn't help me there. one thing I *was* looking for was detailed guidance on riding a long-distance manual. That portion lasted for maybe a minute, and didn't tell me anything I didn't know. Fortunately, I also sponsor a school-based mountian bike club, so I will be able to use this for my students in the club, but for even the Intermediate rider, I'd say you're better suited to hang out with riders a little better than you and watch and learn them.

Rogers has written a good book that strikes the right balance between big picture (this is the strategy portion of the book) appropriate for senior management, and details on the analytics appropriate for financial analysts and modelers. This balance is key because a common challenge for real options is making it less of a black box to senior decision makers. As the title indicates, Rogers places real options in a broad context of strategy, valuation and risk management -- some texts on real options come across purely as financial tools and miss this broader context. There are several realistic case studies included (IT project, electricity generation and pharmaceutical R&D). Senior management should read the first half, and financial techies can dig into the details in the second half. I would like to have seen a longer discussion on decision analysis; however, it covers a lot of territory in a compact size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goldilocks & the Three Bears","review":"This was one of my favorites, when I was growing up.

I think someone needs to bring out more Ellie Norwood films from the 20's out on DVD, and the complete (well the surviving four films anyway) of Arthur Wotner.

These are hard films to describe but there's something very beautiful about them. You'll either get it or you wont.

The author covers many subjects pertaining to the Roman cavalry itself, like unit organization and equipment. But, also covers the life of the individual soldier. From recruitment, training, and conditions of service, to how the cavalry was deployed in combat. The author also makes a number of comparisons between the cavalryman and the infantryman of the Roman Legion.

I lived in California for a year and have gone to San Francisco many times; the colored houses are spot on, as well as the seals at the Pier.After feeling the breeze of the coast, Francisco takes you into a world full of white. The poetry and illustrations make you want to put out your tongue and wait for the snow to land on your tongue. The section on snow would be great to read to kids who live in an area which it does not snow.My favorite thing about this book is the Iguana which is hiding on each page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too clever for its own good","review":"At no point during this album's conception did they sit down and make a conscious decision on its style. What we get is something of an art-rock muddle. NO Distance Left To Run is an achingly beautiful lament, Mellow song doing that style reasonably as well. Swamp Song (no relation of the Oasis track) is instantly appealing but soon fades, so does B.L.U.R.E.M.I. with its lazy retread of Song 2, via Devo. Coffee and TV is the only thing resenbling a britpop song, though I never liked that BLur phase much anyway. Much takd of tracks like Bugman and Trimm Trabb go on too long, with the nosie solo no Bugamn souring an otherwise strong track. Most of the tracks I haven't mentioned border on the unlistenable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-indulgent twaddle from England's most talented band","review":"Some claim to see 13 as a sign of the band's evolution. Well, let's not forget that evolving is not a synonym for improving, it is simply superior adaptation to one's environment. Here Blur continues to adapt to the American mainstream, i.e. pseudo-alternative, while ditching the pop sensibilities that made them distinctive and great. Really, any of a thousand American bands could have recorded this self-indulgent solipsistic noise fest, how many bands working today have the chops to create an album like \\"Great Escape\\"? Damon has turned into the stereotypical rock star, boring us with his \\"pain.\\" What a wanker. Everyone's been there.

Nearly every other album has been stellar and the first two tracks here were quite good.I can only see things getting better if the band chooses someone else to do the producing. Honestly, whose idea was it to hire a guy whose greatest claim to fame is producing a Madonna album?

If you've seen that video with the milk cartons flying around in heaven, you've only experienced a very small taste of what goes on here. Starting with a somewhat sarcastic yet beautiful gospel track about coping with love, and moving on through various forms of pop, jazz, funk, punk, even laced with tinges of hip hop and space disco, this album never stops changing, and you'll be completely hooked by your second listen (it's a bit challenging the first time around, as you will frequently wonder what the heck just happened, but you'll thank yourself for checking it out). I admit I'm not a huge Blur fan, but I'd give this album 21 stars out of 5 were the option available, and it certainly gets my very highest recommendation.

It used to be that the boys of blur would pen a good, solid and highly creative pop song that people could get behind and enjoy. Now, it's all sloppy guitars dripping with feedback and very little song structure. I suppose the launching pad for all of this can be found on their last self-titled CD where they took a stab at new forms of music. I understand the need to attempt new forms to keep things interesting, but if you get way too far out there, you run the risk of ailienating your core fans. There are some songs that work here like \\"Coffee and TV\\" and the opening \\"Tender.\\" Both sound much like the Blur of old, and those are both the CD's most sonically pallatible tracks. The rest is like filler for your ear. For Blur's best work, check out either \\"Leisure\\" or \\"Modern Life is Rubbish,\\" released in 1991 and 1993 respectively."},{"rating":"2","title":"So it's a little different.","review":"Blur are still great. When you buy this, just sit down for a couple of days, playing it over and over again. It's bloody fantastic.There is nothing more wonderful than Caramel or No Distance Left To Run. Coffee and TV is amazing, and Swamp Song is very, very cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good album that will grow with time.","review":"This is perhaps blur's best work to date, though not their most accesable. From the opening track , the wallowing 'tender' to the stormy yet brilliant 'caramel,' this album draws you into it's grasp as you listen further.It is not the most upbeat and cheerful as the other albums; most of the tracks were written during and after the breakup with Damon's girlfriend - there is a lot of angst in here. This album does not have the immediate pop appeal of say Parklife, and not as many rocky tracks and catchy riffs as Blur, their last release, but if you are a fan this will become your fave album in your blur catalogue. Not for newcomers to the blur world but a bloody good buy all the same!!! Recommended for any fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a perfect album","review":"The latest release by blur is wonderfully ecclectic and soulfully rich. From the Framptonesque \\"Bugman\\" to the Eurythmics laced \\"Tender\\" the band and producer William Orbit have have found their voice. The albums lyrics are pleasantly reminiscent of \\"Parklife in their subtle satirical tone\\" Great record!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlucky Number","review":"While I don't like most of the \\"songs\\" on 13, I have to admit that it is a product of sheer genius. Despite their best efforts at intentionally destroying their image, they've succeeded. It was truly amazing to hear Song 2 (one of their worst) being used for an Intel Pentium II commercial.13 is probably the worst blur recording to date and includes the first un-spirational song ever written (Tender). Most of the noises on this CD cannot be considered as songs but as suicidal pastiches. But, there are some songs here which are ok: BLUREMI, Coffee & TV, and the annoyingly long Bugman.I'm waiting for the same blur that made Peter Panic, Mr. Robinson's Quango, or even Death of a Party. Hopefully, on their next release they'll try a bit harder.[DW]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I'm sure Blur were trying to \\"progress\\" or something, but here it didn't really work. I bought the album on the strength of the three singles, Tender, Coffee and TV and No Distance Left To Run, which remain three of Blur's best songs, but I'm afraid to say that the rest of the album seems more like pretentious rubbish than anything else. It's like Kid A Radiohead but it doesn't grow on you from a weird experience into an intense emotional one. It just stays boring, uninspired and more like the strange fair-ground music on Parklife than End Of A Century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlucky #13","review":"Blur's latest is well, pants. Okay it's being hailed by the critics but that's only due to the shift in their music. They've evolved in a way that 'Old Blur' fans such as myself find difficult to adapt to. This simply isn't a patch on the last two albums (\\"The Great Escape\\" and \\"Blur\\"), the music is far too distorted and hard to even comprehend admiring. A couple of the songs do stand out, \\"Coffee & T.V.\\" and \\"B.L.U.R.E.M.I.\\" both see the boys back to their old selves.I'd recommend this to anyone that enjoyed Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\" as it's in the same vein. I personally didn't like that one either and the sooner I flog \\"13\\" the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better...and better...and better!","review":"Blur was great since the very beginning, I even love their first CD \\"Leisure\\". But on the last two CDs they changed more than just a bit, and each time they got even better. This CD is just beautiful. I actually have no favorite track - they are all great. It is a masterwork in the whole. Even if you're an old blur fan and your a bit disappointed - give it a chance and listen to it a few more times. When you get used to it, you'll see, that it is beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"GETTING THERE, GETTING THERE","review":"Coool bandmembers, cool songs, cool lyrics, everything on this album is just very, very cool. I'think its a great album from a great band so I think Damon and the others should continue in the same way. The good songs are: Tender*, Bugman*, Coffee and TV*, 1992*, caramel, Trimm Trabb* and Trailerpark. (The little stars stands for Really good song).Could there be another musical- genious like Thurston Moore in this world of MTV-music? probably not, but Graham and Damon is getting a little bit closer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tune in Turn off....atleast for 66 minutes","review":"Yes I admit when I handed the cashier my 14 dollars I was expecting an album similar to the self titled masterpiece. But after listening to the opening cut \\"tender\\" I realized how foolish this was of me. Every great band pushes the boundaries a step (or two). I'm on my fourth complete listen in two days and beginning to fall in love with it. The album is extremely cathartic and will be placed on the same shelf as say \\"tonights the night\\". Warning to all you \\"charming men\\", if your expecting a bit of brit pop or wooooh hoooooh you may be disappointed. It's more like Lo-fi meets conceptual art at it's finest....Enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"too much noodling, not enough songs","review":"somebody shoulda told damon albarn that an album ought not consist of 15 minutes' worth of songs surrounded by 45 minutes of instrumental filler. Sure, the songs -- especially \\"tender\\" and \\"coffee and tv\\" -- are brilliant, but they're undercut by the band's tedious ambient meanderings. damon needs to embrace his pop-songwriter side and stop trying to be thurston moore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected better, more listenable music","review":"I loved \\"Blur\\". I didn't expect or want a re-hash of \\"Blur\\", but I didn't expect this sonically disturbing release.

They bring vast diversity and typical pounding rage of every Blur album. This album sets the mark in 1999 for music. A precident or benchmark is set. All hail Blur, for they are our true gods. This album marks a change in the British industry. The music has gone past the neo-techno and distortion in favor of a reestablishment of the acoustic guitar on songs like the single, \\"Tender.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"WHY is it a BLUR?","review":"An intriguing question about this band will always be why they keep on turning their heads to a new direction every time they have taken a huge step. It was this CD that convinced me of their true experimentalist spirit, which in other terms means the unconformity with what is already done and the will to create beauty. This CD won't cope with the industries expectations. It is a blur because it doesn't have many common pop structures and is deliberately new. It will open your mind -at least a tiny bit-, specially if you are fed up with generic songs, and eventually will delight you, with some of the more horrible strident sounds on record, as in Bugman (all the noise you'll love becomes clear as Albarns says \\"space is the place\\") or Trimm Trab. \\"Tender's\\" optimism affords contrast to the album, which in general terms is very dark. Go on and take it for a spin."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most ruined albums ever","review":"With 13, Blur missed another opurtunity to make a great album which could be looked at as a masterpiece. The album has jewels here and there, and a great ending song (optigon 1) which show Blur as a band which wants to experiment. However, they betray themselves with songs such as Bugman and their other efforts seem to be made in vain. It reminds one that Blur is only another Pop band and a poor one at that .Blur's contmepararies from Britian do a good job of showing that Blur is a inferior band and that their music will not stand the test of time. The Verve, Radiohead, Pulp etc. all released masterpieces during the 1990's and Blur trailed behind, acting as a poor imitation.On your first few listens of 13, you may enjoy it, but it most likely wont last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that substantial","review":"I was never much of a Blur fan, but this album intrigued me. And on first listen, I was sure I'd heard something great, one of the best albums of the year. But sadly it was just a ruse. The music on this album is formless and mostly uninspired feedback symphonies, with nothing else going on. It's not that innovative or original (for the real deal in feedback rock check out My Bloody Valentine's \\"Loveless\\", or even Lou Reed's \\"Metal Machine Music\\" for that matter), and after a few close listens, it ceases to be interesting or entertaining. It's just a muddled collage of feedback, trip-hop, and, every once in a while, some brit-pop and punk. Don't be fooled."},{"rating":"1","title":"An experimental noise failure","review":"I've enjoyed plenty of records that other people call \\"noise\\". I like the Residents and industrial bands and NIN etc. I like most all of the Blur music until this record. What happened? Did they program a computer to generate totally grating screaches and add a little bit of impromptu vocals? This reminds me of Public Image Limited's unlistenable album \\"Flowers of Romance\\". The beauty of music successfully derived from noise is the genius it takes to mold the noise into something enjoyable. This is a failure at that, ending up a nasty reminder of the DENTIST'S DRILL! And, please, all you musicians of today, stop making every song start extremely quiet and build up. It has become cliche and cannot be heard in a car stereo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurts my ears, and not in a good way","review":"I really liked Blur's last album, the self-titled one. So I got this new one right after it came out. I've listened to it about 5 times and I can't stand it. I find the songwriting really uninspired and the level of noise incredibly grating.

I also liked the trust factor of Velvet for Jason. Yes, Jason was perhaps not as trusting of Velvet (I think...) but he certainly had reasons to be a bit unsure of the trust factor considering his past history.

Bnois also supplues the smokin \\"I'm a man\\" vocals\\". Together they make up one of the best blues duos working today. Their second release for Blind Pig takes up where \\"Roadhouse Research\\" left off. Joe still is heavily influenced by early employer Freddie King and fires off salvo after salvo of red hot guitar riffs. Bnois sings of deceiful women and the joys of being from the Lone Star state. There's nothing groundbreaking here and Bnois and Joe may not even be the best at what they do. They just work well together and their albums get your south side shaking. Recommended if you like fun music tailor made for cranking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tree Frog Named Popeye","review":"Once upon a time, there was a googlely-eyed tree frog named Popeye who crawled up among the leaves of a spinach plant. Imagine his surprise when the plant gets harvested and he finds himself inside a clear plastic bag on its way to a grocery. Now imagine the surprise of the person who buys and opens that bag of spinach to find little Popeye. Based on a true story Popeye ends up as a school classroom pet and science display. The author tells a wonderful tale in a menner in which youngt children can quickly connect with. The story is both interesting and educational. The illustrator, a retired Disney animator provides very realistic pictures about the little frog's journey and the people who interact with him.

I found many, many pages that offered excellent insight - by the time I finished I'd turned down perhaps three quarters of the pages! I bought the book for my siblings, and have also given copies to friends who have lost loved ones.

The children happen across a magical cottage entirely made of gingerbread and sweets, which is owned by an evil witch...Joan Collins plays the dual-roles of the stepmother and the witch, and gives a fantastic performance as both characters.

Collins is delightfully funny and frightening in her roles and looks like she is having fun. Ricky Shroeder and the late Bridgette Anderson turn in cute performances as Hansel and Gretel. Although excellent for the family, you may want to cuddle up with the kiddies while they are watching the witch scenes. An excellent episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MOVIE FROM THE FAERIE TALE THEATRE!!","review":"I loved to watch this movie as a child and I still love it today.

I was caught up in the descriptions of baking bread from scratch. I have actually tried some of the author's recipes. Yumm! The story about a young woman who is rejected by her all-for-show husband is entertaining. It didn't take all of the expected turns, either.

I hoped that the shallow whiner at the beginning of the book would evolve into someone a little wiser and more sympathetic by the end. Alas.

It is about Wyn realizing she wasn't so happy in her marriage anyway. I cheered her courage as she forged ahead to find out what will make her happy and it wasn't the designer clothes that David always made her wear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written","review":"This book is not about racing to finish and find out what happens. It's about enjoying every paragraph and every page which is filled with vivid imagery, a wonderful sense of humor, tremendously sensitive insight into the emotional life of the human heart, and rich characterizations of imperfect people who become real and important to you. You WILL get involved with Hendrick's characters and you WILL care deeply about what happens. But, in THIS book (and Hendrick's other Novel \\"Isabel's Daughter\\"), you will enjoy every page on the journey to find out. I borrowed these books, read them, and then ordered them (from amazon, of course) because I want to OWN them and re-read them, something I hardly ever do. These are keepers! And I hope Judith Hendricks lives a long productive life, taking her time to craft more such beautifully-written stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books out there.","review":"This book started out great and then halted quickly. The husband having an affair leaving wife theme is done again and again and I do enjoy reading about the down and out women making a fighting comeback.

She loses her own sense of self and purpose when she marries a man who then divorces her. She goes to Seattle to work as a baker. She works through issues in her life and finds new friends. I loved this book, there was a strong story along with strong and rich characters. As a reader, I enjoyed learning about bread and baking and enjoyed the recipes scattered throughout the book along with words of wisdom from Wyn's Oma (grandmother). I felt a connection to Wyn, as if I was a friend hearing her thoughts. The cover is also beautiful and pulled me in with a picture of a quaint bakery storefront which fits perfectly with the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a great woman's book","review":"It is a book of many situations.

After reading the description I thought I was buying a DVD that was a \\"Core Yoga Flow practice\\" and it was not that at all. The 40 minute segment is very choppy, there is no flow what so ever, and the instructor often stops all moves to explain things for 1-2 minutes before going into the next sequence. I was expecting a vinyasa style flow that had me sweating, but with all the stopping/explanations and the awkward transitions not of a normal vinyasa class I wanted to turn the DVD off 15 minutes in. Definitely for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so","review":"Wouldn't buy this DVD again... It's definitely a good yoga DVD but in my opinion it's just for beginners. The best part is that the instructors talk you through everything so well that it actually allows you to focus on your movement and not break your neck looking at the TV in order to follow the master yogi.I got this DVD mainly to bring variety into my ab workout routine, but have to say that I was disappointed... However, one of my friends, who works out every blue moon, found some exercises rather challenging.So if you are a beginner - go for this DVD because it's very explanatory and the exercises won't kill you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"the core workout was ten minutes if that. i expected more. i guess being a beginner i did not like the 35 minute yoga program too fast for me. will return if i can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I hate to give something YogaWorks related only two stars, but I found the workouts on this DVD disappointing, and I wouldn't recommend this DVD.There are two workouts on the DVD: a 9 minute Fit Abs workout and a 43-minute Core Yoga Flow workout.The Fit Abs workout doesn't really have any yoga-specific elements and doesn't utilize any of the traditional core-specific asanas (e.g. navasana). It's a series of crunches and plank exercises that you would do in any gym class.The Core Yoga Flow workout is very slow. This longer workout does have more traditional sequences and asanas, but it's not exactly a flow workout where you move through one pose for each breath throughout the workout.I was hoping that with this DVD I could incorporate some of the YogaWorks energy and focus on flow into my home practice. Unfortunately, the DVD doesn't deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"cozy crochet","review":"I've been crocheting for two years now, and at the very least, I don't need to keep looking up how to make a single or double crochet stitch anymore! That being said, I think this book (so far) has both really, really simple projects like the dishcloths and coasters AND overly confusing and somewhat misleading projects like the cozy kerchief. The lovely picture of the kerchief is not triangular like the pattern indicates. Unfortunately this specific picture is one of the main reasons I bought the book, and it simply is not what this book tells me how to make. Wouldn't it be cool if the author or publisher or editor put up the real pattern online somewhere?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love it but one pattern is giving me trouble!","review":"I was attracted to this book mainly for the Cozy Kerchief pattern-and I can't create it!!

I was ready to throw this book across the room within 30 minutes! Contrary to what the book says, it is not for beginners. Very pretty illustrations, but the author assumes you know what she's talking about a lot of the time - in the first few pages! Those who, like myself, know very, very little about crocheting will be confused and frustrated. I'm returning this book today for Crocheting for Dummies. COMPLETE WASTE of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psalm 103 beautifully illustrated!","review":"This book is filled with beautiful illustrations, accompanying the text of Psalm 103 (KJV). A gorgeous book to read through with your children. The illustrations are so detailed and worthy of being framed.

I stop and explain at the end of every two-page spread anyway, just as I do anytime I'm reading the Word of God with my children. I'd recommend this book to any Christian family with children in the preschool through early elementary years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast food pilates","review":"This DVD relates to Pilates the same way as fast food relates to real food. The emphasis is on speed not quality . The exercises switch quickly from one to the next with minimal instruction and , worst of all, with a minimal warmup. Some things just take a little time , and I believe pilates is one of them. Pilates is like good sex, it shouldn't be rushed. If you can't spare more than 5 minutes for a pilates workout you have a problem that pilates isn't going to solve. I would reccommend the Lindsay Jackson \\"Pilates for Men\\" DVD. Sure, the workout takes about an hour but it has a good 15 minute warmup, good instructions and seems well balanced and structured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be a better problem solver better math worker","review":"These books are the basic preparatory materials for a better and more successful college math career.

I was hoping it would but it did not. I took the advice of some reviews and pored hot water into the thermos first but that did not work.

At most this will keep food warm for 2-3 hours. I try to use this for my daughter's school lunch and end up having to pre-heat the flask with boiling water first to reduce heat transfer when I put in the extremely hot food, and then also wrap the whole flask in kitchen towels, before putting this in an insulated lunch box. It provides a lukewarm lunch after 4 hours.I would expect much better from Thermos. The fact that the wall of the flask is warm on filling is a real giveaway that the vacuum (or, more likely, cheap insulation) is just not effective.Pros: good portion size, durable, wide mouth, handy folding spoon.Cons: does not keep food warm for more than a very short time."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't keep the heat","review":"This product didn't even keep liquid hot for 2 hours.

I have the TomTom iPhone car kit, and again the plug doesn't fit, even without the case -- which is disappointing, because I purchased this shielded, 6' long cable exclusively to connect my iPhone to the audio input in my car while using the TomTom kit.

As Logic books go, it's dated and missing a lot of information. The section on dealing with VST instruments is few pages long and I think thats dates it more than anything.The author spends a inordinate time talking about setting up a midi environment and skipping over all the things that make logic so powerful.Most of the book reads like a laundry list to be honest.

Half of a movie shows us how her life is really so average, just going around, doing her chores, work and family--boooring! Here and there it shows how she \\"help\\" women who are pregnant to abort. At the end she gets arrested and goes to jail. That's a whole story. No dramatic twist, no character development, no historical backdrop that would tell us something about views of the time--this one is a big miss, because movie might have been more interesting if introduced views of politicians, church, judges, average women. If you have 2 hours to spare, you might put your feet up and stare at the blank wall-time better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slick Pro-Abortion Propaganda","review":"Slick pro-abortion propaganda vehicle using saintly grandmas. After all, you can't not like a grandma, right? Well, besides the fact that the movie is slow, altogether very very slow and tedious, it is outright propaganda indeed, yes it is; and it leaves me wondering: when is this filmmaker and screenplay writer going to be making a movie about saintly grandma Holocaust nurses? Yes, of course! Let's make a movie about some nurse who helped Dr. Mengele carry out his macabre experiments! Wonderful! Doesn't it make you feel good? About as good as this movie does? Ancient peoples sacrificed their children to the fires of Moloch and Chacmool, et al; we of today sacrifice our children to the twin gods Convenience and Irresponsibility. And yet we have lost our barbarism?--humankind is just as savage as it ever was."},{"rating":"2","title":"a magnificent performance in a brilliant film..........","review":"you will not believe the performance mike leigh gets from the magnificent imelda staunton! if there were true justice in the oscars, she would have won hands down! at the film's conclusion, there was not a dry eye left in the theatre, and many shouts of \\"brava\\" were heard throughtout the end credits! i'll not give any spoilers here, except to say mr. leigh has created his ultimate masterpiece-even better than \\"topsy turvy\\" and secrets and lies\\"! the entire cast is absolutely brilliant, as is known as a trademark for mr. leigh, but to experience ms. staunton's performance, is to experience a great painting, if you will! she is magnificent from start to heartbreaking finish. this one is a true keeper, no matter your beliefs in abortion. the 1950's sets, cinematography, and above all else, ms. staunton's performance all combined together will leave you breathless. do not miss this dvd-it's a keeper and one for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"True life confessions","review":"WOW, I've said it before and I'll say it again, British films seem to do more with less. I'd never heard of Imelda Staunton before this movie, but her performance, especially the interrogation scenes, was so on target it earned her an Oscar nomination. (You may remember her as the disgruntled school principal in Freedom Writers). Substantial performances all around, Vera Drake is a masterpiece from start to finish. I gave this film four instead of five stars because, as with most British films, this movie simmers a tad too long.

It is a movie that I wanted to physically push along to pick up the pathos. The film plot its self was interesting. I had problems with the thick cockney drawl and the slow moving story line. I did enjoy the acting and the glimpse into a simpler time of human emotion and understanding. A glimpse of the more things change, the more they stay the same. The police showed compassion for there prisoner. Vera Drake was honest and forth coming as played as a loving villain. The audience was able to get to know each of the main characters and have a genuine feeling for them as the story climaxed."},{"rating":"1","title":"a new way to get info out of P.O.W.s","review":"It's difficult for me to go into specifics with regard to what I found so horrible about this film because my mind apparently went into some type of state-of-shock-survival mode, I guess like what happens during any sort of severe abuse, and all that register in my memory was the fact that it was entirely unpleasant.

At times the wait has been frustrating (the last two CD's were great!) and it seemed the release date changed many times. I bought this CD the day it was released and have listened to it ever since. \\"Pet your Friends\\" rocked me. \\"And You Think You Know What Life is About\\" made me think. \\"Opaline\\" has taken me to a peace I have never heard from any CD. JR's voice truly hypnotizes and makes you feel as if there wasn't a care in the world. The way the band and JR's voice blend is amazing! My favorite song is \\"Nashville Skyline\\". It's beautiful! I am glad Em from Chicago agrees.

Other strong cuts are: \\"Somewhere In the Middle\\", \\"Home\\", and \\"Angels or Devils\\". J.R. Richards' vocals soar on this record. The band, as always, consistently provides melody, harmony and passion. You'll find yourself asking why this band doesn't get more radio airplay. It's a solid record, one that will make you feel like the world is a better place for listening..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Dishwalla is back-at least I hope they are. I bought this album at midnight Tuesday morning April 23rd, and I thought it was fantastic...I have listened through the whole thing many times now (which in itself is a rarity for me...usually I like only one or two songs) and was amazed at J.R. Richards range and ability to convey emotion. Great stuff...pick it up and you won't be disappointed (plus, its an HDCD, which means it will sound better than regular CDs do)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive!","review":"I must admit to not knowing that much about Dishwalla but when I heard \\"Somewhere in the Middle\\", I knew I had to have the cd. One of my best purchases to date! Every single song on the cd is fabulous! The lyrics and music are addictive and I found myself singing along soon enough. This is not one of those cds that you buy and play only one or two songs.So many of the tracks are soulful and heartfelt, not contrived at all! Some of my current favs are the title song \\"Opaline\\" and \\"Every Little Thing\\". If I had known this band had this much talent, I would have been a fan earlier."},{"rating":"2","title":"You talk about growth","review":"I bought \\"Pet Your Friends\\" long ago, and it was certainly a solid cd with promise for the band's future. But, as the years passed I saw no real follow-up. Then, Opaline comes out. This cd is intriguing and intoxicating. The melodies and rhythms are fresh, deep and artistic yet allow strong rock overtones to surface, fantastic!! It is a bit of art-rock mixed with beautifully written ballads with rock all around. This cd is so refreshing a listen in a world of pop-music mediocrity. My only sorrow is that I doubt there is a large audience for music like this, one can only hope this cd touches more than those who will automatically appreciate it. Those who do find it, and listen to it will discover the MAGIC of musical inspiration that this disc represents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Music!!!","review":"What can I say but simply \\"gorgeous\\" is the word that comes to mind when I listen to this CD. I heard Dishwalla about a month ago on \\"Late Night with Craig Kilborn\\". They played the song \\"Home\\" from Oplaline. Their lead singer has a perfectly mellow voice. I've only been listening to it for about a week, but I'm finding more and more to appreciate with each listen. So far, the tracks that stand out are \\"Angels and Devils\\", \\"Somewhere in the Middle\\" and \\"Home\\".Note to all you hard rock fans: This isn't hard rock music for all your headbangers, just a smooth Adult Alternative rock CD that does a lot with melody and some nice rock touches here and there. That combined with the lead singer's serenely smooth voice will give you something to listen to when you just want to mellow out"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD Purchase You Will Never Regret!","review":"It's very simple.

Please give them your support. The music is pure gold, utterly beautiful, filled with emotion and musical bliss. I also recommend highly their sophomore record \\"And You Think You Know What Life's About.\\" This is one of the best bands of all time. Please buy this CD! I am a musician and work in top 40 radio, so I know my music. This is some of the best a person can come by. Get it and give this band your support!

My local radio station brough them to this festival, and they played after the band Jeremiah Freed... After the show, they signed stuff, so I bought the CD there. I've been listening to it since this Summer. So I feel proud to have the CD signed by the lead singer, just because I like the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"I've been following these guys since \\"Pretty Babies\\" and they seem to have the ability to keep it fresh from album to album. This one is no exception, though some of the songs start to sound a little similar after repeated listenting. Nonetheless, they have evolved their style and sound further with this release and there are several gems to be found within. My favorite is the eastern-flavored title track, \\"Opaline\\". Don't miss the chance to see them live, if you have the opportunity!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Masterpiece!","review":"There are not enough stars for this review! \\"Opaline\\" is the first album since U2's \\"Joshua Tree\\" that has touched me profoundly. Nothing on this CD is insignificant - NOTHING. Melodic and serene, the lyrics, arrangements and production are all first-rate.In my opinion, you can see the steady movement of Dishwalla toward this elegant music from thier first album \\"Pet Your Friends\\", through the second \\"And you think you know what life's about\\" and then the fabulous \\"Counting Blue Cars\\" EP of acoustic masterpieces, to this incredibly beautiful and satifying album. Simply extraordinary! It is a shame that this band does not get more airplay and coverage, although a visit to their Website... will certainly provide some additional information about this outstanding group.If you ever listen to \\"Opaline\\", you will be forever a fan!

They've done it to me three times now! I was a little afraid when I heard they let someone beside themselves produce Opaline, as they produced their first two. Greg Wattenberg did a great job. He does \\"get\\" their style. The songs are melodic, soulful, and really get to you. Its a bit more mellow than the first album, Pet Your Friends - and not as \\"abstract\\" as the second \\"So You Think You Know What Life's About\\". JR, the lead singer writes almost all their songs - backed by the music that the band puts to it - I think you'll find it to be one of the best CDs out there.

There were difficulties in following changes of character when speaking and many changes in point of view through out the book.I knew from early in the book that Veronika was not dying of heart disease. The clues were far from subtle, more like a hammer. Few women dying of heart disease could go through the the extended sexual climaxes that she did,nor \\"trudge\\" up a hill, nor get totally drunk, nor stay up all night walking around.The ending was disappointing as was the entire book.The ending was very abrupt and left the reader with many unanswered questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Veronika decides t die","review":"Yesterday I read the Book \\"Veronika Decides to die\\" by Paulo Coelho, It was surprisingly gripping.

It explores the experience of a young woman, who, having survived a suicide attempt, finds herself in a mental asylum. Freed from the pressures of being sane, she is able to explore who she is and how she longs to live her life. I've avoided this book for a long time, largely because of the title, but it's actually a beautiful book, and one of Coelho's best. There's a messy bit at the beginning where Coelho awkwardly inserts himself in the story, tying his own much publicised time in mental institutions to the story, but once you get beyond that it's an inspiring read about leading an authentic life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifeless","review":"It seems that most people reviewing this book are reviewing the message (\\"Life is good\\") rather than the book. Sure, the moral of the story makes you feel good, but that doesn't mean that the book is well done; in fact, the novel itself is weak. The story goes nowhere, the characters are as dead as Veronika wishes to be, and the ending is obvious from the beginning. Maybe it reads better in Portugese, but this one left me colder than the Slovenian winter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Info and Too Sad","review":"This book is not for the feint of heart, or those people who are working through any sort of problems of their own in their personal life. I felt like the author was too blunt, and the book was sad with no relief, or humor to offset some of the grueling details. It was factual, to the point of brutality. It is definitely not escape fiction.Before I purchased this book, I would have liked a more thorough review, such as \\"a very tragic story,\\" or something along those lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"We're All A Little Crazy","review":"The title of this book would normally be a turn-off for me. I wouldn't even consider reading it if my very own daughter, Arianna, hadn't mentioned it so excitedly to her friend, Laura, last August 2004. I finally found a used copy and I'm very glad I read it now. Paulo Coelho simply adds so much to one's life in his profound words (and definitely read THE ALCHEMIST--if you haven't already!). 'No one should let themselves get used to anything'. Hey that last sentence is in this book! I'd highly recommend this book for any person who is psychologically 'in the know' and/or who has an inkling of minimal depression during the trials and tribulations of living a routine life. Everyone has an unusual story to tell--is another line in this book and the Eduard character is clearly semi-autobiographical to Paulo's own life. Another good reminder from this book is to make sure you get enough 'sunlight' in your life. It DOES make a difference!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Along to Get Along or NOT!","review":"This is a great book that shows how everything is not how it seems. Sometimes we all need a kick in the butt, so to speak, in order to stand up and live an authentic life.It takes courage to live authentically in the world. Sometimes it may seem easier to hide away or disappear or just do what everyone is doing. Veer off course. Take a chance.

After that she is placed in a rehabilitation center where she experiances different kind of an atmohphere and this is what makes this book interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book","review":"Paulo Coelho has done it again. What a fantastic book! It keeps your mind wondering about the different meanings of life and the goals that we think we want to achieve. Wonderful prose!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go ahead, throw your money away...","review":"Please, do not be fooled. Though Paulo Coelho has been translated to many languages and sells fortunes, he is NOT one of the better Latin American writers. No one takes him seriously in Brazil. This, as are his other books, is a bunch of supposedly profound thoughts thrown together and poorly written. There are better books in the self-help section. If you want the real thing, get a book of chinese proverbs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Veronika=An Insignificant read","review":"When I heard of this story I was intrigued as to what Paulo Coelho had to say about a girl who attempted a failed suicide but knew she would still die within five days. The lessons learned here could be quite insightful and incredibly touching, especially since her fate has been pre-determined by her actions. Unfortunately, I found the author's use of the third person at the beginning of the novel to be rather pretentious, and the ending to be especially cliche. If Coelho hadn't put a twist on the plot, the ending would have had better closure and meaning. Instead, it became another hackneyed story about a girl committing a plea suicide, something much too familiar and far less memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is a Failure","review":"I have some personal experience with the subject matter, but that is really not relevant to my criticisms of the book. I found Coelho's writing style very distant and not very engaging. The ending is a cheap hollywood trick and fails to bring any real insight on the subject matter. The body of the work is told from a very distant perspective and the reader is never drawn into the story. A waste of time and money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Substandard","review":"Plenty of writers have examined clinical psychology and the people who practice it, challenging the standards of sanity, the therapies, and the operation of mental institutions. And most of their books are a lot better than Veronika Decides to Die. Paulo Coelho doesn't really add anything to what's already been said on the subject.Granted, this is the only work of Coelho's that I've read, and I'm reading it in translation, so I may not be getting the full effect. But so far as I can tell, this book is a series of serious missteps interspersed with only minor displays of skill.I'm ceding it two stars because it's brief and simple, but that's the best thing I can think of to say about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't literature","review":"This is NOT literature. If you thought the Da Vinci Code was a great book, you will probably like it. If you're into REAL literature, don't even try. Read something by Saramago instead, now that's a real writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking elsewhere for better service","review":"When I ordered this book, I specifically looked for a used book seller on the west coast, where I live, for the ability to receive the book timely. It took me TWO WEEKS to receive the book from one state over! I ordered a book in \\"good\\" condition and it arrived with the spine almost falling out.

There is no profound literary education in this work.

Its perhaps the honesty of the book and the main characters feelings or lack of feelings towards the purpose of her life that makes it quite a harsh read but one with great meaning behind it. I didn't find my self sympathising with the characters trouble but instead I found my self willing her on to rediscover and appreciate her life once again. Certainly a book that gets you thinking, some interesting points are made. Definitely a clever idea to the story, one undoubtedly film worthy. If you liked the craziness of Girl interrupted then this books for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Find the meaning of life here","review":"This is a simple and touching story about a young girl called Veronika who seems to have nothing, yet everything wrong with her life. After a failed suicide attempt, Veronika is sent to a mental hospital where she is told, she is to live only a week as a cause of her failing heart. It is in this madness that she finds the meaning of love and of life. I read this book in one sitting and it really got me thinking. The language in the book flows and the ideas behind the story are thought provoking. All in all, an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unpredictably Interesting","review":"Interesting style of writing by the author. Very interesting insights into psychiatry.

Maybe it is just this book but I do not feel like trying any of his other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've used for in several projects now.","review":"This is the best book on requirements gathering I have ever read. When I finished it, I asked for and received the authors' permission to use the Volere template for a couple of test cases in my job (I specialize in requirements gathering) and have used it for one very large and another very famous client, with excellent results. While it doesn't especially lend itself to Internet projects, it significantly cuts down the time it takes me to gather requirements, and adds a level of consistency to the requirements documents my colleagues and I produce. Definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bible for Requirements Analysis","review":"I have been in the IT industry for 20 years and this is by FAR the best book on the Requirements Analysis process I've every seen. I've had it since it first came out, and have used the Volere process to successfully run several software development projects. They were all successful. Both the Design and Test teams LOVED the resultant Requirements Specification because they knew exactly what to code and exactly what to test to prove the requirements were met. My only complaint is that it takes a lot longer to document a Spec. to this degree of detail, but if you can convince \\"the powers that be\\" to take the time to do it, it will save a lot of time and expensive re-writes later.Even if you don't use the Volere method to write your specs., it's worth the read for the knowledge gained on the analysis process itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful","review":"Took 3 weeks before I was told there was a mistake somewhere, then another week to get here even though I was promised overnight shipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Practical Coverage of the Requirements Process","review":"This book should be on the shelf of every Business Analyst professional. It provides excellent step-by-step guidance with solid illustrations and example material. It has a solid balance between academic theory and pragmatic goodies that every Business Analyst can utilize. Material presented is comprehensive, well-structured, and easily understandable. The customization applied in the 2nd edition relative to Agile theory is well presented and balanced.

Not a bad read and the authors provide some good information , insight and some nice touches of humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is this book for","review":"This is an academic document of someone who has participated on the process of gathering requirements.The detail of every chapter, the context of the user, roles, the things to consider, the tips, the relations to other systems, the different kinds of requirements, the guides, the testing, all is there and complete. But it belongs to the classroom.I was looking for a book that I can lend to the people in my organization so we can improve in our actual development process. There are no tips on how to use formats like the Use Case, it does not even appear on any page. Nor does it show the actual deliverables to the analysis and development team or suggestions on traceability for testing on the final product.The writer has taken care on keeping things open so people could discuss, improve or use alternate approaches. But software development needs standards and method, there are no suggestion on how you can improve on these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatal Fundamental Flaws (cont)","review":"this book has not only the flaws identified below by F.C.Passavant - in addition it has inconsistencies in terminology, lots of ambiguity. it was difficult to map described precesses to those regarded in the field (i.e. IATF Release 3.1)I found \\"Requirements Engineering\\" by Elizabeth Hull, Kenneth Jackson, and Jeremy Dick a much better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Project preparation for the clueless","review":"A little background information before I begin: I ordered this book for a specific project - specifying generic computer application non functional requirements for my coorporation. The book does not claim to be useful in the particular area, but I took a chance and bought it anyway.That being said, I found it surprisingly useless. The language is chatty, repetitive and at worst, tiresome. The illustrations are numerous and large, some of them helpful, others not.The information and toolset given in this book are quite sound, but I must admit that I had expected something, that went beyond what I was taught as a computer science freshman some 10 years ago sprinkled with a bit of common sense.I cannot say wheter this book might not be great for other purposes, but from a computer science perspective, the useful information amounts to something that would fit in a thin pamphlet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biased, how?","review":"Because it doesn't fit your agenda?I'm not sure how someone else's memories mean the writer is biased..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's always on top of the pile ...","review":"... because I keep taking it out to look at again. The photographs are stunning. And Graves's prose is just lovely, as it always is.

It does however leave you with a dilemma when critiquing it. Does one talk about the impeccable writing style exemplied in this wonderful heartlifting novel or the heartwarming qualities of the protagonist? Parry \\"Ebony Satin\\" Brown's SHIRT OFF HIS BACK\\" Leaves the reader searching for more pages at the end of the book. Although the story is complete, the relationship which develops between the characters and the reader is impressive. Terry is every woman's dream man. With that, it is easy to snuggle vicariously into the Jackie character. Parry's style is a new one with a mixture of more familiar genres. The main character ,a single father, is one to be admired. The \\"he done me wrong\\" story was never meant to describe him. Once you pick up this book, don't expect to put it down until the completion. Looking forward to Parry's upcoming works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent easy to read book","review":"I read this book in six hours, I could not put it down. The book is a must read.

I think that everyone can relate to something in this novel. The characters seemed real, and most important, the love seemed real. This novel was well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was way too perfect, not realistic","review":"I did not enjoy this book, the plot was not suspenseful. A lot of what the characters were worried about was not even reasonable. The one twist \\"Wendell\\" that could have been nice was given away early in the story. It is very unrealistic that a African American family would allow a woman into their home (Catherine) that would totally humiliate everyone and they would not even make her leave. I found this book to be very poorly written and very unrealistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S ABOUT TIME","review":"Reviews that I read before reading this book were very mixed.

Her review sums it up to a \\"T\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-intentioned Drivel","review":"Shirt Off His Back was simply terrible. I think that the author had good intentions when she wrote it. Instead of writing about no-good black men who cheat on their girlfriends/wives, she chose to write about loving black men who care for their families and are faithful. That's fine. So why did she mess it up by creating these ridiculous characters? Momma C and her annoying dialect was just too much to handle. Catherine was so unbelievable-she was almost like a black Cruella DeVille. Terry and Jackie's relationship and their perfect children were so saccharin-sweet I just couldn't handle it. The book is as far as realistic as you can get. I half-expected there to be a pumpkin, a fairy godmother, and some dwarfs in it.

Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian book????","review":"I would like to know why NONE of the reviews I've come across, so far, address the fact that Terry and his girlfriend, Jackie, engage in sex without being married--and this is supposed to be a CHRISTIAN book. If there was anything to indicate the struggle of lust, temptation, falling, repentance, redemption--any of those themes--I would find it understandable. But what I read of the book does NOTHING to even address this. It might be some nice sugarcoated religious fiction, but there is no gospel in it. Jesus came to DELIVER us from our sin.

Of course, i also love discovering bands me or my friends have never heard of. I pick up this black cd NY hardcore album Burning Bridges for $5.99. To me, alot of NY hardcore music sounds alike in many ways according to the tradition of the style. But there are those few and far between that stand out amongst the rest...such bands like Agnostic Front, Madball, 25 Ta Life, and the short-lived but very influential Minor Threat from the early 80's. Burning Bridges grabbed me by the heart in its heavy unique style of hardcore metal. In short, I have read up on them and their struggle as a band and line-up changes. But this is one band that I hope emerges from their underground profile and needs to be recognized as a pillar in the NY hardcore lifestyle and music."},{"rating":"2","title":"KINGDOM INSPIRED","review":"THIS BOOK, THE FATHERING SPIRIT IS A MUST READ....IT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THAT WE EMBRACE THE NEED IN OUR FAMILIES, COMMUNITIES AND CHURCHES FOR THE FATHERING SPIRIT.

The chapter on networking has been tremendously helpful to me personally in the expansion of my own business.

I was fooled into thinking this would be a good romance when, in fact, it seemed far from it! While reading, I was disappointed in Davenoff as a vampire. The entire time he was in trouble, I kept expecting him to somehow regain strength and escape. I was sorely disappointed. I was also frustrated with Sarah and Corrine. I couldn't understand why Sarah was friends with Corrine since they were so different. And Corrine's involvement in the whole affair just ruined the desirable image I had at first about Davenoff. After somehow managing to read this book, I realized the whole romance aspect toward the end was cold. Sarah didn't fall for Davinoff for himself. She was pitied into loving him. I think everything she felt for him was just pity.

The story DID have potential to be good, but the author had horrible character development in the first half of the book to allow me enjoy the characters. I will admit the ending was good, I liked the way it turned out.. But honestly, the first 200 pages were brutal. I couldn't quite figure out how a love relationship could development with the heros when there was nothing in the first half of the book to allow them to really interact! I don't recommend this as a first vampire romance novel, try another one of her books because most of them are fairly written. I expected more from Susan Squires having read 'The Companion' before 'Sacrament'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that Great","review":"This book wasent that great.

There was a point were I thought Sarah and Julien were never going to get together. During the first 200 pages the authur never gave any indication that they had and attraction towards each other. They sleep together one night almost towards the end of the book, and they realize oh we love each other. Also the book had about three parts that should of been identify. It was like three stories, with the same characters. I got to say I was not happy with this read. I can say Sarah character was well developed, her character matures through out the story. Corina was a real psycho for a villain. Julien was a boring hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"I usually go through a book in about 5 days. After a week and a half and still only being a third of the way through, I finally had enough of this book. Davinoff just seems to be an object in the book and not a character. Corina is evil through and through. And really if Corina is your BEST friend and she treats you like a doormat then you have enough problems without throwing a vampire in the mix. Do yourself a favor & DO NOT read this book. It seemed to have such potential for the 1st 10 or so pages then it just nose-dived. Perhaps the author had alot of ideas and wasn't sure of direction.

However, one must be fully competent in the use of advanced Photoshop skills to utilize the described techniques. For that target audience this book could warrant 4 stars (I don't qualify to judge).

I'd never heard of Luca Turin, nor did I know anything about the theories and science of smell before.Turin is a scent/smell savant. As another reviewer pointed out and I agree: I've never experienced scent through descriptive words and mental images before. It is a gift of Luca's genius in the world of smell and scent.As an interesting aside, I found my favorite perfume from reading Luca's description of \\"Gucci Rush\\" in this book. I never fail to get compliments when I wear it. If you are fascinated with the use of language and smell, then definitely take a look at Luca's perfume guide for pinpoint, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, descriptions of perfumes and colognes.Perfumes: The Guide"},{"rating":"2","title":"Passes the sniff test","review":"As a former denizen of the NIH, I concur with most of the suggestions about how institutions protect the accepted and reflexively reject anything too different. As a former scientist, Turin's arguments made great sense to me and were fully creditable. As a student of Everett M. Rogers Diffusions of Innovations, I can readily believe that Turin falls directly into the Innovator group and will out of hand be rejected by even his closest friends.All of that said, this is an excellent book , well worth reading, not only for the fascinating theory of scent, but also about the lethargy with which the scientific community accepts radically new ideas (or rejects them).For any one who has been at the NIH or a major university this book will remind them of the politics and the pettiness of these great institutions. I loved my 4.5 years at the NIH for the extraordinarily brilliant people there. Nonetheless, I was constantly amazed at the puerile behavior of some of those geniuses."},{"rating":"1","title":"not quite what I expected","review":"I freely admit that science is not necessarily my strong suit. I have nothing against it, but I often get lost around a mental corner. I have to admit that this is what happened with this book. The author conveyed his enthusiasm for the subject and for maverick scientist Luca Turin, but to be honest, I didn't quite understand what all the enthusiasm was about, and I am not sure I liked Turin as much as the author did. I got a little tired of Turin, actually, long before the author did. The aspect of the science of scent was interesting, to a certain extent, but after a point I found myself skipping passages that seemed to go on too long and get too mired in arcane scientific specifics. Overall I don't think this is a general readership book as much as it is a text that could be useful for someone in the field."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talking Scents!","review":"I am a self professed scent junkie.

The subject matter was interesting, but both of us found ourselves skimming much of the book to get to the interesting stuff.

It's not really heavy, but it is difficult to lift over higher trunk openings. The one thing I wish I had done was order one with removable arms, or that it at least had arms what were lower in front. It's narrow, just under 30 inches at its widest, so it fits through narrower doorways. I would buy this again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Purchase","review":"Reasonable price, good quality, fast shipping.

Vanessa Redgrave offers a tour-de-force performance as the Wicked Queen, who dons several magical disguises to ensnare our heroine. Rex Smith gives us a Prince who is handsome yet goofy (a refreshing change), and Vincent Price is a delight as both the Magic Mirror and Narrator.

This one is included in my collection and I have to say it is an instant work-out! The toning tape is a good challenge and gives pretty good results. The aerobic portion is fun, kinda zany and doesn't get to boring. There are a few traditional moves, like the grapevine with other funky ones added in, like the \\"running man\\". It also allows for some freedom in sections that you are bound to enjoy. The stretching portion leaves you feeling relaxed and free. Each section is made up of its own individual 20 minute mini workout. Different music and settings help alleviate boredom. All in all, I would suggest you add it to your collection, especially for the price. Great if you are on the go and have minimal time in your busy schedule to get in shape. Also good if you feel like taking a long work out with lots of variation."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but somewhat boring","review":"This tape is effective, but I find it somewhat boring. What I appreciate about it is the fact that it's a concentrated workout that does the job in twenty minutes per section. If time is limited, I'll do twenty minutes of toning one day, twenty of aerobics the next. I typically skip the stretching section, but it's nice when I'm feeling tense after a day at the office. I also workout to the Firm, Jane Fonda, and Paula Abdul, and Kathy Smith provides a similar challenge, though not as high a production quality as the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toning Segment Inadequate","review":"The aerobic and stretching parts of this video are fine, but the toning segment is not. The abs section is good, and there is a fairly thorough leg section. However, the stretches within the toning portion are extremely rushed, and she moves from exercise to exercise so fast that the people onscreen are already finished a few reps by the time I've figured out which exercise they are doing.Also, she seems to think that push-ups are the ONLY upper body exercise you need, along with a very short and perfunctory lat portion - I had to do my own shoulder, bicep, tricep work with dumbells after I finished - this is NOT the tape to choose if you really want to work your arms.There are some confusing cuts and editing, cheesy, dated music, and some odd camera angles (i.e., a view of the bottom of an exerciser's foot while she's doing leg extensions).Be forewarned that the box copy about it being a thorough workout is exaggerated, and be prepared to add on some of your own arm work."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZERO","review":"I was sent a video cassette that does not work.

The ending was one of the disappointing I've ever read. There were so many questions left unanswered. In the past, I have been a fan of Coulter's FBI series.

Handwaving explanations of the improbable? Paper-thin villains with superhuman luck, but not quite good enough aim? Stilted dialogue?

It was finally nice to read a book that had absolutely no sex in it. It was purely about the mystery-a double mystery, really. I loved it from the time I picked up, til the time I finished it-which was only a few hours after I started it. If you've read C.

Yes, I know she has written more than eight prior novels, but each one is getting noticeably worse than the previous effort.This is by far the worst. Honestly, has anyone ever had personal dealings with any FBI agents? I have. Many times. The idea of one of them getting bashed on the head while solo spelunking, losing her memory, then coming out in the forest right next to a single dad, small town Sheriff? Riiight. Of course he befriends her and her partners (A married couple, no less), and they fall in love with his sons.All four improbably join forces and become a merry, happy, smiling, friendly gang of crime fighters.Wait. I need a bucket.Of course the female FBI agent finds the hidden civil war gold in her cave.I am going to be sick again.The only thing worse than the plot is the dialogue. Far worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Coulter's Best!","review":"Point Blank was a ho hum book. Since I shelled out money for this book, I forced myself to finish it. Coulter's characters come off as cardboard figures. This in part is due to her mediocre, stiff dialogue. Many of her sentences start with, Ruth said, \\"blah, blah,\\" or Dix said, \\"Blah, blah, blah.\\" I encountered this so many times it became annoying. Also, Ruth's amnesia was a joke. It was amazing to me that this woman had no idea of who she was, where she lived or worked, etc., but seeing Savich and Sherlock everything came rushing back. The plot was contrived. And ask me if I care that Pinky is killed. I know very little about him except that he's an entertainer. Make me care about these characters.Definitely not one of Coulter's best efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down","review":"Point Blank had me all the way through; then let me down at the end. I don't like investing time reading 425 pages of mystery only to have one of the main threads (who killed Christie, Dillon's wife) left unanswered. I admit the author held my interest and entertained me right up there with James Patterson and John Kellerman, but Point Blank's ending...it was like Ms. Coulter suddenly remembered she had something more important to do and she deserted me! Not only was a main thread left open, all threads were wrapped up poorly. Is a sequel planned here?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous Dialogue","review":"I read \\"Blowout\\" on others' enthusiastic recommendations of Catherine Coulter, but \\"one and done\\" as far as I'm concerned.

What I found the most disappointing wasn't that it couldn't match the power of the first book but that, overall, it was poorly written. Haldeman maintained his characters well but the actual story did not develop. We start out with a potentially insidious (to our eyes)evolution of future humans and Taurans melding into an entirely new being. That start was extremely intriguing. Then, all of a sudden, the last remnants of our form of humanity are hurtling across the galaxy in a semi-comedic god hunt. The two halves of the story did not gel! One or the other might have been good. It leaves one feeling that he (Haldeman)realized that he bit off more than he could chew or focus upon. Don't waste the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak ending to an average series","review":"Though I remember the avid engagement in which the other books in the series held me, I am disappointed by this book. It is simply unconvincing in the way it lays the foundation for the revelation at the end of the story - quite frankly, there is very little meat to the storyline and I found the plot unconvincing and contrived. This seem to be an excuse to milk the fans hooked on the series and anyone looking for a good read will be sorely disappointed. The lukewarm interactions and unconvincing dialogue had me flipping pages in a hurry to find a reason for buying the book.For example, the group consciousness concept is pretty nifty but it is poorly explored. The Omni species was decidedly irrelevant to the story and the manner in which the true nature of human existence is revealed is simply bogus. I suppose this book is adequate for those who don't know any better, but if you're looking for a real SF epic, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment","review":"Wow, this one was a real disappointment. After having read, and greatly enjoyed, 'Forever War' and 'Forever Peace', I was anxious to read this book. 'Forever Free', however, failed to live up to expectations. It lacked any of the impact of the previous two books and failed to generate any thought provoking questions. The book started off slowly, but there was a sense that something really interesting was going to happen. At about the point that the interesting stuff should have happened, the story simply sputtered out to a really disappointing conclusion. Suffice it to say the end was incredibly simplistic and really didn't seem to relate to the rest of the story. It seems as though Haldeman either grew bored with the story and decided to wrap it up in a simple, \\"Star Trek\\"-esque mysterious omniscient aliens manner or he decided that he really wanted to write a different story. Either way, this was a real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly, not even worth it","review":"This is not a worthy successor to The Forever War. While Haldeman's style is in top form, his ideas are not. Even the favorable reviews concede that Forever Free has none of the impact of the original Forever War. What we have here is a forced novel springing from a half-formed idea that would have been better as a mediocre Twilight Zone episode.Over the past few year I've been reading most of Haldeman's works. While not all of them are treasures, almost all of them are worth reading. Usually even his worst books have something unique to offer that you can't find anywhere else. Unfortunately his newer work is not up to par, and this novel is not even worth a read.I would highly suggest Forever Peace. While not a true sequel in the sense of plot or setting, it is really the logical successor to The Forever War in terms of ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't recommend this book if it was Forever Free (haha)","review":"I don't agree with the reviewer who said this would surpass Forever War as Haldeman's best novel. I found it to be relatively weak compared to both earlier \\"Forever\\" works (even considering that Forever Peace was not related to either War or Free).Many of the characters lacked the definition required to be unique or contribute substantially to the story line. Some scenes seemed ridiculously out of place when put in the context of the universe Haldeman has created. And of course, many reviewers have pointed out that the ending \\"plain old stinks\\". It's an abrupt shift from a mediocre quest of discovery to an eigth grader's sci-fi fantasy finale at the last possible minute and impossible to take seriously.If you've read Haldeman's other works, then this should be on your list only if you must read them all to satisify your Forever Lust. Otherwise, skip it.If you've never read Haldeman, drop what you're doing and order Forever War right now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible. Save your money","review":"What happened? The Forever War was so good! This was dullness punctuated by the mundane, with no suspense and a cheesy neat wrap up in the last few pages. I kept hoping things would take off, so I kept reading, and as I started to near the end, I realized I'd wasted a whole lot of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't see any special merits in this one.","review":"Haldeman is good in creating believable characters, but after a writing a few books or so, you have the feeling that his methods seem formulaic. And there's nothing original in this one (not in the science fiction sense - as that is extremely hard - but in the literary sense). His writing seems deep when you first read them, but then, after a few books, you feel cheated, like after watching a hollywood love story, like Titanic. But, then again, science fiction has never been about literature in the first place. The 1-star rating here is given when I compare this novel with other literary greats. Compared to other science fiction novels, a 4 to 5-star rating is appropriate for this master."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"This book does not deserve to be by the same author and in the same series as \\"Forever War\\"It feels like the author was in a rush to get this to the market.

And now we have \\"Forever Free,\\" which commits the unforgivable sin of grabbing the reader's attention, and then insulting him with an idiotic and just plain lazy ending. It seems a safe bet that this book was written on an advance from the publisher to a deadline, and Mr. Haldeman just plain ran out of ideas as the deadline approached.The story starts well and sets-up some interesting plot lines and puzzles, but using \\"a wild and crazy G-d!\\" to wrap-up the story is maddeningly cheap and disappointing.

Haldeman wrote all these really cool books and then he wrote this? The story was just sloppily thrown together and threatens to undo what was so good about The Forever War. I didn't feel like I was reading about the same two people. I thought there was this deep love connection between Mandella and Marygay and that her having waited for him all that time was so sweet and romantic...Then to ruin it with this Cat lady, that was the person that she really loved but decided she wasn't able to wait for...I just started really disliking the book from that point and my opinion of it never improved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frank Herbert did this better","review":"And in fewer words, in his short story \\"Rat Race\\", which you can find in his collection /Eye/.

Both Forever War and Forever Peace where great stories which offered interesting views of humanity.Forever Free was just a Twilight Zone episode. I wish I had never read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forever Free of What?","review":"I can't find a reason that Mr Haldeman would choose to revisit the characters of his classic \\"The Forever War\\" except that it must have been easier to use familiar faces than to create new ones. To think that this is the continuation of the saga the author always dreamed of is a scary thought. Forever Free statrts off well enough as it quickly reaquaints us with old friends. Unfortunatly, as the book progresses all hopes for a thrilling and satisfying conclusion goes out the window as the narrative spins beyond the unlikly and into the absurd. If Mr Haldeman wanted to tell this tale, he should have left William Mandella alone and started with a new crop of characters. This is not the fate they deserve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deus Ex Machina of doom","review":"Okay, it's almost a good idea, except that it doesn't make any sense, and what might have been a moderately interesting premise is destroyed byt an embarassingly poor ending.

What a disappointment! Great charcacters and dialogue completely wasted on a juvenile, self-indulgent plot. William Mandella deserved better. God is a dweeb in this book, Angels are reduced to Odo and Halemann trivialized his own excellent novel _The Forever War_ (which is justly regarded as a classic.)Some things are better left alone and Haldeman's time and IMMENSE talent would be better spent finding new characters and plots to explore."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could Haldeman do it?","review":"I saw the book yesterday lunch-time at Sydney airport terminal and had a few hours to fill in. The Forever War is one of my very favourite hard sf books and I couldn,t believe my good fortune in spotting the sequel.ITS AWFUL. Starts off well then descends into soft fairy-tale fantasy. I can't describe how disappointing the book is. I read it straight through in four hours. It really came apart for me when the Time Warp strange events started and was all downhill from there.What about the unnatural origin of MF and its biosphere? Just mentioned and left.

I wondered why I hadn't ever gotten around to reading it before. Then I read Forever Peace and really, really liked it. Not quite 5 stars, but almost. Then when Forever Free came available in paperback, I saw all the negative reviews, and I thought, \\"Aw, come on! Must be a bunch of Haldeman haters!\\" So I ordered it, and I read it.Ugh.Trust me, the reviewers are right: This is one to avoid. I remember how, when the movie Star Trek 5 came out, my friends and I went to watch it, and afterwards, depressed, we said, \\"You know, I'm just going to pretend that one never happened.\\" That's the way I feel about Forever Free. (And its plot is remarkably similar to Star Trek 5, too.) It felt like Haldeman just wasn't trying. Joe, if you read this: I'm not enraged, I'm just disappointed. Really disappointed. You can do better than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh.","review":"There are times that sequels do not live up to the original, and are just used as a vehicle for the author to tell another story riding on the back of previous success.

Well I wish he could give me my money back. Forever Free is AWFUL. This is what we waited for? The ending of Forever War was so perfect, leaving the lives of the two characters up to the readers imagination. I think anyones imagination could have devised a better ending than the one written here by Haldeman. A 25 year wait just so that Mr. Haldeman can completely destroy this story line with what? Just a bad episode of \\"The twilight Zone.\\" This story is just plain bad, no action, no suspense, none of the caring for the characters that I felt in the first book.

She found herself trapped with events as they moved on, and was having to continually develop her ruse.For me it highlighted the fact that at least some of what is considered boyish, or girlish, is not genetic but purely what others feel one should do. What one should be.I do think her mother was unusually cruel, in the way she resolved the situation; it did need something doing, however.I was particularly disappointed the reason she was fighting wasn't explained: the other boy injured her younger sister - she even tended her wounds; this should have been brought up.

Actually \\"chill\\".\\"Sly\\" - Boring & pretentious.\\"Heat Miser\\" - Boring.\\"Light My Fire\\" - Really horrible cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"so i stand in front of you...","review":"Massive Attack has paved the way for all trip-hoppers and electronica artists. They masterfully out-do themselves on every album (with their best album therefore being Mezzanine) and with slow songs, gradual climaxes, and heavy beats, its irresistable to an electronica fan. There is no question that the best song on the album they put first, the title track, Protection. Its a sweet song, with tracey thorn's smooth vocals (I cant change the way you feel, but i can put my arms around you) with a great guitar riff and the classic massive attack beats, at more than 6 minutes long. No downtempo collection is complete without at least one massive attack record- and the rest of the album is pretty good- but the whole album is worth it for just that one song."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER GREAT ATTACK!!!!","review":"MASSIVE ATTACK is one of the coolest fusions of reggae, hip hop, eletronic and jazz of all time... this one, PROTECTION is another WONDERFUL MUSIC TRIP!!!!All the songs are amazing!!!!I don't know which one is better...this one or BLUE LINES...PROTECTION is a modern MASTERPIECE!!!!If you like reggae, hip hop or jazz you gotta listen to this music pearl from MASSIVE ATTACK!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated Gem, Tracey rules!","review":"This is Massive Attack's sophomore album, released in 1995 after their highly acclaimed debut, 1991's Blue Lines. Although overshadowed by both its predecessor and 1998's Mezzanine, this album is just as good as both of them. Tracey Thorn and Nicolette are arguably the best guest vocalists they used on any of their albums, maybe even a little bit better than Shara Nelson or Liz Fraser. Not breaking new ground like their debut, or pure darkness like their third LP, but still worth the money. Best tracks are the title track, \\"Sly\\", and \\"Spying Glass\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Massive Attack does not go the protective route on Sophomore CD","review":"After hearing about Massive Attack from a friend I decided to check out some of their songs. The production on this album is completely solid. If this album was nothing but an instrumental piece it would recieve 5 stars from me, however, the lyrics and vocals of several of the songs (more directly Karmacoma & Three)brought the albums rating down one star.Album highlights include: \\"Protection,\\" \\"Spying Glass,\\" \\"Weather Storm,\\" and \\"Sly\\"Album embarissment: \\"Light my Fire (Live)\\" -- this is the only track I skip when listening to the record.If you like Massive Attack I would recommend listening to Telepopmusik.

This was not a good film. I am a great admirer of Tracey Thorne's voice and, as I said elsewhere, would listen to her sing the phone book; but this is not the phone book. This is teenage emotionalizing. Though I resonate with the idea of self-sacrifice, the whole point of self-sacrifice is to actually DO it, not to talk about how you would or should or might do it should the situation arise. The track is basically like listening to somebody saying, \\"You know, I'd like totally run in front of a bus to save somebody, knowwhamsain?\\" The whole point of self-sacrifice is that it is difficult to do. It certainly is not difficult to talk about doing, though. I don't know Tracey Thorne, but I am not really uplifted by the thought of her hypothetically jumping in front of someone to take a bullet for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, albeit frustratingly uneven","review":"There are lot of interesting songs here, but the album lacks direction.

My friend who gave it to me described them as a mix of Radiohead, Portished and Bob Marley...that is about as strangely accurate as you can get. I definitely would compare them to Portishead, with the female vocalist and the bass. There is also some really hip tunes that are more like hip hop songs.

But the stars have gone out and what I am left with is an album that is a weak mirror of the Verve's earlier material. The album lacks the sonic appeal of A Northern Soul and does not even hold a candle to A Storm in Heaven. How tragic that this album would be the one that everyone knows. The only tracks that show any promise are the ones that Nick McCabe gets credit for. Those two songs offer a gilmpse into what the album could have sounded like if Mad Richard had chilled his ego and left Nick at the controls of the album. Richard writes good lyrics. Hre does not write good music. Everything that has his name on it has the feeling of something tired and old. So forget this album ever happened and pick up A Storm In Heaven.

If maybe one of the other songs kicked the album off it may have had a chance, but since the group chose to kick off the album with this vomit then the whole album is bad. Yes you may argue that it has the classical music which makes it sound cultural, but it's so mind-wrecking so psyche-damaging that it makes me want to suck a lead piece with a trigger at the end. The vocals are at best nasly and whiny too. I was left with the sense of \\"Why Bother?\\" The group comes out of Michigan which is notorious for artists like Ted Nugent, Frijid Pink, Brownsville Station, MC5, Iggy and the Stoooges etc. The Verve are the dishonorable boys from the Wolverine State."},{"rating":"2","title":"Umm, No","review":"Jagger/Richards didn't write \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\" - ... In actual fact, the Verve sampled a tiny fragment of an orchestral version of a Stones track, but didn't get permission.

This album was *the* sound of British summer '97.The sheer emotion of the lyrics and the beauty of the songs were something that hadn't been around in England since Joy Division or before.Songs of such intensity are still lacking today and song writers write songs that sell, not realising they can never package singing from the heart.This album is brilliant for love and best after a nite clubbing when you need a calm thoughtful album.

Although I'm hardly a drug user, I still found the songs to be very good road trip anthems. It's nicely crafted, with Bitter Sweet Symphony taking on the role of \\"catchy song.\\" If you like Oasis or Coldplay(both from the UK), this is your next stop on the road to music satisfaction.BEWARE: Bitter Sweet Symphony is only one of about three songs that's background music if electronic on this cd.

It's as if she was directed to perform as stoically as possible. I don't get it at all. I am also not impressed with Carrie Fisher's singing here. I know she is capable of singing quite beautifully, I just don't think the folkish songs in this tale are well suited to her instrument. It's hard to pull off such dirges unless the singer has that ethereal, almost mediaeval quality to her voice (think Loreena McKennitt, Mediaveal Baebes).

In the section on St. John's wort, this book states that there are no known contraindications or drug interactions with St. John's wort. There are in fact serious drug interactions with this product, including anti-rejection drugs (resulting in at least one case of organ rejection in a renal transplant patient) and potentially fatal interactions with other anti-depressants (most importantly MAOIs). This book has extensive information on historical use of herbs, pharmacology and uses... but lacks important safety information. No clinician should use this book as his/her sole source of information on herbal products."},{"rating":"1","title":"You know you've wasted money when...","review":"When I ordered this book, I expected a tongue-in-cheek retrospective of the ups and downs of being the parent of a gifted child. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Very wrong. This book is no more than a regurgitated compilation of common lists found at every gifted site on the internet. Any parent who has come this far looking for information on parenting their gifted child has already seen every characteristic list in this book at least two or three times for free. Do not waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"This book is heavy on vague lists of what to look for in children who might be gifted. It contains very few specifics and reads more like a book intended to convince parents that their children are gifted rather than a serious analysis of the extent of their skills. Not worth the money to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"too simplistic","review":"This is not the book to buy if you want tips on how to parent the gifted child.

I felt this book was overpriced for the information it contained."},{"rating":"1","title":"For parents of tots only","review":"I was disappointed that this book talked only about children identified as gifted when in preschool or earlier. The anecdotes and examples all refer to children less than 8, usually less than 6. It is not uncommon for a child to be identified or maybe even BECOME? gifted until later. I know several kids who weren't \\"certifiably\\" gifted until 3rd, 4th, and 5th grades, even one in the 7th grade.

If I were reviewing the document feeder strictly based on time and labor savings, five stars again. However, the document feeder has the regularly recurring habit of feeding sheets at a slight but increasing angle until, eventually, it jams. Yes, you can work around it, but it's a colossal pain when it happens.If you want perfectly aligned, trouble-free scans, spend even more money and get a scanner with built-in document feeder.

I am an avid fan of stand up comedy as well as a queer individual, so let's just say that I am quite familiar with Ms. DeGeneres' body of work. Because of this, I already knew a lot of the material in the book. It makes it no less hilarious or well written, but let's just say some of the magic is gone when you know the tricks behind the curtain.Still, if you're a casual fan of her stand up or you're an avid viewer of her talk show, I highly recommend it. Not only is her material hilarious, but she often sneaks a great message about life right past ya. She is truly an amazing human being, and her signature humor can brighten up even the darkest day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Ellen . . . WHY?","review":"I adore Ellen and watch her show daily. I thought this book would be hilarious, but I was extremely disappointed, and I'm not a picky reader. It's not well written and jumps around too much. The jokes don't carry because Ellen's not there telling them and showing visual expressions. There's no point, and she's either trying too hard, or she's just not funny on paper. This book is unfortunate. Ellen is better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"a terrible disappointment","review":"I am a big Ellen Degeneres fan, this audio CD does her no justice. Although she reads it herself, much of her comedy is her impeccible sense of timing and her facial expressions that accompany her schtick. Obviously she can't use either of those tools with the audio CD. Hence, it comes across flat and lifeless. While the material is funny enough, I'm sure Ellen herself will admit, the delivery is the most important part of comedy. As anyone who has ever tried to tell a joke will attest it is all about timing and delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my!","review":"I think Ellen is pretty funny USUALLY!I loved her in Nemo - she was perfect!I love her talk show as well.I'm sorry Ellen, but this book is so damn painful.There are a couple of funny parts, but the rest isjust so damn boring!

It provides an insight to her life and her sense of humor is wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Letdown From one of my Favorite Comedians","review":"As a long standing fan of Ellen's comedy, I was disappointed with this effort. She presents a collection of comedy that seemed to range between a little genuine humor and a lot of mediocre humor.I have found myself laughing deeply at some of Ellen's standup, thus this book left me wondering if part of her comic genius is in her delivery. The book is not a total loss, as there are a few moments when Ellen reaches hilarity, but mostly the book feels like a comedic struggle.I anticipate reading more from Ellen in the future, but hope it significantly surpasses the quality of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant humor, very entertaining","review":"This is a brilliant piece of work. The author has always been a favorite of mine. You will find this book easy to read. It will have you laughing out loud, so I would not read it in a quiet library.

Her tales of life experiences are fun to read or watch as it is part of her stand up comedy. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biography by Ellen Degeneres","review":"Remarkably nice.

Pretty interesting & really make my day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Ellen, What Happened??","review":"Let me preface this by saying that, normally, I am a huge fan of Ellen. I find her to be charming, enthusiastic, clever, and downright funny. I love her stand-up comedy, love her HBO specials, and really enjoy her daytime show, when I have a chance to see it....However, \\"The Funny Thing Is...\\" that the book just wasn't funny. It was, in fact, painful at parts. While I normally adore her sometimes quirky wit, it just didn't come through in this book. I am unsure if she was experimenting with new comedy, or a new style...but all I can say is, I found it to be disjointed, incoherent, and bland. Most of the skits in the book were so unenjoyable that I stopped reading them halfway through. I would not recommend this book to anyone, Ellen fan or not.(I'm sorry, Ellen!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"WATCH THE BOOK VERBATIM ON HBO","review":"I enjoyed the book and read it from cover to cover in a few hours, and, of course, I DID laugh out loud a couple times. However, one day later, her Comedy Special was on HBO, and she could well have been reading the entire book off of cue cards. I was very disappointed to find that I had just spent $23.00 to read a book that was actually a \\"script\\" for her HBO Special. I could have just watched HBO and saved $23.00! What a ripoff!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Ellen angry?","review":"I have enjoy Ellen for years. I've seen her current show as well as her stand-up routine.

But being a fan of her stand-up comedy I decided to give it a shot and listen to it on my long drive. OH MY GOD! This seemingly never-ending stream of pointless thoughts made me want to cry! It started off slow, but hinted at promising material ahead which never came. At best there were maybe 3 mildly humerous comments and the rest of the 3hours and 27 minutes were just plain painful. Not only do I want a refund of my money, but I also want 3 and a half hours of my life back!!! PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS TIME, I BEG YOU!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycled Material","review":"While this book is probably enjoyable if you're not already an \\"Ellen fan,\\" it is really all recycled stand-up material. I found myself skipping entire chapters because it was a word-for-word recount of previously used stand-up jokes. I have to admit that the jokes were funny, but I was hoping after paying $23 to get some new material.Also, in my opinion, what makes Ellen so funny is not necessarily her material, but it's the way she delivers the joke...her voice inflections, her facial expressions, and her subtle pauses. Without these additions the jokes aren't half as good for me personally."},{"rating":"2","title":"The funny thing is...........this book","review":"When I first picked up this book I thought it would be autobiographical. It isn't, except that through her humorous take on life you get to know more about her as a person. She covers topics like why do people talk too much, advancements in technology, to why being in prison wouldn't be so bad. The book is very much in character with the Ellen we see on television-warm, wry, self-deprecating, a person with a wide-eyed view of the world. If you are a fairly quick reader it won't take much more than two hours to read. And a very pleasant two hours it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hiliarous thing from the Queen of Comedy","review":"Oh gee. I can't even begin to tell you about this book.

A lot of the material seems to be just like her act, which is a good thing. The only downside is that being sort of like her act makes it a fun read, but not one with any real story or time line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless Dribble","review":"I like Ellen, I think she's funny but this is not funny. If you can imagine being locked in a room alone with Dori from disney's Nemo, then you know what this book is like.

I'd love to be able to give Ellen a glowing review, but I'd be fibbing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyways... Its not that great!","review":"The book is just rambling. I figured it would be a lot funnier, b/c Ellen is so hilarious, but its just rambling and sometimes it is hard to follow. I found myself getting lost in mid paragraph. Would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm a big Ellen fan and was looking forward to this book. After sixty pages I lost interest and returned it to the store. It wasn't going anywhere and was too far out. I liked her first book a lot better. But the part about her Sunday brunch with Eminem and Diane Sawyer and the rest tried to be so outrageous but was dull. A lot of the meterial was already used in her HBO acts, which were great- I think she's better at stand up rather than writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart and Funny!","review":"Funniest show since Scrubs was first aired. Great comedy WITHOUT a laugh track. The humor speaks for itself and doesn't need an artificial laugh; you will supply that all by yourself.

It's on again, off again schedule made it hard to find an audience and it finally paid the price.

It is the best TV comedy I have ever watched! My entire family enjoys it... even my 13 year old daughter.

There was one other one star review so I made this so people would know he is so terribly wrong.Lem and Phil are so damn funny by season 2 that I would sell a kidney to see a season 3 of this show. The lie detector episode in season 2 made me cry. Season 1 starts slow, but Portia de Rossi knocks it out of the park the entire time without ever once slowing down.

There are moments in the show where you feel like you should re-wind it and memorize the words so that you can use them later, if you ever find yourself in that situation. The dialogue is carefully put together, and it is the epitome of office environment in a large corporation. I purchased this and haven't looked back since-love it!

It's to bad that it didn't last. Portia de Rossi was insanely funny. The Veridian commercials before the real commercials were hilarious. The comedy was well off center. Which is what made it so funny. Thank god a company like this doesn't really exist. But, by watching this you may think it seems like a familiar government contractor. The cast was great. If I had to choose one thing that I didn't like. It would be that they tweaked the storyline with the characters in the second season.

I was in complete awe.I was moved by how John's love for Angela never faltered, amidst everything she had done and been through. This is a beautiful love story full of extreme emotion and intelligence. I showed this movie to all my friends and family, and everyone who saw it cried, even the guys (LOL).And the ending: WOW, is all I can say.

The language got worse as the show progressed. Call me a prude if you like, but I don't like dirt messing up a lovely outfit any more than I like dirt that is offensive to my ears.This movie had no rating as it was made for TV, but the rating would have been R if they had rated it. The \\"F\\" word was used more than once and the Lord's name was taken in vain over and over again.I would have been able to deal with the language if the movie had a point, but I felt it ended with nothing being resolved and no one being changed (even a little).If you feel comfortable with this type of humor, I would say listen to the other reviews and try it out. But, if you are like me and don't find foul language to be funny, I would skip this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gin Game is Excellent","review":"I originally saw most of this play on screen a few years ago on PBS.

Just unusually uncomfortable right now is all, but I don't think that they should be. Also, they are pretty heavy for low quarters.

After weeks of work, we installed the Hunter switch as the cherry on top. We were ecstatic. It took a while to get used to the slider switches and the master on/off switch for the preset felt a little chintzy, but we were quickly spoiled by the smooth dimmer and 4-speed fan control. Our joy lasted less than a year. The knob on the fan control broke off. I could now see how the knobs were attached to the sliders and it looks like they are designed to fail: a blade in the back of the knob is pressure-fit into a slot in the thin plastic slider. When you screw down the cover plate on a switch, you expect the job to last for years or decades. This switch lasted only a few months. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful switch construction","review":"I did not buy my dual slide control from Amazon, and I'm really sorry now that I didn't see the reviews here before I did. I bought two of these switches in August 2008, and one of them disintegrated last month. Exact same thing as other people have said here -- the knob of the slider that controls the light (which, unlike the fan, I use all year round) broke off, leaving only a tiny nub of plastic. I was making do with that until tonight, when the nub also broke off. Now I can't use the light switch. The design of the switch was great, but I can't say the same for the construction quality. Time from purchase to disintegration: less than 9 months. Unhappiness at the prospect of paying for a new switch and a second service call from the electrician during this \\"recession\\": considerable.

We love the fans, and the controls seem to be holding up pretty well. All but the master bedroom. The light switch on that one is missing. Was when we moved in. So, naturally, with all the others in tact and found throughout the house, I figured a straight replacement was in order. You guys have changed my opinion on that and I appreciate it very much.

When I turn on the light for the ceiling fan, the switch now makes a buzzing sound and emits a burning electrical smell. Now I'm going to need to replace this one, and find something better.

I bought two of the La Crosse clocks, the other is similar but silver in color.

I didn't want to pay extra for this feature, but it seems like your can't find a clock these days that isn't \\"atomic\\". Anyway, the clock failed to set itself correctly, and I had to manually fix it. Not a big deal, since I had no problem buying a clock that I would have to manually set. I wonder if I would have left it alone for 24 hours, perhaps it would have set itself initially. But I'm not that patient. It did, however, update itself for daylight savings, and I appreciated that since the clocks are hanging in hard to reach places.

(Rechargeable batteries probably won't work well.)3) Place clock in west-facing window for about 5-10 minutes until it sets itself.4) Hang clock in final location.5) After 9-12 months, change battery and repeat.The second hand does, in fact, \\"jump\\" from second to second, so there is an extremely faint ticking sound. However, it is much, much, much quieter than our previous clock. It was worth the price, to me, just to be rid of the horrid ticking.The only downside: My wife finds the design too \\"office-y\\" for a kitchen.

But I thought it would be great to not have to worry about it and always have the exact time.For what it's worth, the clock is attractive and quiet.The problem is that when I put in the battery, it sets itself to a strange time. With the switch set to Central time, the clock sets itself to two hours behind actual Central time. Since there is only one later setting, this means that it is impossible to adjust the clock to display an accurate time. In other words, this \\"perfect\\" atomic clock will never show the correct time. Garbage! I'm infuriated. Waste of $30. And the worst part is, it's elaborately packaged so it wouldn't be easy to re-pack and return. I didn't keep all of the boxes so I'm stuck.Worst purchase ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"It couldn't keep time","review":"When I put the battery in, the clock reset itself to exactly 1 hr and 4 mins ahead of my time. I reset it several times and it kept going back to the wrong time. The company, in their booklet, claims they don't take any responsiblity for reception problems and its inability to reset the time. They say it can still be manually set and used as a normal wall clock. If I had wanted a regular wall clock, I could have gotten one for about a third the cost. I like to have the exact time. I thought the atomic clock would be the way to go, and their advertisements for it certainly made me think it would reset itself to the exact time.

There is no obvious provision for such programming on the clock, nor with the included setup instructions.Attempts to obtain advice by telephone resulted in long waiting times with a promise to return my call.The details supplied to Amazon did not mention this little difficulty.If one lives somewhere between San Francisco and New York, it would be a great clock.Otherwise, I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, but quirky","review":"I purchased this clock a few months ago. I live in San Jose, CA, and have it on a northwest-facing wall.Aesthetically, it looks good with the wood trim, but functionally it's a bit quirky. Most of the time it shows the correct time, but it often seems to get confused. The time can be off by 15 to 20 minutes, and the second hand seems to get stuck about halfway between the seven and eight.

When you receive it, if you cannot get it to work right away, go online to the lacrosse website, and there are good instructions for getting the clock set-up.

Then, it didn't automatically adjust for DST, so I tried to reset the time by pulling the battery. It then stopped working altogether -- apparently unable to pick up the time signal from the mother clock in Colorado. The manual time set feature didn't work so I had to take the clock from my office back to my home. After 3 days, it picked up the signal from home and ran fine.

Took almost a week to lock in when I bought it (come on - is Los Angeles that remote?) and now that daylight savings time ended, it still hasn't locked in to the correct time 5 days later. For an \\"atomic\\" clock, this thing is anything but space age in it's operation. The instructions tell you to put the clock facing west, keep it away from appliances, be sure the battery is fresh, put it on a window sill at night, be patient for 3-5 days, etc. Please. It's a clock, for crying out loud - not a tomato garden. I'll give it a couple more days to figure out what time it is - and then I'll put it in the trash ... facing west."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Waste of Money","review":"I purchased this clock about a year and a half ago.

I love this clock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"La Crosse Replaced Clocks with Bad DST","review":"Many LaCrosse clocks are plagued with bad reviews on how the DST doesn't work. A couple of online forums also discuss DST not working for LaCrosse clocks. Mine synchronizes fine with normal time, but has NOT yet synchronized with DST. Totally worthless now as an atomic clock. If LaCrosse doesn't offer an exchange or fix, the clock will have to end up in the garbage. Other than the DST issue clock has been very accurate.Update: La Crosse sent out new clocks to replace the ones that did not adjust for DST because of the new date changes. Any company that does this is tops in my book. Changing rating to five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like to get a headache changing these for non-us time zones","review":"I have disliked these clocks since the first time I have had to change for daylight savings time. Sometimes it would take two days for the clock to autoadjust.

They are beautiful, but I had problems with both of them. One didn't work at all and had to be returned. The other one only picks up the required radio signal if the clock is directly facing a westerly window even though the instructions suggest that the radio signals penetrate walls (except in the middle of large buildings). My house is not a large building and when I put the clock on a wall that faces north for four days, but it wouldn't set itself. On the fourth day I moved it to the east wall of the same room (facing a western window) and it set itself, but that's not where I want the clock!! I've decided to keep the clock (on the north-facing wall) knowing that the time is not being updated daily and will be no more accurate than any other clock in the house...disappointing, since I was looking forward to setting all my other clocks and watch from that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this clock","review":"The clock stopped working in 3 months.

It's nice enough to put in any room in the house or office. It's keeping good time, it's quiet and it's easy to read. If it updates itself, that will be an added plus.

Also, does not change when daylight savings time change. That's the main reason I need an automic clock. I had to go through the same excercise of setting the time for the first time. There is no way to manually set the time either. Clock looks good, but just not worth the hassle.Update: All of a sudden clock goes haywire and start spinning crazy. It does not stop until you pull the battery out. Took out the battery to stop the clock, and inserted it back and clock sets itself in the night. Again clock goes crazy and starts spinning non-stop next day or few days later. This is beeing reported by other reviewers also. One of the reviewer has posted a video. Finally I got tired and just threw away the clock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Atomic Time Reset is Annoying","review":"I wish I could find a clock like that looks like this one without the Atomic feature. You can't set the time on it. Every afternoon the hands started spinning around even though the clock was at the right time. I bought one 3 years ago and it just quit working.

It replaces another radio-controlled analog clock that started making too much tick tick tick noise after a couple years of good service (it's in the garage now).

It also set itself very quickly (about a minute), and I live pretty far away from Ft. Collins (central Florida). This clock is easier to read than the LCD displays which can be hard to read at an angle or in low light. The clock face is somewhere between a cream white or light tan color. The wood surround has a satin finish, not glossy.I wish these clocks could use rechargeable batteries likeSanyo NEW 1500 eneloop 4 Pack AAA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable BatteriesorPowerGenix ZR-PGX1HRAA-4B 1 Hour Quick Charger with 4 AA 1.6v NiZn Rechargeable Batteriesbut alkaline batteries work best in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst design ever!!! Don't buy!","review":"My clock always gives wrong time and the design is very bad.1. This clock always stops at midnight and waits for the 4:00am radio signal to restart. That means there are 4 hours in a day (0 to 4 am) it doesn't give the right time.2. When it adjusts itself at night, it makes big noise that will wake you up.3. There is no way to turn off the self-adjustment function. If your location can not receive good radio signal, the clock is useless. It depends on the radio too much.4. At last, a clock doesn't need to adjust itself everyday if it is accurate enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"clock almost perfect","review":"The price is right, the clock looks good and keeps good time.

So I gave up and tossed it in the dumpster. Only reason I gave this 1 star is the looks. It's a nice looking wall clock.

It will be a very long time before I buy either a La Crosse clock or any type of radio wave adjusting clock. Why can't anyone build a good quality clock with electric cord anymore???

After all, I owned other manufacturer's atomic clocks before.LaCrosse provides NO instructions. Nothing. Instead, the package insert warns you that you will not be able to get it working. Instead, provides a telephone number to call. Call the number and get voice mail. You NEVER get to call a tech support directly. Maybe they will call you back. Maybe not. You end up with a product that does not work and no one to call to tell you about the engineering secrets they built into the clock to make it work.In simple terms, send them your money and you don't get a clock that works or a teck number to talk with. Very incomptent operation. Never buy another product from them. LaCROSSE STINKS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clock went crazy","review":"I had had this clock for 11 months when it lost its mind. Starting about a week ago, every afternoon the hands would start spinning around. This would go on for a few hours until it finally stopped at the correct time.

The hopes with buying these were that they would take the inconveniences of occasionally adjusting the time for daylight saving time and that the time would always be exact, but in the end I was taking them off the wall every couple days to reset them. This one looked like it was working for several days until I realized the time was off by 23 minutes. The other would just reset itself and sit at 8 o'clock.And the video is of one of the clocks just going haywire, as it zips around a full 14.5 hours in a few minutes. And it kept going. I got tired of recording before it stopped. I could accept this if it was just part of the set up process, but they just do this occasionally on a whim.

This may seem like a feature but it will move the minute hand around the clock 12 times by going around and around rather than just going to the right time. Sometimes it will go right on past the current time and keep going around and around for 20 minutes and longer!! Kills the batteries within a few months and makes a racket. And once it does finally calibrate, there is no way to prevent re-calibration in the future (by disabling the radio service). Piece of crap.

The phrases, techniques, statements, data, etc are exactly what is taught to Amway distributors and it is great that Burke has been able to get such inside knowledge of senior people (Crown Embassadors, Diamonds)in one of the Amway groups. This book reads very much like it has been written for them as a tool for recruiting, it is also a Recommended Book (RB).

First, why wait until 3/4 of the way thru the book to drop the name \\"Amway\\"? I found this to be in line with the way all \\"Amway\\" followers do business. It was very \\"sneaky\\" to say the least. Second. The author compares Henry Fords starting of Ford Motors with Quixtar? First of all, Ford is a publicly traded company. You can buy stock in Ford where as Quixtar ie. Amway is not. So the author failed to make a correct comparison. In all I found many things wrong with the information in this book. But if all you are looking for is a commercial for Amway then you will be pleased with the sermin this book is filled with. As for myself.

The author has written a poorly argued book in that it misrepresents the people he is arguing against, and is based on bad science. Unfortunately, this reflects poorly on conservatives in that it makes us appear to be sneaky, unintelligent, and disingenuous. Mr. Huber does a great disservice to the conservative movement, and I can only hope that this poorly researched book was the result of ignorance and not malice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conservative Conservation-Huber's oxymoron","review":"Well, it's always good to hear the other side's opinions on a subject in order to get a more well-rounded perspective. At least, that's the idea. Huber, however, comes across as a specious jerk whose real agenda seems mainly to be \\"let's save the wilderness so's we can all keep shootin' animals there.\\" Protect the environment from environmentalists? A terrific idea, Pete, and while we're at it, why don't we finish tearing up the Alaskan wilderness, too. It's too cold for hunting up there, anyway. If you want a balanced take on anything to do with environmentalism, forget this book. Huber's the Rush Limbaugh of sound environmental reasoning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly green","review":"I have read a number of books of the enviro-bashing kind, and I must say this is the most depressing of all. Not only does Huber cleberate not doing very much (the market will save us from ourselves), he also promotes not knowing very much. In addition to the lack of documentation, the only \\"Hard Green\\" he can come up with is Theodore Rosevelt, a progressive (not a conservative) who can no longer protest.It is also, sad to say, not very funny (in spite of the remarks of some reviewers). Real satire requires an intimate knowledge of the subject matter, and Huber seems to be making stuff up as he goes along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Green lacking hard science","review":"Peter Huber treats the environment like some sort of political beachball to be tossed around on a whim. His \\"conservative manifesto\\" is an ignorant and (very)un-scientific approach to the environment, to the point of sheer flippancy. I think he may be playing a sick joke on us, actually. Believe it or not, there are things in life more important than economics and politics, but you won't find them in this book. You won't find any real science, either.

He was not a conservative Republican, he was a populist progressive. He believed in helping the simple man, that is why him and Taft were know as trust-busters. Also, conservation for American forest were conserved not just to keep them in the same state for other generations, but Teddy followed a philosophy of utilitarian environmentalism. This is where he believed that forest and wilderness should be conserved for future use. He believed that the future should have a chance to exploit the resources he left behind.

There really is no value to this book. Huber may have some interesting ideas, but they are not truly explored in detail or with examples. In fact, most of the book is just attacking what he calls radical, ignorant environmentalists. His manifesto at the back of the book are simply summaries of conservative envionrmentalist ideals. If you are doing any kind of research, skip it. This will not help you. If you just want to read a representive of conservative, right wing environmentalism, this will introduce you to some ideas, but it really is just garbage.

I don't know if I'll ever go back to it and probably have just wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Folly of a Demigod","review":"Without doubt, this is the finest biographical fiction ever written. As he stated in a Wall Street Journal interview today, literature is a powerful tool to further the cause of human rights and liberty, and Mr Vargas Llosa's talents are superior in every respect, whether developing the inexorable progress of the parallel plots of the dictator's amoral indulgences, the simple assassins' hopelesssly ambitious revolutionary plot, or the innocent victim's path to the slaughter. Each character is painted with translucent brush strokes, picturing clearly understandable actors in this horrific drama.The story is laced with graphic violence and sex, butr never gratuitously. In the end, Trujillo's arrogant abuse of power, which he believed was granted by God, consumes him ferociously after demeaning his masculinity. The fate of the tyrant is never as severe as deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality inventive journalism, prolix to a fault","review":"The story of a manipulative dictator is told here from both sides, showing us the terror and the stability that a man like Trujillo (or even Saddam Hussein or Josef Stalin) brings to a nation with fundamental fractures in its culture and people. Vargas Llosa introduces his characters and the topic so subtly that it seems to grow around the reader, marking a path for descent. Insights about government and people abound. While all of it is well written, there doesn't need to be as much of it as there is, and it doesn't need to be as strikingly \\"emotional\\" (translation: obvious). Any more of that and it would become a coffee table book for hand-wringing pill cases. As it is however, it is well-written and an engrossing exploration of this topic without the usual moralizing that makes such books as tedious as a root canal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Book","review":"Despite the other glowing reviews, this is not a good book. There is no insight into Trujillo, the Dominican people or the events surrounding Trujillo's domination of the Dominican Republic. Instead, Llosa writes a 400 page script for a TV soap opera. Who slept with whom, kinky sex and grotesque violence thrown in to fill up space. If you like Days of Our Lives, get this book. If you are interested in serrious literature, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good rewrite","review":"The book is well written yet it saddens me to see that a master author can take such liberties with the research and hard work of others and claim them as his work.Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SOUND IS NOT DTS.

Glatthaar's perspective of bringing the war down to the level of the individual soldier is not always found in historical novels. He writes about the soldier's innermost feelings, not about the glorious generals, the great armies, or the magnificent campaigns. I believe that individual battles do not win wars, but that it is the men composing the fighting force that can turn a potential devastating defeat into a glorious victory. Mr. Glatthaar has done a great justice in his portrayal of the men who conducted the march to the sea and beyond. I would highly recommend the book to anyone who wishes better to understand the soldiers that fought for Sherman"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD","review":"Excellent CD - artist has a beautiful voice and the music is outstanding.

This is a wonderful series, and this particular book is particlarly good. If you haven't read Lindsey Chamberlain than I suggest that you do. She's a wonderfully real and likeable heroine. In this book Ms. Connor melds the sixteenth century with the current century seamlessly. Lindsey is involved in an archeological dig of a sixteenth century Spanish ship that went down off the coast of Georgia. Her and her crew are challenged with the exciting job of unearthing an old, old story, and while they do that they unearth a sixteenth century murder. And it seems that murders are happening in around the site as well. Of course Lindsey cannot rest until she uncovers the truth. These books are real page-turners, and the archeological information that comes out is incredible. Ms. Connor is a professional archeologist, and her knowledge is very extensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen.

It's a real movie shown in theatre with well-done special effect and a love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mysically overrated.","review":"MYSTIC RIVER is a well made, depressing, and genuinely run-of-the-mill drama that yet again shows the wide range of crying, weeping, and sobbing SEAN PENN is always capable of. Chock full of unsympathetic characters and predictable plot arcs, this flick is way overrated. Which should suffice for fans of PENN, who is the most overrated actor in hollywood today. He and the supporting cast do a decent job of bringing their characters to life, but the story doesn't give you a chance to really like any of them. CLINT EASTWOOD's direction is assured if not inspired and the end of the picture drags on for quite some time. Maybe I expected more from MYSTIC RIVER due to the high praise it recieved, but as a cinematic experience it's just plain there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mystic River - What a Stinker","review":"This movie was a bonefide stinker.Severe over-acting by the stars and a plot that was so obvious that only someone who couldn't figure out the ending to the weekly A-Team episode would be kept wndering.Sean Penn will never be the godfather that Brando was. He shouldn't even try. Even the ending was pathetic.The only good performers, and they they were good, in this whole movie were the two goon friends of the Father.

No likeable characters, no smiles or laughs, nothing good going on - and no real emotion to keep the viewer hooked. Who'd want to watch a bunch of miserable guys living miserable lives?

Everything that Clint Eastwood touches does not turn to gold. The acting is painful to watch. The characters are mostly so objectionable, you hate them all. This is a mediocre thriller devoid of excitement. The murder is explained at the end but there are many holes in the story. The reasons for the killing were quite weak. This movie is slow and dull. Too many talky scenes between the policemen. How many more movies do we have to see with disagreeing cops?The actors are pretending they are acting in a great movie. That sums it up for me. It's not a great movie. It's basically an extended TV show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't know if I saw the same movie...","review":"Trully, I don't know what people saw on this movie...

Dull and disappointing!","review":"When Tim Robbins and Sean Penn won Academy awards for their roles in \\"Mystic River,\\" I just knew I'd see the film sooner or later. Plus, I love Tim Robbins' progressive politics anyway. This movie was such a letdown. It ran too long. I didn't sympathize with Robbins' character in the slightest. I loved Robbins' dorky look and I loved Penn's muscular torso, gray temples, and big hair. However, any admiration stops there. This film was a bunch of nothing. I don't know why Laurence Fishburne put on so much weight for his role. This film wouldn't help people understand the sexually abused better and it wouldn't help the sexually abused come to terms with their tragic victimization. I love the way that sports balls falling into sewers was a metaphor here. In fact, they should have played it up more. Still, very disappointing. This must be one reason why moviegoers don't take the Oscars seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been Done Better","review":"I saw a movie that was kind of like this, except better.

Check out Pitt, DeNiro, Hoffman, and Bacon in Sleepers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done, but ONE BIG flaw is a little disturbing...","review":"Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are really that great in this movie, and no surprise there. Two of the best actors in the world today.But :It doesn't take you long to reveal the plot, does it? In the beginning of the movie we hear two boys call 991, \\"Your name, son?\\" the police ask - \\"He wants to know her name\\" the boy tells \\"someone\\" - hmmm...Wouldn't cops in the USA check out the anymonous call a little closer when they start their investigation. In the end (!) this call reveals it all, there is no grown man the police should be after. A major weakness to the story, and I realize I am not the only one to notice this, of course - or am I picky here?Anyway :Overall this movie is very, very well done - great camera-work, acting - and that behind a very tense and gripping story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"There is not really much to say about this movie other than if you haven't seen it you need to. It is one of the greatest movies of all time I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!!!!","review":"My sister rented this movie and I'm glad she did. Saved me twenty dollars on this insipid farce of a drama! I cannot believe this was nominated for best picture, let alone all the critical hype. I thought this movie was going to be a great drama, or so I thought. Small town tragedy leads three broken friends to reunite after Sean Penn's daughter is murdered. It had its moments..and Sean Penn is a notable actor, but the ending left me cold and stunned. So much for morality. The look on Marcia Gay Harden's face as she searches helplessly for her husband and the unrepentant Laura Linney's gleeful smile is sickening....all and all this movie is okay for a rental...save yourself the twenty bucks..maybe the book is better,,they almost always are....disappointing Mr. Eastwoood...a waste of time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a classic","review":"I felt that this movie was more commercial product than an earnest attempt at art or at entertainment. The twists and turns of plot were manipulative and trite to the extent that they made the characters appear less believable; therefore much of the acting talent was wasted. When the movie finally ended I felt that I had been cheated. With the advent of the blu-ray edition I offer a caveat for those who seek memorable characters and meaning in film; otherwise I would not bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"Great cast. great movie.

A movie may be well-acted and worthy of many technical credits, but this plot was depressing, disturbing, and not even remotely entertaining.I realize that life is not all hearts and flowers. In fact, I can get into a heavy drama with the best of them, provided there is some element of hope, resolution, redemption or something that I can walk away feeling good about.There is nothing positive about this storyline and I cannot imagine anyone feeling uplifted by it.Sorry, Mr. Eastwood. I cannot recommend this film, although you have certainly given us other movies that were worth writing home about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film about grief, and vengeance.","review":"Mystic River is perhaps Clint Eastwoods finest movie next to Unforgiving. An unrelenting look in to childhood, and penance that not only disturbs but liberates as well. Kudos to Sean Peen for another great performance, and to Eastwoods dedication to the original novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat confusing, but definitely great!","review":"Mystic River starts off with three young boys (Jimmy, Sean, & Dave)playing in their neighborhood, when one is abducted for about 4 days and escapes. 25 Years later forced to become friends again Sean, (Kevin Bacon)now a cop, is assigned to head the murder of Jimmy's (Sean Penn) 19 year old daughter. Circumstances lead to Dave (Tim Robbins) being the number one suspect.This movie is awesome. Throughout the whole movie i was like \\"What?\\" but by the end i was like \\"Ohhh.\\" The reason i enjoyed this move so much was because it wasn't only about solving a murder, but it was about friendship and fighting battles in your life. The great acting made you actually feel like you knew the characters. The one thing I didn't like was that at the end they kind of still had you guessing to exactly what happend, and what is still yet to come. Overall i would suggest this move to anyone who loves a great mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superb acting","review":"To be honest, I had higher expectations. I haven't read the book and I cannot compare it to the screenplay. However, I thought that the film lacked in continuity, it would fall apart at times. Pacing was another thing that, in my opinion, suffered. Nothing remarkable with the cinematography either.Well, what came through though was undoubtedly the professionalism of the \\"all-star\\" cast (Bacon, Gay Harden, Linney). Penn delivered an incredible performance, yet sometimes he tended to overact. Robbins, who totally managed to capture his character, took my breath away with his powerful playing.Overall, I would recommend this film more to aspiring actors who could learn a-plenty from the aces of the profession."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Bad accents, a ridiculous pile-up of convenient coincidences, unconvincing speeches, are not redeemed by a strong performance from Sean Penn. This movie falls apart while you're watching it, and then really really really outlasts its welcome. Laura Linney's Lady Macbeth scene is laughable. Can you say overrated? Eastwood has directed far better movies. All I can imagine is that whatever made sense in this story was left out of the screenplay and might be found in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Critics Have the Life","review":"This movie was a grand attempt (Big time director, actors, budget etc) to tell a story which was very well done in novel form. However, it falls on its face in too many areas. I hate to give too much away (although much is already missing) but there are two points that must be made. First, the killer is clear from the beginning and there is a very sensible reason for the killing - which turns out not to be the actual reason at all. The actual reason is MUCH less fulfilling. Second, we are supposed to believe that the cops are competent yet the climax of the investigation comes when both partners turn to the other and say \\"I didn't listen to the 911 call, I thought you did\\"!! What!! And just to add to the insanity (This is a bonus complaint), Sean Penn's wife has a soliloquy at the end that comes out of no where. I understand that it is very difficult to take a good novel and make a good movie, but one thing to never forget is the PLOT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"A movie starring fine actors such as Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne, and directed by Clint Eastwood, should be a can't-miss opportunity. For the first hour and 15 minutes or so, it seems like the movie is going to deliver -- the story is laid out methodically, without plodding, and the acting is superb, even if Mr. Fishburne is criminally under-utilized. Then it all falls apart.I won't give away the plot or the ending, but safe to say what you think you are watching for the first half and hoping to see resolved takes a bizarre and contrived twist, and the resolution is so wholly unsatisfying that you feel cheated for sitting through this two-plus hour film. Great talent, wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Man is still a Monkey","review":"Clint Eastwood's Mystic River is a revolutionary film that explores the ultimate deformity in man: His failure to successfully communicate his emotions.The cast performs at peak-power perfection(especially Tim Robbins)and the direction is beautifully austere.I'll waste no time with a plot synopsis other than say that the story revolves around three childhood friends who have drifted apart because of a disturbing event in their youth as well as the dark deck life delt them, and their subsequent reunion catalyzed by a terrible tragedy which begets another tragedy, which is founded upon a frighteningly fragmented nonlanguage of male frustration. This is a friggin brilliant film, whether its intentions to denude such a monumentally pathetic side to human nature was intentional or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Don't Gain Anything From Watching This Movie","review":"I have not read the book, so I cannot comment on that aspect. However, I didn't feel like I learned anything about humanity or the human condition from watching this movie. If you invest this much time in watching something, you hope to feel even just a little bit wiser when it's finished. The characters acted predictably and stayed \\"true\\" to their stereo-typical character types. No surprises. The 2 stars are for the relatively good acting and for the directing. Overall, though, watching it was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"bland and depressing","review":"Why do people like to see movies set in slums about scummy people doing crappy things? If I want to see that kind of stuff, I'll just drive downtown. The actors performed well, but seeing this just depressed me. And every time I see Sean Penn, I feel like I need a shower. If you want an uplifting movie, then don't see this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"For the life of me I could not understand one iota what the deal was with this movie. I saw it. The acting was way overblown, especially by Sean Penn and Tim Robbins. The dialogue was cheezy and stilted. I was rolling my eyes every time the 2 cops talked. My father was a Detroit police officer for 26 years and cops do not talk full of chiches like that. Needless to say it took every ounce of strength in my body not to walk out. Dont waste your time on this snooze-fest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely amazing[ly bad]","review":"There are some movies that draw attention from awards shows... there are some that draw fan attention. Usually I can understand one way or another and accept the differentiation and enjoy either type for what they are. But then a movie like Mystic River comes along and makes me wonder if my whole world is off. Yes yes this movie is by Eastwood... maybe that explains the interest. But nothing should forgive such overacting that only Mr. Penn can conjure up. And nothing should forgive plot holes that would annoy a seven year old. Sometimes Hollywood manages to trick people into watching a crapfest... Well folks, this is one of those times. I honestly say that this movie has NO redeeming qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not Eastwood's best effort at directing","review":"Up to a point the film is beautifully directed and filmed. However, it is, in my opinion, marred by over-acting from Sean Penn and a very unsatisfying, implausible climax and resolution. That's at least two problems for this 'true to life whodunnit' that great performances from Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon can not overcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great acting and everything else PLUS the terrible ending","review":"I would have to say that I heard lots of good things about this movie and thought well here is a movie that I will like and think is worth my time. Well, everything is great except for one thing, the injustice in the end. Just disgusting really. More action could have also fixed this movie. Almost any other ending would have made this a worthwhile movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the sixteen silliest movies ever","review":"Like a bad episode of Law and Order, this pretentious movie flies its artsy urgency with the kind of solemnity that makes it painful to watch.I remember sitting through improvisations in high school and college drama classes where two boys would adopt accents and do a lot of cursing and bitter emoting as they worked themselves up to some kind of pathetic confrontation/revelation (all the time imagining that this was \\"real\\" and \\"true\\" and \\"art\\" because they were cursing and emoting); Eastwood's little crime melodrama has that same painful self-consciousness about it. It feels like a bunch of unprepared actors standing around working themselves up to something they hope will startle the audience.It is a sadly unworthy film --in almost every way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morally disappointing, could have been so much more","review":"The basically unsatisfying tale of three friends separated by life changes, fate and time, though none of them have moved from the environs where they grew up.While Sean Penn gets the most sympathy I've felt since before he went to Baghdad (nicely undoing all the goodwill from \\"I Am Sam\\"), his performance and Laura Linney's urban hausfrau-meets-Laby Macbeth can't save the moral failings of this film. Granted, any parent would feel ready to kill for Sean (except possibly soldiers' parents), but how far do you go?Other movies have explored this theme and I maintain that \\"Sleepers\\" addresses this sort of story better. The book is usually better anyhow."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential but a huge disappointment","review":"This movie was full of tension and suspense right up to the last 10 minutes. Then the cliched, trite, stupid ending came and completely ruined it. Seriously, I enjoy dark movies like American Beauty but Mystic River is completely overrated. It's as if they tried out a bunch of different endings on some focus groups and picked the one that was the most tidy and that everyone could understand. Nice job Clint. I'm glad I only rented this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"movie","review":"This movie got so much hype. It wasn't good.

This explains how the actors turn the characters into charactertures of human beings, by exhibiting over the top method acting. Warning! Ugly, inhuman, inexplicable final scenes. OK, explained by the fact that Ole Clint directed them just for the \\"shock value\\" DUH! To top it off...big old lettering at the end...\\"Music by Clint Eastwood\\".

That is always tricky as one cannot help but compare the two. I was very impressed by the casting and performances, and the Oscar nominations and wins are very well deserved. The mood and setting were perfectly captured on film.Of course, not every detail can be put in a movie, and I wondered whether those who hadn't read the book would have questions, for example, about Sean's relationship with his wife and why he was in that situation.I strongly recommend this DVD to anyone who appreciates an excellent drama with solid acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"i can't believe this","review":"what a load of crap! i dont know who bribed who but this DID NOT deserve an Oscar! the whole storyline is just absurdly terrible and i dont understand how anyone can think this was a great movie!

His acting was fantastic. It was quite clear who was the killer thirty minutes into the film. It seemed to me that Eastwood tried to throw curve balls from the beginning of the film to keep you off track, but it never worked. The first appearance of the killers in the film gave it away.

With Clint Eastwood directing and Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Laura Linney, and Marcia Gay Harden rounding out a stellar cast, I didn't think much could go wrong. Not true. This is one of the most disappointing cinematic experiences I've ever had. The plot is bland and is not in any way original or creative. In fact, it is derivative and closely resembles Lifetime movie of the week productions as far as story and execution go. It's your regular Whodunit movie, only with a Hollywood cast. I still have no idea what the big deal about this movie is. Yes, the acting is all right--it's hard for these actors to misstep--but in the end the story itself is simply not as engaging and original as critics made it out to be. I would avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Was Anxious To See This Film. What A Letdown!","review":"Based on all of the positive reviews and Oscar wins by Penn andRobbins, I was anxious to see this highly regarded film. What a letdown!

Mystic River is one of the best films I have ever seen.

Penn and Robbins give powerful performances that make Mystic River a film that simply must be experienced.While minor flaws come into effect after repeated viewings, its the acting and direction here that really take over. For a film buff or just a movie lover, Mystic River should satisfy on all accounts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good till the end","review":"Wow, this movie started great and had me thinkin who did it form the beginning.

It was like clicking the channel button on the remote....Right when Sean Penn's character starts to develop, and to learn something from his pathetic life....they throw the last scene in with his women telling him he's king....sorry, but that scene and everything after it was completely lame, and should have been cut from the movie all together.It disturbed me so much that I have to give it a 2, since I will never \\"by choice\\" see this movie again. It's too bad because up until then it was a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"mystic river","review":"i have to say, with all the hype about this movie, it ended up being a big flop. the story was good for the first 75% of the movie, then the ending ruined it. its like they spent all their time and effort in getting the big named actors to star in the movie, then think that will make up for the lack of script. the ending is stupid and rediculous, kevin bacon, who is a cop, just walks away from the scene with sean penn, where he just told kevin that he killed tim robbins character, and sean just walks away like nothing happened and continues his life. what a HUGE dissapointment,any fans of kevin bacon, tim robbins, or sean penn should not view this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIDN'T GET THERE!","review":"I saw this a few months ago with my movie buddie, and we both felt that Sean Penn was just terrible, completly overacting, and Tim Robbins character was just too pathetic. the movie just kept missing what it was or what it should have been trying to accomplish. It absolutely stuns me that people liked it and gave it all those awards and missed out on the the wonderfullness of \\"Lost in Translation\\" and Bill Murray's oscar winning performance. I even forgot myself and thought he was sexy for a few brief moments. anyways i dont think \\"mystic river\\" DESERVED ANYTHING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great acting does not make up for the bore fest that this is","review":"Sean Penn delivers a powerful performance in possiable one of the biggest let downs since lost in translation. This just like lost in translation was sworn up and down by movie critics everywhere to be such a great and powerful film. But on the contrary it might be one of the most boring films I have ever seen. It starts off great and fast, a girl is killed in the first few minutes (which is always nice), and then the next hour or so you spend your time waiting and wanting something else to happen. And I mean anything at all. This movie is all build up, with little to no pay off. It has a interesting ending, but by then you have pracitically ripped all your hair out waiting for something to develope. And as we learned from star wars attack of the clones, a good ending does not make up for wasted hours watching a tedious storyline. This was a movie with such promise but just did not meet up to any of my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Show.....","review":"What is it with violent (pervertedly, randomly, and disgustingly violent) shows that have a modicum of emotional/relationship issues? Do they get a free pass of some kind? Do critics not know what to do with them? Not to be too simplistic but do people's minds turn to mush when presented with a film marketer's \\"mystical holy grail\\" of combining boy's likes with girl's likes. Violence with relatioship issues.This show was terrible. (And all apoligies to those who liked this show but they all probably like a History of Violence as well....an even more atrociously terrible show). And I am someone who doesn't mind violent shows if they are good.Bad, bad acting. Ridiculously dull dialogue. And a plot that made me want to vomit. And I didn't even bother to finish the show--but after reading the ending from other reviewers I now not only feel justified in my views, but emboldened enough to write this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"Horrible, horrible, horrible. Random plot twists, no point, tried to be over dramatic, not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is sooo much better..","review":"Please read the book first....otherwise you risk losing a great read because once you sit through this film you'll no longer wish to read it. I read the book, then saw the flick at the theater, maybe I was expecting too much considering how much I enjoyed the book but it was really, really bad. Please avoid.Girlfriend didn't like, parents either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Ado about nothing","review":"I personally started liking Tim Robbins from Shawshank Redemption & Sean Penn from Dead Man Walking and I believe these were the movies these guys should have recieved oscar for their outstanding roles.Keeping than in mind and seeing lot of recommendations I saw Mystic River which the review said was the best as far as Clint Eastwood was concernedAgain he had adapted another movie, Bridges of Madison County, which in my personal opinion was much better adaptation of a novel.The story line eventhough is good about three friends meeting again by fate and all the script is not that strong. I actually fell asleep in between.Off the cast my personal belief is Kevin Bacon was really good. Sure TimRobbins plays a character of sexually abused child with lot of conviction but even that was potrayed better in Shawshank Redemption where he is abused by a few inmates.And the end is kind of loose.Give it a miss"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are all the characters in this movie just plain stupid?","review":"The movie was ok until it got close to end. The accused murderer was murdered by his long time friend, the father of the daughter that was murdered. They all found out that the accused person was not the killer. And they all seemed like nothing happened. All the characters seemed kind of retarded near the end and that really made a good movie into a bad one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, much?","review":"What a sad little disappointment this movie was.... or should say the longest disappointment of my life. The story moves along soooooo slooooooowly that I fell asleep 4 times before finally finishing it.Sean Penn tries too hard; and if it's possible, Tim Robbins tries even harder. I just didn't buy it. The whole thing was ridiculous, and it had the potential to be really great. I just don't see what all the fuss was about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mystic River..The Ending Bites","review":"First off..someone please tell Clint Eastwood to back away from the camera slowly and never ever direct another film. As far as everyone who raves about this film..you have lost all cred. I supposed your enthralled by shiny objects too. The ending was ridiculous....my daughter is killed..lets go to a parade?????? The fact that this drivel was considered genius in two mediums is baffling...more proof that everything is watered down beyond hope...whoever says this is a classic- I have some old home movies..you wanna shell out money to see those too???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I say this is one of the best movies I have ever seen, the movie kept me on the edge of my seat and the acting was phenominal. The music and the dim lighting really helps set the gloomy mood as the story unravels to unveil the story of three men and one murdered teenager. Although it is very tragic and sad, I still liked it and I think this is the best movie I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too shabby","review":"Clint Eastwood adapts a powerful drama that examines both the suppression of marring experiences and the consequences of taking justice into ones own hands.Sean Penn leads a superb cast that will be sure to dazzle even those tougher critics, such as myself. Each character is carefully constructed and the way in which the characters play against each other is excellent.This film is also a refreshing change from the banal hollywood excesses that are so often dwelled upon. Here is a film that examines the true spirit of humanity. It is worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"This is a movie that makes dumb people feel like they are experiencing \\"art.\\" They are plenty of movies that matter; movies that, while horribly depressing, have something to say about the human condition. This is not one of them. This is a movie that portrays the kind of deep emotions and complex logic that can only be learned from other, similarly shallow, Hollywood swill. The lack of careful examination that went into this film just makes me angry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable & Overacted","review":"I don't understand why critics around the world joined hands in universal praise for this film. I see an enormous amount of films and I usually tend to agree with the majority of critical opinions, but not this time.Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are both HORRIBLE in this movie. I'm no actor, but to see Sean Penn in \\"anguish\\" over his daughter is the most unintentionally funny performance of the year. It looks like he decided to try as hard as he could to be \\"dramatic\\" and all his lines are spoken with an annoying scowl. Tim Robbins is worse, wandering around looking confused and failing to show us any character beyond Tim Robbins: Actor.Don't even get me started about the ending, lame. I saw it coming an hour away. I love Eastwood, but people are pandering to him too much. I've watched better episodes of network TV drama.Overlit Hollywood crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clint Eastwood should retire","review":"I guess the judges felt that both Clint Eastwood and Sean Penn were overdue for an Oscar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash from the Word Action","review":"This is simply the worst movie I have ever seen. And I am not alone. When I saw this the week it opened - to a full theatre - nearly everyone in the room laughed at Sean Penn's fake crying and TERRIBLE acting. This film is fumbly, immature, and just plain boring. I found it disinteresting and sloppy. The end is nothing short of stupid and confusing. Acting worse than a Star Wars film, and a thin - if at all present - storyline. Watch the cemetary scene where the entire camera crew is visible in the reflection of the headstones. Just plain amature backyard moviemaking. I fell asleep at one point and left the theatre wanting my money back. (I only gave it one star because Amazon requires at least one.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Realistic Viewer","review":"This movie sucked. It could not have been worst unless it had been Matrix's Revolutions. I watched this movie in breathless anticipation of the good part to come.It never happened.I figured out the \\"plot twist\\" half way thru the movie, an just sat around waiting for this snorefest to be over.This horrible movie was not worth the eight dollars it cost me for the ticket."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is almost good","review":"Here's my story with mystic river. Began reading the book, but got bored and gave the movie a shot since it was a very interesting story. The movie pulled me in just like the book, and Sean Penn's acting was very good. I thought Tim Robbins was horrible and could barely stand watching him. When you get to the point in the movie where everything ties together it is, at least for me, a let down. And, overall, it made this just a mediocre movie for me. However, Stephen King said in an Entertainment Weekly column that it was one of the best movies he's seen in years. So, take his opinion or mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for Clint","review":"I have great respect for Clint Eastwood as a director but if you already saw Sleepers then you can happily skip this movie. It's dull, slow and Sean Penn does the worst Robert DeNiro imitation I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mystic River--a metaphor for America and Iraq","review":"A man with considerable power gets his buddies together to seek revenge on a man who must have had something to do with a heinous crime.A President with great power rallies his armies together to seek revenge on Sadam Hussein who must have helped Ben Laden blow up the Twin Towers.Get it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost","review":"This movie was disappointing because if the actors had tried a bit harder they would have produced an excellent work. They did well, but the finishing touch that would have made a classic wasn't there. The story is a tough one to put on screen as fully detailed as the book, but Eastwood still has a future. I'll see this movie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie was good, the book was better","review":"I had read the book so of course I was interested in seeing the movie.

This truly is a fine movie worthy of multiple viewings. A movie that belongs in anyone's library who like the genre.Scott M"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful thriller with superb cast","review":"Suspenseful, well-paced thriller performed by a top-notch cast and directed superbly. Tim Robbins gives a terrific performance as the relatively dull-witted Dave who gets caught in the crossfire of a wife who jumps to the wrong conclusions and bad circumstantial evidence. A classic...worth seeing again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"Viewer's of this film would be wise to not let the superficial twist at the end of the movie entice them or be awed. There is some major flaws that other reviewers have hit upon. I'll just say that it seemed pretty obvious to me that whoever wrote this story never created 'the mute' during early versions, and discovered that he (the author) had no ending and superficially imposed this undeveopled character to tie things up. It's really lame. Probably there was a time when Tim Robbins character was the evil party for the crime emphasized throughtout, but rather than milking this for meaty insights, he is turned into a flimsy character who comes away very inconsistent and...dead, still. I really wanted my money back after this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF TIME","review":"This movie was good until I got to the lazy ending. Great actors who did a great job, but what were they thinking? Glad I rented it instead of paying $9 to see it. Let me ruin in for you: it's always the guy you least expect that's the killer. Shocking. THAT'S never been done before. SO original. GRADE:C+"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Your daughter's name is Nora!!!\\"","review":"I came to this movie expecting to be deeply affected, but came away shaking my head in disbelief. The fact that Sean Penn (who gives a performance that is so over-the-top that it's actually somewhat amusing), and Tim Robbins (who has made a career out of being overrated) won Oscars for this piece of manipulative hackwork is downright surreal. Think a two-hour episode of \\"Law & Order\\". Or maybe \\"Kojack\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn Good Movie","review":"This movie was sooo touching. I felt everything as if I were there. Sean Penn was beyond excellent. I recommend this movie on a night at home where you just want to be reminded of how precious life can be. I don't have any fancy words or spectatular review to give except to say that the movie was good, the acting was excellent and the story line was real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie..Lousy Special Edition!","review":"This was one of my favorite films of 2003. Sean Penn and Tim Robbins both deserved the Oscars they took home. My advice to anyone reading this review is save 10-15 dollars and buy the version with just the film on it. The Special Edition contains nothing more than some of the most boring interviews, which go on for over an hour or two, and a dull commentary track. No insight on the making of the film or the casting. The Soundtrack is decent but not worth the extra bucks. Please take my advice and buy the \\"bare bones\\" version of this outstanding film and nothing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go see it.","review":"Hard to discuss without giving it away, but here's one example of what a beautiful movie this is. As the detective attempts to solve the crime, his estranged wife periodically calls him, but won't speak to him. She just calls, and listens. As he gradually unravels the crime(s), he tries saying different things to her, and her lips move silently as if she really WANTS to speak to him. At the end of the movie, he's figured out everything, and finally, he knows what to say to her, and she speaks. It's beautiful, haunting symbolism, and about 1% of the wonderful things this movie has to offer. Go see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well acted and directed.","review":"Clint Eastwood's Mystic River is a very poweful and touching film. All the actors do an amazing job and this is Eastwood' best work (as a director) since \\"A Perfect World\\". There is one thing that doesn't make sense, though -- the two killers, one of them loved by the victim. Why do they beat her with bats and kill her? What for? Money? Fun? You tell me why these little monsters had to kill a 19-year-old girl. I like movies where you can watch them 100 times and still discovering new things, like in \\"Chinatown\\" or \\"Blue Velvet\\". I don't think is the case with Mystic River, but I'll watch it again for the third time and who knows, maybe there is an explanation for the killing, which occurs off-screen. However, Mystic River still is a great achievement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well acted, weak screenplay","review":"Tim Robbins and Marcia Gay Harden both give excellent performances in this movie. Sean Penn was believable in some scenes, over the top in others. My main complaint about this movie was that the story became totally unbelievable toward the end, and there were many flaws in the logic of the plot. I was surprised at how unrealistic the story line was, after reading so much critical praise about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even helpful","review":"As a sophomore in electrical and computer engineering major at Auburn University, I can safely say that this is the worst book I have ever *attempted* to read as well as spent seventy dollars on. The book came with faded text, a poor introduction, and horrible examples that does not appeal to the beginning programmer. This book is now a coffee coaster in the living room of my apartment (as no one would buy it back). Do not waste your time with this book. Instead, try the Absolute Beginner's guide to C by Greg Perry or any other book if you want to learn C.Not this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"C Program Design for Engineers","review":"Book trys to be good at explaining programming, but it's not exactly something you can explain in a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I am a c++ programmer and tried to brush up on C using this book. I had to buy a new book. Maybe an engineer can get some use for their $55 some bucks but I didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the breakthrough record she needs","review":"Okay, I'm a fan of Kelley Hunt, not an objective reviewer. Having seen her in concert several times, I know what she is capable of.Kelley is a talented musician with a powerful voice (think Bonnie Raitt) and a fun boogie woogie piano style. But her studio records have yet to completely capture the talent she displays on the stage.This is a very smooth, laid back session which, unfortunately, comes across as bland and uninspired. The band plays every note to perfection, but it never takes any chances or adds any zip to the recording. Same with Kelley's vocals, dead on perfect, but she appears to be holding back. Blame the producer, I know she can belt out the blues with the best of them.If you have a chance to see her in person, be sure and catch her show. Otherwise, check out \\"Inspiration\\", her first CD which was recorded live at the Grand Emporium in Kansas City. You will become a fan too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My birds like it best","review":"Its simple my 35 year old red lored amazon gets more \\"pretty bird\\" in his stomach and less flung around the cage bottom than other brands I've tried, (kaytee exact, zoopreem, etc.). I'm not sure why, it all looks and smells about the same to me, but my birds can tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait... how many different beats are there in this CD?","review":"Okay, so I have to admit it. I own this CD. I do listen to it from time to time, but that is becoming rare. The beats were fun and maybe it was just the crazy video for \\"Around The World\\" that got me interested. But enough is enough. In \\"Da Funk\\", how many times can you hear that one riff before your head explodes or you just have to turn it off? Give me a break. They have some good reiffs going, now they just need to get the rest of the songs going."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Labotomy Is Preferrable To Listening To This Junk","review":"The popular songs from this CD may have been club hits, but they don't transfer well to listening in the car or at home. Give me a 6 year old for five minutes and I could teach him musical \\"skills\\" that could easily surpass those of Bangalter and de Homen-Christo. The production is excellent, but it's like painting a pile of vomit red - it looks good, but it's still vomit underneath. The songs are dull, unoriginal, repetitive, and boring (and I'm being generous in my appraisal of this CD). This CD should include a \\"vomit bag\\" as a standard accessory - it's enough to make any human with an IQ 2 points higher than dead weeds hurl. The A/R corporate moron who signed this band should be fired.Bottom line blunt assesment: This CD sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daft Punk keeps me popping! BUY IT QUICK","review":"I have listened to Deep House, Techno, Ambient, Trance, Jungle and every other genre of dance music. Personally I hate labels, but bluntly put, Daft Punk is simply \\"funky\\". I would not hesitate to recommend this album to anyone! This music puts me into a smooth mellow hypnotic state. A year after owning the album, I still listen to my favorite cuts once a week. BUY THIS ALBUM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daft Punk: Beethotoven reincarnated pumps future of music","review":"Without a doubt, Daft Punk is the most talented group I have ever heard. They are intellectual geniuses. Contrary to what others may say, the music is not repetetive and it is very unpredictable. The more you listen the more you'll know what I mean. I got bored of the cd fast when I first got it but now I realize how to listen to it and I can't go a day without it. It is such good music that you can't listen to it like normal music. If you like to move with the music you should check these guys out. Support this group by purchasing multiple copies of their cds so they may release future cds. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars--A Dance Masterpiece","review":"If you're reading this, chances are that you've already heard all the hype and the rave reviews of this album. Often regarded as an essential electronica recording, it's not hard to see why: Daft Punk manages to make songs that sometimes have very minimal melody, or a minimally changing melody, yet they never seem to get old. From the pure house of \\"Revolution 909\\" to the catchy single \\"Around the World\\", this is a great dance recording, and a must-listen for all house fans. (as well as anyone else) However, for all people coming to Homework from Discovery, be warned: it's not the same. Many Discovery fans just turn down Homework because it's not as accessible, but neither are by any means bad recordings. Check both of them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"rejuvination","review":"This piece of exceptionall work has manifested itself towards the \\"New Modern\\" age of digital rock music. Everything from amazing breaks to smooth transitions are not only ones that impressed me; it is the astonishment of experiencing the vitality and energy in which it creats to alter your state of mind, one that does in a subtle manuver which makes Daft Punk a rejuvination of the classical music era. Everthing from its composition to its development, Daft punk not only seeks similicity in the literal sense, but it also brings the primitive drive out of us: an abstract concept.
