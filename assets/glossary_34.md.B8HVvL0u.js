SPR is on a very short list of best war films ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most touching films.","review":"Spielberg has done it again. This masterpiece is a story that revolves around D-Day and the carnage at Omaha Beach. It is deeply touching and I do not feel all of the gore was out of place. It was needed to give it the truly realistic feel. Some movies try to put gore in it, but this movie needed the gore. I will never forget the image of the man with his inards spilling out crying for his mother. It was awful, yet so horrifyingly real. I must admit, some of the talking scenes were a little dull (it would be helpful if the actors wouldn't mumble so much), but some of them have deep meaning about honor, duty, etc. Some of the events are a bit confusing- if you don't know about the history of the battle (I knew a little from my dad's lectures and another movie \\"The Longest Day\\"). Every American should see this, in honor of those who lost their lives in such horrible ways defending their country."},{"rating":"2","title":"War is hell.","review":"For anyone who has served in the military, particularly one who has faced his own mortality in the line of duty, the realism of combat portrayed in this movie will rip your guts out. \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" illustrates the price our veterans have paid for the freedom we enjoy. Admittedly, the film's plot is weak. Nonetheless, the movie is an invaluable testament to our veterans. Let us never forget them. Just imagine yourself approaching Omaha Beach in one of those landing craft. I dare you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest WWII movie ever! (with one minor mistake)","review":"In essence, SPR is THE greatest WWII movie that was ever made. To me, the closest thing to SPR in terms of WWII movie was \\"A bridge too far\\". It clearly is no competition. As for those morons at the academy, I have no idea what they were thinking. Regarding the movie itself, there was a minor mistake that one would not expect from a director like Spielberg. The search party for Ryan starts out with eight men. But if you take a good look, after Caparzo gets killed by the German sniper, there is a scene which STILL portrays eight men walking the French countryside. Take a closer look the next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST GOD D**N MOVIE EVER MADE","review":"I also thought all war movies were alike. Imade the mistake of judging the book by its cover and never expected what i saw. The most realistic movie about war ever made, there is nothing that could top this movie. I'm a trained infantry soldier and the army brainwashed me into wanting to go to war. After i saw this movie it changed my whole outlook on the military and war. I didnt cry when bambie died, but i cryed when i saw this movie. this movie hits any military man HARD. RANGERS LEAD THE WAY!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Movie every American should see","review":"Before I saw this movie, I didn't think much of what happened to the people who fought the war and what they went through. I thought, yeah, cool he's been through this war, he should be respected. But, when I saw this film, it changed my whole perspective of war. Even though the directing was a little shaky, I would say this is one of the best war films ever made that's telling you what actually went on in the war, not like the movie \\"The Longest Day\\" which only told the story of how the battle started and ended. The story overall wasn't very great, but Steven can just make these things turn out awesome (like he does most of the time) so people actually enjoy it.This movie still sometimes depresses me when I think of the men who fought for the country and died. Like my English teacher said, \\"Every American should go and see this movie\\". It truly was good and I thank Steven Speilburg for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome war movie","review":"One of the best war movies I've ever seen. The acting, filming are both fantastic.

Tha movie is stretched out just a bit and goes downhill after the first hour, but tha whole movie is classic.

Minus 1 star for length - almost 3 hrs.

The script, the acting and the cinematography are all extremely good and make for a very entertaining and enjoyable movie. It also is a good thinking movie with lots of situations that can be catalysts for discussion and reflection.Is one man ever worth risking the lives of many?Should a captured enemy simply be killed when the chance exists he may be a future threat?To what extant does a man follow orders? Are there gray areas?Do men fight in war for a cause, a country or simply for their compatriot?This movie is a great action flick and so much more. It is hard to watch the ending without tearing up just a bit. The only word of caution; it is graphic.Highly recommended and worth watching over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving","review":"During World War II, three soldiers who were killed are brothers.

I've watched it millions of times and I still keep watching it. It is a war masterpiece and it was the top-grossing picture of 1998.The movie begins with World War II's historic D-Day invasion. And then shows that eight men must recruit Private James Ryan from the battlefield. This movie has lots of sad scenes and the bloodiest scenes I have ever seen on film.The movie is very intense as you watch the brutal realities of war and the eight men who all search for hope and grows with honor and courage.

A view of war that is strictly combat, a portrait of the soliders ? A political film ? He never onces decides on what he is trying to show so the films becomes increalby uneven by not trying to tell one story but tell many and all are uneven and trite"},{"rating":"1","title":"Humpft","review":"I sat down and watched this, and honestly, I don't really know what the big deal about it all, was. Sure, it was full of action, the depiction of the atrocities of war was excellent...but...I don't know. It left me with a feeling of emptiness. Not one I would re-see, frankly.

At an early age I developed a tremendous since of pride that my dad was a part of that wonderful group of men that sacrificed their lives for our country. Dad was on an escort carrier in the Pacific that saw a lot of action and was also kamikased. I've always been amazed that more movies weren't made about these courageous men. I started crying during the first 3 minutes. Spielberg did a remarkable job in capturing WWII veterans patriotic even sacrificial attitude toward the defense of their country. This movie was absolutely the best I've ever seen. How they did it, just amazes me. And I have to say the medic's death scene was the best I've ever seen. Tom Hanks'love and respect for these men was evident in every frame. I felt nauseated when they announced the Academy's Best Actor award. But wasn't that just typical HOLLYWOOD. God bless Spielberg and Hanks for a long overdue tribute to these men."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Incredible Film","review":"Saving Private Ryan, in addition to being one of the greatest films ever made and one of the greatest of the 90's, is also one of the most sobering. No other war film ever made before SPR has captured the feelings of horror, confusion, sadness, and chaos of war. Steven Spielberg put himself on the line for this film and the results are absolutely incredible. In addition to THE most realistic battle sequences ever put on film, the human drama was likewise excellently portrayed. Tom Hanks led a cast of brilliant actors and captured all of the emotions that those soldiers on D-Day so many years ago must have felt. Spielberg may be getting older as a person, but is getting better and better as the extraordinary filmmaker he is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Blood and Guts","review":"What a horrible thing war is.

Speilberg, a great director wasted too much time on \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" at the expense of the actual events.

As for Good Old Monty, he lost enough men at El Alamien, Sicily, Italy, and who could forget, Arnheim. I am grateful that he wasn't at Omaha, or we would have lost the war. As for the movie itself, it stands alone for its realism and quality. If you had been in a battle, Mr Turner, you would agree.

Well through this journey the men in Tom Hanks squad find out who they truly are. The acting in this movie is topped only by the incredible action scenes.

I can not believe some of the moaning reviews abouth this movie wondering about why this movie didn't spend more time on numerous superfluous topics.This movie uses a small, albeit cute, story as a vehicle to portray the absolute violence and cruelty of war. The reason Spielberg is a master is because he doen't have to 'Spike Lee' his movies to nail a hidden message or theme through the viewers. SPR is an in your face absolutely astounding visual and audio presentation of war at it's bloodiest and ugliest!I would venture to guess that most people, including myself, buy this DVD after having seen the movie so the Mid-Western plotline should be no surprise.If you want a movie with stupid messages, twisted history and a RIDICULOUS plot then please wait till Pearl Harbour comes out on DVD, but, if you want a movie depicting war in it's purest form then SPR is a must have!~"},{"rating":"1","title":"FULL METAL JACKET!","review":"Whoever said you need to rent Full Metal Jacket is right.

Honestly, I had respect for the soldiers who fought and died for our country, yet I lacked this true feeling of compassion for the soldiers. I basically thought the whole war was idiotic, and the soldiers were just millions of men not knowing what they were truely doing. Yet after watching this film, after my parents strong advised I should, I felt as though I had expierenced WW2 with my very own eyes. I was shaken and left with many emotions afterwards.

First , I must say that my grandfather was a U.S. Navy veteran of teh pacific theater, and his brother was one of the soldiers who gave his life on the sands of Normandy. I haved new respect for what they gave during that time. The main virtue of this movie is that it shows just how hellish combat is, and through that, the enormous valor of the fighting men.

The uniforms and equipment were wonderfully accurate. However I watched this the first time with a veteran that was part of the first wave (green sector, dog beach). First he stated that the beach landing wasn't as bloody as it showed. All the fortifications were blown away. The Army didn't get tanks on shore till the fourth wave. And there was no artillery present. The only Germans there were infantry, and machine gunners. Before it was over he was critiziing every action that was shown. The way prisoners were taken, and especially the guy who was going AWOL. Watch this film for the equipment and uniforms. Also the filthiness of the soldiers was great. All in all I'll take The Longest Day, or The Desert Fox over this film any time. There are many articles out on the true story of Private Ryan, read them. The articles are history, but would have made a very dull movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"SPIELBERG BETRAYS THE FANS!","review":"This movie won its awards almost entirely on the strength of its incredibly visualized battle scenes.

If Mr. Spielberg (have some forgiveness if I spell his name wrong, but I don't really care) thought that shocked the audience with violent graphics was more important than focus on a character who was talking (he focused on nothing when someine was talking!?), then he may probably win an award if he produced a motion picture that shows how Japenese treated Chinese, Korean, and Southern Asian (I know that he'd not be interested).

This is nothing more than a few one dimensional characters wrapped around 2 set pieces at the beginning and end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saving nobody","review":"This movie is definitely a disappointment.The plot is rediculous from the start. Would any army waste the lives of 8 men to save a nobody?Even if they would, Private Ryan didn't get saved. He wasn't in great peril or a Prisoner of War. The whole movie doesn't make sense.The storyline is too linear. Good effects and realistic portrayal of war details should not compromise on a good storyline.All I can say after watching this is: DON'T BUY IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"BE CAREFUL! The actual movie that shipped was NOT DTS!","review":"The whole reason why you are considering purchasing this particular version of the movie is likely for the DTS sound. While the DTS box was shipped to me, I was dismayed to find the 60th Anniversary edition disc inside the DTS box, WHICH IS NOT DTS. It only supports Dolby Digital 5.1. I suspect this is an issue with the manufacturer and not Amazon, since the movie came in the factory wrap. Your best bet is to purchase this movie used. This is why I only gave it 1 star. Otherwise, the movie is one of the best of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-hyped, distorted flub.","review":"This gory, pseudo patriotic movie is just not that good. Behind the emotionalism is the real danger of blind faith in anything. The acting is not that great(average at best) and the only real exceptional factor of the film is the special effects, which serve only to make it for a more unpleasant experience. For a group of of numbered green soldiers to take on a tank column without proper weaponery is not only stupid on their part, but very unrealitstic. Anybody would have run. The real attraction for people seems to be the \\"greatest generation\\" myth which has popped up recently. This view that the folks living during that time were somehow superior morally or otherwise(remember this is the same generation that tolerated segregation and Japanese internment) gives us a flawed view of history. These people just did the things they did because they had to. This is a concept that the new generation of white Hollywood billionaires who produced SPR could never fully understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hooray for Hollywood!","review":"Thank god for 'Saving Private Ryan' with authentic representation of WW2.

A misguided, factually woeful and tediously dull piece of moviemaking. Who cares that he was a school teacher, who cares that the US Government cared more about PR than a cause that the rest of the world had been fighting for for 4 years already. It may have been worthy, but since when did worthy make a good film. All the critics gave it top reviews for being shockingly real...... so! You can film my postman and that would be real, it doesn't make me actually want to pay to watch it.

The story, the actors, the scenes...

Right from the begining you find your self with those solders on the beach and you wonder will you make it or not. If a movie is suposed to give you experience of life in other peoples eyes, this one definitely does. All in all, its war in its real image weather you like it or not. I wonder how will it feel for somebody who was in WW2 to see this movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious subject matter doesn't automatically make movie good","review":"I watched this movie some time ago. Thinking about it now, I realized that while a lot happened on screen, I don't remember most of it. Why? Because the film's action was mindless.There is nothing wrong with realism or grit. But there is something wrong with realism or grit if it isn't advancing the story's ideas further, if it isn't moving the characters or the viewers along. As it stands, what I had in my mind at the beginning of the movie was exactly what was there at the end. I came in, like most, with knowledge of the horror of WWII, and all the movie did was affirm this knowledge. I didn't learn anything from this movie; there was nothing in it that made me think and reach new conclusions. After watching it, I knew nothing more of men's motives, or soldiers' lives, or the impact of conflicts on psychology, or history, or contemporary politics, or ANYTHING. I can forget it entirely, and be none the worse off."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A REALISTIC LOOK AT WW II...","review":"It seems to me that to many people forgot that a significant number of african-american men died defending this country in WW II also. Trying to give this movie the benefit of the doubt, I saw the movie twice. Coming to the sad realization that there wasn't one, not one african-american face in this movie. Not dead, alive or wounded. This cannot be an accident. Why is it so hard to give credit where credit is due. The year 2000 is here, and this kind of thing shouldn't still be happening....The only reason I didn't rate this movie a zero is because of Barry Pepper's portral of Pvt. Jackson. I've seen him in other film, and He's a very good and likable actor. I'm looking forward to seeing more of his work. E.

There is no DTS track on this version of the film, why not???!!! Because the studio is making you buy the entire 4-dvd World War II Collection, in order to get an \\"exclusive DTS 5.1\\" track. What a crock. I'm stickin with my older DTS version and I suggest fellow DTS version owners do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for double-dipping...","review":"I'm so sick of studios releasing multiple dvds of the same film. I bought the first edition of SPR when it came out. Instead of taking the time to do it right back then, you wait until now to try to leach more money out of fans of the film. Guess what, I'm not buying it. I will rent it to check out the special features, but you won't get my money twice. It may be good business for you Dreamworks, but it isn't good public relations."},{"rating":"1","title":"An ok action film","review":"This was a pretty fun action movie, but not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark.

Check out 'Midway,' 'Tora, Tora, Tora,' 'The Longest Day,' and especially, 'A Bridge Too Far.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well made but thats about it","review":"This film is far far overrated. The opening 1/2 an hour is indeed shocking and the last 1/2 hour is action packed but the film is held together by a rediculous and self indulgent plot that only the Speilberg could put out as a serious film. This film is so patriotic its sickening, this film doesnt say anything even though it pretends to. If youwant to see a truely deep, meaningful and beautiful war movie, then check out The Thin Red Line that came out the same year. Avoid this sentimental speech filled insulting piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Steve & Tom","review":"For realiality, I give it a 5 star, watchablility a two star. Had to fast forward through much of the beginning of the movie, for it was too stressful for me and I can imagine how it must have been for those who had gone through the experience in person. The beginning would have been accepted better later in the movie as a flash back. Couldn't finish the movie, for was just too \\"REAL\\". I can accept that but made me so stressed there were people who had to go through the experience in real life. My heart goes out to them and their families."},{"rating":"2","title":"First movie in a long time that shows the horror of war.","review":"This movie really gives you a sense of what WWII was like. The opening scene was brilliant, same as the shell shock scene at the end. However, it would have been much better without the arguments between the soldiers, i think that if they had created a better topic of dialogue, this movie would easily be a 5 star film. However, i do not want to trash the dialogue fully. The conversation between the captain and the sergeant while the rest of their squad is sleeping inside is really great. I felt as if what they were talking about was the most important thing in the world, and i was hooked on every word. I also did not like vin diesel. What a jerk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half-baked","review":"Once again Spielberg wastes great photography and special effects by stacking them on a film with an absolutely dismal script.

There are 2 specific instances where the transfer was flawed, extended freeze frames. The DTS sound was excellent; but the interface was not fully functional. When you select DTS, it re-shows the leader w/o sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"best movie ever","review":"This was great. I felt everything the soldiers were going through. Spielberg is a genius. Almost every scene showed his great skill as a director and his attention to detail. And some other things: I was at first appalled at the lack of diversity in the soldiers, but I later learned that no black soldiers fought in the d-day invasion or much else for that matter because of racism at the time. Someone also said there were no British soldiers and that is historically accurate also. Only Americans went ashore on Omaha beach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saving Private Ryan- look, listen and learn","review":"Few movies have moved me, or brought such tears to my eyes as Spielberg's great epoch on the cruelty and honor seen in war. What motivates men to flee landing craft in the face of searing hot lead tearing limb and life in a fleeting moment? And further, to continue to move forward against all odds, is explained in the first half hour--they had no choice, or options but to survive. And, perhaps the greatest service this film provides is demonstrating ,especially to the young, that life is precious and should never be wasted on war.Sure, there are times when conflicts of this nature are unavoidable, but nations and peoples should never see war as a first, or \\"easy\\" resort. Speilberg demonstates the sacrifice and horror of the WW2 generation. And, in the process creates a masterpiece of visual literature. This movie is a must see for thr ROTC and military academy crowd. Historical drama at it best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great battle sequences. Would have been great IMAX film.","review":"Great visuals, lame plot. Typical Speilbergian effort. As usual, the movie feels impersonal, as though Steve thought he was going to make a grand statement about war. What is it? War is hell? War is good if it saves a Private Ryan at the expense of a lot of others on a worthless mission? Gore looks cool? Who the heck knows? The opening sequence is great for displaying the chaos of battle, but a great technical effort doesn't exactly make for an emotionally involving scene. The ending is absolutely horrible and makes a mockery of those who died in WWII. Was Private Ryan worth it? Yes for battle scenes. As a movie, it was only average."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Great WWII movie. the best that depicts what the invasion of Normandy was really like for the United States."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fitting Memorial for the Finest Generation","review":"I wanted this movie in my personal collection - after seeing it twice in the theaters several years ago. I'm not a great movie buff, but this was special. I'm also a military history buff, and have studied Normandy and D-Day extensively.My father is a WWII Vet/Infantry Officer. He didn't land at Normandy, but was in two amphibious landings in Europe - Anzio Italy and Southern France. He never talked about them much - even after he presented me with my commission many years ago. After reading eyewitness accounts and seeing the opening scenes, I can understand why he didn't want to talk.I think the other appeal of this movie is the way Speilberg crafts the interpersonal relationships among the men - especially the newby interpreter Allman who at heart is a coward and demonstrates it at the end of the movie by shooting the prisoner as compensation for his own inability to do his duty earlier, when it mattered."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE DIFFERENCE OF DTS","review":"Although I watched this film in cinema, I never realized that I would enjoy it this much in DTS version.

PERIOD","review":"Speilberg never ceases to amaze me. I cannot believe that Shakespeare in love beat this movie out for best picture. I Admire Speilbergs crazyness for historical accuracy. The uniforms, the collapsable stocks on the m-1 carbine for the 101st, the bangalore torpedoes, even the dead fish caused by all of the blood were all accurate historicaly and through the eyes of veterans. The only thing that i disagree with was the age. The average age for a Ranger in WW2 was about 19. Other than that i would give the movie 3 thumbs up but physical limitations keep me from doing so. :-)oh.. some guy from florida commented about how no minority groups were shown. Well.. Speilberg is an accuracy nut and to the best of my knowledge, there were no Black Rangers during that period in history. I disagree with this policy which once existed but like i said... speilberg is an accuracy nut.. not a Politicaly Correct Nut."},{"rating":"2","title":"it makes you have more respect for people who went to war","review":"i think this was the best movie ever made by Spilberg he is the best director i loved all the blood in it.

Great acting, great music, great sound, great action, and it is the best movie ever made. I know you won't think that but that's what I think. There is no way that you can't ignore this movie. It just makes you want to scream out \\"SPIELBERG, YOU ARE A GENIUS!\\" I would recommend this movie to people over 14 years of age, who likes Spielberg films, and who likes to watch war films. After you watch the movie, you have to clap and cheer at the end. This is one of those films you have to see.

Until then, I can only enjoy the magic of his technique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty, sentimental war movie","review":"This was a very hard-hitting (no matter if it was manipulative to a degree) war movie. The opening and closing battles were very intense definately surpassing Hamburger Hill. I didn't mind the slower middle sections that allowed for us to catch our breath. I didn't think that the Germans were portrayed in any lessor light than the Americans. Both routinely killed the wounded and the captured. Both were trying to survive. Don't tell me that a released US soldier wouldn't have recycled into another unit if he had been released. War is Hell! As far as this being basically a US movie.....it is! If you want the multi-national approach see The Longest Day (an excellent movie in it's own right).

It is the best movie ever made. How the Hell did it loose best film of the year. Shakespheare In Love was overrated. RYAN showed what it was like to be in heavy combat, what it did to the men, and how many men can be killed in a single day. My hats off to Spielberg-who diserved his Academy Award for Best Director. But he was cheated out of an award for Best Picture. The Academy should be ashamed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a classic but still very good","review":"Let me say that Spielberg is a hack. He hasn't made a good film (until now) since \\"Jaws\\". (I'm sorry, \\"Schindler's List\\" was not handled very well and Liam Neeson couldn't act his way out of a paper bag.) It frustrates me that because \\"Ryan\\" is a Spielberg film that it is immediately deemed a classic. It is very good however, up there with \\"Apocalypse Now\\" and \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" (I kinda like \\"Born on the Fourth of July\\" too). It's worth your time, but I still think \\"The Truman Show\\" should have won best picture.

When orders mean being part of something that seems insane but becomes something honorable and noble. The viewer witnesses mans struggle with self, pride, trust, and loss.

Perfect use of colors, ie its emphasis in dark and red hues. The slow shutter speed used in this film also brings incredible realism to this movie. Also pretty accurate special effects. Other than than that the movie has a marginal, at best, script and plot. The acting is so-so and the chracters are completely forgetable.

Tom Hanks did his usual great job of bringing his character to life. Spielberg, the great movie maker, also has the special talent of showing the greatness of the characters in his films. This is definately the greatest war movie made to date, but it's also a fine tribute to the greatest generation of people that ever lived. I'm, of course, talking about our 75 to 90 year old national treasures that are about to be gone forever. Yes, it's got great color, the most realistic war scenes, great sound, great stunts, etc, but this is a movie about ordinary people doing what has to be done. It's a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie! And a good DVD Quality edition.","review":"Saving Private Ryan was the movie that finally took War Movies from the Hollywood of old (Longest Day, Dirty Dozen, Dam Busters, etc) the final step after movies like Apocalypse Now & Platoon endeavoured to bring the true face of war to the big screen - SPR went the rest of the way taking that to it's next stage and adding even greater levels of detail & historical accuracy and realism - it was the movie that led to a whole new generation of movies in the last decade (Band of Brothers; Flags of our Fathers/Letters from Iwo Jima; We Were Soldiers; Days of Glory; Saints & Soldiers; Max Manus; and more). Good to see it given the high quality 'Superbit' style treatment - the ultimate & preeminent DVD version, at least until a new Blu-ray version is released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of the praise heaped upon it....","review":"Honestly, the only reason to see this film is the cinematography; it is one gigantic plot hole as it's told through the \\"memories\\" of \\"Private Ryan\\" who wasn't present through most of the action of the film. The characters are thinly developed stock war characters that we never really get to know (with the exception of Tom Hanks' character since he is an uberstar). I can't express my disappointment with this film after the critical praise heaped upon it. I'd recommend \\"Thin Red Line\\" over this any day! Just my opinion..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, Spielberg, you did it again....","review":"This is the old Spielberg formula.... Totally empty character, a lot of sheer violence, an inocuous plot filled with false \\"partiotic\\" messages and false \\"emotional\\" moments all along the way. I must admit the battle sequence are the better ever made, but this is not sufficient to make a good film. At least it didn't win the Oscar, this would have been the last drop of injustice !"},{"rating":"1","title":"World War What??","review":"Awful Spielberg garbage, plays like a comedy tour across the fields of France. Stand up comedy, with the legs cut off. Yes, it has amazing set pieces, showing violence almost for the sake of violence. Unfortunately, there is absolutely no script. This movie shows how the Spielberg frosting can hide a rotten cake beneath. The characters of this movie behave as if in a fantasy world and have no grounding in reality. Hanks, in particular, was terrible, in essence playing himself.The modern scenes were particularly poorly done, and the scene where the US planes roll in in the nick of time was so bad as to be beyond belief. Spielberg continues his tradition of telling us how to feel---he seems to believe we are not smart enough, nor caring enough, to feel for ourselves.Wave-the-flag garbage. One of the worst WW2 movies out there, try Midnight Clear, Thin Red Line, The Third Man for more realistic WW2 and after effects thereof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saving Major WasteOfTime","review":"Nice special effects, nice video and sound quality, and whole bunch of people I didn't care about by the end of the flick.

It's been completely cut out in this version!!! That's like remaking Casablanca without the 'Here's looking at you. kid' scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Apart from the opening 10 minutes and the last 5 minutes, this was the worst war film I have ever seen.tedious, lame and uninspiring with an overemotional endingjust a story about a handful of GIs arguing with each other in the French countrysideOver rated and an insult to all veterans"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I thought it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. It shows you exactly what happened at Omaha Beach on D-Day and everything is so realistic. It was the best movie and filled with everything that a perfect war movie needs...Guts, explosions, the whole bit. I just have one question to the people who know the characters names in real-life, does anyone know the name of the sniper in the movie?? You know, the one who prayed before he killed a man?? I thought it was Alex Winters, but the review that is especially for the movie says his name is Barry Pepper. So mail me if you know his name!"},{"rating":"2","title":"tearjerker","review":"Spielberg succeeds triumphantly with this epic World War Two story of a platoon of eight men with a mission: risk their lives to save one person. It displays how precious human life really is. If you're going to buy this, make sure you have plenty of Kleenex because you'll be crying your eyes out from the realism of this war drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I don't think anyone can deny that this film is very good and those who try either offended by the violence or are simply swept up in the backlash. The Normandy Invasion is fantastic. However, all this film boils down to is a simple war film with a simple message: to remember what these kids died for and to earn it by living a good life. Also, Spielberg uses every old tactic in movie making to make us feel for these artificially contrived characters. This film is good, but artificial characters with great special effects can only take a movie so far. For the best movie of the decade, and maybe ever made, watch The Thin Red Line (I don't say this to compare the films though because in fact I think they complement one another)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very haunting - a mature, intelligent account of WWII","review":"Saving Private Ryan shows World War II without political motives, mindless satire, or senseless violence. Yes, it is the most violent movie I've ever seen, but June 6, 1944 was a very bloody day, and Spielberg showed us just how gory. I always knew, factually, that war was an abomination, but now my heart truly breaks when I think of the service of those in the Armed Forces, and cringe with anger at those who take freedom for granted. This movie can change you - you understand the fear and anxienty when young men in battle scream for their mothers at the top of their lungs. You feel the emotions of the soldiers and understand their bewilderment, as well as subdued but apprehensive composure in wartime. Thousands of soldiers suffer death in battle, and thousands more, like Private James Ryan, suffer in life with survivor's guilt. This is a powerful movie - no American should be allowed to vote on election day without seeing this movie first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get over yourselves.","review":"Let's get one thing straight right here, the only reason that this movie was written is to earn some quick oscars. I'll admit that the opening and closing battle scenes were amazingly done, but the middle overall did a terriffic job of sucking a** that the only one to blame is that screenwriter Robert Rodat, who should be knee-capped."},{"rating":"1","title":"30 Minutes of Action.","review":"As i refer in the topic, SPR it's only 30 minutes of the D-Day. The rest of the movie looks like American patriotism that is used in too many movies. An exception is The Longest Day that shows how the war really is. You don't really need to see the two movies, just look to the name of them and you understand what i'm saying."},{"rating":"1","title":"The great man-child goes to war","review":"Evryones favorite man-child brings us his bizarre take on World War 2 and its not pretty. OK let me get this straight it was a WORLD war right. Apparently through my schooling i have been terribly lied to. I had no idea Americans single handidly won the war. And boy those Germans are some real cut ups. Mickey Mouse, Betty Grable what gams! Are you not listening to the campy B-movie dialogue in this god awful film? Speilberg needs to stop milking serious events for his own profit. Speilberg the savior of human kind. He's so caring. The Color Purple, Schindlers list, and now this. We must immediatly begin building of a spielberg temple, statues must be erected in his honor for all that he's done for us. He deserves a real pat on the back."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a convenient formula","review":"The more I think about it the more I realize how bad, if not insulting, this movie is. It seems to me like Steven is merely following an unoriginal formula to make big bucks and win academy awards. Look at the facts. He gets a mega-star, Tom Hanks, to play the lead role, then he gets teen-heart-throb Matt Damon to play private Ryan. Then he makes an ultra violent war movie were OF COURSE the audience will feel moved. Other than that this movie has very little else to offer. My dad is a veteran, and I find this movie insulting because it is obviously profiting from really horrible events. It made me sick to my stomach. Other than that I must admit this film does do a good job of showing the horror of war, and by writing this review I abosoIutly mean no disrespect to the troops that served our country in WWII."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film is fine, as long as you're American","review":"For those reviewers who think this film is a masterpiece, I urge you to consider one thing:IF YOU WATCHED THIS FILM, HOW INSULTED WOULD YOU BE IF YOU WERE GERMAN?We perpetuate stereotypes. We embrace jingoism. Have we really learned anything from the terrible atrocity known as war?"},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding","review":"The pure thought and images I saw and felt were unsupassed with brillance. A grand story which made me feel as if I was there at Omaha Beach.

A \\"must see\\" for everyone!","review":"This is an outstanding depiction of war and combat combined with a heartwarming act of decency in an otherwise not so pleasant situation. The special effects are so real it actually FEELS like you're there. There's no holds barred for displaying the brutality of war either. The first 20 minutes should be required viewing for every high school history class to show our young people the horrors of war so they may try harder to prevent it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great movie but this probably couldn't happen","review":"This movie is awesome. The second scence opens up with Omaha Beach where the speical effects are awesome yet terrifying: a man picking up his arm that blew off, a man sitting with his guts hanging out crying for his mother, a mans face being taken off. After this Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks) and a group of his company are sent to go find Private Ryan to send him home since all his brothers are dead. Would this happen, I doubt a group of men would be sent to find somebody before their units close to the person, but who knows.The group of men go through the hedgerows, and of course encounter Germans. The scence with the prisoner is amazing. When they find Private Ryan there is an awesome, but yet again terrifying fight.The acting in this is great, and the guest stars in it were awesome, one is Ted Dawnson from Cheers. This is a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie","review":"I'm a WWII history buff.

I felt that the movie was not a hollywood version of war, but a real version of what war is really like and very capable of being. Being a veteran myself, I hope no other person is to go through hell like what I or on the beach in the movie. As one reviewer did say \\"I too believe that this movie should be viewed by all recruits at all boot or basic training depots\\" so that war is not glorified as a necessary evil to live."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this movie, it's my favorite!","review":"This movie is one of my favorites. I've seen a lot of movies, but this one is best. There is a lot of blood and gore, but if you can handle that and are into WWII, you'll love this movie! It's action packed from beginning to end and has many good actors, including Tom Hanks. The characters are great, too. There are some very tense moments, and the movie makes you feel like you're on \\"Omaha\\" beach, or in a small town in France called \\"Vierville\\". The only part of the film that takes place on D-day is near the beginning on Omaha beach, so it magnifies the fighting that took place in the streets and in the fields of Normandy. A masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am proud to be Virginian","review":"I read more into the real shocking history of the Omaha Beach battle after seeing the movie. I found out that the men in the first wave of the attack were in the 116th Regiment of the 29th Division. They were almost all Virginians. Boys from my state. People who used to live where I live today. They were the first to hit the beach and the first to die. I don't have any grandparents who landed in Normandy, but I honor those of us who half a century ago gave their lives so we could live ours free. I hope more people will take the time to read more into the history of D-Day after they see the film. I hope the movie will win the state of Virginia some national recognition."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie on D-Day .","review":"I saw the movie before I visited Normandy and it really made my trip a special one.I think every person should see it.After visiting OMAH BEACH I feel it was a miracle that we were able to even get men ashore.Every man that landed or jumped into Normandy is a HERO.The GOOD LORD was sure with us on June 6 1944."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must own","review":"I first rented this DVD and now feel I must own it.

Everything Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg touch is gold. The cinematography is wonderful and the action scenes are very realistic. Spielberg takes great care to develop some meaningful characters. Some 2 and a half to 3 hour movies can get pretty painful to watch, but Saving Private Ryan leaves you wanting more. Fortunately, there's always the epic series Band of Brothers to satisfy that fix."},{"rating":"2","title":"I may be young, but I know about D-Day","review":"And this film is such an accurate depiction of the carnage of \\"Double-ya Double-ya Two\\" that one has to wonder how Steven Spielberg could sleep while directing such an emotional film. My grandpa even got emotional from it, and he laughed at Thin Red Line (which did stink, really badly...)! The one quip I have about this film is that it couldn't be any more unoriginal if it TRIED to be. Yes, the D-Day scene is graphic and accurate...but that's one of the few remotely unique parts of the film. Personally, I believe that this movie is mainly just that, a movie. It's never going to be a masterpiece because it just doesn't lend itself to it. Platoon and Full Metal Jacket took place in the same war, but at least they had a different story and meaning to them. There are so many WWII movies out there (albiet, not as graphic...) and I don't think this is the greatest one of them. (Schindler's list was better!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spielberg Makes No Good War Film","review":"Special effects are not everything for a film. Especially for a war film.

The plot line; however, is tenuous at best. Putting that aside, it is a film that entertains; holds the viewer's interest, and is a tribute to those who gave their lives to end that horror which was so much a part of my childhood.Mr. Spielberg has given us another of his master-works. Tom Hanks and the supporting cast make it all very believable as a reminder to something that effected the lives of millions, andshould never be forgotten.Best of all it is entertainment at its best; the reason I watchmovies in the first place. This Special Edition contains enough extra material to support all of the above. Bravo Mr. Spielberg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steven Spielberg saves another atrocious movie.","review":"If one were to edit out the opening and closing scenes(the opening for sure, it was done just for shocks) this would easily be the worst war movies ever.

Sure, war is horrible and it was depicted here truthfully, that's why I gave it 2 stars, but if anyone else had directed it, you would be inclined to agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably as realistic as Hollywood will get","review":"I remember when this movie was released, the media went on about how gory, gritty and realistic the opening Omaha Beach scene was. I don't know how realistic it was (I've never seen combat), but watching that scene made it hit home with me that war is not a Nintendo game, like many young people might think. After that, the action drags at times, but this remains one of my favorite movies.

It wants to be a powerful statement about the horrors of war, and a moving tribute to the men who fought and died in WWII, and a really cool war movie with lots of cool battle scenes. Needless to say, the final result fails to really coalesce into a coherent whole. As in most Spielberg films, the material points one way, and Spielberg goes in another.But Spielberg loads on the HIGH SIGNIFICANCE at every turn, and when all else fails, the music swells dramatically to remind us to start crying.

However, I was extreamly let down. This movie, though gritty and unpleasent, does nothing BUT glorify war. It shows you that to be a \\"hero\\" you must brutally murder others who are in the same awful position as you. I know that this view is unpopular, but I couldn't care less.

That should be enough for all of us to make a promise to ourselves to personally thank as many vets as we can for serving to keep us free. War is no walk in the park, and this movie comes closest to capturing just how close to hell it really is. This movie teaches a lot about sacrifice, courage, heroism, and emotion. Sometimes there are causes greater than our own selves which are worth sacrificing for. A great movie for this era.

Sound is also excellent on my 3D stereo system--not quite Dolby Surround, but close.As for washed out colors, you may be referring to the high contrast the film was shot in. That was normal. Some scenes have a \\"heavenly\\" glow in them for a purpose. I think they used a high shutter speed also because some explosions look similar to cam-corders using high shutter speed.I believe the Widescreen Edition is a must. It is in 1.85:1 ratio which isn't much different than full 4x3 (1.33:1) ratio of Pan & Scan. I don't understand people who don't like widecreen. It's the WHOLE picture! In Pan & Scan you're missing a great deal of the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saving Private Ryan","review":"Good technical, realistic opening. Unfortunately the WW II story of the average soldier is lost in the quote We gotta save a kid! end quote heart-warmer. D-day was the story of thousands who risked everything and sometimes sacrificed all for their fellow servicemen. This Ryan vignette is a sideline for the non-hardcore (who seem to often love the opening sequence, oddly.) See The Longest Day for the overall story. It is THE movie that the current generation don't believe was ever made. Then tell me about how Hollywood used to quote glorify end quote war!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no DTS?","review":"The best thing to commemorate about this movie was the awesome sound editing.

Watching this film made me lose all respect (not that I had any to begin with) for Spielberg and Hanks. I can't believe they said Monty was overrated. He was the best allied commander of the war. Typical Yanks, taking all the credit for themselves.The only reason Monty took his time moving on Caen was because the British and Canadians had to take on the Elite of the German army, including SS Panzer divisions. The U.S. soldiers only had to fight the normal army. It's more American propaganda, making themselves look like the best when that is not the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"d day","review":"saving private ryan is one of the best movies ever made.

The problem is simple: the movie is just too damn long. I'll give credit to Spielberg for reinventing how battle scenes are filmed, but the story is really lacking. Tom Hanks is probably the most overrated actor of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the directors commentary?","review":"I'm filled with mixed feelings. I am incredibly happy that they are going to put out a DVD of this wonderful movie, and I am equally joyful at the fact that they've taken time to put in documentaries, featurettes, and such.....BUT...where's Spielberg's commentary? I know that i should be satisfied with what we get, but just imagine what insight a commentary could have provided! They could have put Spielberg, Hanks, and maybe Januz Kaminski on the disk with a feature length commentary! Darn! Oh well. Don't get me wrong, It's not that I'm not satisfied with this DVD. Far from it. It's just that I've been hoping for a Spielberg commentary for a long time, and i was hoping it would appear on this disk. Too Bad. But hey, i would've been happy with the DVD even with NO extra stuff, so i shouldn't be whining! Well, i guess beggars can't be choosers..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"The movie \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" was on of the best war movies that I have ever seen. This movie takes you to the heart of the moment where soilders came face-to-face with what they had been traing for. Steven Speilberg instead of making a movie where it gave you the idea the soilders never suffered, it showed you the pain that they went through. It showed that they wanted anything from their mothers to a cigarette. The actors in this movie did a wonderful job making it as realistic as possible. The deaths of Caparzo(Vin Diesel), Medic Wade(Giovanni Ribisi), Jackson(Barry Pepper), Mellish(Adam Goldberg), Horvath(Tom Sizemore) and Miller(Tom Hanks) was terribly tear jerking. These men gave their lives for some stranger. I might only be 18 but after seeing that movie I don't take life for granted anymore. I say the movie \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" is the best and anyone who disagrees please don't try and ruin it for the rest of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saving Private Ryan (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)","review":"Saving Private Ryan (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)Great War story turned cinema depiction.

For once an un dramatized view of war is offered in this film. This film is so effective, because it forces the audience to abdon their innocence just like those young men who fought in the Second World War did repectively. Tom Hanks gives a great acting performance, but he feels out of place in a war movie.The best performance of the movie is that of Matt Damon as Private Ryan. In this role, he plays a wide-eyed young man who is thrust into a fight for his life and for freedom. In this he symbolizes so many like him in the era. Anyway, this movie along with The Thin Red Line are the best contemporary films on the Second World War, and I would recommend either to anyone wanting to be sobered by the true, unromanticized nature of war."},{"rating":"2","title":"These men went through Hell and back!","review":"This is a great movie that everybody needs to see. This movie is unquestionably timeless. These men fought for our freedon and now 40 years later we still have freedom. Every American needs to own and watch this and pass it on for generations to come. Okay about the movie if you're young and just now discovering private ryan you can learn more about WWII than anything hollywood has to offer. Tom Hanks Steven Steilberg together again do a realistic job of potraying WWII. The story line is great. I couldnt ask for more. I was really impressed.-private crisler"},{"rating":"2","title":"TERRIFIC MOVIE IN EVERY WAY.","review":"This movie sent a chill up my spine in the opening scene.

Its battle scenes are realistically frightening, and will make a pacifist out of anyone for at least a few hours afterward. My only complaint is that the first 15 minutes make you believe that the entire movie will continue to be a war movie. Technically, it is because we're at war throughout the entire film, but the movie wanders a bit, sometimes becoming too slow to keep your mind from wandering as well. It's as if Spielberg couldn't decide exactly what type of movie he wanted to make. As far as the rest of the film goes, the character's stories are believable and compelling, except for (ironically) Ryan himself but I wish the film was able to retain the same intensity as when it began. However, in the long run, it's a well put-together piece of filmmaking that will certainly change your views about WW2 & war in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"dvd sound not as good as laser disc format","review":"The documentary style cinematography, the absence of hollywood-style bravado, and the graphic content of this film make for a chilling experience that makes for many redundancies in the reviews. It is an awesome movie and deserves all the credit it receives. It may, however, be too disturbing to watch many times. As for the format of this masterpiece, DVD shows much promise from its transfer of its documentary-like hues and tones (although being color blind hinders accuracy); however, the sound through a Denon DTS/Dolby receiver wasn't as earth shaking as the Laser Disc version (yes I still have one of those clunkers)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saving Private Ryan","review":"Special Effects Rock.

You can find them on the Internet even though you can't see them on Amazon anymore unless you go to the Listmania lists and find one with Mystikats on it. They're like Bratz except they have cat ears and tails and they look more like anime characters than Bratz. Their lips and feet are like Bratz and their eyes are the same shape but they have ears and tails and their taller. My friends and I play with them and we're in sixth and seventh grade!

Although it claims to cover most two-stage snow blowers, it could not cover my Yardman snow thrower. I purchased a MTD snow thrower cover which was the right size. The Classic didn't go to waste as I used it on my gas power-washer.Having forgotten about the size issue, I purchased the second one with the intention of covering my Troybilt chipper-shredder, which is roughly the same dimensions as a two stage snow thrower. Once again it was too small, and I ended up purchasing a second MTD cover which did the job. I guess I'll use this Classic to cover stacked lawn chairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased so far...","review":"I purchased a cover for my tractor, and was very pleased, so I ended up purchasing this one. While being a lighter weight than my tractor cover, I found this to still be sufficient for my snow blower. My biggest concern was whether it would fit, and luckily, it did - perfectly. I have an Ariens 824, and this cover fits like a glove. It's snug, so I'm a little concerned about it catching on something and tearing at some point, but I won't be taking it off/on too often, so hopefully that's not an issue.It's summer here, and with the snowblower under my deck, I don't expect too much weathering. Come winter, we'll see how it handles the cold/snow.

Far better than all of the name brand rotary blades out there. However, this foil is too fragile in my estimation. I have had to replace at least once a year because of cracks in the foil. If you hit the head of the shaver on anything, it will crack the foil and you end up spending $20 for a replacement. And the plastic guard that protects it does not stay on the head very securely. Pops off too easily and the tabs on the sides of the plastic protector break off too easily.

The story is centered around the accidental death of the wife and mother of a well-to-do ranch family.

The bulk of the story happens in Mexico, where the son now lives and has a highly successful career as a painter -- that career provides another point of stress between father and son.The father travels to Mexico to try to help his son when the son is involved in another car accident, this one a hit-and-run resulting in another death.I enjoyed this Hallmark offering greatly, but for me it's a half-step down from other Hallmark movies like \\"Sarah, Plain and Tall,\\" \\"The Love Letter,\\" or \\"Decoration Day.\\"Definitely a solid 4-star offering.

There is a real pathological hatred of women that plays out in Slim's foul treatment of his prostitutes. Homo-eroticism abounds in Slim's relationships with other, especially more senior pimps. Slim rots in confinement for some time, and guess what, he doesn't enjoy it. This story is good antidote to the pervasive and unambiguous sexuality that gets portrayed on the rap videos (at least, it was when I last watched one in the mid 90's), which ignore the truly aberrent aspects to the lifestyle that gets shamelessly glorified."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"People don't be fooled by this book. It's total fiction!!! If you read the in the very beginning of the book(the third page). It says \\"This is a work of fiction, all the names and places are fictitious\\".

Anyone who tries to sell you the game is trying to put a \\"Murphy\\" on you, just like Iceberg describes in the beginning of this book. You want to be a pimp?? Go out on the street and get some game. Like that other reviewer said, the only pimping that will be had from reading this book will be on the streets of Palo Alto and San Jose. I am a true hustler and one of the greatest pimps ever to step foot in California so take it from me: Iceberg is a square and was never ever in the pimp game. This book is funny stuff because everything in it is so wrong and untruthful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Influencing a generation","review":"There haven't been many writers who can stand up as having influenced a generation. Iceberg Slim's 'Pimp', has been an inspiration to young, poor people the world over. It tells the story of one man's obsession with the pimp game, and how such a life can be at once as rewarding as it is darkly terrible and destructive. Iceberg's characteristic writing style puts the reader on the street so that he can feel, hear and smell the corruption and violence. It shows the stark, unromanticised reality of street life and how, if you've got the strength, you can pull yourself out of it. This is a truly rivetting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was ok","review":"You people speak of this book as if it were Faulkner or Joyce or someone like that. It was ok, not great.

Several of the tactics used in this book are out dated, and no one should go out trying to be a pimp today using iceberg's strategy derived from this writing, however the way this book was writtne is what makes it a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not convinced","review":"Sorry, but a lot of this book sounds made up and even the writing style appears to be mostly an affectation on the part of the writer.

It gives the reader an inside look at the underworld of hustling. Also, the book gives the reader a chance to see the \\"human side\\", (or just like everyone else side) of someone who had become a pimp. The book does this by telling the story of Robert Beck's childhood and how he was an excellent student, although he really never applied himself, for long, to anything that could be considered \\"constructive\\". The interesting thing to me is how often he liked to read. The vernacular of \\"The Life\\", was interesting along with the relationship of the pimp and the whore. There was sort of a sense that a hustler had to be alert at all times, even though they are often abusing a drug to controll their anxiety. This was a very entertaining book. Robert Beck was fortunate to live long enough to tell his story before it claimed him as it has claimed so many others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Beck is incredibly articulate and passionate.","review":"The author is quite descriptive. He paints not only the story but the enviroment and feelings in a manner that puts you there with him as he's telling the story. Someone told me that they learned a lot about women from reading this book. I'll agree! Some negative but some positive. It did reflect various types of women, their different reactions to the same situations, and his mind set and persuasive tactics toward women. I'd recommend it to anyone who needs to be brought down to earth for a bit of reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"you cant put it down","review":"THIS BOOK RIGHT HERE IS THE BEST THING TO HIT THE BOOKSTORE.

Unfortunately, this one isn't one of them. If this book was a set of new ideas or even just compilation of other works it would have been pretty good.Sadly, this book just serves as one big advertisement of all of his other products, such as his board game, which he dedicates almost a full chapter for advertising it.

He talks about how he bought his dream car while being homeless. Ok then, how did Robert make the monthly payment? Why would he be stupid enough to sleep in a Porsch as a bum? This guy is such a liar and is trying to con the masses. He is a conman and a good one. Thats why hes a motivational speaker. It takes a good speaker to con you out of your hard earned money.

She often uses daydreams to escape the harsh realities of her being, and she has a warm good nature. A scene in the movie that is priceless is when Precious introduces John the male nurse (Lenny Kravitz) to the school receptionist, who is constantly frustrated by relationships, and she drops the phone the moment she lays eyes on John.

Lee Daniels uses visual pastiche to fill the screen with powerful images and powerful emotions. He blends a documentary style with choice editing in the carefully planned sequences that shows us just enough of the violence and horrors of this young woman's life, without indulging in the details.

I mean she told the social worker about some stuff going on in her house and her mom finds out and gets mad which is why they get in a fight. Tell me why is she still living there when she tells a social worker she has a kid by her dad? Also in the end the social worker just gets up and leaves after talking to Precious' mom. I'm thinking to myself why isn't CPS doing their job? Why wasn't she put in a better home sooner?Also, I don't really feel like Precious' character exhibited much of the characteristics of someone going through that much abuse.

Yet it was Joab who brilliantly led Israel's armies, it was he who was the king's confidant; only he had the courage to go against David's express commands and carry out the terrible killings of public figures so necessary to the kingdom's safety. Joab anticipated his cousin at every turn, often earning public reprimand in return; for David, Joab even sacrificed his beloved Reba, and his own son. Why? Because David was the anointed of the Lord.Sweeping in scope and conception, The Unanointed introduces an extraordinary writing talent.

A good cast, including a deliciously villainous Robert Duvall unfortunately fail to lift this picture above mediocrity. Add to this, it's relatively short running time (just under 90 minutes), fans of the genre, and Clint (who have been spoiled by great movies before) will feel a little let down. It's probably fair to say that a lesser known cast, and director wouldn't even have got this movie off the cutting room floor. All this said, any Clint collector will probably want it in his/her collection, and the usual amount of dry humor, and Eastwoodesque rationality does make this watchable, if not that memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"Despite a cast headed by Clint Eastwood and Robert Duvall, and the presence of John Sturges (\\"Bad Day at Black Rock,\\" \\"The Great Escape\\") behind the camera, \\"Joe Kidd\\" is almost instantly forgettable. The first fifteen minutes show promise, suggesting that this might be another offbeat Eastwood western, but it soon dissipates into boredom and predictability with the accent on the former. A major disappointment (especially coming only months after the release of \\"Dirty Harry\\") and one of Eastwood's worst films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor adaption of a campy show","review":"I wasn't a fan of the original Lost In Space television show, but the movie looked descent. I was dead wrong. The film, written by the writer of Batman and Robin, is one of the worst I've personally ever heard. Not only that, the acting was poor, Gary Oldman is great actor but this is one of his worst performances. I seriously recommend avoiding this film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Standard Clint.","review":"Standard Clint. what else do i need to say.

Key scenes are missing, and until they release a version that has the whole movie, I recommend staying away from this on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Screenplay to \\"Joe Kidd\\"is similar to Leonard's Novel \\" The Moonshine War\\"","review":"Was Elmore Leonard's screenplay for \\"Joe Kidd\\" an adaptation of his1969 novel,\\"The Moonshine War\\"? I had believed this to be the case because the plots in both of Leonard's works are very similar,the onlydifference being in both cases the historical periods & land reform vs.pure Kentucky moonshine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of my favorites, but a good performance by Duvall","review":"Joe Kidd is not one of my favorite Eastern westerners (and Eastwood is my favorite, hands down, when it comes to films, and the Western is my favorite genre), but it does feature a good performance by Robert Duvall as the heavy. Clint's character is a little too reigned in in this one for my taste, until at the end he runs a steam engine through the town in order to extract some vengeance from Duvall's baddie.A good supporting cast (as is typical in an Eastwood flick), also featuring John Saxon and Don Stroud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing too much","review":"I, too, am disappointed they excluded the most important parts to this movie/storyline, Joe Kidd's growing suspicion he's signed on with the devil, as in the missing supper shots in the mountain cabin, and again with his romantic interest with Helen Sanchez, and her growing resentment with Luis Chama, as expressed in the copse of trees AFTER he disappoints her on the mountain. This causes major discontinuities. With plenty of room left on this DVD, it should have been easily retained. This print looks like it came out of the cuts they made for late night TV where they would fill two hour time slots with a minimum of 30 minutes of commercials, and any movie over one and a half hours would be trimmed at the engineers will. Too bad they couldn't find the original... or is that going to come on the \\"Platinum Collection\\"...."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"I love this movie,---just another \\"Eastwood\\" classic!!The best part is it comes with 2 other \\"Eastwood\\"classics \\"HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER\\"=\\"2 MULES 4 SISTER SARA\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it.","review":"I like the lighter, very good quality , the color and feel is real nice, it fits as a collector item"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the read","review":"while I agree with some of the previous reviews that Petroski may overstate and repeat a little bit, this book is an excellent in depth look at the invention process as practiced by many people in parallel and in concert.If you have any interest in Industrial Design, Interaction Design or just trivia for how object evolve this is a great read and Petroski surely knows his stuff.I don't agree with some who call it too academic, the text is in depth, but not dry. It is not breazy or flip either...Just right*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile Reading","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was fascinating to learn how so many things came about. I enjoyed the history and the anecdotes and in-depth analysis of each topic.I found it inspirational in many places. The creative artisan not only perfects his skills but looks beyond the routine to develop improved tools and processes. I read many passages to my kids.I was dismayed when the author started writing about forks again when I thought we were all done with forks until I noticed the way the book is broken out by ideas and concepts rather than the specific examples. I think this is probably the most well-organized book I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book in the weak design theory bibliography","review":"Ok, although it's true this book has very few illustrations, I strongly recommend it to industrial designers. Even if Petroski can't forget his engineer point of view, he has written good material here. After reading Donald Norman, you should give this book a try. (Ok, and after Giedion, Munari, Alexander, etc)... but do read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"an over elaborated dull story","review":"There is a lot of interesting information and many good insights buried in this book.

Instead I read about how and why inventors invent new things. Although this is somewhat interesting, the book has not been work the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting look at the development of everyday objects","review":"Things get improved because in their current form, they do not work properly. Henry Petroski's book, The Evolution of Useful Things, traces the development of objects in our everyday life, including detailed histories of the development of the staple, the zipper, silverware, and hand tools. The book is interesting, although Petroski does tend to shy away from offering a theory of development, and instead offers a conjectures about how things might have developed. He explains, but he does not offer a theory or an argument that explains everything. Overall, though, a goos book, well researched, well illustrated, and interesting on many levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delivers less than promised","review":"Mr. Petroski labors at too much length to describe how several common items became what they are today as a result of the design process and subsequent evolution as a result of engineers' continual desires for improvment. This exercise is less successful than earlier works which focused on the engineering process and used infrastructure projects such as buildings and bridges for examples.Lay readers, and even engineers, would be better served by reading \\"Remaking the World\\" or \\"To Engineer Is Human\\" which provide more insight into the engineering process and which are more relevant and connected to the common structures and objects that we take for granted every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Slow to ship","review":"I bought this needing to work on a project. It took almost 3 weeks to arrive after paying for expedited shipping. Needless to say I had to use something else and ended up just put it in the refrigerator for the next project because we couldnt wait anymore and were under deadline. Hopefully it will hold up and can be used next time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"One of the least useful textbooks I've ever read; I learned next to nothing from it. It's very poorly written, in very confusing style. Samples are placed several pages away from where they are referred to. As another reviewer stated, the authors don't explain much of anything -- it's like watching an expert accountant quickly burn through his work, then ask you if you understood everything you saw him do. The problems aren't very enlightening, either: instead of focusing on building up the basics, they seem to prefer to focus on special cases, so you're thoroughly confused about what to do in the normal case.Yes, there are good reviews, but notice that two are commenting only on shipping speed, and the other was from a guy trying to sell his copy. I won't inflict my copy on anyone else, because I'd rather destroy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst text book ever","review":"It is a very detail oriented book and you have to read every single sentence. Everything is stated, not much is explained. The reader gets lost in all the statements and tables. The probelms are annoying and like playing meaningless puzzles. One gets the feeling that the authors want to trick you rather than effectively teach the material.I wish the authors would have explained all the concepts step by step, but they go over the material again and again in a spiral fashion. I find this approach rather confusing and would have hoped for a more gradual approach of logically building up knowledge.If you are a detail oriented person you might like this book, but if you are a grand-picture thinker you get terribly lost. The storyline is missing.I find this book one of the hardest books to follow. I can read general relativity books and solve Einstein's equations, but the way the material is presented here makes Einstein's work sound really easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I'm using this book during my MBA, it is a required lecture. I will put it very simple:1.- It is confusing, the structure makes difficult to follow the examples which are located in several places.2.- Very congested; I'm a visual learner and all the examples and solutions are narrated, not graphically described. like a, b, c.3.- The solutions to the proposed excersices are not included in the book4.- The paper used is shiny which causes glare when reading it, I have to find a good position when reading for a long time.For me this was my first exposure to accounting, and I used this book only because my University charged the price and used it as the main text. I ended looking for other authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most useless textbook ever","review":"I do not understand why instructors use this textbook. It seems as if the writers of the text and the writers of the problems have nothing to do with each other because the problems focus on topics that were never covered in the text. The problems also seem to focus on things that have no meaning. I learned more from an online Harvard Business School tutorial on accounting than I learned from this textbook. It is just god awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer Service is Terrible","review":"I ordered 3 books for my MBA and AMAZON managed to lose the package 2x. I will admit the prices were right and spot on. The orginal shipment was lost and I asked for a reshipment. That was sent and lost as well. I recieved the books 2x after both shipments were found. I was meet with excuses such as, I am sorry that person is not here it is the weekend or I am sorry we can not send you another shipment. I told them I did not lose the shipments they did. They did not seem to care. Also after the books finally came I recieved a phone call within 24 hours telling me to send them back or I will be charged. I told them they were lost and I only just got them. This did not seem to phase them.I am not sure I will use Amazon ever again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with the other reviewers, this book is awful","review":"This book is hands down one of the worst textbooks I have ever tried to read. I'd more monotonous that reading a foreign dictionary that you don't understand and just as unintelligible.I am incredibly disappointed in my professors for using this book as part of their class as it has done nothing to aid my confusion and everything to worsen it.I'm sorry for anyone who tries to read this. The authors should be ashamed of themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Book","review":"This is a decent book. It is mostly well written and full of practical examples. In fairness, if you are looking for a book that you can extract the material without reading the text (handbook style) than this isn't it. The authors organize the book in a unique way. They discuss financial reports in some detail and then reiterate the reports in individual chapters. At first it was frustratingly redundant; however, it was also an effective organization for thoroughly learning the material."},{"rating":"1","title":"worse book i have ever used","review":"This book was absolutely terrible it is overly complex in no way easy to read. it literally makes everything more complicated. this book is worse than Hitler drowning puppies. i threw it off of my dorms roof halfway through the semester. the authors of this book should be absolutely ashamed of themselves. i deeply believe any person who picks up this book will hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I was so lost with this book and thought it was my lack of background knowledge in the topic that was causing all the confusion. Nope, even my friend who is a CPA was stumped by this book's explanations. If your prof insists on using this book get theSchaum's Guideline of Managerial Accountingstudy guide/outline. It will save your bacon and your GPA."},{"rating":"1","title":"steer clear","review":"Although extremely rigorous in definitions and concepts, definitely not the type of text book I would recommend for a MBA introductory accounting class. Steer clear.The structure is confusing, and the way it has been presented to me (by one of the authors) made it even more confusing. Only positive note are the problems at the end of each chapter, which are challenging enough and offer a good preparation even for the toughest tests.Previously, I had another intro accounting class in which Horngren/Harrison Financial Accounting Managerial was used. I have found this latter text book much clearer, to the point, concise."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good book for beginners","review":"the whole structure of the book is ot comprehensible. it gives out 3 financial statements at the first 3 chapters, without letting the readers to have time digest the concepts. after you are confused enough, the book will then introduce concepts of each items listed in the statements, and have you look back at the first three chapters.the layout is not good either. for some chapters, you need to turn the pages back and forth, again and again, because the text content and the illustration table are back to back.the book is just very confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used book in exceptionally poor condition","review":"Book was fine on the outside, but was exceptionally used on the inside. extensive highlighting in multiple colors, underlining, and answers written in, plus notes in pen in the margins."},{"rating":"1","title":"unclear, disorganized, vague language","review":"The title pretty much sums it up, I think this book is pretty bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This does not work well, at all, and it is the piece of junk I see at dollar stores.

I wear black dresses often for work and I can't stand lint on black clothing in any fashion. I bought this brush based on the reviews and I like it. It's removes most of the lint from my dresses and other clothing. It does tug a bit at the clothing as you're brushing which I didn't care for, now I just use shorter brush strokes. It works for the most part and was a good purchase, however I feel I still need an adhesive roller for the stubborn lint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"Piece of crap.

On its FIRST use, the fabric part of the brush separated from the actual plastic holder. The fabric is not secure AT ALL. And it is pieced into the plastic holder, a separate piece on front and back, so that both sides can easily become separated from the holder. Never purchased something this useless before. To make matters worse, there was no way to re-attach the fabric back into the \\"teeth\\" of the holder, so it was tossed into the garbage.

Personally, I read Ms. Kallmaker's work because shedoes have a gift for prose. In Car Pool, she makes her characterstotally believable and their situations plausible. I have given herthe benefit of the doubt in the past; reading her stories voraciously;hoping her genre would become a bit more ethnically inclusive. Thelesbian character in Car Pool who is an Asian American is a fairstart. Unfortunately, black lesbians have (at worst) been absentor... at best, been marginalized in Ms.Kallmaker's writings. It isbeyond belief how such an obvious talent can also be so narrow andbackward in her thinking.

I eventually bought this book (a used copy) and although the book covers exactly the kind of stuff you want to learn about pairs trading, the writing is very poor and there are way too many places where the sentences don't make any sense, regardless of your math/stat background. This book is not a how-to book. It's a general treatise and not a good one at that. I cannot recommend this book. You may want to check out Tsay's financial time series analysis book which, although not specifically for pairs trading, has all the essential materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"If you want to become a pairs trader, you might want to find a quick primer. Unfortunately this book is not it. It's very poorly written and very confusing. While it does delve into much of the statistics you'll need to know to implement pairs trading stratgies, the coverage is neither sophisticated enough to allow you to start applying theory right away, nor simple enough for a non-math person to grasp easily. The book does not serve any practical purposes.

Brady, a former Marine officer, captures the daring of the Marines as they use their initiative under difficult and changing circumstances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning of War","review":"A novel, which challenges the reader to sift military fact from pure fiction. For instance, Captain Billy Port's \\"relentless pursuer\\" Colonel Jessie Irabu of the Imperial Japanese Marines lifted a .50 caliber machine gun from a downed Zero fighter, and mounted the gun on the hood of his scout car. The problem with that is the Japanese A6M Zero was not armed with .50 caliber machine guns, but two 20 MM cannons and two 7.7 MM machine guns. In contrast, the authors description of the 4th Marines marching out of Shanghai to leave China was well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst","review":"This is one of the worst examples of the war genre I have read. I spent almost 30 years in the military, and we were continuously taught to keep our writing at the 5th grade level so that everyone could understand. I think Mr. Brady took this to heart - repetition does not make good reading and the book seems to concentrate on making sure we understand what First Sergeant's do. The characters lack reality, and it appears the author is hoping to sell this work as a movie. I was completely disappointed, and find it hard to believe a senior Marine Corps General Officer endorsed this drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"God Bless Chesty Puller and the United States Marines...","review":"This novel surprised me from start to finish. Its rare that one finds so many elements of a great novel within the pages of a single book. Warning of War is well written and so detailed, it could easily pass for non-fiction if the reader wasn't aware that it was a novel.The characters are well developed, believable, and true-to-life. Federales is a great example of a 1940's era marine squad leader and 'Top,' the link between Port and the enlisted men, adds perspective, especially to the battle scenes. Another great character is the priest, dubbed 'padre' by the marines. There are many fine characters in this novel but they are all distinguishable and unique, a testament to the author's skill in writing.This novel is entertaining.

While it contains much interesting science that is generally well presented, virually all of their main points rely very significantly on speculation well beyond what is well established science. Mankind's knowledge of processes such as the formation of Earth-like planets and especially the evolution of complex life forms is so poor that we can only observe what happened in our own system. Ward and Brownlee jump to the conclusion that complex life could only form in systems with histories very like out own, but in fact, they (as well as other scientists) really don't have any idea what is required for complex life to develop. Perhaps it would not sell so many books, but I would certainly rate the book more highly if the authors could be more honest about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopefully, this book and its theories are now extinct . . .","review":"This book was assigned reading taking AST 248: Search for Life in the Universe at Stony Brook University. Instead of a plausible, scientific look at the size of the universe and the possibility for life to exist on other planets, this book and the course I took, took an almost steadfast inferential view towards extraterrestrial life based solely on conclusions drawn from far too little evidence. I disagreed with the content of this book, most specifically the fact that planets within a stars habitable zone are rare (what proof do the authors offer?) and that for life to evolve it requires the same conditions that we see here on earth. I actually FAILED the class because I refused to subscribe to the theories (thankfully recently disproven) put forth by this book.I wonder if I should request a grade change 10 years later based on the false evidence put forth in this joke of an academic volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who knows?","review":"While this book is well written and very informative, what they authors have to say could be said in a dozen pages.

I almost think this could have been better presented to the non-scientist reader as a long magazine article rather than a full book.However, that is minor criticism; there were many intriguing ideas presented in this book. And I should really give it 5 stars -- the extra star awarded to the authors for debunking the ideas of that pompous populist, Carl Sagan (I can just hear him saying...\\"Only one civilization in the galaxy? NO! Billions and billions and billions...\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abundant microbial life can't evolve?

Rest easy Science Fiction writers; the book misses its own most significant conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, some scientists finally brave enough to break....","review":"the illogical Sagan paradigm.

Unfortunately, the book can easily be summarized in one sentence: life may be rare because Planet Earth may be rare. This simple statement may seem flippant, but the authors really offer no more conclusive information than this simple statement.The book does have some nice summaries of astrobiology, evolution, plate tectonics, snowball earth events, etc. If you are in the simple sciences (physics, astronomy, biology etc.), this book may provide a good read because there is a lot of theory but little real information.

I will always love Sean Connery as Bond, but Daniel Craig is now right behind him. I wasn't impressed with Pierce Brosnan's Bond, he was too ... prissy/weak to me.I really enjoyed watching Casino Royale, it was a very quick, hard movie to me. I did miss Q and the banter between Bond and Moneypenny, but it is early yet and I have a feeling they will be back. At least I hope they will be back. I do feel that the movie went by quickly.

Thankfully, the producers have gotten back to the basics - emphasizing realistic (comparatively) action with bits of humor rather than humor with bits of realistic action. Daniel Craig, who benefits from a great script, plays the role with a intensity, capturing Bond's character weakness - his ego - while also showing his wounded, vulnerable side. The opening sequence, featuring an athlete known for his pioneering \\"free running\\" technique in England, is among the best of the Bond series, setting just the right tone for the film. Eva Green does OK, but I think she is a terrible actress overall. I'm excited to see the next film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is good, but the DVD isn't worth a damn","review":"I would probably give it 4 stars just based on the movie alone, but the dvd sucks.It is nothing like the old MGM Bond dvd's, there are no commentaries, you pop the disc in and it starts playing...commercials...who made this, Disney? I don't want to sit through ten minutes of commercials, I hate that above all else. I know you can FF through them, but that's not the point. It ruins the feel that the old dvd's had. Why didn't they let the disc start up with the old \\"Activate\\" screen like the other Bond dvd's did? It all looked so Bondish, the activate screen and then the menus, playing Bond music in the background and scenes from the movies.

I still think the chase scene at the beginning is silly, but fun; but the rest of the film really engaged me. I believe the producers have made a very wise choice in both Daniel Craig, and how Bond is updated. The old bond seems as dated as watching the original Rat Pack in some of their films--- fun, and certainly reflective of the time, but very dated.

Granted, the first chase scene between Bond and whoever that guy with the knapsack was, did hold my attention.

While there are a couple of exciting chase scenes, I think the time spent on the chase scenes may have taken away from Bond's character development.

These movies always feel a lot longer than they actually are just because there's so much action- looks sharp in high definition- features great extras, if you're the type of person who watches those- a great addition to the James Bond legacyBAD- movie ends with somewhat of a cliffhanger that isn't resolved until Quantum of Solace- movie is a little light on the \\"gadgets\\" that most Bond fans love- the (spoiler alert!) torture scene was a bit awkward to watch- I'll always consider Pierce Brosnan \\"my Bond\\" so getting used to Daniel Craig will take a while"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Superb Remake","review":"Daniel Craig (next to Sean Connery) is the best Bond yet... this movie was more realistic than some of the past Bond flicks. It wasn't fillied with ridiculious gadgets and silly villans.The girls, once again, were up to the Bond standard, for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casino Royal","review":"Great Flick. THe extras on the DVD also a must for any serious Bond fan. Hail the new Bond - Daniel Craig."},{"rating":"2","title":"The new Bond is exciting new blood in a legendary franchise!","review":"The movie is impressive, and the disc is equally so, with fine picture, and very well done surround(I listened to the Dolby). The extras are not ample(compare to the mind-blowing pinnacle for extras:The Abyss-Special Edition!),but they are of impressive quality. 2/5 of the extras as well as the menu on the extras disc are in 16x9/widescreen, something of a rarity, in my experience! Having bought a budget widescreen HDTV last year, I find this detail significant and impressive. I don't know if this rates being a demo-disc, like 'The Fifth Element' was 8 years ago, but it might be, and so, I heartily recommend this set to every Bond fan and any action fan; you will NOT be disappointed! Because it truly is \\"Bond, James Bond\\", at its very best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I love this movie. Daniel Craig is the best James Bond ever. He is so cool and so tough. I want to watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"First time I have tried Amazon videos; would not download at all. I later found out from other family members, the same was true for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great re-launch for the franchise","review":"A bit darker than we have come to expect from Bond over the years, but a very satisfying thriller. Much like the recent Batman Begins, this film takes a tired franchise and re-starts it, portraying the very first mission of its hero. Daniel Craig is surprisingly good, and better than most, as Bond and Judy Dench is (as always) wonderful as M.And Bond fans will love the last line of the film.Can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Bond, Completely Revitalized and Renewed - Perfect on BluRay!","review":"This movie did for the James Bond franchise whatBatman Begins [Blu-ray] did for the \\"caped crusader\\". Totally revitalized for modern times, with all of the old schtick thrown out. Dark, brooding, sexy, artistic and cool. What a great film. The film is absolutely perfect on BluRay as well. The HD mastering is perfect, the sound mastering is flawless, and the extras are totally worth the price of purchase. Amongst the best of the best of Bond flicks. An absolute must for any Bond aficionado and highly recommended even for the casual Bond fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Bond is Crap","review":"The new Bond stinks. My first issue, we have a bond before he was a 007, yet he's in 2006 with a modern Aston Martin, modern Omega, and todays cash? M was taken over by Judy Dench with the coming of Brosnan, yet all of a sudden we just stuck her in a pre-Connery role? This makes no sense.There is no Q, no gadgets, no Money Penny, no whit, no sexual inneuendos, and terrible acting. All this guys got is either sad puppy dog eyes or a blank stare that is supposed to be intimidating. Half of the movie is either watching him run or watching him play cards, neither of which is very appealing or interesting. I didn't get to know his girl either, which makes it hard to care about her. I'm truly sad to see the death of all that is Bond."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth It!","review":"I was never a big fan of 007 movies. The last one I saw was with Roger Moore and I don't remember the title. I took a chance on this one because some friends said it was good.I really liked Casino Royale. Lots of good action. There were 3 times I thought the movie was over as if everything got taken care of by Bond then all of a sudden, there's another twist. The entire movie kept me interested and I'm glad I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Bond Movie","review":"I think it was the greatest comeback bond movie ever made, it has a new plot line and the director did a great job of showing it compare to the resent (good guy) bond movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine film","review":"It keeps your attention from start to finish. It was well written, well cast, directed and so forth. The first film can be seen alone but should be seen with the second one. I liked Casino Royale better than Quantum of Solace"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best 007 Yet!!!!!!!!","review":"I gotta admit, I am a 007 fanatic. I love the movies, and the stories. I think there is something cool about someone who works hard and plays hard all with some class. The movie does not rely upon ridiculous gadgets to grab your attention. Rather, Bond and his wits and brawn are what gets you drawn into the story. So unlike Pierce, Daniel is a Bond who can get everything done on his own as Bond. The villains are not ridiculous either. We aren't treated with some villain who received some new medical treatment to switch his nationality. No we have villains who are impressive, but not wholly unbelievable. The story is great, and even includes some betrayal of Bond and the brits. All in all, the movie does a good job of setting up Bond's development, as well as proving his worthiness as a hero. Good Job again for Bond!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new and improved kind of James Bond","review":"Daniel Craig delivers surprisingly good interpretation on James Bond. He is not afraid to create his own brand of Agent 007. You will not see him impersonate any of the previous takes on the famous spy. I like his looks. He is well built bur not pretty; he is handsome in the acquired taste kind of way. He cares not if his martini is shaken or stirred and we see him vulnerable both physically and emotionally for the first time. Fighting and running scenes in the movie are frighteningly fast and scary while love scenes more passionate than any of the other Bond movies before. One part of the film is supposedly set in Montenegro, but I am still confused if the scenes were actually shot in Montenegro, Czech Republic or Italy. International group of actors brings the right kind of chemistry into this film. Nothing too heavy and yet, very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"If you are looking for a exciting 007 movie, you will be very dissspointed. There is no action in movies but some stupid fights where Daniel Craig gets all beat up. Daniel is a fair actor but he is no way a James Bond, give me back Sean Connery, or even Roger Moore. Daniel Craig is NOT a convincing Bond, he even got rejected repeately by Evan Green (she is hot though). The ultimate was Daniel Craig was caught by his nemesis, got his cloths all riped off and tied naked to a chair. Then got tortured with a rope hammer hitting his posterior. Give me a break, this is not James Bond. It is SO embarrasing seeing James Bond tied naked and tortured. I give up.The movie has more twist than a Hitchcock movie but no action. James Bond gambling movie??? Come on, Bond never loses in a Casino.It deserves half a star for Evan Green being hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst 007 Movie Ever","review":"This was the worst Bond movie we have ever watched.

It's not the new guys fault,it's the story and lack of Bond like movie features(gadgets,etc). The \\"bad guy\\" is also really lame! Come on a leaky eye?! Too bad..hope the next one is more exciting and \\"Bond like\\"!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Bond in the long-running series","review":"Daniel Craig shows he belongs in the role of James Bond in this tale of banking, terrorists, and betrayal. He shows a good range of acting whether he is being the suave Secret Service agent, the tortured prisoner or the vulnerable lover. The movie contains the requisite chase scenes, fights, villains, and love scenes and Craig is the consummate Bond in all of them. There are not as many gadgets in this movie, nor is there the humor which permeated the earlier movies in the series, but Bond fans should still enjoy this latest in the long-running series based on the books by Ian Fleming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"A truly awful movie. Bond movies succeed when they have an elegant hero, with an understandable plot. This movie requires an understanding of stock market puts, which is hardly common knowledge. The heroine commits suicide for no apparent reason; granted, often the Bond girl dies, but usually by murder, not by suicide. Mindless, extend violence scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back Brosnan!","review":"I'll admit I went into this movie a bit biased; I had heard an interview with Pierce Brosnan where he said that the directors of Casino Royale had initially cast him in the Bond role, only to cut him halfway through and go with Daniel Craig. And as I am a huge Brosnan fan, I was very disappointed with the choice of Craig. I may be the only one to say this, but I just can't see Craig as Bond. I know the point was to get back to a more average-looking Bond, rather than a handsome Bond, and Craig is certainly not handsome to me!I nearly walked out partway through the movie because that's how much I didn't like it. To me, it was a $7.50 waste. I would have been better off seeing The Departed again instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Craig is a horrible Bond","review":"The Broccoli's, and now Sony, have been ruining this series since Goldfinger and now they have cast the worst possible choice to play Bond. Craig is so far removed from what Bond was meant to be it's painful, but what does it matter? Since 1964 these stories have not been true James Bond adventures, at least not what Ian Fleming had in mind. Now they cast the most ridiculous choice in Daniel Craig, a humorless, trailorpark thug (which he is good at and should stay) that looks absolutely ridiculous in a tuxedo and kissing the heroine. That's Bond?The producers have finally put a stake in the coffin of this legendary hero and the sad United States box office take for this film reflects that (Casino failed to have as high attendance as Brosnan's \\"Die Another Day\\" here in the States) Hopefully the studio will take this into consideration and bounce this sorry excuse for a spy out of here and try and finally do this series right(I'm not holding my breath)"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are a 007 fan, save your money!","review":"This was a complete disappointment. The director reduced James Bond to a brutish oaf devoid of finess. The actor portraying Bond did not pull it off. I saw the original when it was first released, and this strayed entirely too far off mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"James who?","review":"A good film - but not James Bond! More like Rambo with a love interest!Where are the gadgets? Where is Q? Where are the car chases? Where is the baddies lair? Where is the tongue-in-cheek humor?Sorry guys - you've forgotten the formula and this just doesn't work as a James Bond.No surprise then the DVD price has dropped to $9.99 in the USA or under 4 pounds in the UK. Relegated to the same depths as OHMSS with Lazenby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marlene","review":"I am a big James Bond fan.

Great way to start a movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great,but too short.","review":"I loved Daniel Craig as Bond. I was a little skeptical at first when I heard he was going to play Bond, but he really pulled it off. The story could have been better. It missed a little more of that secret agent feel. At the end of the movie I just wanted more. The over all Bond image is preserved. I cant wait for the next one. A must own for any true Bond fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Bond again!","review":"Plenty of action, beautiful women, and a great script once again thrill us to the core! The Blue-ray version is spectacular in all aspects. Add it to your must have list! It's a five star ride you'll enjoy over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, Craig is one HOT Bond","review":"Daniel Craig = James BondThis new Bond has the true sex appeal that the Bonds post-Connery lacked. I hated the Roger Moore era. Things got better with Dalton and Brosnan was suave, but never seemed to be athletic enough to pass the physical demands of a super spy. The films just seemed to start relying on gadjets first, sheer smarts and work second.Daniel Craig, from the first opening chase sequence to my personal favorite scene, the chair, was irreverant, super smart, ultimately sexy in the role. Too bad he fell for the Bond girl, automatic death sentence for her. Bond can't be in love or get married.Super, super Bond movie. I saw it twice in the theaters and half dozen times on the DVD, and I never go twice to see any movie at the theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"this isnt a Bond movie!","review":"First let me say i really like the new bond,I've always liked Craig,he does nothing to hurt this movie,but man what happend there has never been a bond movie I didnt like untill now,theres a good chase seen near the begining but after that its off to a poker tournament for 45min. or more..I dont understand the lack of action and the lack of any gadgets.Ok some might defend this and say well this is a new type of bond movie...I say B.S.When we watch a bond movie we like action,some hot bond girls,some gadgets and a save the world theme..With this movie you get none of that,zero.I dont understand all the great reviews,in a nutshell its really boring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Bond movie","review":"I really enjoyed this movie, but for a long while had it on DVD.

(more realistic than the previous 007 films)Very Entertaining!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even good enough for 1 star","review":"Bond movies were the movies I grew up with, and they were quality movies. As a big Bond fan, I naturally had to see this movie. So I did. First of all, the beginning is dumb, just two people running and jumping, running and jumping. And, in the VERY beginning Bond dosen't even have 00 status?! Whats up with that? Oh, and by the way, there is no classic 007 theme music until the end. The girls are not that pretty, and the famed Q and Moneypenny were not included. Bond got beat up too much and there was tons of blood unlike past classic movies. And whenever he got into a problem, like when he was poisned or he was being toutured, it was the girl that saved him, he was helpless. There are so many things wrong with this movie that made it disapointing. Not worth the money, but if you arn't convinced and want to see it, borrow it from a friend who has it. In my opinion, this should'nt even be called a true bond film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring, baffling bond","review":"I thought this film was a total disaster. It contains none of the features that made the old James Bond films fun to watch. No humour, no memorable supporting characters, no witty repartee, no exciting, wacky chases,no innuendos, no fiendishly elaborate but ineffectual attempts to dispose of Bond, nothing to delight the viewer. A distinct shortage of beautiful women for my husband to ogle (he was very discontented). And as for Bond himself, this one is entirely lacking in charm, character, and charisma. I will say nothing about the plot, as I found it completely incomprehensible from beginning to end.I have always been a fan of the Roger Moore films myself, but this one made even Pierce Brosnan look good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing some Bond standards","review":"Let me start off by saying that this is a good movie and the Blu-ray presentation is fantastic.My problem with this particular film is the lack of a couple of Bond standards which made be feel overall unfilled at the end of my viewing.Firstly, modern Bond movies always start with a spectacular action sequence that pulls you straight in and gets the heart rate up. This film starts with Bond's first and second kill which while a nice cinematic sequence seemed out of place.Secondly, where was Q and the cool gadgets that normally accompany Bond? Even the Aston Martin DBS was only featured briefly and had none of the usual gadgetry that is normally associated with a Bond ride. The only gadgets in the movie were very plain compared to those of previous movies and felt like a blatant product placement from Sony.To summarize, while I liked the grittier edge that the movie went for, I ultimately felt let down by the missing elements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragged. No funnies, no girls, no gadgets, not the bond I grew up with.","review":"What made Bond great was it was funny, great gadgets, easy storyline, bond girls, a family film.Now its volient, no gadgets, no girls and not a family film. Even though the previous Bonds weren't Ian Flemming's idea of Bond ... he previous ingreidants made Bond famous. Sean Connery got the best mix.This was an awful film that just dragged and relied on visual effects.

He has a subtle cockyness to him that really works, and his action sequences work.The acting in this Bond is also far superior to the previous 4 tries.Definately check this movie out, even if you're not a fan of Bond, but a fan of action movies, you'll really enjoy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst of bond","review":"this is the only bond movie I have not watched twicethere is no style and where did they find the so calledleading lady,she has no appeal at all,the supportingladies were much more attractive"},{"rating":"1","title":"unfortunately a technical glitch","review":"The one star is not for the movie.

That's one reason people love to hate the Niven version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bond is back!","review":"While I understand why Brosnan was not the right choice for this, a prequel, I have to think there could have been a better choice than Daniel Craig. Not that he did a bad job, but a Jason Stratham from \\"The Transporter\\" and \\"The Transporter 2\\" may have been a better choice. All in all, this was a great Bond movie. While the producers played with fire altering the opening sequences's legendary gun barrel opening, they had the sense to keep Mony Norman's timeless theme intact. As this movie has, at this writing, grossed close to $600 million dollars and the producers have already signed Craig for the next film, we can only hope they see something in Craig the rest of us don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"This is not James Bond.

Then it took a severe nosedive. It was more of a romance story than a action-adventure movie. The card playing was dragged out and boring(I enjoy watching Bravo's Celebrity Poker more!) The only action was just watching Bond run around....alot. The car chasing just involved James Bond following another car down a road for about a minute with no fancy car moves and action. I didn't care if any of the characters lived or died including Bond!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good Bond film, or a good film","review":"This is a bad film. I got bored during one of the many over long and ill-paced action sequences involving some cars and trucks and fell asleep. As a film it is poorly paced, poorly scripted, poorly acted and the plot is awful. If you want a gritty action film in the 'Bond style' (as this abortion was intended to be) you would be much better off watching Bourne. If you wanted some classic bond thrills and spills you will be sorely disappointed. The only topless scenes are of Daniel Craig and unless you find male testicular flogging a turn on there is little for the lads here.My advice, don't watch this film unless you are the type of moron who loves bad films and think the idea of a 30 minute scene in which a bloke runs around on cranes is 'well cool'. (Its not)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short, ugly , and classless","review":"Have all these Craig flag-wavers seen the same film I did? This guy's got NOTHING going for him.

I was not expecting to like Daniel Craig as much as I did in this movie. He is definitely scruffier and more grim than previous Bonds, but I think that works. Should an assassin be chipper & smiling all the time? Even James Bond? I actually believed that the violence was real, and in most Bond films it is more cartoon-like. The villain is a bit weak here, just didn't scare me all that much, and the film felt like it went on too long, so I subtracted one star.

James Bond and I look forward to his next movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"007!!!","review":"I've seen most of the James Bond flicks, but, this one, somehow, doesn't register, and I can't understand why. All the elements are here, it is well-acted and well-presented, but--I don't know--I'm still cold--maybe I've changed! The movie is well-done, but there seems to be some kind of a lack of continuity, and I'm not sure what I mean by that. There is a hard edge that doesn't belong. There is a meaness that doesn't fit, strangly enough. I get a rote feeling, rather than a devil-may-care feeling. There is an aspect of depression which does noy belong. Am I beginning to see more and more depressing movies that illustrate the war between optimism and pessimism? With optimism losing, supposedly!!! NOT!!!

This movie does not resemble any James Bond I know.

To me this movie was dull and a drivel. And to hard core. James Bond is suppose to be fun, sexy and exciting. And for me Daniel Craig was only cute. That's it. I didn't finish the movie I skipped through it to get to the end. Why haven't there been anymore James Bond movies if this one was so good. Because it wasn't. This movie was not fun to watch and Daniel Craig is no James Bond. Priece Brosan got him beat by a million miles.

Avatar looks stunning, but the story is nothing special, and the acting only OK, but this gives you all the marbles. Some say the best in the series (or darn close) and to make it even sweeter, one of the best looking blu rays out there. If you are looking for some films to revel in both visually, and substance wise, this should be near the top of your list. A few others that are worth looking for are 2001: A Space Odyssey, LOTR trilogy, Alien & Aliens, Casablanca, any Pixar title, Chinatown, and of course The Godfather collection, which retains all the beauty of the original transfers with added clarity. Don't miss this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had expected more","review":"Good parts: new Bond is OK, very physical and relatively pleasant, the pictures and supporting cast are great, stunts are simply great. The Obanno's attack is a very refreshing move and in my view the best episode of the movie.Bad parts:1. Bond girls are not up to the level set in the previous Bond movies and in all cases mutual attraction looks very unnatural.2. One hundred million dollars moment: governments do not care that much about $15 mln. anymore.3. The plot is annoyingly weak: e.g. the bad guy does not have his own crew capable of minor bombing etc etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where are the real extras?","review":"OK, the movie is great, awesome, spectacular, very well acted, thrilling, but if the movie is all this.

Daniel Craig's acting is completely one-dimensional, has none of the clever wit of any of the other Bonds.

I wanted Clive Owen to be Bond but I am very happy with how Danny worked it all through. Everyone in the packed matinee theater was equally entertained and many faces looked very happy too.

This movie seems to try to make it look cool to kill every terrorist instead of bring them to court, blow up other country's embassy, wasting millions of dollars on the way (\\"do we look like we need the money?\\"). This will influence young and uneducated viewers to approve the current US foreign policy.

Bond is presented in this picture with a highlighted human side, something that was not presented with such clarity since \\"On Her Majestic's Secret Service\\" with one time Bond George Lazemby and Diana Rigg. Some of us may enjoy more than others the human side of 007 but I believe it does not hurt the movie. It is a well done action movie with a little romance. Please do not compare Daniel Craig to other actors that played the Bond character in the past. I would not say that one was better than other, I would say just different. You can have a personal favorite (mine continues to be Sean Connery (I particularly like it in Goldfinger). But I believe that Craig does a pretty good job.

What could they possibly like about Casino Royale?Daniel Craig is a horrible choice as James Bond. He has no charisma, charm or chemistry with the Bond girls. There wasn't an exciting Pre-title sequence, zero gadgets and the Aston Martin gets flipped over in a chase? What on earth were the screenwriters thinking? Moreover, the poker game takes up a good chunk of this movie and it is long and boring. The one other action scene involves a construction site where Craig is doing a series of jumps and climbs onto and off of cranes. In all honesty, it felt like another movie all together. Couldn't the writers think of something better?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bewildered by the negative reviews","review":"Haven't read them all, but can hardly believe the volume of critical reviews here. CR is clearly the top Bond movie in decades and, in my opinion, among the best in the entire franchise. Royale is well-written, casted, paced and acted.

I rented this one because there was a lot of hype around the film and I heard it was different than most Bond films. I wish I hadn't watsted my time. This film is every action movie cliché wrapped into one. I couldn't even finish this over the top borefest. Of course this is full of action sequences like we've all seen before, ie., one secret agent taking on a small army, sexy babes and fast exotic cars. The real turning point for me was the part after Bond sees a bikini clad sexy woman riding a white horse along the beach in front of her mansion, he then wins her husbands 1964 Aston Martin in a high stakes Texas Hold 'Em game. I'm sure any guy out there who wants to see a testosterone filled, macho film will love this. But I'll pass..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Film is 5 stars.

This Bond is supposed to be set pre Dr. No, yet there are:1) cell phones, technology that did not exist then2) laptops, again that did not exist back then (especially not a Sony VAIO which was shamelessly marketed)3) Very elaborate tracking system, much more sophisticated than a radioisotope tracker used in Dr. No4) Modern weapons5) Texas Hold em, not BaccaratJust to mention a few. Sure the acting may be great in parts, like the torture scene, but the whole movie just feels drawn out like they couldn't stop. Kids and first time Bonders will probably like this, but for thoes of us who have seen every Bond movie from Dr. No to Die Another Day (including Never Say Never Again), it is a movie that should never have been made, which is why they made Dr. No first and not Casino Royale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Casino Royale","review":"I found it absolutely outragous the following:1) I pre-ordered this item mid-February and with shipping I paid approx. 10.2) It will arrive to my adress some time in April according to the most recent mail.3) Today (March 19th), I could walk into any stores in the U.K. and buy it for 9.99 - AND WATCH IT IN MY LIVING ROOM.I FEEL ABSOLUTELY CHEATED BY AMAZON - IT HAPPENED BEFORE AND I WILL NOT BUY ANY NEW RELASES THROUGH YOU IN THE FUTURE!TR"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a 2 hour Sony commercial","review":"I'm no stranger to product placement, nor am I against it, but when I saw this movie, I couldn't help but feel the experience was cheapened by all the close-ups on Sony products. When the camera purposely zooms in to show Blu-ray on a disc, PSP on the back of a videogame system, or Cybershot on a camera, it gets a little annoying. It's no surprise that Sony placed all those products, it is a Sony Pictures film, but the purposely placed shots of Sony products was too much for me to handle.There wouldn't have been an issue if there were a Pepsi sign in the background, or if a character used a Cybershot camera; but when a shot zooms in to show the brand, model, or format, I call commercial. If this is what all James Bond movies are going to be like, I might as well just stay home and watch TV.

The missing elements were the women at every destination of Bonds' travels, a memorable villain that packed a intriguing but vicious undertone.

This Bond was not the eye candy that Pierce Bonsnan, Sean Connery and Roger Moore brought to character. This was infinitely a rental not worth the big bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"They wrecked it","review":"They simply wrecked the Bond personality when they chose Craig to play the part. Craig tries to play the tough guy and it is just pathetic. Bond should have the personality of the previous actors that have played him such as class and that hint of humour.

I own all the films on DVD, view them on a reasonably frequent rotation, and in one way or another love them all. I'll keep this brief -- no plot synopses, no detailed analyses: suffice to say that Daniel Craig IS James Bond, just as surely as Sean Connery was. I have great respect for all the actors who have come in between over the last 3 decades, but this film, paired with this actor in particular, are the single greatest pairing in Bond history since Connery in \\"Goldfinger\\".

Although most people don't need it I have to use it sometimes and the thing that bugs me the most is that all the other DVD and Blu-Ray versions of the film do have a spanish language track.

The movie had no outstanding action scene(s), and Craig was not the suave, devil-may-care Bond of old. He was a thug that was doing a poor imitation of the Borne movies.While Die Another Day was not my favorite 007 flick, it beats this mess considerably.My son, grandson, elderly neighbors and their grandaughter all saw this and had the same conclusion - the WORST Bond movie ever!!!

We both thought the action scenes were well done, but overall, it's one of the few Bond films that we will watch only once.I hope the Craig/Bond experiment is over.

I just watched it on DVD and really sorry for the time wasted. Staring at the wall for 2 hours would be more rewarding.The movie is a set of disjointed action sequences (which are nothing special by themselves) following each other with no rhyme or reason. Daniel Craig is another in the line of impostors unsuccessfully trying to fill Sean Connery's shoes (even Pierce Brosnan was better then DC, and PB wasn't very good either). Other characters are not even 2-dimensional - they are one-dimensional. Really bad acting all around.

The plot was not the best not mention hard to keep up with. I am so disappointed that I bought this movie instead of renting it.

I liked how the old villans would try to take over a country with an army of super powered mutants. In Casino Royale, the villan was much more believable.

I really wanted to see a movie that would expose a massive network of villans that have coridated a mulit-national effort to destroy/contaminate a massive fresh water supply like the Kinneret (Israel's water supply). But I guess things like that can't really happen after Austin Powers already made fun of it.And I did really like the new James Bond and nearly everything else in the movie except for the ending.

Taking a page from the \\"Batman Begins\\" playbook, the 007 producers finally return to Ian Fleming's original creation - with an actor capable of redefining Bond while giving Sean Connery a run for his money. Thanks to Daniel Craig's masterful performance, a solid screenplay and Martin Campbell's bravura direction, \\"Casino Royale\\" emerges as the finest 007 effort since \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" (1969).

He brings a toughness and believability to the role which has been missing for a long time. Real secret service operatives who do what Bond does are often ex-military special forces types, not dandies who worry about whether their martinis are shaken or stirred. This hard edge comes through in many of Ian Fleming's books: Casino Royale captures that tone, as did the early Bond films with Connery.

Nice stunts as always; but the love plot with Vesper did/does not work, too much time is spent on it, and the real bond would not have wasted his time with this SKANKY looking shrew. Hopefully the next attempt at anything Bond will deal less with an hour worth of Texas hold em (i can watch the WSOP for this if needed), minimal plot spent on a love line, and a Bond who wont be a guy with little or no acting ability. If I could give a \\"0\\" for this movie, I would. Go buy \\"license to kill\\" or \\"the world is not enuff.\\" At least those movies have something more believable than a blond/blue bond who is totally out of his league.

Casino Royale is not simply a great Bond movie - it is a great film!! Being a huge Pierce Brosnan fan, I was disappointed when we learned he would not be back in the role. Sure the last couple Bond films have been boring & stupid (invisible car anyone)? Surely Quentin Tarantino could have given Brosnan some decent material to work with!!Well, not only did Daniel Craig make me forget how much I missed Brosnan, he now OWNS the role. I can't imagine anyone else playing Bond in this picture. As for the movie, it is sensational. The action scenes are intense. The acting is superb (including the lovely Eva Green).

Often beaten up, too slow to catch the bad guy, too in touch with his feelings, giving up duty for a pretty girl who is duping him the whole time. Bond the douche really. This movie would make the Bond fan think that they've lost it, that the Bond dynasty is done.

Worrying their new Bond not convincing enough, they even shot a screen in the train where Bond first met Vesper, trying to tell the audience, What Bond should be, it's just pathetic. I do not know the Bond Fleming wrote, but I saw every Bond movies, and I am sure this new Bond is not James.Casino Royale plot is simple, out to date (written 1953) and confusing for everyone who do not know what Poker game is.

There are no extra or elaborate descriptions, yet what she describes is crystal clear and said in a way that is unique. I especially like what she has written on the subject of addiction and the frustration of failing in the process. \\"It was like covering a blackboard with writing every morning and then that night erasing everything you'd learned.\\"I haven't finished reading it yet, I'm almost there though.

The writer seemed bratty, shallow, self-centered and very full of her ability to choose a really obtuse word when a clearer one would do. We didn't like her and couldn't figure out why she was so depressed and depressing, other than perhaps her family history. I couldn't figure out how she was rebelling against her father, who seemed, as did her mohter, to support her in her every endeavor. She had a wonderful childhood and seemed to resent it.

Also two of the nets had lights that were unevenly spaced -- as if the machine had skipped a spot and there was a stitch missing in the net. A whole row of lights was uneven when the net was stretched out into its rectangular shape -- the lights were closer together at one end than the other.

This was one of the WORST books I have ever read. The characters were stiff and undeveloped and unappealing. I wanted to smack them all upside the head and tell them exactly what was going on that they were too dumb to see. The plot is convoluted and full of holes - for example, there is a plot to find a book belonging to a 'Gentlemen's club' that detailed their sexual adventures. Now, the book is in Max's possession, even though he doesn't know what it is about. The book is later seen in the possession of a bulter, who is actually using it. But in the end, the book doesn't exist! Surprise! I guess everyone imagined it. And somethings, like the mysterious rider, are never explained.Don't bother.

Why he thinks sins are inherited is even more mystifying.2. Yes, the family trees are confusing but the anecdotes are great3. Well-written.4.

The beginning is rough, and abrasive, pairing Flea's demanding slap-bass style of playing with John's funky and masterful guitar manipulation that generates an amazing and mind blowing intro lasting 30 seconds.It is the two b-sides that I'm not so fond of. \\"Parallel Universe\\" hasn't changed as much as you'd like it to. Really, if anything, it comes off less perfect then the actual album version.\\"Teatro Jam\\" is a nice song that jams like crazy. Chad and Flea provide delectable rhythm, and John plays the guitar proficiently thought the entire thing. It's not bad. This single is purely for collectors, as the b-sides aren't the most valuable ones the Chili's have released. The title track is, hands down, the best off this single."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minimal value, for collector's only.","review":"The \\"Around the World\\" single appeared in two parts, each backed with a pair of b-sides. This is part 1.The title track is a funky, driven piece, opening with a raging distorted bass run before blasting into an oddball, scratchy, funky verse. It's a decent tune, although it's on \\"Californication\\", so it's unlikely anyone would buy it for this.The b-sides on part 1 are from the Teatro sessions, demos worked up before the album-- \\"Parallel Universe\\" hadn't changed much-- the bass and guitar are separated (you can really hear the metallic edge in Flea's bassplaying) a bit more, but other than that, it's about the same thing. The \\"Teatro Jam\\" piece features a somewhat irritating guitar riff and some superb playing from Chad Smith and Flea, but truthfully, it's not all that listenable.In the end, this one is probably best for collector's only."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent album, sadly unnoticed","review":"It's strange, and quite sad, that Chris Darrow, one of the most original US artists, had to find a record label in Germany to keep on recording.

I first discovered him a couple of years ago on a PBS broadcast of the Les Miserables 10th year anniversary production. Since then, I have been trying to build my CD collection of his music. This is my third album by Michael and by far the best. I concur with some comments that I have seen noting that he has sometimes not had the right collection of material to do justice to his incredible voice. This album does! When I received it the other day, I put it in my car CD player and as I drove down the freeway, kept saying YES! Yes! Finally he has material that does his incredible voice proud.

I especially like \\"With One Look\\" and \\"Losing My Mind\\". What a voice this man has! P.S. The only reason I didn't give the CD five stars is because of \\"Love Changes Everything\\", which seems to be on every Michael Ball album. Granted, this is an appropriate place for it, as it is from a musical, but frankly, I'm getting a little tired of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very good","review":"I absolutely loved it.

All those great reviews convinced me. I wish now I had paid attention to the one-star reviews, because I agree with them, - I HATE THIS CD! It IS over-produced, he DOES sound like a lounge singer (Tom Jones comes to mind). All the things I love about Michael Ball's vocal styling are absent from this recording. He ruins \\"With One Look\\" and \\"Don't Rain on my Parade\\" is just embarrassing. If you love the Michael Ball from \\"Aspects of Love\\" and \\"Les Mis\\" you probably won't like this CD.

Boy, was I wrong! His renditions of the songs are terrible (with exception to Anthem and Easy Terms). It seemed as if they were being sung by a lounge lizard. I could just picture Michael standing next to a piano, snapping his fingers, while singing. Do yourself a favor and skip this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"*lol* I read through most of the review and scorned at most of the one-star ones :) I do have to agree that the orchestration is abit over-done and it shocked me at first when i heard it. But it's an absolutely wonderful album and his voice is just breathtaking! His expressions and his charismatic voice are mind-blowing. I love 'memory' because he sings it with such emotion.

Furthermore, widescreen TVs are starting to penetrate the mainstream. In a few years High Definition widescreen TV will be a significant presence. Who will want Full Screen DVDs then?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family entertainment","review":"Shrek was an enjoyable fantasy adventure that will appeal to adults as well as children.I watched it with my nephew and enjoyed it more than he did.It was very funny and very well animated.

Other companies should follow Shrek's example."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whew! Look at this!","review":"I thought this was a good movie until I got me a REALLY expensive S-video lead to replace my previous expensive one.I'd recommend you replace all your old TV's and DVD players with super-duper ones, get a PAL copy of Shrek and prepare to be blown away. I'd previously rated this movie 4 stars but seeing (more sharply and colourfully than ever!) all the fine work that's gone into it made me give it top score."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!!","review":"I first received the Shrek DVD as a gift from my step-sister.

Not the Buttons! Not my Gumdrop buttons!!\\"","review":"Shrek is a mordern day fairy tale with a big, smelly, ugly orge as its hero, and a wise-cracking talking donkey as his sidekick.Shrek (Mike Myers) lives in a swamp alone. All that changes when fairy tale creatures are at Shrek's door. Shrek learns that Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) has forced the fairy tale creatures into Shrek's swamp. Shrek goes to see Lord Farquaad (with Donkey, Eddie Murphy) and tells him to get rid of all the creatures in his swamp. Lord Farquaad sends Shrek on a quest to rescue the beatiful Princess Fiona (Cameron Dias) from a castle guarded by a fierce dragon.A great comedy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Awesome","review":"This movie is great!! The voices of the characters are perfect. Eddie Murphy is great for playing donkey and adds a lot of humor to the movie. Also with this movie you find thier is a lot more to friends than you think.

Every time you watch it you discover something u've never noticed before."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Monsters, Inc.\\" is much better than this by 20 miles!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie isn't all that great.

I'm so glad I watched it first. Within the first 5 minutes I had decided that he would not see this movie now - and he would not see it 2 years from now either. The movie may have gotten great reviews, but I thought it was vulgar. It's certainly not what I want my child to see and then imitate. Not for kids younger than 10, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racism by any other name.......","review":"In reading the reviews for this movie, i wonder just how mind-numbed the average moviegoer is. Was I the only one who noticed that the only villians in this film were invariably white and male? Or that the \\"curse\\" that the princess was \\"cured\\" of was being a caucasiaan female? Shrek struggled between being a mindless parade of fart jokes and an example of political correctness run amok. Do special effects make up for a weak, predictable plot, gutter humor and racist overtones? Apparently so, judging from the reviews. Beam me up, Scotty; there really is no intelligent life here."},{"rating":"1","title":"never received","review":"Never received the DVD-after 15 days I contacted vendor and Amazon and my money was returned.

The dvd comes with plenty of extra material, includes also some of the best menues I have ever seen, better than the ones from \\"The Phamton Menace\\" or any other.Well, the movie itself is awesome. The picture is great, and the sound even better.But I have to say, the Shrek in the swamp karaoke party is the best part of the dvd. Seeing Donkey sing a cover of Sir Mix A Lot \\"Baby Got Back\\" or the wolf singing \\"Who Let The Dogs Out\\", is the best part of the dvd.Well, what else can I say?...Great movie, great dvd...some great things, like some out takes, showing some problems the crew had with donkey (a very hairy donkey appears, and a walking dress), I can only say...BUY THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies of the year!!","review":"This movie beat all of my expectations.

However, after actually seeing the movie, I was extremely disappointed. Some people found Shrek to be descriminatory and prejudiced. Personally, I didn't. However, the bottom line is IT JUST WAS NOT FUNNY. The humor, despite acclaim from adults and children alike, was repetitive, stale and un-intelligent. No person over the age of 10, would find this remotely funny. It literally brings me to the point of nausea to hear this called \\"the best movie of all time.\\" Unless you find an hour and a half of bathroom humor hilarious, don't buy Shrek."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have GOT to be kidding me!","review":"To start, he animation is good, and there are a few good visual jokes.But the plot is so thin, so contrived that it would not have filled out an episode of Power Rangers.Shrek is an ogre who only wants to be left alone. Lord Farquaad rounds up all the Fairy Tale Creatures in the land, and relocates them to Shrek's swamp, less than a mile away. Why? Apparently for absolutely no reason other than there is no movie if he doesn't. Farquaad says he will relocate them again (to where?) if Shrek will retreve the Princess he needs to marry to become a King. Only complication is that the Princess is under a curse (which seems to take the night off while Shrek and Donkey are talking by the light of the moon).(Adult) inunendo and toilet humor make this unsuitable for small children. Lack of characterization, plot or internal consistancy make it unsuitable for anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like foolishness, this is for you...","review":"I got this for my kids because everyone raved about how great it was.

It was crass and gross, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"violent","review":"I felt like this was incredibly way too violent and curse words, really?! It just wasn't necessary. Too much had to be assumed that beauty is on the inside and so obviously stating that outward appearance is what makes someone ugly or beautiful. The violence was shocking. Shrek is violent as his approach to get people away and so is Princess Fiona....the donkey was the only redeeming character in this movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED??!!??","review":"I though comedies were supposed to be funny. The trailers sure looked humorous. Alas, it showed all the good parts; the rest is pretty ho-hum. Disliked the style of animation (it's from the Antz team, another stinker), and the message about people falling in love regardless of physical appearances is totally negated by the ending, when it's discovered that (SPOILER AHEAD) the princess is also an ogre. I realize I'm in the minority here, but this is a VERY overrated film. I'll stick with Monsters, Inc., thank you very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shrek","review":"Shrek was the best movie I had ever seen. I would reccomend it to any age child even if you have overprotective parents. It does have cuss words and gross stuff like farting, belching, love, and fighting (just karate) but those things didn't make me change my mind. It was funny and adventure/survival and keeping a secret that could change ones life forever. I am almost 13 and Shrek is my favorite movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Marvelous Production","review":"Definitely a 5 star production! Appeals to all ages. A definite must for the family's entertainment collection! (When I took my family to see this film at the theatre, our ages ranged from 68 to 7 years old.) It was like a trip to an amusement park but even more amusing. This work of art is hilarious! I didn't know a thing about the story and was pleasantly surprised & enthralled with the magic. Creativity aand then some! The ending will have you rolling off the seat laughing! Shrek is so thoroughly entertaining, it's a most worthy of your time & money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Movie + Great Features = Must Own Family DVD","review":"The special features alone make this worth owning, but when you get crystal clear images from the great digital movie, there's no topping this hilarious family adventure. No matter how old you are, (I went with a group of teenagers) you'll love this movie.Here's the bottom line: 2 discs of games, information, fun new interviews of the characters and a longer ending/party, it's an uplifting, wholesome film.A+ on any grading scale."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST OF THE BEST I COULDN'T STOP WATCHING IT.

I didn't see it in the movies, but once released on DVD, I got a bit curious and was suprised at what I found.As this movie is aimed at a wide audience, I found enough to engross many children and enough to also engage an older crowd. At first I was extremely skeptical of the cast, as I don't usually like Mike Meyers at all, but his voice was disguised enough that I didn't mind. Also, Cameron Diaz usually annoys me, but her voice and character were well cast.Shrek became a loveable creature and even though the plot is not complicated and somewhat predictable, it was definately enjoyable. There were many stabs at Disney, but I didn't get too offended.All-in-all, Shrek was a well done movie with creative dialogue, beautiful scenes and an entertaining plot. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys computer animated movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie I Have ever seen!!!","review":"Eddie Murphey as the voice of donkey, Mike Myers the voice of Shrek,Cameron Diaz the voice of princess Fiona, and John Lithgow as the voice of Lord Farquaad. Could the movie ever be more funny? I think that this is most hilarious, facinating movie on earth. Donkey is anoying i admit, but he is very funny. Shrek the great green fright machine might be a little mean to donkey sometimes, but he's also funny. Princess Fiona, I would say isn't much of a joker, she's more quiet, I would say, but if ever she wants something badly she screams REAL LOUD. Lord Farquaad probably the person that you will hate the most in this movie, is dum.The graphics on this movie are great, the movie is even 3D. The sound comes out clear, the charaters are very well made, and well everything is perfect!!!!If you want a good laugh buy this movie. It's worth it I swear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid's love it.","review":"This movie is cute and I love the digs on Disney and Fairy Tales. My kids can't stop watching it.

It has some humorous situations, but they never amount to more than a stereotypical punchline or fart joke. At best, it's harmless for your kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"This movie was built up to be something it really is not and that is a kids movie. With all the bodily function jokes and sexual overtones I am surprised it got the rating it did and that people let their small children watch it. If it was billed differently, I might given it another star. It has a few good moments as a fairy tale about love and not judging the book by its cover. It has a refreshing ending but it most certainly does not live up to the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foul language is not for kids","review":"I would have loved this movie if it weren't for the occasional bad words and adult humor.

The thing that really sets this DVD apart from others that I own are all the wonderful extra's. It contains the movies in wide screen and pan and scan, commentary from some of the makers. Many games, music numbers. It even lets you dub yourown voice into certain scenes from the movie in place of the actor. I have never had so much fun, and I'm still finding more things to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down by this one!","review":"I feel conned! The 3D effect seems to only work if; you have an TV set with outstanding color beam allignment, you don't wear spectacles or contacts, you have no astigmatism, you have a DVI or SCART connection from your DVD player to your TV or home theatre amplifier, you close the blinds or drapes and switch off all the lights, and you spend 15 minutes waiting for the chromophores in your eye to get used to the 2 cent cardboard cut-out 3D spectacles. I recommend that you first rent it before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed so hard!!","review":"Actually, I saw the movie on a plane. I laughed so hard, I had tears flowing down my cheeks.

The chemistry between Donkey and Shrek is hysterical.Donkey the annoying jackass who never shuts up steals the show. His comical quips will leave you in stitches.And when Shrek's swamp is invaded and the dwarves put Snow White on his dinning room table he says, \\"Dead broad off the table.\\" I laughed for days about that.I watched this show time and time again. Everytime I seem to find some new point to laugh at that I didn't get the first time. Full of inuendoes of Americana. Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELENT!!!!!!!!!!

Tons of them in this 2-disc set, most of them great.As a movie, lots of fun and with a message that's close to the heart of those of us who aren't fairy-tale pretty. Like \\"Antz,\\" however, there's a bit too much of an insistence on NOT being like Disney. This mostly works for them, but you sense they're looking over their shoulders and yelling, \\"Take THAT, Walt!\\" at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly Entertaining/ Not for young kids","review":"With a talking mule as one of the main characters, be prepared for a lot of wordplay with the word \\"ass\\".

One of the best movies of 2001!","review":"Shrek is a wonderful computer animated movie about an ogre named Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers), who wants to live in his swamp in peace. When the evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) captures all of the fairy tale creatures (including the gingerbread man and the seven dwarfs), Shrek demands answers. Faraquaad agrees to get rid of them if he rescues Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) in a far away castle for him. So off Shrek goes with his sidekick, a wisecracking, talkative donkey (Eddie Murphy) on his adventures to rescue the princess.This movie isn't just a kid's movie, like the PG rating suggests. The plot of this movie is good, the graphics are astonishing, and the humor of the movie is hilarious! I strongly recommend this movie to anybody willing to have a few good laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"If you though \\"Shrek\\" was a Disney/Pixar meeting of the mind, you must be thinking of \\"Monster Inc.\\". This is Dreamworks: SKGlatest animated movie to be released. And it's makes a cute adventures for the kids and a pretty good satire on fairy tale movies for the adults.The movie begins when Shrek (Meyers), a not-so-friendly orge, founds out that Lord Farquad (Lithrow) had dumped a few fairytale creatures in this swamp. Shrek and a unstopping talking donkey (Murpy) goes straight to Lord's home, Durloc, to get this swamp back, but they had to recause the Princess Fiona(Diaz) from a dragon guarding castle.You can easily guess what's Princess Fiona sercet this, but that's the only flaw in this movie.

I get just about any video that comes out for my 3 and 7 yr old. Shrek looked like just another video. Well, it certainly isn't Disney. Most parents expect a certain consistency in animated flicks. Dream Works is is looking for a piece of he giant pie. The up side to this video - Incredible graphics. A little shocking really, from all the other 'kids' videos out there. Obviously they tried to appeal more to adults. The down side to the video - there is a lot of 'toilette' humor and innuendos that are inappropriate for most children. Little songs that seemingly are about to end rhyming in words that most parents wouldn't allow their kids to say and at the last moment changing the words. The princess singing a duet with a bird (cute), but them the bird explodes and she cooks her eggs. My suggestion is that parents should maybe preview this one themselves before showing it to young children."},{"rating":"2","title":"For all ages","review":"I watched this movie at home thinking that is would bre like one of those Disney movie where you know whats gonna happen and it'll be all mushy and corny and \\"perfect\\" but it wasnt and thats great.

She was rough and tough. I was shocked when she turned into an Ogre.

It's a fairly funny movie with a lot of great lines, though there were a couple of inappropriate (and in an entirely unneccessary way) jokes, but this movie has a nice mix of medievalism/fairy tales and modern-day comedy and attitudes.One thing that bothers me is that the curse is never explained. WHY was Princess Fiona placed under the curse? I mean, did her parents make some evil fairy godmother or witch angry? The movie was good and I've seen it a couple of times, but that question has always nagged at me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny movie","review":"I got this to complete the Shrek movies.

It only took about 3 mins and my kids and I removed the glasses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fable-ulous Fun!","review":"Shrek is a neatly packaged fable, great fun for the whole family (unless you're squeamish about muted potty humor). The animation seems so real at times, it's difficult to believe that scenes were entirely virtual.Technical marvels don't make a great movie, however. Fortunately, Shrek has plenty of soul. Myers & Murphy play well off each other, bringing to life a fable about love, integrity, and acceptance.Hard to imagine a more enjoyable picture. Earns every one of its five stars.(If you'd like to dialogue more about this review or movie, please click on the \\"about me\\" link above and drop me an email.

I went with seven kids and another adult and we couldn't decide who liked it better the kids or us. It had us rolling with laughter. I think this one is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a child's movie","review":"I have to say that I enjoyed this movie, so did my husband. However I would not show it to it's target audience. There were some things that I would not let children see.Several areas of language, either used in joking, and covered up by a rhyming word, or \\"donkey\\" jokes.One scene that made me gasp, when I thought about the kids seeing it was when the prince looked under the covers while pondering his princess! I couldn't believe that that was in a movie, where the majority of the audience is under 13!Enough said, but I would caution parents preview this before allowing your children to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrific movie for kids of all ages","review":"Once upon a time, there lived an ogre named Shrek (Mike Meyers). Shrek liked the quiet life in his swamp, until Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow)evicted all of the fairy tale animals from his Kingdom. The animals move into Shrek's swamp, which he is not happy about. So he and the fast-talking Donkey (Eddie Murphy) visit Farquaad to work out a deal: Shrek will rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a fire-breathing dragon, in exchange for taking the animals back. While spoofing every fairy tale from Three Blind Mice to Three Little Pigs, and taking numerous shots at Disney, Shrek's message is not lost. One cannot always see beauty from the outside. I haven't seen a movie this funny in years. Bring the kids! I'd say 4 and up. There is some mildly crude humor, but little ones won't get it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shrek","review":"I have attempted to purchase this item twice from to seprate vendors and have not received either."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHREK 3D IS NOT A WASTE OF TIME!

These people should watch these at night with NO lights in the room. Well, just trying to give you a tip, y'all! But still, you gotta see the first original \\"Shrek\\" movie because it is great and it's one of funniest animated films of the 21st century and possibly, of all time.

Yeah, funnines!!!! This 3-d actually works unlike in spy-kids 3-d. and of course, there's that fullscreen problem everybody hates. fullscreen is not that bad. plus what more important, the way the movie is shaped or the movie itself? i say the movie itself. yes shrek is good, yes shrek 3-d is good and yes shrek 2 is good! everything that's in the whole collection so far (shrek 3 is coming out in 2006, yes i know, 2006) is very good.

I'm not a psychologist, but this made me feel really bad. I went with a friend, and he felt uncomfortable, too.It's become acceptable to associate negative traits with certain dialects. For instance an \\"appalachian\\" or deep southern accent with ignorance and baseness.My review is not going to change anything; but I hope that people with children teach their little ones to judge people based on their actions, character and intellect--instead of making assumptions based on the way they speak.Thanks,Joanne"},{"rating":"1","title":"I stand alone.","review":"I am, for some reason, the only person on the planet that truly hates this movie. I first saw it years ago with some friends when it was released on dvd. For the first half hour Shrek and the donkey did nothing but argue so I walked out. I understand that movies must have some sort of hardship in the beginning to draw the viewer in, but there was no hope for this. I just could not get into the constant bickering. I didn't care.

It provides excellent entertainment for all ages. There may be some humour that is not overly appropriate for children, but it is done in such a way that the kids don't even catch it. Dreamworks did an amazing job of bringing together big talent for such a piece of animation - and you can completley immerse yourself in the story. Mike Myers is outstanding as Shrek (as usual) and Eddie Murphy is a hoot. John Lithgow and Cameron Diaz are excellent additions to the cast. Personally, I can't wait for Shrek 2 to come out - same cast, continuing the story - should be great! I would recommend this DVD before any other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for the whole family","review":"Adults and children alike will love it!My favorite part on the DVD was in the special features.You have got to see the interview with the donkey!Hilarious"},{"rating":"1","title":"How much toilet humor can you stand?","review":"I expected this film to be clever and witty, more like Toy Story or Antz. I don't see the difference between this and many of the weak comedy entries this year. This felt like a studio trying to break in to the smart funny Pixar world, and failing. After Prince of Egypt I expected something classier and better quality than this dreck. I can't believe this was the highest grossing movie of the year. And even worse- critics have given it high marks! I just don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm......Hmmm.....","review":"I don't see why everybody thought this was such a great accomplishment!

This DVD set only has the pan & scan version and not the widescreen version and the 3D movie is just a short movie from a ride at Universal Studios that is only about 15 or 16 minutes and if you are looking for the widescreen version of Shrek you will be disappointed and you would be better off buying the DVD set that has Shrek in both widescreen and pan & scan and also a 3D movie seen on a regular TV will not work like it does in a theater that uses special equipment and special effects so 3D glasses with a TV set will not cut it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An \\"adult\\" cartoon...","review":"This is not really a cartoon per say, but an animated movie.

Needless to say, when I watched it with him, I went and bought one for myself. It became my instant favorite.

First of all, i saw Monsters Inc and thought it was delightful and very well done. Then over the weekend I watched the movie Shrek which got such rave reviews and both my girlfriend and I thought the movie was garbage. The story line by itself was just another fairy tale, but the comedy sounded like something created to draw an adult audience to the Myers/Murphy/Diaz/Lithgow names and all it did for me was insult my intelligence and waste my time. Given the chance to watch it again, I would gladly ask for a dental appointment instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined by glitches","review":"Each of the two discs (full screen and letterbox) had enough glitches to completely RUIN an otherwise enjoyable film.

I hated this movie.It's for kids? A great kid movie is usually enjoyable for adults, too. I felt whoever made this movie was thinking, \\"kids loves stupid characters who can dance and sing, and as long as you have that you don't need a story..\\"Probably with the big computer all around, animators somehow lost connection to their characters. I'm not saying computers are bad (I actually love animation such as Bug's Life) but the people of dreamworks wasn't able to overcome this temptation from the great computers, \\"I can do that and that...\\"Mike Myers is simply a miscast that his voice was never integrated to the character.

I don't feel that alot of the content is suitable for children. The hidden meanings in this were appalling and adults who make such movies for children should know better. YES, Children do pay attention and in this day and age we parents need all the help we can get. I'm glad at least I do preview movies before showing them to my child and nieces and nephews... The reviews this movie got just leave me dumbfounded. Let me ask, those who reviewed it, Did you actually watch it???"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's wrong with people?","review":"I can't tell you how many people have told me this is a great movie. How much milege can we get from cliches and then the ridicule of cliches. True love? The music doesn't fit at all, (Hey now your an all star... in the opening credits, come on.)Mike Myers with an inconsistent Scottish accent which he already sold us in Austin Powers.It also is prejudiced against short people. All the DVD extras can't hide the fact that this is an insulting movie for adults and kids. Hollwood has finally killed all sense of taste and originality. I'll take disney (minus the musical numbers) any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Expected So Much More","review":"This movie was a PG-rated animated version of \\"Something About Mary.\\" (Note the Cameron Diaz similarity.) Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed \\"Something About Mary.\\" My point is that \\"Shrek\\" is being marketed for children, but it really isn't appropriate for children. The \\"PG\\" rating is definitely there for a reason. It is not \\"G\\" material. It contains bathroom humor and sexual innuendo that is entirely inappropriate for children. I suggest that parents view this movie alone before letting your children watch it. I am glad that I rented and didn't buy. It's not a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a shame so many kids have already seen this.","review":"I don't own this dvd. My little brother borrowed it from a friend, and I watched it with him and my other little brothers. I know I shouldn't be reviewing, since I don't own this, but watching it made me so mad, and I want you to know why. I'm upset because the movie uses dirty jokes to be funny and claims to be a kids' film. Sometimes dirty jokes can be funny, I know that, but when you're a little kid you don't know what they mean or why they're funny. After one punchline one of my brothers turned around as if to ask me what it meant. That made me sick. It makes me sick how people make movies they say are for kids and then put dirty, even mean, material in them. Don't moviemakers know how sensitive and easily influenced kids are? I'm a 21-year-old college guy and know better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable!","review":"Shrek, has it's good points but it is completely not suitable for children, there are noticable sexual jokes throughout the entire movie. I saw it with my 8 year old neice, and believe me, she knew what they where talking about, and the reason that she does is because she has seen it on TV. It's sad when you can't take a young child to a supposedly family friendly movie, because it is too inapropriate. Shrek didn't need to throw in adult humour to satisfy the parents, it would have been a completely enjoyable movie with out those kind of jokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this one.","review":"I don't know what about it, but I really didn't like this movie. I just hated it. And i usually like these cute little movies, like Chicken Run, but Shrek just sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR KIDS","review":"Shrek may well appeal to some adult's tastes but it is certainly NOT an appropriate movie for kids, for many reasons! There is humor and some really frightening, even sick, violence. It distresses me that it is marketed to children. My advice for parents is to rent and view before you show your kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overated","review":"Me and my girlfriend watched this cause we had seen the trailers months before and had an inkling to see the movie. It started off just fine and might have lived up to its hype if it hadnt gotten horribly predictable and the jokes hadnt gotten horribly flat. A quarter into the film the makers drop some of the better satire and concentrate on overdone spoofs of the matrix and other things. All together we both found it to be if anything a quite boring and unfunny film, certainly not deserving of all the grandeur thrown at it since its release."},{"rating":"1","title":"L-A-ME!! DON'T WASTE MONEY","review":"This movie is totally lame. The plot is cute, but the animation and the overall appearance of the characters is terrible! The humor in here is cheesy, slightly obscene (to little ears) at times. It is hard to buy the Matrix-inspired action and the modern-day vulgar humor. There is nothing reedeming about the plot or the movie itself.

They look at it, and then Shrek sais \\"Do you think he's comfensating for something?\\" (penis size joke). Later, Donkey tells Princess that Shrek said that, and then sais \\"But I think what he's really trying to say is,\\" and is stopped by Shrek.

The movie starts out great with many funny moments. However, after the princess is saved, the movie just seems to drag. Then comes the movie's moral: \\"don't judge by appearances.\\" It's nice and all, but it seemed to get shoved at you during every turn.

The girl actually goes through with the marriage but then runs off with the Shrek. I'm sorry, in the attempt to not repeat one of the same scenes over and over like that in \\"The princess bride\\" they decide they actually have her marry and then run off?But for a culture that has decided that marriage is nothing more than a peice of paper, making romantic love much more superior (not understanding that real love is something a person has to learn and develope as they mature. The question when you marry someone one should not be \\"will I still love this person?\\" rather it should be \\"Is this person someone I'd want to love for that long?\\") to marriage.

But if you re-watch it you'll discover it is amazingly crude, twisted, and sexual. ...The movies also packs WAY to many bodily function jokes in there. There's about five in the first three minutes alone. Shrek takes a bath in mud, gargles it, then jumps in a lake, farts, and a dead fish comes floating up. After that, he squeezes bug juice onto a stick and brushes his teeth with. Then he pulls out his own ear wax to make a candle, and drinks a martini with a human eye in it.

There was 1!!! funny scene in this movie, where the gingerbread man cookie says eat me. Otherwise, this movie included a lot eye-rolling. Regardless, its a good story, and an original idea, just one that was very poorly made.

Although the vast majority of people have been 'taken in' by the bright shiny CGI and have not been tempted to look behind the proverbial curtain.

Even Mike Myers of whom I am a fan seems to be going through the motions without much inspiration.For such technology-heavy projects it should perhaps not come as a surprise that the plot is not the main focus, but after watching the 5-star TOY STORY 2,one cannot be satisfied with Shrek.I'd be disappointed if an adult considered Shrek's humour top class; he obviously has not discovered the Monty Python magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arggh","review":"SERIOUSLY!

This is for High School kids and College kids and parents of four year olds that want to watch something with out ELMO in it- but really NOT for little children.

Some might say that it is just entertainment and doesn't ahve to mean anything but I think that movies can be entertaining for children and adults and be powerful.

It's characters are curt, wholesome characters, the humor I found boring and undermining to the likes of Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz. Do they really need to work so badly as to diminish themselves to hidden comedy. It's a far cry from their acting abilities so well demonstrated in the likes of \\"The Golden Child\\", and \\"Something About Mary\\". Cummon, do they need to make themselves so invisible here?If you like comedy, go find the artistic expression in its live form; bury this \\"Toy Story\\" nonsense already. It's played out with Tom Hanks. Give me something like the presence of Paula Poundstone or Rodney Dangerfield, live. Even Rodney strut his \\"stuff\\" in \\"Caddyshack\\". :) And please, let the kids find something less contrived to laugh at, like the \\"Tubbies\\" or \\"Smerfs\\".

All of the celebrated humor is really just pandering pop-culture referencing of the dumbest kind.

Mike Myers as Shrek is so likebale and I don't think there has ever been a better hero.Cameron Diaz is feisty, fun, and yes even sexy as Princess Fiona. However Eddie Murphy steals the show with a hysterical performance as Donkey. I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard.

It is just about Farquaad's henchman, Thelonious, kidnapping Fiona. And it is onlysixteen minutes. I don't know why I ever liked this movie. If youstill don't know why the plot is stupid, here's more:Shrek and Fiona have just married. While relaxing in the forest,Thelonious kidnaps Fiona. Shrek and Donkey set out on an adventure to save Fiona but that all just gets worse when Farquaad rises from the dead to steal Fiona away from Shrek.In comparison to other Dreamworks movies:The Cat In The Hat*****Shrek****Shrek 2*****I did not like this movie because it was too short and again, the plot is stupid.

He fell asleep but I was curious, so I watched it. This is a great movie that sort of throws all the other classic tales out the window. Involved in the story are Shrek, his donkey, a man wanting to be king, and a princess named Fiona. Shrek is forced to go and resque Fiona from her prison/or castle guarded by a huge dragon. As they near her new home, the donkey discovers Fiona has a horrible secret that could bring her and Shrek together. Shrek overhears and goes to get the king, angry at her for keeping it a secret.

I must admit that I found it surprisingly good. I think the more I watch it, the funnier it gets. Donkey (voice of Eddie Murphy) is the perfect comic relief. While Shrek is quite crude at times and frequently is just downright vulgur, the \\"moral of the story\\" is driven home in a big way with a somewhat surprise ending. Overall, I recommend Shrek to any teen or adult. However, parents be cautioned. This movie may not be appropriate for young children."},{"rating":"2","title":"40 Times and Counting!","review":"My two and a half year old can't get enough of this movie.

I get my hopes up, believing that Shrek will entertain me and all that, but I was a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong. It was a hilarious movie with a cute story line, but I don't think I can consider it the best movie of the year. Yes, the donkey, or I should say Eddie Murphy, does do a great job with the little humorous dialogue here and there but it just needed a little bit more from every character.The day before I rented Shrek, I saw the movie Monsters Inc.. I definetly compared the two and I thought Monsters a more all around cute, hilarious, and great story line movie. This is probably my source of comparison and is probably where my synicism arised from. I guess the two movies are very much different but I definetly believe Shrek really uncomparable to Monsters Inc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A change of heart","review":"I wrote a review titled \\"Entertaining\\" a short while ago (see below) praising Shrek while saying that the Donkey was annoying. Seeing it again I can now appreciate the humour of the character more, I suppose he's too frenetic at first impression.And I say again that the \\"adult\\" content is very mild, and much worse is watched by kids on TV every day. And poot humour is something that all kids find funny, like it or not. But I still think the film is too short!BTW the Shrek DVD I managed to obtain had an added 15 minute 3D section in an extra disc. If you liked the original you'll love Shrek in 3D!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shrek Dreck","review":"One of those rare occasions where I dramatically disagreed with society, I found SHREK to be entirely predicable and, rarely, engaging. The jabs at the commercialization of fairy tales (aka Disneyland, Universal Theme Parks, etc.) were wonderful touches for the adults in the audience, but they were lessened by the idiocy of fart and/or belch jokes. Alas, Eddie Murphy voices one of the major characters for the CGI flick, and I believe he maintains a clause in his contract for a relative number of gaseous jokes.It's definitely worth a view. My tastes in comedy do differ from the mainstream, but rarely have they diverged as widely as they did with SHREK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong product and I'm 99 percent sure that it is pirated!","review":"Our story is simple. We ordered Shrek 1 and we received Shrek 2, a movie that we already owned. Not too big of a deal since we didn't pay very much for the item. There was something about the movie that seemed fishy, however. The DVD cover seemed to be printed on someone's home printer. Upon opening the case, it was easy to see that the movie had been burned at home as well (the graphics on the DVD itself were fuzzy and illegible). When we ordered the movie, we were told that it was a \\"two-disc special edition\\", apparently that meant that disc one contained half the movie and disc two the other half! On top of that the quality of the picture was terrible... yep, definitely pirated. We'll probably just end up throwing the movie away. In conclusion, not the best buyer/seller transaction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"shrek 3d is absolute sh*t, not what you think, dont buy it.","review":"Such [...] I can't stand it.

I know my nieces and nephew would greatly enjoy it, but will not get the chance to because of the profanity. I counted 3 profane words. It's a shame that those same 3 words will cause lots of kids not to see this funny movie, when those 3 words added NOTHING to the plot. I thought animated movies were supposed to be for kids.

I just watched Shrek for the first time. As an adult, I actually really liked it. But it definitely had some language not appropriate for my little kids--and not just \\"jackass\\" \\"kiss ass\\" and the other witty statements about the donkey. They had \\"crap,\\" a song with the repeated chorus \\"I don't give a damn,\\" and about a dozen \\"shut up's.\\" So if you're ok with a mild amount of cursing, the movie is fine. It ranks right up there with Cars and Toy Story.

My seven year old son saw it almost 6 times while it was still in theatres, and he was just as eager to see it when we watched it at home.

I am a cartoom-movie fan so I especially liked it because it was unusual and funny, but still a nice fairy tale and very well drawn and animated. The animation is actually absolutely brilliant, it really looks more like a movie than a cartoon!I think some kids can watch this movie and enjoy the fairy tale aspect, but on the other hand, I think that some kids around 7 and 8 won't get, as one reviewer objected, some of the jokes, which are actually not targeted for that age, but more for a late teen and adult audience. I would not say the jokes are downright dirty, some have a double meaning but they are not vulgar or offensive and I don't see the need to get offended. I would not buy it specifically for a kid, but it is a movie that the whole family can watch together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full Screen = Dont Buy","review":"Went to store to buy this, but since the first DVD is FullScreen, forget it!

The rest of the book simply repeats what other books and websites claim about psoriasis and nutrition. The book is based on what I consider to be an unproven theory that psoriasis has its origins in toxins that build up in the body. The book provides no proof of this but simply goes with that assumption and describes foods that could possibly act as triggers for psoriasis flare-ups. The price of the book is relatively cheap and the dietary guidelines will certainly help improve overall health even if they don't have any impact on healing psoriasis.

The best read-alouds are the ones in which the children beg for \\"one more chapter\\" and the adult reader enthusiastically complies. This book met both criteria.The most impressive aspect of this book was its ability to be a very upbeat, positive story while not shrinking away from the sad details of poverty.

Finally the family settles in a place where Janey makes friends, but it is inevitable that they will have to leave when there is no more work.

Essie's site recommends it for french manicures, but I just use it on it's own. I was frustrated with opaque polishes because chipping is so obvious, but I wanted something a bit more exciting than clear. Essie No-Prenup fits the bill perfectly! One or two coats gives your nails a natural, healthy, rosy tint but is sheer enough that mistakes and chipping are not obvious. It's a clean and simple look. Love, love, love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect everyday color","review":"This pink is fantastic with my fair skin tone, although I'd imagine it's pretty much universally flattering. One coat gives your nails a super-sheer wash of ballet-slipper pink. If you prefer a more opaque finish, it's as easy as a few extra coats. The polish dries with a lightly shiny finish- not at all shimmery, but just glossy enough that I didn't need a top coat. Word of advice: if you like this color, DEFINITELY order from amazon. Any other site will charge about $8 for the same polish."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was very happy with Nuvo","review":"I purchased nail polish from this company.

Not for me though, I like my colors more saturated, even with a Fnch.ManiFollow up April 30, 2011: I went to the local salon, and found this shade, and guess what? this shade is not sheer. It is semi opaque. A few coats will give solid coverage. And the color is a creamy soft pink; not like the one I purchased on Amazon. Don't know what is up with the distributor; not the seller. Very disapointed, 'cause I have had to return 3 nail lacquers thus far; and without return shipping reimbursement.Update: The seller did reimburse one way shipping charges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great polish!!!","review":"I never write review but I felt like I needed to do this for this product.

I have a lot of red in my skin and dark, bright polishes seem to emphasize this. I have tried Essie Ballet Slippers and Essie Mademoiselle, but found them to be just a bit lighter than what I wanted and it also took at least four coats to produce the desired result. Who has time for that? Two coats of Delicacy covers well; three is better followed by Essie topcoat. My nails look neat, finished and not bare but they don't scream \\"I've been polished\\" either. The polish has just enough pink to give definition with a very slight pearl appearance. It's a perfect shade for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Color","review":"the perfect white color i've been looking for. not too sheer, not too white-out looking. definitely need at least 2 coats, but the finished product is gorgeous and simply classic. bought from the same third party seller i've purchased most of my nail polish from. no issues. thanks amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great color","review":"I ordered this essie nail colour FED UP its beautiful color I really liked it , I was wearing it at a party my friend gave at his house and he even noticed it and said he really likes the color ,and there were guests there the women gave me a lot of compliments too and asked what colour it was and what brand so I told them everything and where they can buy for lower prices,again thank you amazon for great beauty products you carry for lower prices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous - as usual!","review":"Quick, solid delivery, product is as gorgeous as I was hoping it would be!

The book is so detailed that it makes it difficult for students to get the \\"big picture\\" out of every concept covered. Every time I tried to read chapters of this for my class, I would fall asleep. I talked to other friends who were in my class. Everyone agreed that this book was plain horrible to read.

For me the book was a pointless journey, and in the end it was completely meaningless. It made me angry that I got hooked on the story so quickly, only to find absolutely no meaning and no redeeming qualities in the end. A total waste of time. Too bad. It could have been fantastic.

There are also peices which are up-beat and fast moving which can get you going for the day(works for me!). But, if you don't especially like piano music, I suggest you don't buy it. There was this one guy who hated piano music, but he bought the cd, and what do ya know: he hated it! Big surprise huh? Anyway, you be the judge.

If there was a musical definition of the word 'relaxed', this would be it. There's 'Apalachian Spring' in Dubuque, the first track, that all-American feel, that 'I've just arrived in New York' feel of promise, and possibility. Tracks 2 and 3 roll one through Winston's theme's which he like's to return to later. Like greeting an old friend, Winston remakes melodies and when he does, you feel you've come home.

The \\"Jam & Lewis\\" cut \\"The Heat of Heat\\" is Patti at her soulful best with the songs \\"Only A Breath Away\\" & \\"Honey For The Bees\\" fast on it's heels. For the fans, who like me fell under Patti's spell with her \\"Quiet Storm\\" sound, she comes through with the hypnotic \\"Summer Is The Coldest Time of year\\" and the lush \\"If I Believe\\". My only gripe is that the single/video version of the title track as well as the extended 12 inch mixes of \\"The Heat of Heat\\" and \\"Only A Breath Away\\" are not included as a bonus cuts.

Many of Norton's books feature people or animals/aliens that are interesting and easy to like. Not so here. Telepathy is prominent in this story, but here it is strictly between humans, and it far less interesting than other Norton stories involving animal telepathy. There is plenty of action, but not enough background to care about it. Despite all the action, I experienced mostly boredom, and not suspense.

The price is high for socks that do not wear as well as the old ones.Be aware of the different types - Fluffies are rayon/nylon blend - Cushion Fluffies have thick soles (OK if that is what you need, they are warmer and you need some extra room in the shoe, might be tight if you have cushion sole inserts) - Cotton Fluffies are a completely different type, not as elastic, a little more absorbent, stiffer as they age, holes develop quicker."},{"rating":"1","title":"smaller than they used to be & falling apart","review":"I have bought gold toe fluffies for 30 years, but I am afraid I have to agree with some of the earlier reviewers.

In the last century it was pioneered by the Germans, then experimented with by other nations. It ended with the Germans as well when the Hindenburg exploded in front of newsreel cameras. Most books look only at the Hindenburg disaster, ignoring the crashes of the R101, Akron, Shenandoah and others. Toland tells the story of them all, including accounts of ten disasters. It will soon become clear to any reader that the airship had more 'tragedy' than 'triumph' of course. It is a wonder they lasted as long as they did.The only fault I found with this book is that Toland devotes all his efforts to telling individual stories. These are necessary and interesting, but more attention could have been given to other aspects of the matter, such as parallel aviation developments or political events."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Dirigibles","review":"Good book high in personal details, but lacking in technical insight, basicly describes, a series of airship disasters from individuals personal point of view.

In \\"Potatoes not Prozac\\" a high-carb plus protein diet is advocated. Dr. Joel Robertson in his \\"Natural Prozac\\" states that protein is a dopamine booster. Who should one believe?

Fat would slow the action of the carbohydrates, so turkey on rice is better than turkey on rice with gravy for absorbing tryptophan. However, high carbohydrates trigger the release of serotonin. If it is night and you are going to bed, that might be good.

I had never heard the song in its entirety, and it clocked in at just above 7 minutes long. Loverboy and Suddenly are also good songs, but not enough for me to rate it higher than a disappointment with the artist as a whole. This is another one of those Cds I found at Wal Mart for 5 bucks. I guess they're still trying to make their money back from the first press. Didn't even include credits, and no lyrics in the package."},{"rating":"2","title":"An 80's classic","review":"Billy Ocean fused R&B/soul with pop/rock and ended up with an excellent album. \\"Carribean Queen\\" and \\"Loverboy\\" are both must-have 80's hits, and this album is the best place to hear them, because the versions here are much longer than the radio edits on his greatest hits CD! But then again, every song on this album is great, and the heartfelt cover of the Beatles' \\"Long and Winding Road\\" should win over people who don't normally appreciate 80's music. But if you are a fan of the 80's, you definitely need this album, and if you aren't, get it anyway!"},{"rating":"2","title":"His best album.","review":"Truth be known, I'd probably keep this over his \\"Hits\\" disc. I say that because three of his absolute best songs are here in their original form, and some of his other hits border on cheese. Plus there's other good stuff here too. \\"Caribbean Queen (no more love on the run)\\" was a huge hit, as was the ballad \\"Suddenly\\", and I think my favorite is easily \\"Loverboy\\". Plus this has the minor hit \\"Mystery Lady\\", and a decent cover of \\"The Long And Winding Road\\". That's over half the album, and the remaining four songs I'd call good filler.

An excellent voice with modern (80's) pop rhythms made for a very danceable and pleasureable listen then. Standouts are 'Caribbean Queen'(the Extended version almost 8 minutes!), 'Loverboy'(contains the longer intro than on the radio version), and the ballad 'Suddenly'(one of the best love songs of the era).

This is a light, melodous downtempo electronic pop with many ambient-like properties. It's much easier to meditate to this CD than it is to dance to it (but I still can't help squirming rhythmically as I lay and listen). I generally only appreciate music that alters my mood significantly, and the sounds on this double-CD LP whisk me away to a magical land of childish groove and funk, where love abounds, and fears and judgements are absent. Not a religous or preachy album, if you were afraid of that, but rather it permeates a distant, dreamy joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful.","review":"Most live albums are distracting to listen to because of the audience in the background and the less-than-quality sound. Though you do hear the occasional clapping and cry from the tables at Sin-E, the sound is high quality. The versions of \\"Eternal Life\\" (acoustic) and \\"Dream Brother\\" are gorgeous. I've had this for awhile, and only recently discovered what gems the two cover songs are. The french song is not your average Buckley cover, but then what IS your average Buckley cover? He sang everything from MC5, Elton John, Billie Holiday, the Smiths...the list goes on.

There's almost 300 pages of material that comes packaged with VBA--it's the entire Word object model, accessible through the Object Browser. Why did Mackenzie include this? Perhaps because a 270 book on Word VBA doesn't look nearly as impressive as a 600 page book on VBA.A better reference for Word development is Guy Hart-Davis' \\"Word 2000 Developer's Handbook,\\" which is not a stellar book but is MUCH better than Makenzie's.

The last 250 pages is strictly a listing of the object models for Word and ADO (with very little elaboration).It contains very few programming tricks; a few programming practice recommendations; medium amount of simple examples; no troubleshooting or common mistakes section.This book is OK for someone that doesn't like to use the object browser & help file because it doesn't give you much more than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"GI Joe new jeep for 12 inch figure","review":"I got the canvas top on it and it is an outstanding toy, yes it is a toy, plastic it is and breakable. I looked everywhere for a jeep for the 12 inch GI Joe and if it's used it's broken somewhere and scuffed up. This jeep is an original item, with the canvas top it looks magnificent!! It is for my grandson who is named just Joe after his daddy who is in the Navy Reserves and the figure looks just like his daddy. Also, the figure has great moveable fingers so he can grip anything. Only using guns to hunt down play dinosaurs. Very expensive, but nobody else has an item like this. Very happy I spent the extra $100 for it, it is for Christmas so what the hek!I have looked again to see if something like this is available, nothing like it yet is on line, very rare item, the jeep is huge!

It has many examples with the entire source code to run different client and server programs. Although, I understand this might be a book for beginners, I was hoping to find out how to code a server for a very high volume of client connections. The book explains how to use the ThreadPool, but that is only good for up to 25 clients per CPU. The book also shows an example creating a thread for each client connection, but if there are hundreds of connections that will require the creation of hundreds of threads. So, the book does not really give any answers to the issue with large number of connections.Still, I enjoyed reading this book very much, but I feel that I might need to get a more advanced book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book - deserves way more credit that it's getting","review":"I really found this book to be highly informative. I credit this one for helping me learn most of what I know about C# socket level programming. Topics covered various non-blocking methods including asynchronous processing via delegates, using threads both manually and with threadpools. He even included sections on how to handle incoming connections by polling. I also liked his \\"when TCP goes bad\\" chpater which discusses how to use .NET to circumvent errors and inconsistencies in transmission.Yes, this book does tackle tricky programming issues - but that's the nature of socket programming. If you want to get the most out of this book, read it several times and start writing your own programs using the techniques described. I spent quite a bit of time with this book writing a light-weight custom HTTP server using what I learned from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"I used a number of books as references for a server project in C#, including the \\"TCP/IP Sockets in C#\\" book referenced in another review, but that book is more geared toward academic use (though to his credit I emailed one of the authors of the book regarding multithreading issues that were not addressed in print and he was very responsive, so I support the purchase of that book to round out your sockets library as well). Blum's book provided far more practical advice relating to my project and was the one I consistently returned to for reference. I had an issue not addressed directly in the book, did a Google search on it and found the answer...by the book's author in an online discussion forum!In short, it is virtually impossible to find a book that addresses every last real-world gotcha inherent in starting any new project with a new language and class library as vast as .NET's, but if you have a C# sockets project to do then I can't recommend another book more than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Response to the person from Canada","review":"In response to :\\"I was hoping to find out how to code a server for a very high volume of client connections. The book explains how to use the ThreadPool, but that is only good for up to 25 clients per CPU...\\"Actually, there is a technique to handle hundreds of clients, but the way to communicate with them all requires them all to be in an array. Then, like in a merge sort algorithm, divide and conquer with separate threads working on each division, sending and receiving data. If you think this out, it would end up becoming a pretty well optimized way to handle this amount of workload. Hope that helped."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure box of Memories...","review":"This book is something a little different from what you might ordinarily read.

One thing to know about it, however is that the information is presented more in a 'conversational' style than an 'encylopedia' style. If you are looking for a traditional 'field guide' type style with color-coded cross-references and the like, you may want to look elsewhere. However, if you don't mind a more casual presentation of the information - and it is that way in this book - then this one is for you.

Unfortunately, in certain vehicles (including the '90-'93 Protege), it will only allow you to install a 2-shaft stereo. The front of the manual says to get the he 99-7501 for DIN units.

I have read a few novels and a short story of his recently, but I read this book before all those. Stableford's advice is extensive and used a lot of examples to illustrate points about speculative fiction writing. However, his book falls short in presentation because it uses a lot of continuous text, which can be tiring and monotonous for those whose attention control needs an extra kick. There is a lot to learn from this book, but its presentation could be greatly improved by using a graphic manner. There certainly are some perspectives and points about science fiction and fantasy writing that can be garnered from Stableford, though, so I don't think I wasted my P279.

The characters were more than a little idealistic, but I enjoyed watching idealism far more than the cynical and demoralizing messages that are more common.I wondered about one flaw though: Maybe I'm wrong, but I believe there was a reference to the president being 6 1/2 years into his presidency. This would mean the following year was an election year. Why on earth would there be such a cutthroat bid for the vice-presidency, when the appointee would only be there for 1 1/2 years. If they wanted to eventually run for president, wouldn't they already be conducting their campaigns by that point? Just an tiny oversight on Lurie's part, but it makes the movie's depiction of the deadliness of the pursuit for this office rather improbable.

It is not about liberals, or conservatives. The main character in this movie happens to be a female liberal democrat, but the movie would have been just as effectve with the protagonist a republican, and Mr. Runyan a democrat.This movie IS about a woman telling the media they have no right to learn about what went on in her private sexual life years ago. Despite what the pundits will try to convince you of, an individual's sexual past has no effect on his or her ability to serve the public. This movie is about someone sticking to their values, \\"even when it is not convenient to do so.\\"Do not make this movie into a political battle.

To applaud is against my principles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic, Repulsive","review":"If I could have chosen 0 stars, i would have! This was a pathetic, repulsive movie.

Huh?...Her defiance to answering any questions on her supposed past indiscretions rests on the lofty principle that women should also have the freedom to participate in fraternity orgies and not have it reflect on their character. Oh yeah, and anyone who expects more from their leaders is a hypocrite. Joan Allen does a great job promoting moral relativism, acting earnest, and looking great in an evening gown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, great performances...","review":"This film lives up to the reputation I encountered before first watching it - a wonderful return to the long absent genre of quality political thrillers. The story is well woven, if a little predictable, and the characters are exceptionally well played. Joan Allen, Geoff Bridges and Gary Oldman all pull off outstanding performances - if forced to choose I would have to say that Oldman clinched it for me. His character portrayal was nothing short of brilliant.If there was a downside it had to be the inevitability of the outcome - but then this is Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to my intelligence","review":"Pretentious and preachy script ruined the excellent premise and the first 30 minutes of intriguing beginning. I am a BIG fan of films on politics (just ask my wife), but this movie simply failed to deliver any subtlty and inspiration. As entertainment, it succeeded by having first rate actors executing well (Gary Oldman was wonderful as usual). But as a film of art, this movie was pretentious and simple-minded, and characters have black & white-like stereotypes with absolutely no convincing development. What a waste as I had such high hope and high expectation :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really plausible...","review":"This film left me underwhelmed. I suppose the movie worked on a potboiler level, but the politics were pretty one-sided &the characters too one-note. There aren't really any moments in which the characters have internal struggles They all are pretty much set in their ways. No one seems morally torn by the issues at hand (unlike a film like \\"Quiz Show\\") this is fine, i suppose, but not as interesting as the material could be. Joan Allen was fine as Laine Hanson, but the character was underwritten. She has principles, I understand, but the way that the movie exonerates her is pretty ridiculous. She's as much a saint as Selma in Dancer in the Dark, but this movie has no sense of irony & expects us to accept her as is. Oh well...Particularly infuriating are Bridges' speech to congress & the following applause, but the film is filled with Capra-esque flourishes that simply don't work in a modern political film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious Liberal Preaching","review":"I expected to see a well made suspense thriller based on the description and the endorsements that are on the DVD cover. Well there's no doubt that those critics who gave the thumbs up for this movie lean far to the left. A hollow script portrays all Republicans as evil, scheming, women haters and Democrats are portrayed as righteous upholders of freedom. The story is so polarizing and pretentious that it lacks any credibility. The plot gets so ridiculous that the movie almost becomes a parody of the ideology that it tries to exalt.On the positive side, the acting and filming are good but it's not enough to make up for the corny and manipulative nature of the script."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent political drama","review":"This is a fascinating story about DC-style hard ball, this time merging with feminism and sexual politics. Not only are the mechanisms of government well portrayed, but the ideals of this country are reaffirmed in a realistic way. I found this to be rivetting drama with some interesting surprises and some superb acting. In many ways, what is most interesting about it is what the VP nominee - a principled, shrewd and tough woman - decides not to do than what she ultimately does. None of it seemed wooden or formulaic to me, and it was not by any means a simple politically correct film. This is the kind of republic we have, for better more than for worse. In a time when I am extremely pessimistic, I found this moving and inspiring.Warmly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! Gross!! Thumbs down!!!","review":"Lots of political action ... too bad it has to be so biased. If you are a normal, decent American, you will hate this film because it puts down decency and morality at every turn. If the producers want the movie characters to play politicians who do not like to \\"be in people's bedrooms\\", then at least do it with some class. Have them say \\"Americans have a right to privacy\\", not something like 'You are the new version of McCarthy' or 'My past has nothing to do with my going for this job'. Sound familiar, America? (Hint: Clinton)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Film","review":"This movie was so terrible I couldnt stand to watch it after awhile. I was rather insulted that the lame speeches the president made in the film were coupled with rousing music and cheers from those playing the senators.

Anyway, there are far better movies to spend your money on besides this garbage. Too few that are better than this to name."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad","review":"This is an awful movie. The acting is so over-scripted -- and while the script is just sort of bad, not that bad, it has a good premise -- the acting is terrible. And I generally like these actors. And yesh -- YEEECH -- the ending, it makes it even worse. While the movie has a good cast and premise, all along it gets worse and worse. See it for yourself, if you want, but as the movie goes along it puts the toxic icing on the concrete cake."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"This picture started as a reasonably competent thriller. By the time Joan Allen delivered her closing speech at the confirmation hearing with the music rising,the absurd surprise plot twist, and Jeff Bridges' ridiculous call for a roll call, I had to apologize to my DVD player for being violated for the previous two hours. My only enjoyment out of this picture was an excellent performance by Jeff Bridges and a wildly over the top one by Sam Elliot. A film about the President (Bridges) probably would have been a better movie. What a load of hooey!"},{"rating":"1","title":"biased baloney","review":"I saw this film at a movie theater, and it is the most biased, pretentious and silly political movie ever made.

While a bit hokey and manipulative at times, this is a mostly satisfying diversion in an era where good film drama is in painfully short supply. It's worth watching if only for the stellar performances of Allen and Bridges. On the other hand Gary Oldman, whose last decent performance was in JFK, gives his usual look-at-me-aren't-I-the -grand-thespian performance. His scenery chewing has, for me, grown tiresome."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke","review":"I approximately halfway thru this movie and unless it makes a big U-turn, this is one of the absolute worst films I have ever seen.A vice president possible president pulled a train.

The Conservative will end up being a murderer, and the female candidate will be anointed Pope.

Save yourself the money of buying this dog, and know that the female Democrat becomes VP. The Republican is disgraced (shocking...SHOCKING, i say) in this badly written, lamely acted \\"behind the scenes\\" yawn-o-rama of political \\"intrigue\\".Joan Allen shows precisely one emotion: stoicism. That's it. She's accused of being promiscuous--she's stoic. She's accused of being pro-abortion--she's stoic. She's accused of being a prostitute--she's stoic. BORING.Rotten movie.

This is the first movie I've ever sat through that I wanted my money back. If I wasn't such a huge Gary Oldman fan I would have gotten up and walked out. Oldman always plays a really strong character, which is how his character started out in this movie. Then the writer or whoever found it necessary to turn him into a snivling coward which I found completely unbelievable considering the character he was playing. The plot was preposterous, predictable, and infuriating.

It certainly had a fine cast. I hope we have such a film one day.Skipping over the far wing rhetoric on today's debates, there were too many holes in this film. As often the case of strictly armchair *authors*, the ends justify the means and to blazes with supportive/coraborative evidence/scenes. (i.e., the car incident, home movie, witness statements, live interview, etc..)A rewrite with informed consultants and a director with at least one foot in reality could go on to create a classic. Again, the premise and cast are fine. Perhaps the political machine mechanizations deserve better revelation as per trade-offs and compromises.

The first thirty minutes of the film, which would have been totally dead had it not been for Gary Oldman, lays all the groundwork for what looks like to be an engrossing, thrilling movie. But as the clock ticks, you quickly become disgusted, and by the end (especially the scene with the 'President' portrayed by Jeff Bridges addressing a joint session of Congress) you feel like hurling your remote at the television.The idea was solid, but the movie just gets it all wrong. \\"A First Rate Thriller\\" it's not."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice book","review":"It's a cute book but definitely not as nice as \\"Daddies are for catching fireflies\\".

According to this book, Mommies are for fixing boo-boos, making breakfast, driving kids around, and my personal favorite \\"TAKING CARE OF EVERYONE!\\" While this may be the reality in many households, I don't think these are concepts that need to be reinforced in a book. I find this book particularly annoying when contrasted with the Daddy version, in which Daddies apparently fix broken toys (I'd love to see my husband fix anything that's broken...he's got NO mechanical sense), \\"GO TO WORK,\\" read books \\"and fall asleep, too.\\" These books might as well have been written in the 50s.

The daddy book is adorable, it's all about how great daddy's are, how they do all these fun events with you. Then I read the mommy book.

It certainly glamorises drugs, as the characters never receive any ill effects in the film's duration. Even 'Trainspotting' managed to address the dangers of drugs. Worst of all is the ending - a tacked on who-dunnit that doesn't blend into the rest of the story.

American Beauty is one of those films that will be remembered because of it's content, and in my opinion should be rated as one of the 100 best films of all time!

I didn't even make it to the half-way point of this film yet the extreme bad vibrations stayed with me for a good long while afterwards. Do yourself a favor, stay away from this cesspool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy, disturbing opus. Excellent actors.","review":"Regardless of how good the actors are -- and yes, they are excellent -- AmBeauty is not for everyone. In my opinion, the Oscars belonged to The Insider ...YOU'LL LIKE THIS MOVIE IF: If you just love it whenever the media probes into the dysfunctional aspects of American suburban life. If you buy the premise that in order to attain true freedom, one must travel the roads of rebellion, of irresponsibility, and of destruction. (Hey, if you buy that, here's a karmic insight: Hollywood and TV gonna make lotsa $ off of you!)YOU WON'T LIKE THIS MOVIE IF: If you can't stand a creepy, disturbing, depressing showcase of moral decay, middle-America style. If you are a rock-ribbed, apple pie, conservative right-winger who believes in white picket fences (in which case, you'd better watch Leave It To Beaver instead.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"But it has its flaws...","review":"Namely, there was no reason to show Mena Suvari's breasts-a comment made by another reviewer that I hadn't thought about until I read that particular review. Also, are we to think that Kevin Spacey's character WOULD have had sex with an underage girl had he NOT found out she was a virgin??? This point is completely ignored and, upon reflection, takes some of the movie's luster away. However, I found the movie to be great nonetheless. So much of it rang true, even amongst the cliches, that it made a lasting impression. Given the passion that this film has created, I suggest renting it first, though I think most will end up buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another cliched look at Suburbia.","review":"Yes, everyone is having some type of crisis in this movie, after all they live in Suburbia don't they? The actors do a good job with the material provided, but the script is so loaded with cliches that no amount of acting ability can bring the characters to life. 'The Ice Storm' provides a more detailed (and believable) look at suburban families in crisis. 'American Beauty' on the other hand tries to substitute cynicism for insight. This is pretty commonplace these days. It gives screenwriters the chance to congratulate themselves for 'deep' material and film critics the chance to use terms like 'dysfunctional family'. It doesn't make a great movie however. Worth a rental if you haven't seen it, just to see what the buzz is (or was) about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanted","review":"Hello, I am a teacher of English in Germany and I am planning to talk about the movie American Beauty in class.

It just means that the movie really proved to be thought-provoking and rough. Getting a strong reaction for a work of art, whether good or bad, generally means you're doing something new and meaningful--something hard to ignore.This movie didn't make me want to molest teens, do drugs, or hate my parents; if you think that's what it's about you're obviously too cynical ... to watch any movie. I left this movie, enlightened by the simple, beautiful idea that there is true beauty in the banal.And that is something to be treasured.

Kevin Spacey's performance was outstanding as was the performance of Annete Benning and the rest of his co-stars. The twists in the plot and true fellings people have are shown dramatically and perfectly. The insight and true genius is only surpassed by the true accuracy of the movie.

But anyway.....GO SEE AMERICAN BEAUTY and LOOK CLOSER"},{"rating":"2","title":"'Beauty' Shines In All Directions","review":"After a 5-month wait, I finally saw the movie, and boy was it worth it. The script is great, the cinematography astounding, great directing, and the greatest performance of a cast. All of the are amazing, but boy does Kevin Spacey do wonders. I have never seen him funnier, and he gave the movie so much life. He is too often ignored by the Academy, and I pray that he does not get robbed of what is rightfully hison Oscar night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordinary People for 2000","review":"This really is a dreary little film. In years to come it will be remembered just as Ordinary People is today, one that swept the awards boards back then, by now has absolutely no bite whatsoever. The acting is horrible, the script very weak, the directing very dull (Mendes should stick to running his theatre in London, though shouldn't direct anything there again). All in all a waste of time. I would say I'm surprised at the response of the general public to the mess that is American Beauty, but then that's the power of the media for you: they tell us what's good, most people believe them. Please start thinking for yourself people. Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disgrace to The Academy.","review":"It is the worst film in the history of the Academy Awards. They should be ashamed of themselves for choosing this garbage to be the best picture of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hateful piece of filmmaking","review":"This movie is so hateful, so loatheful of human existence that it's the most painful experience. The writer obviously hates women because The Annette Bening is such a stereotypical picture of women. She should wear a sign that says, \\"What she needs is a really good shag.\\" That's about as subtle as the writer is with her character. Kevin Spacey again shows why he is the worst respected actor working today. It's the same performance he has given in every one of his movies. This guy's act never changes. Skip this overbloated piece of manure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kevin Spacey 1 star/The rest of the movie was INSULTING!!","review":"I purchased this movie in hope that I would be receiving a 5 star movie. This movie was a great idea if you cut out Lester's fantasy of his daughter's best friend & his wife screwing around. This movie is obviously not intended for children to even be in the room. It was insulting to see Spacey so hung over a girl that he could have had as his daughter. I enjoyed Spacey's comedy that he added to the movie but, other than that you may just want to pass this one up. It is very over rated in my book. Don't let me be the judge though. Sorry to the people who love this movie but, I DO NOT recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star for Direction","review":"The director deserves credit for the usual things a director must do to complete a movie. And my accolades stop there.This is, on my personal list, the #2 worse movie I've seen in the last 10 years. If you are a person of morals and think Hollywood is morally bankrupt and celebrate their immorality then this movie is proof of that belief. It is a microcosm of liberalism where all the \\"hero\\" or \\"good\\" characters are disfunctional (drug users, adulterers, liars, blackmailers, voyeurs, etc). This movie won Best Picture for one reason -- payback for Forrest Gump which was widely hated by the Hollywood elite for it's virtues. Watch at your own risk, but be wary of impressionable children and teenagers watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Beauty is not Pretty.","review":"This is a disturbing film. The Academy Award judges(who are so far removed from middle class America) were convinced that this represents America and picked it as best picture. At the same time, the movie going audience who are probably the same people who worship televsion shows like Jerry Springer and Jenny Jones spent their money to watch a rehash of what they like to watch on tv. It's hard to make heads of what the point of this movie is about except that middle America is really screwed-up. One goes to the movies for escapism, and not to be reminded of how bad and dangerous real life can be. The producers, writers, director probably knew the same kind of girls I knew in high school, because their portrayal in this movie nails it right on the head."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT is the BIG DEAL?","review":"I absolutely cannot believe that this movie won an Oscar. This has convinced me to never watch the Oscars again since it is obviously a \\"political\\" organization. This movie was just dumb AND disgusting in its semi-pedophilic theme. I am not a prude but I could hardly stomach Kevin Spacey's behavior. With all the discussions about \\"family values\\" I was also disappointed with the complete lack of reverance in this family and their attempt to spoof (which fell flat,by the way). I am tremendously thankful I did not waste my money at the theatre. Wasting my money on a rental was bad enough. This was the WORST movie I have seen in a very long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"MPAA and AMPAS must be crazy","review":"AMPAS is nuts giving \\"American Beauty\\" the Oscar for Best Picture. The MPAA is nuts giving \\"American Beauty\\" an \\"R\\" rating. If anything, this movie should be rated \\"NC-17\\". This movie was too much to handle, even for a \\"see-anything-once\\" moviegoer like me. I mean, over-the-top black comedy, bare breasts and masterbating sequences makes this movie all the more unfair for its rating. And the ending was so bloody and disturbing, I could barely lay my eyes on the screen. There are many people out there who should NOT see this movie; if you are anywhere under 18 or the type who cringes just by pouring ketchup on your fries or taking off a calculator cover, I recommend to the highest extent you not see this movie. This is unacceptable material to hit theatres or video, it strays far from it's innocent image. Whatever age you are, don't see this movie. You'll be glad you didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Just Shows How Low Movies Today Will Get!","review":"Though the acting & directing were suberb the plot was crude, disgusting, & not a movie to spend one cent on. My brother, friends, & cousin went to see this movie as a group because of the great ratings. By the middle of the movie we had lost three members of our group who had bought tickets to another film. The film which was originally a teen flick turned out to be a 5 time Academy Award winner & went to become one of the most hated movies of 99.

Wrong is right?","review":"4 stars for the crisp cinematography, flawless performances, and incomparable artistry.0 stars for the mindless message.Poor Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey). Society pushes him to the breaking point and then punishes him for breaking. Can't a guy just be left alone to pursue his own depravity (taking drugs, having sex with children) and not have to worry about responsibility? This is all \\"the man's\\" fault. \\"Yuh know whut I'm sayin', mofo?\\"Mean old capitalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off","review":"This movie was good but it rip off one of the best movies of the 90'es a film called Happiness. A brillent protray of the dark side of Suburbia. I will admit American Beauty had better photography but thats about it there are so many things the same with both movies. The only two difference is Happiness came out a year earler (thats why its riping it off) and Happiness is way more contreversail and is for adults only before you watch American Beauty watch Happiness than you decide."},{"rating":"2","title":"A joy","review":"One of my favorite movies. It just seems so honest and well great. So many complex relationships that all tie together in that they all end up unraveling. I think I'm just rambling now. It's great, beautifully (done)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"This is the greatest movie outit's about a man with a useless life who sets out to change his life forever ... and quits his highly paid job to work at a fast food outlet. This is a move for anyone who wonders if their is any depth behind your average family seeing thi you'll definetly think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie Makes You Think","review":"I wanted to see American Beauty a long time ago, but a friend commented on how this movie was \\"only about sex.\\" No doubt she was completely wrong and if some of you gave it a few stars, you must've merely glanced at its surface. American Beauty the dysfunctional emotions that occur within a seemingly \\"normal\\" family. It makes you think of life itself. The acting was really, really good. I'm not going to repeat the plotline, but everyone with a mature mind must see this movie. It is, indeed, a level higher than the typical movies out now that offer only surface-entertainment value."},{"rating":"2","title":"one my favorite movies","review":"American beauty, how can I really talk about this movie? I've seen it many times and it really stands out to me as showing some normal people with a slight twist to them. It's not your typical movie, but that's good. The cinematography and Kevin Spacey really make this movie classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"I was not impressed with this movie despite its rave reviews. The topic is nothing new. The treatment of the movie's serious theme did not grab me. Ok to pass an idle afternoon away. There have been just too many dysfunctional family movie themes, and I'm bored to death. For instance, it is similar to The Story of Us. Americans have a way of going over and over their own neuroses like a broken record. Just like the endless reams of Vietnam war movies and books. At some point, you've got to snap out of it, and move on. The movie did not change my life nor improve my outlook. Would like to see a newer, fresher and more original movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Daria episode after a lobotomy","review":"How do you win a boatload of Academy Awards? Just use this formula: 1. Pretentious dialogue. 2. Banal symbolism. 3. Overacting to the point of earnest emotional farce. Unless you enjoy the \\"Angst Ridden Overprivileged White People With Problems\\" genre of films, then this film isn't for you. Funniest moment that wasn't supposed to be funny: Annette Benning's emotional breakdown following her merciless cleaning of a house she was showing. While there are plenty of cultural products that elucidate the boredom and banalities of suburban life (like Daria on MTV and the music of Sonic Youth), this movie fails in the delivery of its message. Instead it wallows in its own diminished self-worth. Boomer navel gazing has never been so funny. Like I am supposed to care for any of these characters? At least the characters on Daria are appealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"profound?!?!","review":"maybe - for a hallmark card or a pepsi commercial. it's eyecandy for emotional ...; .... people who like this movie are probably postmodernists, don't understand chess, and weep profusely with the slightest tinge of reality. this isn't dramam and there are no characters but sick people. it would only get one star, but it's better than magnolia."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cartoon","review":"The best description of this movie is it is a cartoon. Kevin Spacey seems to be acting with his tongue in cheek. Annette Benning over-emotes to the point of being laughable; the makeup on her lover is so ridiculous as to seem to have been for a high school play. As for the story, Mendez seems to have been making it up as he filmed it, and when he doesn't know what to do next, he throws in a sex scene. Most of the sex scenes are okay, that is they stop short of really grossing you out. I think everyone misread this movie. It seems to aim to be a satire, but turns out just to be a lame comedy. You can't really like anyone in the story, certainly neither of the teen-age girls, who are probably pretty typical, nor any of the adults. The young drug dealer turns out to be the most likeable, and he's got problems. (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Figure Out the Hype","review":"The only reason I gave this two stars, and not one, is I was intreged enough to watch it all the way through, though it took me two settings to complete it. The reason I had to watch it in two settings is because is was so completely depressing and going nowhere. I was really annoyed by the Father who was love w/ a teen, (and not with his wife), the hysterical wife, and the doldrum daughter. The whole family wouldn't give the time of day to each other. The disturbing way the Colonial treated his son and others was also not inspiring. Really, I can't remember when I was so depressed watching a film. I was puzzled beyond belief at how this movie recieved such possitive attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"overhyped, forgettable star vehicle","review":"Basically, this movie is of the kind that the critics told us we were supposed to love because Big Media wanted another excuse to fawn over Spacey, Bening, and \\"discovery\\" Suvari.American Beauty is an occasionally pretty movie, but the story is just stupid and pointless, the characters are uniformly unlikable (either big jerks or shrinking wimps), and the sloooooooow directing is definitely a love-it-or-hate-it style. (I hated it.) Definitely a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my type","review":"I have to say honestly that this movie upset my stomach. I know that many will say that the symbolism and lighting among other production qualities were magnificent, but when you get right down to what the characters are doing--the plot, I was pretty disgusted. The dream scenes and the reality scene were basic child molestation. I believe this movie was nothing more than art for art's sake. I liked the music, but found the story to be very cold and distant, definitely not a touchy-feely-feel-good kind of movie. I find it disturbing that a film with the subject matter as this one has won top honors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad - for Hollywood","review":"This film reminded me of the kind of movies that Hollywood turned out in the early seventies. The formula went kind of like this: American Dream turns to middle class nightmare / Dad smokes pot, grows his hair long & gets fired / Mom moves to a commune in New Mexico. Bruce Dern starred in about 200 of these flicks. American Beauty sticks fairly close to this formula with a few twists thrown in. Kevin Spacey is so convincing that he's spooky. AB is similar in many ways to \\"Happiness\\", an independent film that was released about two years ago. Both share the same doomed outlook towards their protagonists. Summary: Worth seeing if only for the fact that Hollywood rarely makes (or recognizes with awards) dark films."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great American Movie","review":"I thought that American Beauty was the best movie that I have seen in my lifetime. It kind of turns a mirror on the American people and in some ways it's quite ironic. It is hilariously funny at parts and it caught my interest from start to finish. It is selling for a lot of money, and have you ever wondered why? I would like the people who don't like it to give me an e-mail and tell me why. Maybe it's because they are too scared to look at themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just an ordinary man with nothing to lose","review":"I couldn't get enough of this movie! I watched it 3 times in a row and I must own it! I offers a view of how life is preceived by each main character. Things are not always as they seem. I love Kevin Spacey, he's so honest and real! And Annette has never been one of my favorite actors, but she was GREAT! I felt as though I got a feel for what life was like for each of them. It reminded me of Pulp Fiction as far as the ending makes it all come clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a Drama it doesn't get Any better","review":"I thought this movie was too good. I was glad to see that it won the awards that it did. If you are looking for a dark drama to show you how life can be and be changed, buy this today. I think the movie is almost inspiring in a sense that if you are not happy with your station in life you can always change it. Kevin Spacy is too good as he accurately plays the working suburb man. As for the color and camera angles the movie was very creative and playfull."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth is never pretty","review":"This movie does an admirable job in describing the dark dysfunction of suburban America. Each character in the Burnham family is fully developed and Lester's mid life crises is both sad and hilarious. Annette Benings portrayal of a driven, materialistic real estate salesperson devoid of soul is almost tragic. As a viewer you know that ten minutes into this film something tragic will happen because the two major characters seem so self destructive. The ironic pattern that asserts itself throughout the movie is that the younger generation has its head screwed on a lot tighter than the older. The Burnham daughter and the retentive Marine neighbors son have a maturity beyond their years, and their wry reflections on their addled parents is subtley hilarious. \\"All I wanted was a role model\\" muses the daughter. \\"Not a jerk that sprays his pants everytime my friend comes over\\" This film will be remembered like \\"The Graduate\\" for its controversy in the years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie - Too Bad it Doesn't Play on my DVD Players..","review":"I tried to see this movie on both my Apple G4 DVD-ROM drive as well as my Toshiba SD1200 DVD player, but both had extreme problems with the dual-layer encoding. They just wouldn't play regardless of what audio option I chose. Could simply be a defective disc, however.Fortunately, I was able to see the 2nd half of the movie on HBO when it started showing a few weeks ago. A fantastic movie, but beware of potential DVD-player related problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Oscar worthy! Over-rated!","review":"First of all, I think that it's pretty sad that a movie about a disfunctional family would win an Oscar for Best Movie! Now that I got that off my chest...I've seen 4 of the 5 movies that were nominated for Best Movie of 1999. Out of the 4, American Beauty was by far at the bottom of my list. I strongly feel that The Green Mile or The Insider should have won, followed by The Sixth Sense. I've watched American Beauty twice, and if it weren't for Kevin Spacey, then I probably wouldn't have ever seen it. Kevin Spacey is by far one of the best actors out there. His brilliant performance as Lester makes this average movie worth watching at least once. He definetly steals the show! Other then that, in my opinion, this is an average movie. There was nothing exciting or climactic in the movie. The best part of the movie had to be the last 15 minutes of the movie. Everything throughout the movie all came to one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was all the hype?","review":"Once again, the Oscar hype has taken a sub-par film, and rocketed it to popularity and success on the backs of two of today's best actors. Kevin Spacey once again delivers an award-worthy performance, and Annette Benning is superb as his emotionally eratic wife, but that's where the kudos should end. Not since The English Patient has a film been so disappointing and unworthy of all the attention and praise it has received. This dark, tragic tale of midlife crisis fails to deliver and plods along with teasers of a climactic finish, only to finish the same way it began....slow. Look for a great performance by Kevin Spacey, as always, but your time and money would be better spent on any other of his movies. The Usual Suspects is a perfect example. Steer clear of this one unless you believe all the hype and irrationality once again shown by the Academy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant.","review":"There isn't much that I can say about this movie that hasn't been said by critics or other reviewers. When I say that it is beautiful, I am repetitive. When I say that it is touching, I am trite. But it is beautiful and touching, but it is also more. It is true. It is a true story of American life, of beauty, of family turmoil, of sadness, happiness, love, hate, searching, discovery, and more. It isn't a true story in the traditional sense that, \\"these things did happen.\\" It is true in the sense that these things DO happen, people DO feel this way, and people DO suffer, and love, and live, and die this way. I can't really recommend this movie any more, but to say that it is real."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful Movie","review":"This film is very intriguing. IT's story is very creative, and it gives you something to think about... maybe we should all look a little closer. Kevin Spacey is a stand out as his character goes from a dumpy little guy to a bad mamma jamma.The DVD goodies are pretty good. It's got a little montage of stuff about the road to the oscars, and all that. The comentary is informing. Get the movie already."},{"rating":"2","title":"The end of american illusion","review":"When I first saw this movie, I went by a philosophy teacher's sugestion. When the movie ended I thanked god I was not born in the U.S.A. It was such a great critic to the \\"perfect family and society\\" that U.S. has the habbit to try and follow. What a punch in the stomach. I think that by viewing it outside the critics field helped a lot to my oppinion. What each character represents and means, and the way the beauty of things is dealed is marvelous! A masterpiece if you may say! American Beauty brings the americans to the ground!"},{"rating":"2","title":"surprising","review":"I love watching movies, but when I read the back of the box on this Oscar-winning movie, it just did not appeal to me. So, I asked around before watching. And, boy, did I get mixed reviews:\\"outstanding\\" \\"morbid\\" \\"amazing\\" \\"depressing\\"and above all: \\"weird\\"But, fortunately, I am my own person, so I watched it. It was surprising. Spacey gave a brilliant performance, and I was surprised by Thora Birch, whom I always seem to visualize as \\"Danni\\" in Hocus Pocus. She gave an amazing, coming-of-age performance as Spacey's daughter.This movie is so moving, so realistic that I can't help wondering...will this ever be my dad?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Film Ever","review":"I love this movie. It is my all time favorite film. Many pf the people that I know that have seen it don't get it, and therefore don't like it. I think it is a beautifuly made film showing us how we see beauty in the world. The perfect american family on the outside but on teh inside is where the real beauty lies. When we think of beauty we all see the rose petals and the beautiful girl but this movie shows us the real beauty in everyday life. the way one event can change a man's life forever, a bag floating in the wind. It asks us to look at life at a different angle and find the beauty there, and everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below average movie, definitely not best picture material","review":"When I saw the oscar nominated American Beauty months ago, I expected a very fine movie with talented actors like Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening. Instead what I found was a very bland, often wierd film about a man named Lester (Spacey) going through a mid-life crisis. Why in the world did this film win over the Green Mile! While this movie is fair for the average movie fan, Big movie buffs like myself should not expect anything more than just a fair movie. For those of you who still want to see this movie, don't get your hopes up for this best picture winner. Instead, I recommend renting what should have been the true best picture nod: The Green Mile."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!!","review":"Why, oh why is this movie SO OVERRATED? I don't know why, but I do know that this movie is BAD. Good acting doesn't make a good movie, you need a good script, and they didn't have one. You can tell the story in 2 minutes, so they streched it 2 HOURS!!!Is Spacey good? YES HE IS, but his character is a very simple one, a man that reaches that age where he finds himself insecure of his life, is a cliche, nothing more than that. The director does not give us a background for this, so why would you care for a character like this, and old man that really is a Cry-Baby?, well you wont care for him. And all the other characters are more cliches, but not as good acted as the one played by spacey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another thing....","review":"If you were touched deeply (HA!) by the motif of \\"beauty in the ordinary\\", then go read Joyce's \\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\", which has in it a much deeper, genuine explanation of true beauty. This movie is hyperbole, a of easy answers that have a much greater assumed context than is developed in the film. By no means is it a masterpiece. The hype about it is just a flock of sheep proving that strength in numbers does, though it shouldn't, work.\\"And when at times the mob is swayed / to carry praise or blame too far / we may choose something like a star / to keep our minds on and be staid.\\"Joyce is luminous.

I feel as if the American public has been brainwashed into thinking that this movie deserved an Academy Award, but to me it was a dreary recital of the most selfish, self-centered, and downright dysfunctional people I have ever seen! To me, it did not seem artistic. It was just downright weird! I realize I am in the minority, but I really wish someone had told me how bad this movie was and I would not have wasted the time or money to rent and watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly boring","review":"This movie is way to over rated and way to digusting:there's nothing enjoyable about an old man having sexual fantasies about his daughers best friend or about a gay neigbour abusing his son.

(A quick quiz: in the land of Hollywood who is the ultimate villian -- the drug pusher, the cheating wife, the near-pedophile husband ... or, the man who won't come out of the closet?) A shallow film, about shallow people, given 5 stars by shallow reviewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Look Closer...","review":"American Beauty is a great movie that discovers how twisted America can be And what a beauty this is. Spacey is excellent as Lester Burnham, a disillusioned hack writer who embarks on a reckless quest for self-discovery. While alienating his control-freak wife (Annette Bening) and confused teenage daughter (Thora Birch), he jumps headfirst into his midlife crisis, befriending the drug dealer next door (Wes Bentley) and lusting after his daughter's best friend (Mena Suvari), among other things. Director Mendes' uncommon approach to common realities is wonderful, and the script is full of pessimism and hilarity, with not a word wasted. Add to that the film's electric visual style, and what emerges is a terrific film about troubled souls. Musical score is just great with along with the theme and the thoughts of Lester Cunningham (Kevin Spacey). I would recommend it for anyone to se the realities of the American Beauty"},{"rating":"1","title":"whodunit? whocare?","review":"This movie is a who dun it where you have to guess who killed the dad. Now, i dint see American beauty because I dont like mystery. I like movies where people ACT! and not just who did the killing. My grandmother likes who dun its, though, so I know people out tehre like them, but I would rather wach a movie wioth James Dean or Marlyn Monroe. Also, even though I dint see it i know from previews for it that it was the dark haied girl who killed him, I think she's his daughter? See, I'm right and look at all the time and money i saved by not watching American Beauty!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"I really didn't think it could get any worse when the American public voted for Bill Clinton a second time, knowing what a lier he was. The fact that this movie is held up as some sort of statement of \\"suburban America\\" really shows how pathetic society really is. This is the worst movie I have seen in years. Go rent the South Park movie, it has more class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing is real & nothing to get hung about","review":"An odd & terribly depressing movie whose only consolation is the unreality of the characters.

You would have to be on something to enjoy this movie enough to give it such a high rating.

This movie was a large disappointment. It gave a very sick and twisted view of life. It also had some of the worst performances by actors I have ever seen, including Spacey. I do not know what everyone sees in this film, but it is just not there. It just goes to prove that the Academy does not know what they are talking about because this film did not deserve anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am still nauseous!","review":"There are many things that bothered me about this movie.

If this movie had never been made, I would be just as well off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did it win Best Picture of 1999?","review":"This review is for the DVD Region 1 disc of American Beauty (1999).I did not like this movie. Why did it win the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1999? The way they filmed the ending where you saw the reactions and where everyone was at, at the scene of the crime, was very well done.Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) was better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unsurprising symptom of a culture.","review":"\\"American Beauty\\" amounts to little more than a felicitous combination of skillfully contrived production values and purposefully directed acting put to the service of highly resonant metaphysical fraudulence -- which, of course, makes it eminently suitable for our time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I agree; the movie was absolutely disgusting. It was revolting to see a middle-aged man go gaga for a highschool cheerleader. The way it was presented in the movie was disturbing. I just couldn't get over that part. It is inconceivable to think that people thought that part was funny and liked the movie, not to mention that it won awards. In the theatre, many women were expressing their distaste for the movie. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"rolling my eyes","review":"This movie had some good lessons, but I thought it was unrealistic. It was a movie that pushed a false reality. We practically all go through a little phase where we think we are being shocking, we think we harber this little rebellious adolescent secret of disgust toward most of humanity and secret way of behaving when not around others, and we are going to go out there and do this lifestyle that just because it's taboo, we think we want it, even though we don't. It was like encouraging that done to death scenario. Did the main character ever give a thought to whether HE was satisfying everyone else? Did he ever sit and agonize over whether he was impeccably faithful to his wife in thought/sight/action, or whether he could make her really pleased? Did he ever obsess over being the perfect father? Did he ever stop to think. The movie definitely had that \\"shock jock\\" quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to much to say about this one","review":"First off, I like dark films alot. I like films that end they way that this one did. What I did not like was that the whole time I felt that something was missing. I wanted to give the characters an extra boost, something to make me interested and make me care if they lived, died, got laid, were happy... It just didn't happen. This shows once again how tainted the Academy is. 'Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and dismal","review":"The film is really nothing more than a bizzare portrayal of what happens when you mix self-absorbed people who let ordinary evil rule their lives with people who are just plain nuts. None of the characters are likable, and I found myself really not caring what happened to any of them by the end.Why this got such critical acclaim is beyond me- I don't know whether we're supposed to believe this sort of thing happens in America every day (if we're really that far gone, we are in deep trouble) or if this is just supposed to be a black satire of social issues like family dynamics, drugs, and sexuality (if it is, it's not funny)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well made, HIGHLY OVERRATED","review":"It's a shame to see so much skill go into making such shallow material. The story of a man who chucks his job because he's sick of being a \\"whore for the advertising industry,\\" but suffers absolutely no ill economic effects. He gets to keep his salary and buy a bunch of expensive toys, plus pursue the affections of an underage girl. Then it's supposed to be \\"deep\\" when he passes on having sex with the girl because she's a virgin -- not because it's morally wrong or anything like that. My big question at the end of this movie was, where would this guy have been in a year when the money ran out and his wife was gone if his stereotypically, repressively gay neighbor hadn't killed him?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I bought this DVD without renting it first, which was a big mistake. With all the \\"critical acclaim\\" it got, I figured it was worth a shot when I saw it on sale at a local store. I found almost no humor in what turned out to be the darkest \\"black comedy\\" I've seen in years. While I'll admit that the acting was excellent, the story itself is just sick. If you think you might be interested in this movie, do yourself a favor and rent it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"A Misleading Story\\"","review":"What \\"American Beauty\\" is supposed to be about involves a dysfunctional American suburban family who suffers uncommon everyday social problems. The idea of the dad being attracted to her daughter's friend is more frequent in real life than most people believe. But, I don't think it was done right when Kevin Spacey did drugs and other things to impress her. This didn't show any reaction from his daughter. This was a lot like a Jerry Springer episode.The entire main idea of this movie was very flawed because reaction to the situation was only seen through the eyes of Kevin Spacey: not of his wife or his daughter. It's like your looking for the hamburger buns and you're obviously in the dairy section. If you study this movie after you watch it a few times, you'll probably get the REAL idea of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Screamed to the top of my Movie list...","review":"This move is hands down my favorite of all time. Script, acting, camera work, direction, it's all there. You must watch it if you haven't yet done so, do yourself a favor.......but only on dVd ok : ) DOWN WITH VHS! DOWN WITH BETA! : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stays with you...","review":"Let's see, the cultural conservatives hate this movie because it leaves no possible dysfunctionality unturned. And hard-core artsy types don't care for it because it's not nearly audacious ENOUGH. But most viewers, I suspect, will find an intelligently paced, very well acted and beautifully shot film that they will not quickly forget. Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening got the Oscar nods, but the younger actors, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley and Mena Suvari were all spot on. And Chris Cooper and Peter Gallagher turned in remarkable performances as well. I won't say it's a perfect movie, but it is a film of genuine substance--the kind that lends itself to multiple interpretations and multiple viewings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie but Bluray could be better.","review":"There's no doubt that American Beauty is a great movie. I feel that the video quality of the Bluray could have been better. There are scenes that look great but it's not consistent throughout the movie. I would give the video quality a 3/5. Also, I wish there were more extras. Since this is called a \\"Sapphire\\" release, you would think they would give you more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing","review":"This is one of my favorite movies and it gets better each time you watch it. You can identify with some of the characters in the movie and although it is dark and sad, it has a moral to the story and the ending was just amazingly done. Even though your sad for the main character, you still realize that his life had finished in a weirdly positive way. Hence the smile at the end. I highly recommend this movie. It should be in everyone's DVD collection and is one of those movies you can watch over and over again without getting bored. And it is not entirely always dark. There is comedy woven into the movie as well. Again, one of the best Kevin Spacey movies ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Let the Name or Box Fool You","review":"I won't bother describing the plot of this movie. I just want to put in my 5 stars and say it deserved its awards and was funny as hell. The name and cover art made me think it was some kind of chick-flik, so it was a while before I watched it. If this is what you thought, forget it and make sure you see this soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"What does Sapphire mean?","review":"I have to say, American Beauty is one of my favourite movies, but this Blu-Ray feels very lackluster.Pros-Picture- quality is decentCons-Sound- horrible, I had to keep turning my t.v. volume up and down because some parts are inaudible, often times the volume would drop considerably mid-conversation. This didn't happen in the regular d.v.d., and it I've never had another blu-ray that I had this problem with either.Special features- next to non, I'm not exactly sure what makes this Sapphire Series but I'm not impressed.The movie gets 5 stars, the blu-ray gets 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best film of 1999!","review":"This was the best film of 1999, even thoughh 'Being John Malkovich' is equally good and in some ways better, I can't really choose.1999 was a very good year for movies, lots of brilliant and fresh films coming out from some brave new directors. Too bad 2000 isn't shaping up as good, let's just hope it gets better.I think that it is a great shame that the DVD version does not offer the alternate ending. This 'alternate ending' was completely different and is said to hold the best bits of Conrad Hall's brilliant cinematography. There must be a strong reason why they didn't keep it, but the viewer must decide which version to see. A special edition double-sided disk with both versions of the film would be nice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"I saw American Beauty right whn it came out on video and then bought a used copy. I love this movie! I do not want to give anything away but I wil tell you the plot. It is about a suburban family, The Burnams. The husband and wife, Carolyn and Lester, have had marital problems for a long time but do not show it in public. Lester and Carolyn also have a 18 year old daughter Jane who doesn't like her parnt at all. Obvioulsy they are falling apart. Carolyn is having a hard time with her job as a house saleswoman. Jane is a misfit in school. Janes father starts to develope a crush on his daughter's friend, Angela and starts to have erotic dream an sexual fantasies about her. Lester, Janes dad. starts going through a big mid-life crisis, quits his job and starts working at a fast food joint, starts smoking marijuana, gets in shape to impress Angela and acts like a teen.

American Beauty is a winner for a life time. After reading some of the other reviews, I would have to agree with all of them. The first time I saw this movie, I wasn't really paying much attention. As the movie progressed, I just got mad when people were talking when walking into the living room. My friend's mother thought this was equivelant to a porn movie, but it is so much more! It has so much beauty in it. It is really an amazing movie.

It is one of those movies that I consider to be a classic like Pulp Fiction. If you haven't seen this movie, please do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A deeper look at the myth of the urban family","review":"From the outset this is the story about the urban family, white picket fence, working parents, nice house. As the movie progresses you become increasing aware that nothing could be further from the truth. A fascinating look at responsibility and discovery of what is really important in life. Its dark and very real but has a remarkably uplifting ending. I would rate this movie as one of (if not the) best movies of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing? Ha","review":"I just want to say that this is a true masterpiece! And to the reviewers like the \\"too distrurbing\\" one, let me say this: American Beauty is NOT an educational movie. When that reviewer says: \\"if you're a parent you won't like it\\" come on! that's so stupid. A good movie doesn't necessary have to be optimistic. You can't say \\"it's too disturbing to be good\\". It doesn't have anything to do.And again: no one said this was an educational movie ok? don't get confused, you \\"parents\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie!","review":"Wow, a movie that actually deserved an oscar.

Something tells me the votes were stolen at the same time as the Oscars.American Beauty is a long way from the worst movie of last year, but it's even further from the best.This satire purports to hold a candle up to the hidden underbelly of suburban America. It doesn't. While the story premise isn't bad, the characterization turns out to be almost uniformly one-dimensional (only Mena Suvari has any fun with her role). You pretty much know what to expect from each character within forty or fifty frames of meeting them. Where's the beef?American Beauty is beautifully filmed, but anyone who thinks this work reveals anything whatsoever about America probably believes everyone in France wears a beret and eats frogs......"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dissenting Opinion","review":"This smug satire makes its tired little points against all the obvious targets - middle class hypocrites, homophobes, and uptight squares of all ages. Filmed in a slow, narcoticized rhythm that gives it the appearance of being deep and artistic, it predictably won a slew of Academy Awards. But there's more wit, insight, and true satire in any 10 minutes of \\"The Simpsons.\\"p.s. One major scene involving weightlifting and a bong has to be the single stupidest plot twist in movie history."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD won't play","review":"Hopefully, I can exchange and get one that does play.

UGH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood Hideous","review":"Once again, a film depicts the boredom and shallowness of suburban America. But this one had overly stereotypical characters and little originality.One of the worst examples of this was the white middle class houswife/real estate agent trying unsuccessfully sell a house. She over acted the part of the phony, foolish salesperson who did not connect with the customers. To maximize her white suburban foolishness, her skeptical customers included an Hispanic couple, a black couple, and what appears to be lesbian couple.The scene of her with the difficult lesbian couple was stolen right from Fast Times at Ridgemont High, when Judge Reinhold's character was waiting on two difficult gay customers in the fish joint, while wearing that ridiculous pirate uniform.The difference is, Ridgemont was funny. American beauty was stupid. I guess the Academy in Hollywood liked the message. They sure are easy to fool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this critically acclaimed?","review":"I did not enjoy this movie at all. The acting was bad, the characters one-dimensional and the central message (that American suburbia is not the paradise it appears to be on the surface) was also not news to me. And some of the plot developments, especially towards the end of the movie, were desperately contrived, especially the ex-Marine officer turning out to be a closet homosexual.I was particularly disappointed with the performances by Kevin Spacey (his worst I have seen) and Anette Bening, who was so good in Grifters. Admittedly the two younger actors who portrayed their daughter and her love interest were extremely good, and did not fall into the trap of over-acting like their two better-known colleagues.I cannot understand how this movie won the critical acclaim it did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy if you live in the US","review":"We had no idea that this DVD would not play on our DVD player and that there are Regions for DVDs.

I cannot identify with any of the characters, since they are all blatantly incompetent.2. The depiction of innocence in the movie is not believeable.3. The premise of the movie is not fully believable, due to the previous reasons.4. The premise is also entirely outdated. The realization that middle class people can get caught up in seeking social status and their problems has already been played out way too many times.It was a waste of money at the movie theater, and it's a waste of money on a vhs tape or dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"A PIECE OF TRASH","review":"Perhaps because I heard so much hype, I may have expected more when I acquired the DVD.I should have guessed when the Hollywood \\"in\\" crowd loves something this much, WATCH OUT.Looks to me like those ever so pseudo \\"hip\\" self absorbed obnoxious inbred hollywood libs giving us their take on middle class america. Clinton and his Hollywood lapdogs obviously loved this movie. The basic equation here is to suggest middle america is so screwed up, so dysfunctional, that in relative terms, the Hollywood crowd must be just about normal.Now isn't that convenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Letdown","review":"With a good cast and director, I had my hopes a little too high before watching. American Beauty could have been amazing. The lighting and angles really bug me, and for a script with very little encrypted or interesting dialogue, the visuals are important to get right. I think it was worth the $7.50 spent to see it once, just because of the conversations about it afterward. Some love it, some hate it. In my opinion, when describing this movie, using the word \\"eh\\" is inevitable.Message received but not well delivered, if that makes sense at all.Rent this movie before buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly good.","review":"This is a very intellegent movie, if you have any brains. If not you will hate it. You will hate if you are conservative too. Conservatives, need to stop thinking the world is all for them and their shelterd ways. There are people out there that probably go through things that are in this movie every day. Carolyn and Lester remind me of my parents. They make movies about God and church, why not make one about this? Why conservatives, why? I don't want to give anything away so I'll just talk about it. Alan Ball is a genius. Sam Mendes too.

I have little love for most of the noxious pukes in the entertainment industry -- and I consider this film to be a bunch of pretentious crapola -- but freedom means that people can watch this sewage if they so choose. The fact that such a film can be haled by so many is further demonstration that the herd mentality has almost completely taken us over."},{"rating":"2","title":"STELLAR","review":"This was a stunning and spectacular film, visually, creatively and structurally. The story is poignant, beautifully told and acted, and somehow very close to home for many of the people who see it. Suburban family life looks very neat and happy but who knows what kinds of complex problems lie beneath the surface? This film shows us a glimpse of that bitter reality. Marriages fall apart, people change but change in different ways from each other, people alienate each other, parents beat their children, parents ignore their children, parents are humans with human desires, people have nervous breakdowns, people have affairs, people hate their jobs, kids lie about their personal lives to try to be cool, people build facades... it is a wicked and vicious game society as a whole plays, and this film brilliantly conveys all the plots, subplots and layers that occur everyday. The acting is stupendous. The accolades and praise this film received were more than well deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the all time greats, i'm apalled anybody could hate..","review":"Firstly, this is the first movie to win the big Oscar for best film of the year that is so coveted in the movie business that wasn't ABSOLUTE GUTTER TRASH in a long time.This movie is great. Kevin Spacey is brilliant in this as he is in about any film. He plays a man, Lester Burnham, who is just fed up with his sedated life style and how everybody around him just cares about monetary values and proof of their own wealth. This movie is an insight into why people maybe do things they do and a possible explanation for human behavior.This is a very sad movie, and a very sick and twisted one in points, you have to watch with an open mind, just because it appears in this movie it isn't meant to follow a stereotype, it's just there.

The writer and director's commentary was very informative but was just not enough. The making of the movie, etc was a nice feature, but I wanted to see more, including the alternate beginning and ending that was much talked about in the commentary.I was happy to see that they included information from the photographer as the lighting was wonderfully done.The picture and sound quality was very nicely done and comes across well even on a smaller television."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE FOR THE GARBAGE MINDED VIEWER","review":"I nearly vomited when I saw this travesty. To think that it won an Oscar for Best Picture is totally in keeping with the depraved Hollywood style of today. If you prefer decent films stick with the black and white classics or most of Disney. American Beauty should be retitled \\"American Ugly\\". There is nothing beautiful about this film. It is grotesque, glorifying just about every decaying moral in today's society. This type of film is what is wrong with America today. Heaven help us!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"American Trash","review":"This movie is so overrated. The acting is good but its not that good. PLease how do people see beauty in a dead bird and a mans head shot with blood coming out. The nudity was pointless and disturbing. Underage girls breast is not beauty in this way more disguisting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not entertaining","review":"How can anyone give this movie 5 stars? My wife and I watched it and I felt like apologizing to her about halfway through. We were not entertained at all. If you like dark twisted movies, you'll love this one. For the rest of us, I'd recommend saving your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"After watching David Lynch's masterpiece A Straight Story I had the misfortune of sitting through American Beauty. I liked Kevin Spacey's performance, except for his idiotic monologue at the end. This is one of those movies that make me talk back to the screen, with insulting remarks. Move it along, director! Shoddy work can't be excused by inventive plot twists. Yes, it's politically correct to dislike the ex-marine who smacks his kid around, collects guns, and is a hard nose, and sure it's easy to take the cheap shot at this caricature and call him a closet queen. You may think this is cutting edge, but I think it's just a cheap shot at an obvious target. I couldn't stand the movie before most of this happened, so my dislike goes deeper than just this. This is just not a quality job. The director just did a lousy job. That's my reaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original? I think not - Yawn","review":"Two stars for actor performances, the production work et al which is great. However the true meat of a movie is the story and this was a case of chopped pork rather than loin. Suburban bored miserable middle aged man, burned out wife who hates him, the terrible temptation he could not resist, disaster. A plot found in a million books and a million magazines, not exactly ground breaking stuff. Not terrible just a little ordinary in my opinion and not really worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest movies ever told.","review":"Words can not describe the emotions that I feel when I view this move. Having grown up watching an untold number of horror and action flicks, my mind and soul have become immune to all forms of compasiion and understanding. In the past ten years, the only movies that I have been touched by have been Schindlers List, Magnolia, and Platton, and now American Beauty. I laughed, sat at the edge of my seat, and cried for the eniterty of the film. When I left the theater my emotions were so mixed up that I did not know how to feel. But this is a good thing. I recomend this movie to anyone who has been rendred a heartless zombie, by hundreds of action movies,and think that they need some sort of feelings to remind themselves that they are still alive. Please excuse my spelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Movie (Look Closer...)","review":"If you get this movie, you understand that it is one of the most beautiful (no pun intended) movies ever made. Same Mendes and Alan Ball, both newcomers to movies, created a wonderful movie about a disfunctional American family. Kevin Spacey got a well deserved best acting Oscar, and Wes Bentley gave an unbelievable performance as Ricky Fitts, the only person in the film that can see the beauty of the world. Never have I seen a movie that can make me laugh and then make you just sit back and go \\"WOW\\" within minutes of each other; the scene where the family is eating dinner after Lester quits his job has to be one of the best acted scenes I've ever seen. This is not a movie for everyone - some people will not truly understand it, but if you do, there is no finer movie to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"toobad","review":"This movie is awful. Beats me why so many people think it's great. In that case people are really down-grading their knowledge of what is a good movie. This movie makes you feel crappy and has no real good story or action. There are many movies better than this one like Dirty Harry or The Straight Story. But this movie is just a feel bad movie full profanity and b.s. and screwed up people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movie","review":"I can't belive this film won any awards it ripped off so many films before it.To summerize.A used up idea done once again but this time since it was released by a big studio were all suppose to respect it.The film is trying to be artsy but it tries too hard and in obvious ways.In my opinion its the most overrated film to have won the oscar for best picture and to top it off its really bad writting,done in a predictable manner.If you want to see a good movie that it ripped off watch Interiors,Ordinary People,Sunset Blvd,Blue Velvet,and there are many others you can look up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop complaining if you didn't like it.","review":"I liked this movie. You have to watch it for the messages and it is even more profound for those who identify with the characters. Those who dislike this movie are either too afraid that the movie is right and dont wan't their world to shatter or are, sadly, unable to identify with the feeling expressed. For those of you who say that intelligece has everything to do with either or not you like this movie, I say your wrong. I liked the movie and I'm an extremely bright person, I liked it because it was true for me. If it isn't for you than thats fine but don't knock something you don't understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Beauty- Beauty At It's Best","review":"Words cannot describe this film. It is art. It is a very realview into the all too real and extreme banal realities of life. Weforget of these sometimes, but only because of the beauty we see. American Beauty portrays this on screen perfectly. The director, Sam Mendes, does an excellent job of as well. There could not have been a more real cast for the film also. Kevin Spacey was at his best. He certainly deserved his Academy Award. Anette Benning portrays Carolyn to a tee. Wes Bently was believable. He made us see beauty in our own lives, no matter how cynical they may seem. Other cast members deserve congrats also. Mena Suvari, Thora Birch, Peter Gallagher, Chris Cooper. And how could it all have been done without the touch of Alan Ball's genius. The composed music was in sync with the film perfectly, thanks to Thomas Newman. Extrodinary, and incredible. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful satire","review":"This is a brilliant satire on middle America and an exhilarating exploration of what is \\"normal\\" and \\"ordinary\\". The central character (Spacey) embarks on an odyssey of self-discovery and liberates himself from a pointless marriage, a pointless job, and a pointless lust for a Lolita-type schoolgirl --...The only jarring element here is the parodistic military man next door. Spacey is superb and the direction is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Classic","review":"American Beauty is a true classic!! It is a fabulous movie and one of the best movies of all time. I have never gotten tired of this movie, I can watch it over and over with out getting sick of it. Kevin Spacey won an Oscar for best actor, which he truly deserved. Spacey was the man, especially when he quit his job and started working for a fast food joint. And Mena Suvari, well she is self-exclamatory, she is the American Beauty. I can't say enough good things about this movie it is just truly a masterpiece. I recommend this for all the epic movie lovers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie ever period.","review":"This is hands down the best movie I have ever seen and it changed my life forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"I heard so much hype about this movie in the fall of 1999! Even in Russia! I knew that I had to see it. I saw it, and vowed to never watch it again. The dialogue and acting was beyond superb but the storyline was not very good. The fact that it explored suburban dysfunction was nice, but all of the sex and vulgarity turned me off. There were a few funny moments in the movie, (ex: The family eating dinner together and Col. Fitts 'homophobe-ness'). Overall, not worth all the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fabulous","review":"Few films have that cult genre, mystic philosophic appeal, world-class acting, tantilizing music, and overall top notch production qualities all rolled into one. American beauty brings fringe movie making thought to the main screen. One of the few movies I can watch more than once (this and Starship Troopers)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sick Movie About Sick People","review":"I had wanted to see this movie ever since it came out but when I did go see it I didn't like what I was watching. My brother, two friends, & I went and saw this two weeks after it's release. I was the only one of us four who saw the entire film. My brother fell asleep, one of my friends walked out & the other bought a ticket for another movie. It was a disgusting picture that shouldn't have won anything. The characters were gross and obnoxis. No one I know enjoyed it and the as for the touching part at the end I didn't even notice anything touching or spirtual about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Best Picture Oscar winner.","review":"I'm sorry, but \\"American Beauty\\" is yet another overrated Best Picture Oscar winner. It protrays suburban midlife-crisis in a very smug, ridiculous, and pretentious manner. The characters have about as much depth and substance as those in a TV sitcom. They're shallow, smug, and superficial charicatures. The music, cinematography, and Wes Bentley's performance as the boy-next-door are the only redeeming qualities of this movie. If you want a more honest portrayal of a American suburban family in midlife-crisis, rent Robert Redford's \\"Ordinary People\\" from 1980. \\"American Beauty\\" is really just American trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor's New Rose","review":"I know I am in a distinct minority, but I intensely disliked this film. Satire works best when the creator loves his characters, flaws and all. Alan Ball clearly despised his creations, and I echo his sentiment. There is much about middle-class suburban life that lends itself to ridicule, but there is also room for intelligence, compassion and wit, qualities I find all but absent from American Beauty. Being invited to smirk at and feel superior to freaks -- this is art?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I still can't forget it...","review":"Kevin Spacey was the man for the job... the job of playing a middle-aged man in the thick of mid-life crisis. Lester Burnam (Kevin Spacey) is having trouble with his wife (played by Annette Bening) and daughter (Thora Burch) and yearns for peace. When the delinquent son of the next door neighbor makes an impact on Burnam's daughter, things are lining up for disaster. The boy is violent and has a mysterious way of making money. And he is about to change the Burnam's life forever.Add to that Lester's sudden preoccupation with his daughter's 16-year-old, best friend, and you have all the angst, drama and suspense you could ever wish for! The script, written by Alan Ball, was beautiful and dramatic without being overdone, and Sam Mendes direction is superb. Lester's \\"silly little life\\" will make an impact on yours... a great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but no must","review":"The film \\"American Beauty\\" is about a guy who wants to celebrate his life. Therefore he tries to get more influence in his comunity. The actors are very well chosen for this topic so that the film shows a problem of our society in a very social critical way. This problem is the boring lifestyle (sleep-eat-work-eat-sleep) many people live today. The main caracter Lester tries to break out of this trod and it's very interesting to see how he does it. Sometimes the film has a boring action."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Oscars for This???!!!","review":"I absolutely HATED this movie!

Not much happens, in a plot that creeps along aimlessly, at a pace that is almost as boring as it's characters. But few things imaginable are that boring. Hapless attempts at being shocking, fall flat throughout this mess. Shockless shock, for shock's sake (yawn). Maybe in the 50's we could have been shocked. But by now it has all been seen before, certainly more convincingly as well.As flaccid and full of itself, as it's progressively more narcissistic star.

I know that this is supposed to be a \\"dark\\" comedy, but I totally found it to be disturbing and I disliked all of the characters. Kevin Spacey's acting is great, but his character totally going for his daughter's girlfriend made me sick. I am trying to understand that it can be a fantasy for this middle-aged, exhausted man to lust after a high school girl, but that is called rape usually. I think that in showing all the dysfunction in family life it is a sad commentary instead of something to be revered or laughed at.Don't waste your time with this movie. If you have never seen it before and want to get it out of curiosity, I beg you to not waste your time because it is not funny or interesting, but truly disturbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Classic","review":"One of my favorite films of all times.

It's a must see for anyone who's captivated by the underside of quiet suburban life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The future of film","review":"American Beauty represents the potential of American film. An intelligent, suspenseful, funny, charming, and intensely significant character driven movie, American Beauty shines. Its poignant and accurate portrayal of all the facets of suburbia in an American microcosm, the film explores self-knowledge and the transformation of self as well as smoking pot at 40. American Beauty is Sam Mendes' masterpiece. I would love to single out Kevin Spacey's absolutely masterful performance, but the truth is that every character deserved an Oscar. It should be required for every American to see this movie. Particularly as a teen, the portrayal of what it means to come of age (and back again) is brilliant. The power of the movie lies in its ability to take countless themes and ideas and piece them together as one. You will never think about your life in the same way again."},{"rating":"2","title":"You either get it or you don't","review":"Think about the best movie you ever saw. What made it your favourite? Was it the acting, the plot, the direction?The best movies I've seen had all of these, but they done something else, more importantly, they touched me.American Beauty is one of these greats. It has depth, it made me think, question, and maybe appreciate life a little more.It's not a movie that spoke to everyone though, and that's fair enough. But hopefully, like Lester, everything fell into place, and for just a few seconds you realised how amazing life, and this movie, really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Movie for Boomers!!","review":"Right now, I'm watching a scene from this movie for the umpteenth time.

However, if you're not a boomer, you may not get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A film that makes want to say hmmm","review":"Now, at this point, I am in agreement with some of you who say that this film has been offensive at times. I also feel that once you get into it, you see a true beauty. I'm kinda of out with the jury here, but I will say that I liked the ending because Lester was at peace with himself and what happened. I liked it. Now, the wife, she lived in another zone completely. The daughter as well,(her and that boy were compatible), and her friend was just I'm so beautiful. Now, forgive me, but I am still unsure who did him in (My bet is the wife).All I can say is what a film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"American Beauty THE best movie ever made","review":"When I first saw American Beauty I was stunned. At how wonderful this movie is. I feel I can relate to every character on at least some level. Annette Benning, Thora Birth, Wes Bently, Mira sorvieno (sp?), and of course Kevin Spacey did a wonderful job. After watching the movie it made me think.. and reflect on my life and how I live it. And belive it or not, but it actually inspired me to care more about myself, to work out, and to look at the little things in life.

It pretends to be deep and profound, but it is actually shallow and manipulative. It tires to find quick and easy solutions to people's problems and does not consider the long term conquences. For example, the main character (Kevin Spacy) quits his professional job to work in a fast-food resturant. At first he may enjoy it, but how long could he sustain that lifestyle. How long could he be happy working minimum wage. Also, his daughter is ready to run away with her drug-dealer boyfriend. How long do you think such a relationship could last? The movie does not consider these consequences. Think about the characters' actions and apply them to real life and you will realize 'American Beauty' is full of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Even Kevin Spacey couldn't save it. Judging by some of the other reviews I'm not alone. What they should have done is save everything the kid next door in the movie shot with his camcorder and just use that footage then throw the rest of the movie away. I've never seen such a bad story or worse acting. Shame on the studio for offering this trash to the movie going (and buying) public. Oscars? You've got to be kidding."},{"rating":"1","title":"What? Critics mess up Again!","review":"This movie has bad acting and an even worse storyline. Fortunately, I don't give a crap for low high school girls who complain and whine that their breasts are 2 mm smaller than the average or about a crazy guy who video tapes people who is the son of an even crazier military officer. Who cares about a movie that is all about teen sex? A lot more than you think. Who cares about a person being in Seventeen magazine? A lot more than you think. But this movie is not compelling, just plain stupid and way too long. I can't give you enough reasons not to watch this film. Take my advice, don't get this film. But you can ignore it and face over two hours of torture or over two hours of napping time."},{"rating":"1","title":"very fair, definitely not best picture material","review":"When I saw American Beauty months ago, I thought with talented actors like Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening, the film would be very good, espeically since it was nominated for best picture alongside Green Mile.

This film is a depressing story about sick, dysfunctional people and their ways of coping. Is there anything uplifting about it? Not that I can see. Do we really need to see a movie featuring:The father (Lester) lusts and fantasizes over his daughter's teenage friend;The friend (Angela) talks using the raunchiest language imaginable;The neighbor is a drug dealer who is beaten by his own dad, sells to Lester and has a voyeuristic fetish with his video camera;The wife has an affair with a rival business owner and ultimately murders her husband.These people and their real-life counterparts need the gospel message of Jesus Christ.

American Beauty is no exception. The movie takes the traditional family unit (you know, two parents - one male, one female, with children) and makes a complete mockery of it. In addition, the role played by the ex-Marine neighbor portrays military personnel (to whom this country owes way too much gratitude) to be psycho fruitcakes. I hated this movie. I work too hard at making a good stable home-life for my husband and children to accept that the message in this movie is anything but destructive. Kevin Spacey is extremely talented and has wasted his efforts here. If you want to see him in a good role, get \\"The Usual Suspects\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The number one movie EVER","review":"The movie will easily be considered one of the best, if not the best movie ever, in a few years. There is nothing to complain about with this movie as the direction was fabulous. The multiple storylines combine seemlessly and is greatly wrapped up at the end.

American Beauty is almost here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"American Beauty is only Skin Deep","review":"Every now and then you see a film you initially think of as ground-breaking, until you start to think about it. American Beauty is such a film. What most bothered me about this film was its message that those of us in suburbia are repressed hypocrites who secretly hate our lives. Perhaps most disturbing was its portrayal of Marine Colonel Frank Fitz as a pseudo-Nazi who abuses those around him--this is (yet another) thinly veiled slap by Hollywood at the military. When all is said and done, this movie really says nothing of substance about American society. If you want to see the best example of film as social commentary, I recommend \\"Fight Club."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Made For a Really Good Trailor..........","review":"This movie is really pretty bad. Nothing in this movie was groundbreaking in the least, and the fact that nearly everybody bought into it was just sad.

Just think for a second of this movie played for laughs as opposed to the garbage seriousness that ended up on the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mid-Life Spiritual Awakening or Statutory Rape - You Decide!","review":"A confused film with stereotypes and a self-deceiving message that confounds statutory rape with a mid-life spiritual awakening. Check out the fantastic Aussie film from 1987, BLISS, (directed by Ray Lawrence) and you will see how AB is a weak, mixed-up reworking (from a writer who cut his teeth in TV sitcoms). The very last scene of AB is the true tip-off to the reality of the rip-off, compare the camera's heavenwards pullback and Spacey's final voiceover monologue. The lovely poetry of BLISS' last scene will, if you have even a vague pulse, bring real soul-tears to your eyes. You tell me.PS - I was moved at the final images of Annette Benning's wailing in the closet and her brief, gleeful smile on the Tilt-a-Whirl (black and white film is so underrated). So, there's a couple of stars for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grotesque Beauty","review":"Technically, this is a very well-crafted film, and the script does have a certain amount of black humor which is funny, but by and large I found the film nihilistic and demeaning to women, treating them solely as sex objects. Moreover, the one \\"hero\\" in the film is a drug dealer whose \\"occupation\\" detracted from his message of art and love.I did watch the film through to the end simply because I could not believe it could get any worse, but worse it got. Nowadays this is considered a classic film that is studied in film courses, but in my own personal view only the technical aspects of the film are worth raving about. As a woman and a feminist, I find the movie greatly insulting. Sorry if anyone out there thinks me mean-spirited for this, but, that's the way I feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Disturbing Movie","review":"This movie definitely is disturbing for the soul and the mind.

If you enjoy an entire movie about strange neighbors, a middle aged man that is obsessed with a cheerleader and spends his time masterbating and smoking pot, a neurotic wife, a really wierd daughter, and predictable plot (now who ever thought that the girl WASN'T a virgin)...

As for me, my disappointment lies in expectations. I heard great things about the film and saw excerpts which led me to believe it would have many humorous moments. I wish advertisers would do more honest up front promoting of their films. Say something like \\"well done, well acted, dark film about suburbia that will leave you feeling depressed\\" so that if that is what you are in the mood for you can say, \\"yep...this one's for me.\\"As for me, I wish I had not spent the money.I give the movie two stars only because it is well done...for that type of film.

The first album, Destruction by Definition, is a great album, one of the bests. The second, Battle Hymns is just flat out horrible no matter how much you try to get youl listen and try to get use to this album, it just kills you. This album has a couple of nice songs where it is more ska-ish, but when they try to play hard core is when they all mess up. The worst song on Dest. by Def's worst song is better than Battle Hymns best song. Every odd song is the decent ska-ish type on battle hymns until like song 12"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want political punk, get Propagandhi!","review":"OK. Either you love or hate the Suicide Machines. I personally don't care for them. The ska on this album is not bad, but the punk is rotten! The message is good, but the vehicle (the music) needs work. I admit, the album has the ferociousness that I like to see in punk, but if you want the ferociousness and the message of the Suicide Machines in a better package, I suggest Propagandhi or Good Riddance. I give the album 2 stars because there are a few good tracks, namely \\"Someone\\", \\"Give\\", \\"Black and White World\\", and \\"High Society\\". The rest just ain't good."},{"rating":"1","title":"no good! get destruction!","review":"this cd is really bad compared to destruction. someone is an ok song and probably the best on the cd. the rest is real bad. short 1 min songs with no melody and then slow ska loops. this cd is no good!!!! i would only listen to someone and independence parade.

The Suicide Machines had thrown that ska-core stuff from their last CD out the window and became a hardcore band. Battle Hymns is filled with such energy and aggression that the music seems to jump from the stereo and slap in the face. The Machines take on a lot of political issues as well as relationship problems and their is still some ska thrown in the mix. Buy this CD NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the hardest and loudest punk/hardcore cd of all time","review":"this cd is just the best cd of all time for hardcore punk. it will get you going in the morning i'll bet you. the best songs are confused,ddt,strike,punck and jah. it is a big leap from the first cd.

This is a fast pace cd full of both punk rock a sak that makes you just want to get up and skank untill your house fall in. It starts out pretty hard with a great tune and then surprises you with a ska like melody.

It keeps your attention the whole time. Sure there were some slow times, but overall it will keep your attention. I would recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, predictable, and over-acted","review":"I am usually a big fan of both Robert Zemeckis and Harrison Ford so I was really looking forward to seeing this film, especially considering all the praise it received at the box office. But when I finally watched this one, I was very disappointed. The pace of the movie is painfully slow, until the ending, and by then I was tired of the movie. The plot twists are very predictable. And the digital effects used in the film look awkward and don't add anything to the film (except to the budget). The Hitchcock style that Zemeckis uses at the end of the film is almost too obvious and is not very effective. As far as Harrison Ford goes, he does a good job with his character. But Michelle Pfeiffer does some terrible over-acting as Ford's unstable wife. All-in-all, this movie was a big let-down. Worth a rental, but don't waste your money buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Herring'sville","review":"I was very disappointed with this movie. It started out suspenseful enough, but then it couldn't decide what it wanted to be, a ghost movie, a murder mystery, whatever... It was very predictable and the attempted murder scene in the bathtub, rather than being suspenseful ended up being long and tedious (no \\"Psycho\\" shower scene). Then the old cliche of having the murderer revive after you think he's a goner... Don't villains who get conked out ever stay put ! Then the scene in the lake where the murderer tries to get rid of the Michelle in the sunken car ! It was all in the dark, and I only found out who survived (another cliche, as if the murderer gets away !...) when Michelle Pfeiffer visits the tomb of the other missing girl, so we know that she escaped from the doomed car. How she escaped - that's the mystery for me !"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT LIES BENEATH is one of the best movies out there!!","review":"This movie is awesome and Ill tell you why. I was counting the days down untill it was came out on DVD, and I ran out in the morning to get it!! This movie leaves you hanging on the edge and you just bite your nails to see what happens next! Michelle Phiffer was EXCELLENT!!! she really is a great actress and should of won an award for the role that she played! YOU HAVE TO OWN THIS ON VIDEO because its the best movie I ever seen! I watch it every single day!!! Im obsessed with it, and you will be too. Dont listen to any bad reviews because they are sooo wrong. Go and buy this film its a collectors!!

THis movie is so dumb, with all the cliches: the villain that's supposed to be dead after hitting his head but it's not; the underwater car at night where it seems like daylight, so clear it is underwater !! THe \\"suspense\\" where everyone knows right from the start who is the bad guy; Ford giving another lesson in bad acting...Well, it seems to me, reading the reviews below, that I'm wrong in my point of view. So, enjoy this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE","review":"I cannot believe that I paid to see this movie in the theaters. I would give anything to be able to go back in time and see something else. The plot in this movie moves so unbelievably slow. There is nothing scary, creepy, or even remotely startling in this movie. They try to make the bathroom scenes scary, but it doesn't work. If you want to see the best parts, watch the trailer. Both Harrison Ford & Michelle Pfeiffer give such weak performances that you can't believe these are two premier actors. I have probably seen thousands of movies, and this has to make my top 10 list of worst movies ever. I just wish I could give it zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we supposed to take this seriously?","review":"Seriously, this movie has Michelle...I don't care that much to finish her last name. She is a terrible actress and yet she keeps getting roles in good movies. This isn't one of them. Unlike her catwoman preformance in \\"Batman Returns\\" where she was at least nice to look at, she does nothing in this movie. It's not even up to par with \\"Dangerous Laisons,\\" in which where suppsoed to believe the hottest women in france are Glenn Close (ok, technically she is an attractive older woman) and Michelle. If that's true, I'm never going to france.This movie, and the plot could have been covered in a seven minute short film...and how did they get Harrison Ford to do this?All in all this movie sucks and time should not be wasted watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my fav.'s...","review":"I thought this movie was excellant.True, it wasn't that scary, but I think it had a good plot- line, and Michelle never let me down in the whole movie. I think Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford were EXCELLANT together, and if they ever made another movie together, I would definately see it. This was another movie I didn't mind paying full price for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Supernatural Fatal Attraction!","review":"This was a pretty good thriller about a depressed woman believing she's going crazy when strange things begin happening in her house. Turns out that it's the spirit of a jealous, vengeful past lover of her husband's. It's along the lines of \\"Fatal Attraction\\" but with the supernatural added in. Very suspenseful ending similar to the classic \\"Fatal Attraction\\" ending with the bath tub, but a little different. If you're into ghost stories, horror thrillers, and soap opera thrillers, then you should see this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"This movie was very haunting and told through a minimal amount of characters and superb acting.

I usually like Harrison Ford, but this movie is SORRY. For a surprise ending to be successful, you should be able to look back through the movie and recognize that the clues were there. The clues in this one are deliberately misleading, and make no sense when you look back. The big finale is a joke - the effects people must have been asleep. Pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Shouda Been Buried, You Mean!","review":"As a film for which I had high hopes, \\"What Lies Beneath\\" truly disappointed. With stars Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer, as well as killed director Robert Zemeckis, I expected this to be an intriguing, well-acted thriller. That was not to be.Upon initial renting, I found myself bored to death by the slow pacing, the absences of real thrills, and an clichéd premise that had been much better in other films: y'know, the one where hubby has a deadly secret and wifey begins her suspicions. With about a half hour to finish, I returned the tape.Seeing the last quarter of the film recently on its HBO airing, I was no more satisfied by the denouement. Ford seems to sleep his way through the ending and Pfeiffer continues in the \\"screaming Mimi\\" vein.Even Alan Silvestri's score, in an attempt to mimic the great Bernard Herrmann, is as waterlogged as is the film.To paraphrase Bensen, I \\"know\\" Hitchcock, and this ain't no Hitchcock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"totally awesome horror","review":"This is my most favorite horror film ever. It's one of the few I can watch every year or two and still jump even though I know what's coming. I am surprised the other reviews aren't even better.

Couldn't have fit better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great thriller","review":"I have to begin by saying that this is one of my all time favorite movies. You are a Hitchcock fan then you will love this movie. It has the same feel of a Hitchcock movie but with modern technology.

It's an excellent film and will make an excellent addition to anyone's film collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done , we even get to see Harrison Ford with no","review":"shirt, not bad for a guy pushing 70.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good but not great homage to Hitchcock","review":"'What Lies Beneath' directed by Robert Zemeckis ends with a very satisfying bang / surprise, but it is just a bit tedious in getting there. Contrary to the blurbs on the jacket, the movie does not live up to Hitchcock's quality and does not do for the bathtub what 'Psycho' did for the shower.While it is not as bad as the most critical reviews, it does not add lots of points to its stars' resumes, as it simply does not effectively use the ambiguity between psychosis and the supernatural as we see in Hitchcock and the best of Stephen King.Nice surprise in the casting and in the technique used to attempt murder. Otherwise, average."},{"rating":"1","title":"What lies beneath? Utter Boredom","review":"Come on! a \\"non-stop thrill ride\\" maybe if you are a member of an undiscovered tribe deep in the jungle... or maybe if you have been dead for a hundred years and have never seen a \\"talkie\\" before. This movie, apart from being derivative and MIND NUMBINGLY BORING, is so predictable that it had us going \\"... and his eyes open!\\", \\"... and he's in the back of the truck!\\", \\"... and it's only the dog!\\" about a minute and a half before the lame, predictable, cheap, non-thrill occurred on-screen. There were virtually NO special effects, which can at least make a big waste-of-time movie watchable. And, I will admit I am usually a complete dullard when it comes to guessing the \\"twist\\" in movies (i.e. had no clue about Sixth Sense) but I had this stinker figured out in about 15 minutes. Save your money, and remember Time is something one can never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're All Mad","review":"Classic thriller? Hitch would have enjoyed it? Oh My God are you people out of touch. This was a slow, dull, verbose, convoluted, trashy, wannabe adult thriller with a bit of style, no substance, pregnant pauses of triplet proportions and a few moments that make you jump out of your seat. What is most annoying about this film is that the first forty minutes, in which we are shown the next-door neighbours as red herrings. This would be acceptable if their strange circumstances were later explained. This large portion of the film is totally unnecessary, boring and there for seemingly unknown reasons. What is further frustrating is the ending does not belong in the same movie as the rest. After a good bathroom scene we are treated (?) to a series of calamities where good, well-respected actors are placed in a very bad scream-clone. All in all a flat out disappointment, and one better left off your dvd shelf. What Lies Beneath??? Not very much!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless in every way","review":"What's the point of taking a substandard ghost script and making a whole movie out of it, especially when practically identical forms of entertainment and media just like it come out every week?

I thought it was awful. the whole movie is dark,like those cheap movies where you can't see anything because the budget was too low to pay for special effects, and they substitute obscurity.

The first hour almost put me to sleep. And the scene with the ouija board was not even enough to keep me engaged mentally through the rest of the film. Yet I did sit through the whole film, miraculously! And I usually don't complain about movies that much, but Harrison Ford turns me off in movies. He's just getting to old to entertain anymore. He reminds me of an old grandfather who has volatile mood swings, yet tries to turn it into acting.By far this film is the worst ever produced. And this movie turned me off of the Science Fiction-Horror realm. And not to mention some of the special effects looked as cheesy as the special effects in Deep Blue Sea and The Frighteners. And I think that any Alfred Hitchcock film is ten times better than this film.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"I don't like scary movies. I don't like them for the same reason I don't like rollercoasters with loops in them. Sure-- I know I'll survive the coaster, but that doesn't make it FUN. Ironically, this movie would have BEEN better if it had been scary.Sloppy sloppy sloppy.The acting was mediocre, the plot was easy to guess half way through the movie, and once the movie \\"reveals all,\\" it stutters through some subpar slasher-esque scences for about 15 or so minutes of redundant cheap trick camera angles and constantly annoying music.Only watch this to complete your Harrison Ford collectin. There is no other reason for it to exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Endings Ever","review":"From the beginning of the movie it is great. I believe that It builds suspense and it keeps my attention. But as it goes on it starts to drag. The ending is just terrible. It is so unblievable. What are the odds that they would fall into the lake in which the girl was killed. What are the odds that the murdered girl would come back to life and hold Harrison Ford down so he will drowned. And why would Michelle Pfeiffer chase after the identity of the missing girl. Harrison Ford acted terrible in the movie. Clearly one of his worst performances of all time. This movie could possible be a good movie to rent if you like good begginings but terrible endings. But it is not good enough to buy. It does not hit in my top 100 charts."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good sleeping aid.","review":"The movie moves very slow at the beginning (and by \\"beginning\\", I mean the first 3/4 of the film) and doesn't have much happening plot-wise. Some \\"surprise\\" plot twists along the way keep you interested, only to let you down again. They just kind of leave you hanging. There was absolutely no chemistry between the two main actors.I did give it 2 stars because it picks up pace at the end (action-wise, but not plot-wise) and makes you glued to the screen, wondering what's going to happen next. Its just regrettable that the rest of the movie couldn't have been the same.At best, a renter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"A boring, mediocre \\"thriller\\", with unengaging characters, and an illogical plot. By the time you've reached the end, you really have to wonder why anybody is doing what they're doing. The conclusion is really just illogical. You'd think that expensive talent like Ford, Pfeiffer, and Zemeckis could have chosen a better script, and created a much better movie. If you want Hitchcokian thrillers, go with the originals (or even Branagh's \\"Dead Again\\", a much better thriller)."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG BUDGET = NOT SCARY","review":"I rarely review films on this site, but I just have to say that this is not only one of the worst attempts at a scary movie but also one of the worst movies ever made. The only way Hollywood could make a scary movie is if they filmed the private lives of it's stars. \\"What Lies Beneath\\" is nothing but a boring and pathetic shoplifter of far better movies. Try the 70s classic \\"Let's Scare Jessica To Death\\" or \\"Ghost Story\\"...the original films that this ... stole from instead. ..., an episode of \\"American Idol\\" is far scarier.

Unfortunately, the lame story kicked in and I lost interest. I won't go into some of the plot points, but you could drive a truck convoy through them. The DVD picture didn't even look as good the second hour as it did the first, probably because of more night shots. I did like the sound though. That was the only aspect of the film that stayed solid throughout the long two-plus hours. If you want a film like this, stick to \\"The Sixth Sense.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy","review":"This is one of the better movies made recently in this genre. It's more of a supernatural-suspense movie than horror. Michele Pfeifer is great as the empty-nested mother who becomes spooked by strange occurences. Is something happening to her or is she going crazy? Either one is an option. It was a good movie with a rather surprise ending. If your looking for something gory or something to jump out at you this isn't the movie for you. Rather it is a very well made, well acted atmospheric movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something you watch once","review":"I just watched this movie last night. It was pretty good as far as suspense goes and it freaked me out. What interested me was the haunting aspect. I'm really into all that ghostly stuff. Over all it was a pretty good movie. But it's something where once you know what happens, you probably won't want to watch it again because you know what's going to happen. Also, there were many parts where they tried to throw you off that didn't really seem to fit into the plot. so, that made it a little confusing.

Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer gave great performances as Norman and Claire, the perfect couple leading the \\"perfect\\" life, until these ghostly apparitions start appearing in the house, etc. This film will send chills tingling down your back until the end. And also, you will never believe who the killer is in this movie!! But I will not say who he/she is until someone has rented or bought this movie. The extras for the DVD were exceptional. The pretty decent extra was the trailer for the film. But anyways, dont miss this film!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding, underrated thriller!","review":"What Lies Beneath is a highly entertaning film, full of great moments, from the always fantastic Robert Zemeckis. Great performances from the entire cast, but Michelle Pfeiffer owns the film with an outstanding performance. Involving story-telling, patient pacing, and great GOTCHA! moments. Keeps you engrossed like a great novel as you watch the story unfold. One of the films biggest assets is it's creepy and eerie atmosphere, perfect setting. Works it's magic best in late-night viewings with the lights out! Have fun with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Parents Like Scary Movies, Too!","review":"It was amusing to see the droves of adults who went to see \\"What Lies Beneath\\" because of the stars. \\"What Lies Beneath\\" is basically lite-horror fare, a \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\" targeted to adults.All jokes aside, it was a nicely done thriller without the help of a knife/hook wielding serial killer with a cache of bodies hidden in the basement/tower/freezer. A lot of critics griped about some of the standard devices used to frighten the audience. Well, in my case, it still worked, so if it ain't broke... I jumped out of my seat a few times. Overall, a nice psychological element to all the terror rather than relying on the ever popular gore. Both Harrison and Michelle did a nice job on their characters, which makes up for the few slow moments in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"........boo.","review":"THIS is what passes for a horror movie in this day and age!???!!To quote the great Homer J. Simpson, this movie is more boring than church. How can anyone consider this movie even REMOTELY scary or suspenseful? Aside from a few surprises (which are all shown on the trailer, by the way), this movie is pretty much dialogue, scared looks, and a lousy plot filled with more holes than swiss cheese. It is also very long...it moves in a way that you keep thinking it's gonna end, and BAM! Something else comes up, and we have to wait fifteen minutes for that to get solved. If you want a real horror movie, I recommend anything from my list, \\"The Best Scary Movies Out There!\\". But pass this one up.

Not to mention that the ending is rediculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"What absolute drivel","review":"If Harrison Ford had acted this badly in Blade Runner or Star Wars, he would never have got anywhere in his career! Come on HF, we expected better than this from you. Give us something worth watching next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Lies Beneath? Absolutely nothing.","review":"Perhaps director/writer Robert Zemeckis should have stuck with comedies like \\"Back to the Future\\". This attempt at a thriller is dismal, becoming increasingly scattered until the story finally peters out into complete boredom. It seems like Zemeckis would have said to himself at one point \\"Hey, what th' Hell is going on here?\\" That's what I was saying after about 45 minutes. Plot lines are developed and then disappear. Coincidences and revelations are totally unbelievable. And the \\"surprise\\" ending? Preposterous. The stars Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer (who are both starting to look a little dowdy, by the way) give blah performances. For anyone who has never seen a classic Hitchcock (and there are a lot of el-cheapo touches here) this \\"thriller\\" might be acceptable. For others ... caveat emptor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So dumb it's funny","review":"This is a film to truly ask the question of what happened to Robert Zemeckis. He used to be so good, yet, this film is unforgiveable. The acting is terrible, the story line is mediocre at best, and the shooting style doesn't hide who it steals from. There's a differene between developing and creating new techniques that others somewhat developed as apposed to downright stealing them. To give any credit to this movie, I would say watch it if you want a great laugh. It's a perfect example of what a film shouldn't do and is incredibly funny because of its awfulness. The only problem is that it wasn't made with a conscious attempt to make it horrible, which just makes it sad. In all reality though, you may just pray to get the two hours of your life back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie But Not As Scary As Made Out To Be","review":"This was a great movie with a good plot and the actors played their roles well.

This film fits the EC formula perfectly and once I realized that I took it for what it was--a 'B' movie with an 'A' movie gloss. I have to admit that some of the overt Hitchcock references were annoying and that the Hollywood gloss sometimes gets in the way of what maybe should have been a low-budget flick; but, it was fascinating to see Academy-award nominated actors (and director) making a film of this nature. Once you realize what it is you're seeing and adjust your expectations accordingly, a good time can be had by all.

But the one thing that happens the most is the bath tub keeps filling up with hot water. Norman thinks its all a joke until he sees it for himself and does he know who that girl is?

Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer, fine actors though they are, do NOT belong in these roles, and their prescence is distracting and slightly uncomfortable. On the other hand, if you're a foot fetishist, buy this movie at any price!

Considering how well crafted and inventive his other films such as Forrest Gump and Castaway were, this film resorts to corny special effects and hackneyed suspense techniques. This film has been compared to Hitchcocks films. The difference however is that Hitchcock will employ brilliant camera techniques and timing and music -- NOT cop-out techniques of artificial CGI to paste in ghost images.Furthermore Harrison Ford's character development is simply inconsistent and rather unbelievable. This is a well done \\"made-for-tv\\" movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring and predictable...","review":"...it was almost unbearable to make it to the end. I haven't been writing many reviews lately, but this one was sooo bad I couldn't resist.

The door shuts on her, she sees a reflection of someone in the bathtub, and the mirror writes a word by itself. There are many jumpy scenes leading to the conclusion. I did already know the conclusion half way through the movie; it was kind of easy to guess, but still, it is done terribly creepy and awesome. Lots of Oh My Gosh! scenes in the end which leave you thinking; that's all I'll say, don't want to spoil it for you! Yes, I'd definitely recommend this to everyone.

However, an unwelcome visitor to her home begins to foil her plans.The first half of What Lies beneath was wonderful, very spooky and captivating. The visual beauty of the Vertmont landscape was also quite well done.

I thought What Lies Beneath was one of those movies that you like from the start and it gets really boring to the ending. If you want to see a good scary movie rent The Sixth Sense. Haley Joel Osmont has more good acting then Harrison Ford. I liked Harrison Ford in the Star Wars movies but the way he acts in his other movies looks like he seems a little disappointed. The only thing that's scary about this movie is when Harrison Ford is a good guy in the beginning and he turns into a bad guy at the end.

Why? Well, if you can't see the characters, nor understand them, what's the point?There isn't a point. From the dialogue that I could understand, it wasn't particularly well written either. No new ground was staked out on the whole confusing sexuality thing, and to make this even less believable, a truly beautiful and handsome man who seemed to possess some depth (but who can tell, really), is in love with a \\"blugh\\". A \\"blugh\\" is someone unattractive and socially undesirable.This movie is so low on the meter that imdb.pro doesn't even list it on its website.

The armstraps on the miracle blanket keep his hands secure all night!Only issue is he can kick his feet out of the pouch and this will wake him up.

They are soft, stretchy & lightweight (so baby doesn't sweat). Maybe if you have trouble swaddling, I can see how this would make it easier, but trust me - with a newborn, you do it enough to get the hang of it pretty quick.

It's still not perfect, but a lot better than the miracle blanket and generally he does not get out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Love this Swaddle!!!","review":"I have tried several swaddles, this one is the best on the market! My son is 4 months old now, and he still fits great in it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They won't get out of this!!","review":"My son is really strong and he can't unswaddle himself from this, unlike everything else we've tried. The result, 8-10 hours of sleep straight through at night. Worth $30 easily!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible return experience with Miracle Blanket","review":"My baby loved to sleep swaddled, either in receiving blankets or \\"Swaddle Me\\" blankets. As he began to outgrow these first two options, we decided to try the Miracle Blanket and ordered one from Amazon. We were particularly confident in trying it because of the miracle blanket company's \\"100% Satisfaction Guarantee\\".Although we have heard that most babies adore the Miracle Blanket, our child hated it and after several attempts we followed Miracle Blanket's written directions for returns (found on their website) precisely and sent the blanket back expecting a refund. I even spoke with one of their representatives over the phone before sending it. This was over 4 months ago, and we have yet to receive our refund via PayPal.I am now incredibly skeptical of the company's \\"guarantee\\"! Consider yourself warned..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps baby in!","review":"This swaddle is A+ when trying to keep your little one in. My son is a mover and can get out of most swaddles, but this one really keeps him in! There are arm ties to help keep babies arms down, and the extra long wrap helps keeps a tight swaddle, even when baby moves. One of the nicest functions is that it does NOT have velcro, which I find to be annoying if your baby doesn't fit the \\"mold\\" of what size the swaddle is intended for. It also prevents ruining other clothes when you wash it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!!","review":"I got one of these right after my son was born. I tried to swaddle him in a normal swaddling blanket but he wiggled right out of it. This blanket is AWESOME! He did not wiggle out of it and it also helped him sleep at night. We used it for the first 3 months and I think he enjoyed it as much as we did! I recommend this blanket to all those parents who have a wiggle baby or a fussy baby. It also calmed him down because he was a slightly fussy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Complicated","review":"Not what I expected. Never understood the directions and, after learning how to swaddle at the hospital, this was more complicated. After the first month, if the baby is strong enough to unwrapped himself, then this product becomes a good idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Switched swaddling blankets after a few weeks","review":"I got this when my now 4 month old was almost a week old hoping it would help my little one sleep better. The swaddling defiantly helped! Swaddling and a fisher price rock n play and by 2 months old my son was almost sleeping through the night! I used the Miracle blanket for a few weeks then I switched to the aden and anais muslin swaddling blankets because it was easier when doing night time diaper changes. Be careful when using the miracle blanket in warmer weather as my September baby frequently got to hot in this and I would have to unwrap him thus defeating the purpose of keeping him in a calming swaddle when he was fussy. Overall, I like the Aden and Anais swaddling blankets better once i figured out how to swaddle my son tight enough in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just like it should!","review":"My baby smiles every time I put him in his miracle blanket. I wish I would have gotten it sooner. I didn't get it tell he was 8 weeks old. He loves it and before I would swaddle with a regular blanket and my son would always get his arms out and that would wake him cause he would knock his paci out with his hands while sleeping. Now he is snug as a bug in his miracle blanket!! This is my 3rd baby and I have never used one of these before and if I have another baby I will for sure have one before the next kids even born!! Also I have a big baby he was 9lbs 10oz at birth and it fits him no problem. He is 13lbs. 6oz. and 23.5icnehs long right now and we are still using it at 10 weeks old. Highly recommend it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tutorials are wrong & no support","review":"There are errors throughout the tutorials, and several are major enough to halt the process of the design.

Easy to follow and a pleasant romance. I recommend it :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This far one of Motorheads best cds. The vocals were great the lyrics were terrific and the instrumental parts were just super amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too many fillers","review":"This is a very similar album to Iron Fist, in the sense that it too was the follow-up of an absolute classic Motorhead album (Overkill cq Ace of Spades), in the sense that it too was thrown on the market too hastily and in the sense that it too contains too many fillers to be a really strong album. Sad but true, it was this sloppiness in putting out records that explains to a large degree why Motorhead never became as big as Maiden or Priest.This said, three of the best Motortunes ever are on this CD. The live sensation Bomber, the awesome Stone Dead Forever (in my top-5 of all-time best Motorhead songs), and the slow paced, chilling Lawman should feature in every metal / punk / rock enthousiast's iPod collection. Enough reasons to buy the CD? Sure, but not before you've bought Overkill, Ace of Spades, Another Perfect Day, Inferno, On Parole and Orgasmatron."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome album from a great rock band!","review":"Classic early Motorhead. Great album! The production quality started climbing up with this album. Love the cover art. I don't have all of their albums yet, but I put this one as number 4, after Orgasmatron, Inferno, and Ace of Spades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skimmed through much of it","review":"After a while, the reading gets mundane. There were many passages that read:'I walked through the darkly lit hallways. It was cold. I pulled the lamp in front of me to see better. The wind died down. I shivered...\\"Much of the story was in 'essay-speak' form and didn't read like a story at all. The plot itself is interesting which is why I gave it 1 star.I think the story would have been better written in third person rather than from the many viewpoints of the characters in the story. This format would have been fine if each character had a distinct voice but all of them sounded the same. Really, it almost seems like Pattou made more of a book-mache of journal entries or even drafts and just put them together. The characters were only two dimensional and the writing with no feeling or character.Your better off reading the actual fairy tale itself, with all it's loopholes and consider that a satisfying read versus 400 or so pages of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: NO DEPTH!","review":"I wanted to like this book, I really did. It sounded great, loved the whole \\"Beauty & the Beast\\" thing, being a big fan of fantasy and fairy tales in particular I thought it would be a great book.... sadly I was wrong. I thought 4 view points might be interesting... but all it did was repeat the same scenario's over again from everyone's viewpoint and you never seem to really GO anywhere, or to really know anyone to care what happens to them. You never get attached to any of the characters because you never have time to bond with them before your ripped into someone else's viewpoint. All the head hopping made me nauseated."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 for story...1 for originality...","review":"I liked this book alot, but it is almost an EXACT copy of my favorite book \\"The Golden Compass,\\" by Philip Pullman. His book is about a girl who goes to the North to cross a bridge made by the northern lights (might I add she is accompanied by a pansbjorne: aka. polar bear) even the words are similiar: philip pullman's polar bear is called a pansbjorne--hers is called an isbjorne or something similiar. It is mention more than once in Edith Pattou's book a bridge that connects the spirit world to the regular world made out of the northern lights: that EXACTLY the same thing in \\"the golden compass!\\" What really makes me angry is that in all of her interviews they ask \\"What books inspired you?\\" she doesn't even mention \\"the golden compass!\\" and OBVIOUSLY she read it cause its EXACTLY the same!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very glad I bought this","review":"At first the story was a bit slow but about 5 chapters into it and it became interesting. I would recommend this to anyone who loves fairy tails. I'm also interested in reading more of her books. East is a wonderful story full of memorable characters and a great storyline. Do pick it up it is really worth reading. ^_^"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Great","review":"I have read this book about 8 times and i have to say that i can never get enough of it! its a really great story about a young girl named Rose who is taken from her family by a white bear and is to live with him for two full moon phrases. I absoulty loved this book and recomended for people of all ages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plenty of Direction","review":"Are you getting tired of the girl-meets-talking-bear theme yet? Yeah, me neither. This was a terrific novel that wove in elements of Nordic mythology and fantasy together with a strong heroine and compelling story. Bears, weaving, family, solitude, evil sorceresses...all great themes that kept me up way past my bedtime. This would be a great book to curl up with on a cold, snowy day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful retelling of a classic....","review":"As a K-6 librarian I am always looking for new authors to recommend to students. I will easily be able to recommend this book. Combining elements of Beauty and the Beast, Norse mythology, and East of the Sun, West of the Moon, Pattou tells an enchanting story of Rose and the Great White Bear. The story is told from several \\"voices\\" as not only Rose and the Bear tell the story but also her brother Neddy, the Troll Queen, and Rose's father. A definite \\"good read.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise!","review":"What a fantastic book! I've probably read it three or four times already. The plot and characters really reach out to me and I was immediately pulled into Rose's world.While I was reading, I was very pleased and stunned to figure out the troll language. The language, in fact, is Finnish. Since I speak Finnish, I was able to find a few errors in the author's writing, but it didn't really bother me. I've just been wondering if anyone else noticed that.All in all, though, this was an amazing book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great fairy tale re-telling","review":"It was a great re-telling of the East of the Sun West of the Moon story that used that basic framework but then spun a truly original story. The characters were interesting, the writing was good, he form was interesting where it was told from different viewpoints, and it had a satisfying ending. It was a good YA story with thought-provoking themes. I was struck with the idea that life revolves around the day-to-day tasks of living. They are what make living worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON.\\"","review":"While reading this (long stretched) fairytale, I was surprised by how the author switched from person to person. From my point of view it might have seemed annoying, but once I got to thinking about it I realized it must have been a challenge for Edith Pattou to do it that way. When someone does right like this (switching from person to person) you always have to make sure that the chapters are lined up correctly so nothing sounds strange or out of place.This is a very interesting book (and that is all I have to say)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like i stand alone on this...","review":"I was disapointed by East. My number one reason being that i never felt any connection between Rose and \\"The Man who was a White Bear\\". The person with the most emotion in the book was Rose's brother Neddy, not the girl who was treking the globe in a search to find her lost \\"friend\\" who seemed to forget her a bit to easily if you ask me, slank or no slank. Not to mention there just always seemed to be to easy a solution at hand for every problem. I mean, sure there always has to be SOME solution but the way she got into the Ice Palace? *shrugs*. The story definately had it's good points. It was a breeze to read once you started it, and the journey itself was exciting (i loved Malmo the most)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, Fantastic, Most Definatley on My Favorite Book list","review":"I originally bought this book to pass the time till Harry Potter came out but I read it too quickly for that. It was amazing. I have always loved fantasy so it might not appeal to the realistic fiction group. It was truly wonderful, and should be on your reading list. People say that the different points of veiw make the book choppy and i disagree 100%"},{"rating":"2","title":"East of East","review":"I always love the 'East of the Sun and West of the Moon' story and was curious to read this one. It turned out like reading a fairytale put into the real world, with places and time in history. It was so amazing :) and the heroine not just win the white bear then married him, happily ever after. This book gave a more believable start, process, climax and ending with help from magic since the cursed bear was born out of magic (the goblin's) too so it was only fair.I only have small problems in reading it. There were some dialog/thought not properly put into a character and they sometimes made me stop for a while to think it over. I also feel the start was kinda slow. But overall, I enjoy this story of Rose and her White Bear, specially about the birth-direction myth.A fairytale came to life :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The heroine saves the hero.","review":"The heroine saves the hero.Enjoyed this lovely book. Rose is a strong and adventurous young woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Book","review":"East is about a girl called Rose, born as a north child, but everyone thinks she is an east child. Her direction of birth predicts that she will die in an avalanche, and her mother frantically does not want to lose another child. But when a polar bear comes to Rose, offering to cure her dying sister and restore the family fortunes, despite all of her family's protests, Rose goes. In this retelling of \\"East of the Sun, West of the Moon\\", Rose eventually goes to the troll's palace, frees the prince who was the bewitched polar bear, and they settle down together.The book is good, except for the end. All of the sudden, it becomes choppy beyond belief. It is hard to swtich the viewpoints as quickly as the author would like to, but it is relatively good. I would recommend this to fantasy lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nocturnal","review":"This is a fantastic album. Dope beats, heavy lyrics, this album has it all.

Izumi and Yan offer a collection of compelling case studies that give hope to teachers and students still struggling under the yoke of classroom bureaucracy. The model charter schools profiled are well researched, and provide an insightful look at how breaking the public school orthodoxy with charter school reform can make a difference in the lives of children everywhere. Free to Learn was an enjoyable read, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and insightful analysis combined with engaging personal stories","review":"I found Free to Learn insightful, as the authors navigate through several different charter school success stories, highlighting inefficiencies in public schools and the mechanisms that allow charter schools to more adequately handle these situations, without superfluously extolling virtue. Yan and Izumi deftly touch upon both commonalities and differences between these successful charters - emphasizing the fact that there is no \\"one size fits all\\" solution. Yet, comparisons with non-successful charters are included for a balanced viewpoint. Lastly, the personal stories of those students lives affected or the principals and teachers driving positive change give this policy book a very human feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"revolutionary","review":"Anne Rice has created an entirely new universe of vampires with this novel.

I have read this book three times in the last 15 years or so and I can't wait to pick it up again in a couple years. Rice has a way of making you believe her. The main character in this book is Louis and you can not help but feel for him and love him. And on the other side you can't help but love to hate Lestat, the 'villain'. If you haven't already read this book, read it now. But please keep in mind this isn't like the fluff Vampire reads out there now, you probably won't be able to read this in one sitting.

Thoroughly researched, her books are steeped in history and study, bringing a level of validity and depth to her writing that many of her contemporaries lack. Crafted in a modern, gothic-esque fashion, the story weaves through a span of some two hundred years as the character, Louis, meets Lestat and is made a vampire. His dealings and travels are remarkably relayed, drawing the reader into the story. You cannot put it down! Luckily, this is only the beginning of the Vampire Chronicles, and the seed is sown for the remaining five novels..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Beginning","review":"Anne Rice establishes a strong framework with her first novel in the Vampire Chronicles series. I read this novel after finding the movie a delicious addition to the Vampire myth. Upon reading the book, I enjoyed every twist, turn, and detail that gave the book such a lush feel. I love this book simply because it establishes a world within a world: the character's are so colorful one cannot seem to place them anywhere else but in the world of fiction but the realistic settings and the provacative emotions make one think that these characters are real and that Lestat, Louis, and the others are real beings existing in our world.This book I believe is our modern-day Dracula and a good read for anyone interested in vampires in general, but also for anyone interested in devastatingly human relationships, emotions, and struggles"},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it could not put it down!","review":"I started this book near Christmas and wizzed thew the whole sriis (inculding Pandora) and finished recently. But this one is the first and one of the best! I seen the movie first but as alot of people will agaree the book was much better. Louis niative is endreing and his story is spell binding! Lestat is unkind and crass but that's what get's you interested I love the carecter of Claudia, her silence in the first part of her vampiric life sets you up for an emtioal blow out that you feel coming even if you didn't see the movie first.

Rice's style was very hard to adjust to at first, as someone who read her for the first time with this book, but once you're use to it it sucks you in. This is a very beautiful and powerful story leading through the history of a Vampire named Louis. It discusses how and when he was turned into a Vampire--at the hands of the infamous Vampire Lestat. This is a book that truly belongs in the classic literature section decades and centries from now, and hopefully it will earn its place. This is a book everyone should be had to read, and it is certainly well worth the reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"If you haven't read this book, you're cheating yourself!

This story is truly incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Introduction to one of my favorite book series","review":"I've always thought that, just as H.P. Lovecraft deals with the macrocosm (i.e., outside ourselves- cosmology), Anne Rice is his equal when it comes to the nature of a person.It is ironic that, when we read about these vampires and how they feel, we learn more about human nature, and ourselves.This book deals with an interview with a vampire (surprise) named Louis, and chronicles his descent into the hidden vampiric world with the one who made him a vampire, Lestat.If you read this and like it you must continue reading the other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sinister and Intriguing","review":"Anne Rice is a compelling writer.

Interesting concept.What I thought, or didn't like about the book is that if the boy (Daniel) never spoke much & Louis just kept on going & going & going. If he's a reporter, he should be asking, reporting.Anyways, the book was addictive, page after page of new adventures & curiousity.

We learn of Lestat an older and immortal French vampire living in French New Orleans, and newly made Louis, a young French planter. Their affair might be homosexual if vampires did anything sexual but in Rice's vampire world sex is virtually unthinkable, they're dead you know. Louis never can make up his mind to be the vampire he is, feeling guilt feelings and drinking chicken or rat blood instead of killing humans. In his misery he makes a girl into a vampire, against the vampire rules. She will forever be a child, because she's dead doncha know.

As such it is original, vibrant and haunting. An actual vampire is interviewed. He describes his transition from a mortal man to an immortal vampire and he describes his moral transition from a vampire who, initially, feasts only on 'undesireables' to one who will destroy literally anyone.We see a fiend with a human outlook. We wonder how we, ourselves, would behave if we had the fortune [misfortune?] to be changed into a being with the remarkably positive trait of immortality with the unbelivably negative trait of hemo-cannibalism.

This book was awesome, Anne Rice is magnificent in details that do not bore me. I loved the book, but I must say that I love Lestat and he was put as the \\"enemy\\" in this book. But I love Louis too, and I understand it from his point of view. I think this book gave a grand intorduction to the rest of the Chronicles and it told you about Loius. I believe that is important, to know each character and how they feel about every other character. It is true that I was drawn this book because of the movie, but I believe the book was way better. I am now half way done with Memnoch the Devil and I recommend this series to everyone. The only part I didn't really like out this book was Claudia's character.

I simply couldn't sympathize with them. Louis simply refused to be happy. Whenever it started to look like he might be happy, he figured out some way to make himself miserable again. \\"I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints,\\" no longer has any meaning, because now all the sinners do is whine, whine, whine.

I like horror, history, New Orleans, vampires, plantations, etc. I have a degree in English Literature, just so you know I'm not an idiot. This book is not good. The story is not interesting. Why create this relationship between Louis and Lestat? It doesn't work. Why is the whole thing an interview? Just for a payoff in the end? Claudia is the only good character.

It certainly isn't up to Anne Rice's normal standards, and I found that upon reading it, I became more confused about the lives of the vampires about which she was writing than I was intrigued. Being a big fan of vampire novels at the time I first bought this book, I wondered why I had picked it up in the first place.Anne Rice's style remains fabulous throughout the book, her descriptive talents beyond imagining, but the story felt cluttered to me, and the book took me an inordinarily long time to read.Thankfully, I feel that the Vampire Chronicals truly picked up with the second novel in this series, and I have been enjoying them, when in the mood, since."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this book ever become popular?","review":"Does anyone actually speak this way?

The narrative is painful to read. Ann Rice needs 1) psychiatric help, 2) to learn to write a good sentence and 3) to learn to develop some tension/expectation (and plot) in a book.

Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's smoke, but no cigar","review":"Promises, but none kept! It entices with the intresting tale of Louis, a Louisiana plantation owner in the 1800's. Louis is made into a vampire by another vampire, Lestate. Louis' struggle with killing human to live and his resistance to give up human emotions makes him a likable guide through the world of vampires. The mysteries of vampires origins creates suspense, and when Louis leaves with a child vampire, Claudia, to discover them, the book flopps. Louis only runs around in circles in his mind about death. While one long anguishing muse is acceptable, a book cannot live on confusion alone. Had Ann Rice carried on with the plot moving vibrant painting she began with, this would have been a facinating book. Unfortunatly, I only finished the book because I hoped for awnsers to the questions asked in the beginning, but none were to be found.

At first I thought it was kind of odd because I had never read a book in that form before, but I got used to it after a while.The story is about Louis, and his tale on how he became a vampire and all the horrible struggles he had to go through. He goes on to live with the one who made him a vampire: Lestat.The book has a great plot and I recomend it to someone looking for a truely great vampire tale. But don't expect anything much of extreme horror.And also, I recommend reading the book before seeing the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome book but not for everyone","review":"From reading the other reviews I learned one thing and that is you either hate anne rice books or you love them.Do I think the people who gave this book bad reviews are idiots?No,I just think they read it from a different point of view.I love all different types of fiction and read this with an open mind.After reading it I believe it to be a modern day classic.Sometimes the lengthy dialogue can get a tad boring and becomes a chore to read and it could go with out some of the homoerotic scenes which I think take a bit away from the book but once you get into the book you feel as you are right there witnessing Louis's tale.This book can be easily loved or hated but it all depends on the readers interpretation of it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interview with the Vampire: a modern day classic","review":"I first heard about this novel when the movie was being made, and since I will read almost anything, I went out and got the book from the library. Once I opened it, I could not put it down. Ms. Rice has the wonderful talent for transporting you into the very body of her characters. She enchants and seduces her readers with every passage into her mysterious world of the undead. She makes you want to laugh, cry and rage along with Louis, Lestat, and Claudia. This is the type of storytelling power that every aspiring writer should take note of. Also, the fact that she wrote it when in the midst of grieving for her daughter, makes it all the more real to a person, even if we are not a vampire. If you decide to read her other works, you will find that she grows in talent and power with each one. Believe me, you will never be bored or dissapointed with Ann Rice"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Barely Finish","review":"While I know that this book is considered by many to be a great classic, when I read it I literally had to force myself to finish this book over the course of a month, when normally it would have taken me a matter of days. The writing dragged on and on and on with little details and events I could have cared less about. The characters did not appeal to me, except for Claudia and \\"\\"SOILER\\"\\" she was killed off rather quickly, compared to the rest of the book. The only thing that attracted me to her was her determination and more ruthless personality than Lestat and Louis, who were, in my honest opinion, too effeminite for me to greatly like. I suppose the overall story is interesting, but it is so lost in a web of mind-numbing writing and weak characters that it was impossible for me to enjoy in any way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Louis! Take a walk on the beach!","review":"Anne Rice has a way with words. There are scenes in this book which are incredibly vivid and stand out in your memory (whether you like it or not). Many people will tell you about the homoerotic undertone in this book; the only reason they might count as \\"undertones\\" is because people are pretty blind unless there is a direct, lurid sex scene. We are dealing with one of the worst-matched couples of all time. Lestat is one of the most fascinating anti-heroes I have read about in a long time. Louis, conversely, is a whiner. Hey, catch a clue, Lou! If you don't want to be a vampire anymore, just leave off the sunblock on the beach! Stop agonizing and get over it! Of course, as we see in this book, it is a lot more difficult than that. It's next to impossible to kill a vampire. Just ask Lestat. For imagery I give this book good marks; for Lestat, also good; for Louis, nothing. For plot, well... I guess there was one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an Anne rice fan here!","review":"I didn't like Anne's usage of words. I felt like I was being bombarded by feelings rather than the story. I'm a fan of Stephen King and Michael Chirchton. Now those two guys make you see the book, not just read it. I like seeing my books. She just didn't cut it, well.....at least not for me. I'm not going to have the slightest problem staying away from the rest of the chronicles, or any of Anne Rice's work for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put a stake in this book!!!","review":"I am a real fan of horror books and went into this book looking for a good read. I kept reading and reading and the story plodded on and on. I don't know if was Rice's style, the story, or what. I would keep going back to read it, to give the book a chance, but finally I just stopped reading and never finished it. I found the book boring and dull. I eventually wanted to put a stake in this book to put it out of its misery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Classic Bore","review":"I had heard much praise for this novel, so I expected it to be a great, intriguing read. This novel turned out to be one of the worst pieces of literature I have ever read. It was slow, unappealing, and could have been wrtitten far more laconically. This is the first book that I had to force myself to read, just so I could get through it. Although there were some vibrant parts, overall it was extremely bland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goth Schlock & Vampire Kitsch","review":"It's unconceivable that a novel this painstakingly dull and anemic could become so successful. Rice's plodding, unbearable exposition signals that she's spent one too many nights in the crypt. This isn't gothic at all; it reads like a Dickens Halloween Carol, with cartoon vampires acting silly and pretentious. I think maybe Anne Rice missed her calling--she should have written travel brochures. Interview With a Vampire is one of the most plastic, contrived pieces of bloodsucking ilk ever written, and Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt did an outstanding job in accentuating its cardboard dullness in the film version"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Eh....This was a pretty bad letdown for me when I finally got around to reading it.Touted as the definitive work on the Vampire subject, it is more of a long somtimes winding - sometimes quite gripping in fairness - whine fest about how its hard to be a vampire people dont understand them.Okay, I get it. I dont need over detailed descriptions of the minutia.Just tell me a story, and make it interesting....Oh yeah, and it seemed more than a little gay. I dont have anything against homesexuality, I just dont feel like reading a several hundred page often boring tale featuring men in love with other men.I will try the next volume - the vampire lestat - just to make a fair go of this series, but if it isnt better, it will most likely be my last stab at Anne Rice's \\"Vampire Chronicles\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmorizing, a great book!!!!!","review":"Anne Rice captivated me from the first sentence of the book.The story is good enough but the way that Rice articulates herself isso poetic it made me want to finish the book in one night.

Anne Rice has such a talent for story telling. She spins a tale of sadness and desperation like no one else. Thank you for opening my eyes to all things paranormal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Step","review":"When I was eight or nine, my aunt sat me down and handed me this book, proudly telling me, \\"You know, this is far better than those Goosebumps you burn through.\\" At the time, Louie's narration was a bit too wistful and slow for me. (Or maybe Daniel just couldn't keep up with him) So, lucky me, they made a movie version. After watching it, I fell in love with the Vampire Chronicles wholly and utterly.Years later, I picked up Interview again (this was after reading the rest of the chronicles mind you), determined to try and dissect Louie's state of being and Claudia's Master and Servant dynamic she shared with him.What I found in lieu of my query, was actually this:I was missing the point altogether. Yes, the book follows Louis, Lestat, Claudia, Armand, Santiago, etc. But really, it follows the changes they are observing in the world itself.The vampires themselves are just part of a subplot.And honestly, the big picture is a lot better than a thumbnail, don't you think?"},{"rating":"2","title":"VAMPIRES, POSSIBLE OF LOVE AND CARE?","review":"That's shocking to even imagine as possible. One would never associate adjectives such as love, passsion, caring, nuturing and feeling with the evil-inspiring vampire. But this author does it with talent, making it seem as ordinary and everyday as Hanzel and Gretel. I was not intending to read this book, I usually don't like such blockbuster novels, but this surprised me. I thought it started out a little slow and progression at first was almost painful, it ended up tremendously. The abusridity and ironicness of this tale of Vampire love and despair makes it intriguing and interesting.Anne Rice does a marvelous job of character development and takes us through the birth and maturity of a young Vampire. Loius finds that thogh it takes only seconds to lose one's life; it takes half of an eternity to lose one's soul. I will probably read her other novels in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unearthly","review":"Anne Rice began the Vampire Chronicles with this stunning opening novel. Far more than the vampire tales we were all accustomed to Anne Rice created characters with the essenc of humanity trapped inside an inhuman frame. hile some might say this novel is just another Gothic story told for sheer amusement \\"Interview With The Vampire\\" goes beyond this and touches the hearts of many people with a tale of searching for one's self and of lost love. You will adore this novel when you read it, and be simply touched by it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent beginning","review":"I enjoyed this book as the first of the Vampire Chronicles. By narrating to a young reporter, Louis explains and clarifies information which gives the reader a deeper understanding of this existence of a world within our world. I came to know all the characters - there are heroes, victims, those with internal struggles, those with strong relationships; there are masters, fledglings, makers. The characters are very real - nothing like the hollywood ghouls. The information gained from Interview made reading the next three Chronicles enjoyable because of the information base it provided. The Chronicles have provided a fascinating, enjoyable, involved read. I'm looking forward to #5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"I couldn't put it down. This is a very engaging book, just when I thought I'd read everything there was to read about vampires or the undead. Rice creates new rules for her creatures and her descriptive powers are immense. She travelled back and forth in time with ease as you followed her lead character's story. Dark, scary, but also sumptuous and romantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"intriging","review":"I liked it alot but her time line was a little ifey. I found Louis intreging. He character developed so much through out the book. Lestat appears to be pompus and arrogant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genre Defining","review":"Anne Rice does a remarkable job of describing the characters. We are able to see the complex nature of each person, their own struggles and of course the fight or embracing of taking in the liquid that allows them to live.I would rate this particular book in along with the classic tale of Dracula and as a must read for any vampire fiction fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Should Be Used As Punishment","review":"I'll make this short and sweet (unlike the book I'm reviewing!). Ann Rice, no matter how apparently popular she is, is NOT a good writer. Her books are so bogged down with rediculous, tedious, POINTLESS detail that it destroys any chance at a good read.She has some good ideas as far as dealing with the sides of the vampire we don't normally see: How they think and what they do on a daily basis. But again, it's completely lost in the monotony of the rest of the book. Skip her (and Stephen King while you're at it!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only there was a \\"no stars\\" rating...","review":"I consider myself well-read, with wide-ranging tastes in books. There have only been two books in my life that I absolutely could not finish, no matter how hard I tried. This is one of them. It is, by turns: insipid, long-winded and breathtakingly boring. I'm not a good enough critic to come up with phrases to describe just how excruciatingly bad this book is. I'm not sure that I've come across a worse writer than Anne Rice. Please do yourself a favor -- pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I ever read","review":"This is the worst book I ever read. I haven't seen the movie because it's probably just like the book. It's fine if you're into blood and gore. I'm not. Ms. Rice, in my opinion, is a no-account, hackneyed, and cliched writer.

Ann Rice has taken her love for penning overblown sexual fetishes (both hetero and homo-erotic) and single-handedly ruined the vampire as myth originally described the foul demon. Lestat's character was so lavishly overblown as to verge on the comical. Each scene in the book was more or less a wishful description of an orgiastic costum party. The film characters portrayed by Pitt and Cruise cemented the laughable image. Hissing clowns, rouged, guy-shadow, and puffy shirt wearing caricatures, floating and flying around, catch the books atmosphere remarkably well. It's not a vampire novel. It's thinly disguised, (if at all) poorly written porn. True vampire fiction this is not. Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated reading this. It was a depressing experience about an existence of despair and lack of feeling.","review":"Louis felt attachments to Lestat then Claudia, even though he knew Claudia did not truly love him and had evil about her. After Claudia's death, he never felt for anyone again. I did not like the author's use of the words \\"You see\\" and \\"For you see\\". To me, it sounded feminine and did not sound natural coming from the male, Louis.Sexual content: not evaluated. Setting: U.S. and Europe. Copyright: 1976. Genre: paranormal fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This book was incredable! It absolutly took my breath away. The relationship between Claudia and Louis was truely unique. I was amazed by the way Louis is able to express his feelings openly. Lestat was a vitial character in this story although you didn't hear about him much. I am ecstatic about reading the entire series. There is one bit of advise I would give to sombody; skip the movie and read the book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interview With The Vampire Review","review":"A story of a vampire's lifeI found this book to be very interesting. It is about the life of a vampire named Lestat. Most of the story takes place in New Orleans where Lestat first becomes a vampire and then starts his new lifestyle. He starts to do the things other vampires do like sleeping in a coffin and staying up all night but one thing he does that other vampires don't in that he feels for things. This is something that really effects him and the other vampires he associates with throughout the book. I would say that one theme in the book could be Love. Lestat falls in love with another vampire that he created named claudia who is a small orphan child.

You'll be happy you did.Most people like the characters of Louis or Lestat the best, but I liked Armand most. You see, in the film Louis seemes human, but in the book he turns into a monster. He thinks that Armand feels nothing, but I think that he is only diffrent. Wouldn't you be diffrent after 400 years? Louis feels like a human being before he meets Armand, but in the end HE is the one who feels nothing.

Her vampires become otherworldly but keep a somewhat grip on their humanity (as much as a blood thirsty immortal can). Her books cover the stories of very unique and interesting characters that are not stereotypical or predictable.I was 17 when I picked up this book and over the last 6 years it inspired me to go on reading the rest of the Chronicles up into the Mayfair books.

Their story is one of tragic heartache.If you are one of the five people in the world who hasn't yet read this poignant love story, one that rivals Romeo and Juliet, then you best get your act together.There's a reason they tapped Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise to star in the leading roles.

What a beautiful, yet tragic tale of the undead wishing they were dead. The regret Louis delt with night in and night out could very well be felt by humans everyday. We all regret something sooner or later, but fortunately, we dont have to live with it for eternity. And Lestat was what a vampire should be, strong and without regret. But little Claudia....kind of disturbing to think of a little girl drinking blood. But thats the purpose of books like this. I must say though, it was a good evening at home with those three vampires and I do recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"the 12 year old bookworm opinion","review":"i really enjoyed this book. Its a classic, you dont want to miss the chance to read this book. The characters were so real and lively for a group of undead vampires. It tells the story of the vampire Louis and the real hardship that he faces. Lifes not easy being a vampire,you feel sad for him but the adventure you feel as seeing him on his adventure with Claudia, a vmpire stuck in the body of a little girl ,and the evil vampire Lestat is incredable. Many other treats and exitment await for Louis and Claudia on the quest to meet others like them but wisdom is only gained though hardships. So enjoy and dont miss the chance to read this classic novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unsurpassed","review":"I read this book when it was first published, and I've re-read it frequently over the years. I still marvel at Rice's writing talent, her sublime skill at creating characters that you can see so vividly from the page. It takes considerable talent to provide the detail that she does and still excel at moving a story at such a brisk pace. Interview remains one of my favorite modern novels and my favorite novel about vampires. Yes, it surpasses Bram Stoker's Dracula and Stephenie Meyer's Twilight, both which I liked very much.This is a novel that just absorbs you, separates you from real space and real time and inserts you as a witness of an enthralling story. Every time I read it, I still mourn Armand and hope things are resolved differently.The movie, by comparison, was simply atrocious. I can't believe that anyone who read this book could envision Tom Cruise as Lestat and Brad Pitt as Louis. I think David Fincher would be a good candidate to direct a better film version of this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED IT!!!! But...","review":"I found the book to be a great piece of work, almost poetic writing and pilosophy/psychology inlaid within the pages.But if you are looking for a very fast paced, horrifying, Salem's Lot type novel, then slowly back away from the computer. The book is very slow in pace, very emotional and dramatic about EVERYTHING ( which I personally love, but which others could find terribly boring). If you are looking for a Vampire novel with a more...tangible (for lack of better word) plot, then I suggest checking out Laurell K Hamilton or Christopher Pike, and some of the YA authors like Amelia Atwater-rhodes or Vivian Vande Velde. And if your looking for a vampire novel to just scare the hell outta ya, then it's always nice to go with Stephen Kings \\"Salem's Lot.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Interview With a Vampire","review":"I found what I liked most about this book is Anne Rice's use of description and setting. She uses both to set the atmosphere and tone of this novel. The dark atmosphere and the ominous tone create a deep, underlying desperation within the characters. I've watched the movie and now read the book. I've enjoyed both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but I like the next one better","review":"I had to knock off one star becuse Louis wines alot!

The language and structure of the writing is reminiscent of some of the great Gothic horror novels but falls far short of capturing their intensity. The plot moves along like a two legged turtle, however even a faster pace would hardly make up for the lackluster story and rather tedious detail to which the reader is subjected. Particularly frustrating was the continued use and reuse of pseudo biblical language. This book failed to capture either my imagination or even my attention. If you plan to read this book, make certain to allow for frequent breaks"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good prescription for an insomniac","review":"If you need a good nights sleep and are tired of counting sheep, try a few paragraphs of this book. Anne Rice's run on sentences and meaningless fluff will bore you to death if you are not careful. I think she was trying to expand what could easily be a short story into a novel. I forced myself to finish at least half the book which took me well over a week to do because I couldn't stand reading much of the book at one time. Don't waste your good money, go to the library and check it out if you are curious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mystery","review":"It still mystifies me why so many people have so high an opinion of this book.

However, Interview with a Vampire is written with poor, boring prose. It is certainly not a page turner, and I would assign it as punishment for high school students who did not come to class on time. The story seems to be random, without any clear organization or purpose. Often while reading the book I will start to daydream about to other ideas and topics that are unrelated to the book.

So as I progressed through the book, thinking very little of every single character and not much caring what happened to them, I didn't put it down, but kept going, thinking that something better must be on the next page.Not so. The characters are not sympathetic in the least and the plot is uneventful.

I mean I could write the code and I could play with OPENXML, but I didn't really *understand* what I was doing. This book changed all that. Now it all makes sense. Unlike a lot of other books, it doesn't repeat the online docs. It starts where the Books Online ends. And the sample code is really useful. The book says there are over 700 example files and I don't doubt it! The sheer number and the quality of the samples makes the book worth the price all by itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"You need this book","review":"Some might question whether they need a separate book on stored procedure coding. Trust me, you do.The book goes through one aspect after another of how to develop stored procedures for SQL Server. It differs from other books in that it treats T-SQL like a real language. It posits that you need to apply design patterns to you work, that you need to test it, and that it needs the same type of source code management as any other language.This book is different from other T-SQL and stored procedure books for this very reason. It approaches the language from the perspective of a professional developer. As Ron Soukup says in the forward this is a masterful guide written by a master coder.You can learn from this the same way I did. The writing is detailed, flows well, and extremely technical. Add to this the great SQL-XML info and HTML chapter and you have a book no SQL Server developer should be without."},{"rating":"2","title":"Information, tips and knowledge","review":"This is one of the few books that explore T-SQL.

It starts out with a primer on stored procedures. It devotes chapters to database design, triggers, views, UDF's, XML, and .NET, to list some of the topics. Once you read Mr. Henderson's book, you see there is so much to learn about SQL Server. I especially liked the chapter on UDF's. If you've ever searched for a better alternative to the builtin Soundex function, Mr. Henderson provides *the* best Soundex solution for SQL Server. In fact, that alone makes the book worthwhile. And let's not forget his listing and explanation of dozens of undocumented functions and features in SQL Server."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Wish I could give it 10 stars","review":"I have been looking for a book like this for a long time. Thank you very much for it. It's the first SQL Server programming book I've seen that doesn't treat you like an idiot. Mr. Henderson assumes you know what you're doing and simply want to get better at it.I consider myself somewhere between a beginner and an middle-level stored procedure builder and this book fit me just fine. I learn something practically every time I pick the book up.This is not your father's computer book. In fact I'll bet you will have trouble putting it down.For once a fresh approach has been taken to teaching this very complex subject. In the hands of a capable teacher such as Mr. Henderson, you will learn more than you could ever have hoped to from other books. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth the paper it's printed on but no more","review":"I used this book in a 400 level college course on software engineering, and found it to be exceedingly shallow in its coverage of the topic. The work is a worthy attempt at providing a broad overview of the discipline. However, in my estimate it covers too much material in too little space and presents too few practical examples of the type that might be applicable to a \\"real-world\\" software project. Further the text only gives lip service to the wide array of tools now available. In all honesty I don't see how any one could give this book more than three starts (apologies to the other reviewers), especially considering that the book is now in its sixth edition.I was at the used book store recently and had the good fortune of acquiring Stephen R.

The author explains every important step of software engineering as promised in the contents list. All kind of specification posibilities, design systems, reliability and verification approaches are topics that opened my eyes. On the other hand, the part of object-oriented only told about OO as a modeling approach and hardly surpassed the level of buzzword. Perhaps some more attention in a next version? Still, the book is perfect for the novice at the topic of software engineering.(2000-06-29)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative but not Practical","review":"I used this book for an introductory course on software engineering. Although the book gives an expansive view of the field, there isn't enough detail or in-depth examples to make it anything more than an academic treatise. I don't feel that I could use much of what I've learned in an actual project - I would have to resort to more specific references.Now, the premise of having an entire book on software engineering may be more to blame than the clarity or presentation of the material. But software engineering is a practical field, and a software engineering text that doesn't provide practical information isn't useful. For this reason, I cannot give the book a passing grade."},{"rating":"1","title":"a book without structure","review":"One expects one's textbooks to present material in a structured way. This book is all over the place. It is full of references to material \\"covered in the next section\\" or \\"I explain this later in the book\\". It is also full of incomplete sentences, spelling errors, and uncoordinated subjects and predicates. For failness' sake onó must admit that some useful information may be gleaned with some effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOTS TO LEARN FROM THIS BOOK","review":"I think one of the previous reviewers who gave 1 star is too picky about wordings and slammed the book based on just that.

I gobbled up this book, with its gorgeous descriptions of Italy, the wonderful food, scenery and people, all against a sensual, yet realistic romance between two normal, imperfect people. In addition to the pure pleasure of reading this travelogue/biography/romance, it has sparked a lively discussion amongst my book club of 30 something women. How would we face Fraser's situation, thinking about issues of divorce, children and the biological clock? And what are the \\"right\\" boundaries for a marriage? Whatever answer each person might come to, I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to travel, to eat, to live life richly or who has ever been hurt or healed by love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply delightful!","review":"I read this book in two days and wished there were others like it!

Yes the second-person style was irritating but ultimately I just didn't have any interest in wondering where this relationship was going. Nor did I have any interest in the author's healing process.

Go to Italy and have an affair with a shriveled Frenchman? A Parisian professor of aesthetics? Could you make a more limp choice among all the males available in Italy? (Note that irritating 2nd person usage.) Dear former husband, excellent choice that divorce -- although you must have had quite a draining year of marriage trying to fill the vast emotional pit of Ms Fraser.The self indulgent Fraser woman's poorly written observations about her \\"recovery\\" from divorce while swannning her way across Italy with other women's husbands is an insult to every abandoned, divorced woman trying to raise her children while her husband bops off with an emotionally arrogant Fraser clone.Ms Fraser's piece of print is not non-fiction. It is a piece of self delusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth reading if you're planning an Italian sojourn","review":"Part travel-log, part story of a woman and her relationships - one in particular - over a period of several years. Apparently at least based on fact, if not pure non-fiction. An unusual mix and style, but it works reasonably well. I read it because we were about to head off to Italy, so I was interested in the traveller's tales and experiences in Italy. Also includes holidays and short breaks in other parts of the world. As travel tales sometimes go, this is light and easy to read - but I doubt I would have chosen to read it if I hadn't been planning an Italian break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative and pointless","review":"Does every American divorced woman take off for Italy immediately following her receipt of the final decree dissolving her marriage? And does every one of them find true love in that country?There have been too many similar books published just ahead of this one for there to be anything innovative about the theme here.And author Laura Fraser has written this book entirely in the second person, like a beauty article in a hackneyed women's magazine. (The whole work scans to, \\"First, you take an egg and you mix in a bit of good olive oil, then you spread it on your face.\\"\\") After a couple of pages, boy, does this self-conscious styling get tiring!I cannot agree with the majority of other Amazon readers who posted complimentary reviews about this book; I found AN ITALIAN AFFAIR to be predictable, stilted and, altogether, a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU are not Laura!","review":"I cannot believe believe this writer graduated from Berkely!

I found the second-person, present tense voice a bit distracting at first, but I was quickly drawn into the story and stayed up late on a camping trip, reading by flashlight. Laura keeps the focus on the magical places the lovers visit and their feelings, not on the sex.

(thus no middle initial) It's a murder mystery starring an investigative reporter. The reporter starts out with an anonymous tipster leading him into a government scandal, and ends up the center of a murder investigation. There are twists, turns, and the wonderfully erratic/eccentric characters that Banks likes to use with the skill that he uses them, and it's a good read. Not my favorite work of his, but I'm biased -- I like the SF stuff better. It's older too -- 1993 first pub, available here (here=US) only since 2002. Good, fun, entertaining, engaging stuff. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggh...","review":"Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of Banks' sci-fi work. I'm as big a fan as they come, and his sci fi is as good as it gets.

A section on manufacturing methods to distinguish between hand hammered and other would be useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Midwest Collector","review":"I received this book as a gift. I have some hammered aluminum and thought this book would be useful to help me learn more. I was wrong, indeed! This book has decent pictures and that is all. There is absolutely no timeline for markings to help someone establish when a piece was made. There is no regard to what is 'rare'. There is also no information given on what the numbering system for certain makers means. How many types of things did Rodney Kent make, for example. I have found this book of little help with my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grist' book has received criticism from many collectors","review":"Grist' book has been the subject of much discussion among aluminum collectors and little of the comment has been favorable. Concerns have been raised regarding the organization and scholarship. I do not recommend this book, and would recommend Woodard's aluminum books as better and more thorough general guides which are also listed by Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Harm Than Good","review":"Virtually everything in the book is innacurate. There are literally hundreds of factual errors. A good example would be the 23 line essay on Wendell August Forge that has 14 errors of fact in those 23 lines. Shame on Grist!! Shame on Collector Books for having published it ! ! Anyone who has paid more than $1 for it has been significantly cheated.William Freeman"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be Zero Stars","review":"I am totally opposed to censorship, but this book at least should come with a big warning on it, \\"Pure unsubstantiated drivel\\"! The author's premise, that AIDS is manmade, the world is just full of conspiracies to keep the truth from us, etc, is simply not supported by any evidence. And his comment that AIDS can be transmitted by such contact as handling the sheets of patients, or by insects such as mosquitoes and bed bugs, just isn't true. If mosquitoes could spread AIDS, every person in the USA South would now be infected.This book is a cruel, poorly presented, lie that uses the suffering of people in order to make money for the author, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"the finis jhung ballet","review":"IT IS THE BEST, VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND,QUICK SHIPPING. WITH BALLET IT HELPS TO WATCH AGAIN AND AGAIN TO MAKE SURE OF YOUR PREFORMANCE IS ABOVE ALL SUCCESSFUL.WOULD DEFINATELY BUY AGAIN."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthwhile addition to your Beatles library","review":"As a fan of nearly 30 years, this was one of the first Beatles books I ever bought, and it remains a worthwhile buy for today's new fans. It may not be as detailed or as enlightening as the Mark Lewishon-type of books, but it benefits greatly from being written in the sixties - and having a firsthand access to the band. Hunter Davies includes many stories and insights that would simply not be available to today's writers - because they weren't there. The chapter that describes them writing 'With A Little Help From My Friends', for example, is as amusing as it is amazing. And I very much enjoyed the prologue, where Davies explains the difficulties he had with Queenie Epstein and Aunt Mimi. And his meeting with Pete Best in the mid-sixties is as poignant a scene as you will ever get in a Beatles book. It is stories like those that make the book worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important","review":"This is an essential document for Beatles scholarship. At the time it was simply a pop bio by a competent writer, but it depicts the Beatles at a fascinating juncture in their career. It is particularly notable for its accounts of songwriting and recording sessions, for a glimpse of their home lives, and for their opinions about life in general at the time. Since this is an authorized biography, critics may complain that it is whitewashed - but one can read between the lines and gather the full meaning of everything pretty well. All in all, it is remarkably honest. This updated edition features a sterling introduction by the author about the writing of the book and offers further insight into the personalities of the Beatles."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the 1st True Books on the Beatles!","review":"I'm sure there were books about the Beatles written before this, but this book was written with the Beatles (complete with interviews). Hunter Davies includes some of his own opinions in later editions but this is about the Fab 4, their rise, and where they were in 1968 when this book originally came out (John admits to be bored with life as Yoko Ono had not yet been a household name to us and George was already sick of being a Beatle at the time). The later editions have a section about the breakup, what they did individually in the 1970's, the tragedy of John Lennon in 1980 and more recent interviews with Paul, George, and Ringo. You can trust Davies since he got the Beatles' authorization and respected their privacy (he mentions that George Harrison asked that certain things not be printed). As Davies points out, this story is about the rise and not the fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"I found Davies' account an interesting read. It was written in 1968 after the author had spent considerable time hanging with the Beatles during the peak of their popularity. It's refreshingly non-technical and non-critical -- Davies has no academic pretensions and in fact the book reads like it was primarily written for the Beatles young fans of the time. There is also an updated chapter discussing the group's breakup. Be sure to read to the (relatively recent) introduction as it puts the ensuing account into modern perspective. I wouldn't exactly call this book definitive, but I would definitely recommend it to Beatles fans and rock historians."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for Beatles fans who want the true story","review":"Because this book was the only authorized biography ever written of The Beatles and also because it was written at the time, rather than researched & compiled years later, I felt that I could believe what I was reading. It was facsinating reading comments from John before the breakup when he still enjoyed being a Beatle, rather than the cynical type of quotes from after all the animosity came into their relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"A smart, doalbe diet","review":"My wife and I got on this diet more than a year ago. We both so instant results and we felt good doing it. You have a lot to do to first week(s), but you see and feel the results, so it keeps you going. I was only a few pounds overweight, but I wanted to find a diet that could get me down to a healthier weight and look a little better in my clothes. Don't be fooled by the title of this book, the best part of this diet is that it gives you tips to run your life from here on in, and I'm still following many of the basic principles.

Infact it is just like a novel where the hero (or is it the villian?) is oil and other characters include the rest of the world. A must for anybody who is interested not just in oil industry but the socio-econo-geogoro-politico developments of the 20th centur"},{"rating":"2","title":"The History of oil","review":"If you are looking to get an overview of what the start and development of oil was, this the only book to put it in terms most people can understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive -- Yet Accessible -- History of the Oil Industry","review":"The Prize follows the major developments in the oil industry, from its inception with the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company through the Gulf War.The Prize well deserves the praise it has received. Yergin's research and knowledge of the history of the oil industry are obvious and make this a great historical work, yet the length and the abundance of detail do not impinge on the readability of the book.Among many insightful sections of this book, I found the chapters on the role of oil in the Second World War to be particularly interesting. After reading other books about the battles of that war, it was useful to learn something about the logistics behind those battles.It is unfortunate that this book is already a decade old. In his epilogue, Yergin touches on the Gulf War and the effects of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the world's largest oil producer in the late 1980's, but this was not quite history yet when he was writing The Prize."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, still relevent even today","review":"I learned a great deal from this book, from the rise of Standard Oil, it's dissolution, wildcatters, and the rise of the Middle East. I now have a better understanding of the economics of oil. The knowledge this book covers is still applicable today, including Saudi Arabia's continued role in attempting to regulate oil prices, and the risks/rewards of offshore oil drilling, and why too low price of oil is bad (too high is obvious, as we all know with the summer-2008 gasoline prices). It should be required reading for all politicians and also should be read by anyone who voices an opinion (left or right-wing) on energy-related topics.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Overview on the History of Oil","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone wanting to learn about the history of the oil industry and its effect on World history. Not only is it informative, but it is also well written and interesting to read.Although it is almost 1000 pages long, it kept my interest throughout. Much of the book is focused on the impact oil, or lack of it, has had on governments and wars. Although the book discusses many major oil field discoveries with some detail. I would have preferred the author to go into more detail with regard to the discovery of Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea. Nonetheless, this is a book that I would strongly recommend to any history fan or anyone interested in oil."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for those working in the oil industry","review":"This book is a must for anyone working in the oil industry. Though written early last decade during the Gulf War, much of the discussion and analyses in this book is still relevant today... proving that the old economy - powered by oil - is still very much a force to be reckoned with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book!!!!","review":"Being on the downstream side of the oil business, my curiousity was piqued by the title. It was interesting to see the history of the business so well laid out. I am the third generation in the business and I can verify some of the events mentioned in the book, personally. All-in-all, a well written book."},{"rating":"1","title":"First to cover the topic, but still a facile book","review":"Yergen gets kudos for being the first to cover this topic, but his account (perhaps because it's now outdated) is facile and pro-oil company. Every time the oil companies are thwarted he seems to blame straw men for it: tree huggers, the people that hounded poor misunderstood Tricky Dick Nixon, the Saudi sheiks (best friends of Bush, Cheney, et al). He never turns his gaze on the corruption of the oil companies themselves. We hit peak oil in the U.S. in the 1960s. The oil companies suppressed any attempts since then to find alternative fuels. Now we are up the creek, so to speak, with the Oil Men running the Show. Some \\"Prize\\". I'd say it's the booby prize. The best overview of our current fix is Lawrence Wright's The Looming Tower."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great","review":"I did not find this book very interesting or engaging.

Gripping, well-written, insightful.

I would have liked to see maps of the world when oil was discovered and post-Desert Storm near the preface to give me a better visual understanding of the changes in boundaries caused by claims of oil.

This book is about the impact oil and mankind has had on each other. Oil has shaped the world economy and power structure in business and goverment since it was first drilled for in Penn. This book is more about the intrigue than technology. The goals of this book is to show how man hads become to depend on oil without knowing it. How oil has shaped history, warfare and peace. I have had several friends who are not engineers say that they have loved this book. No hard science background is needed. Yergin is weaves a story of people and their fasination and fixation to control the worlds supply of oil. THE PRIZE is the perfect title."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Prize - Book Review","review":"Excellent book. Written well. Reveals a lot about the history of oil and the roots of the modern ages economy. So interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda or lack of a moral stance","review":"Propaganda, no matter how couched in research is still propaganda. The author seems gung-ho on the archievements of \\"the industry\\" and its dominant actors and never expresses dismay at the wanton destruction it has and continues to perpetuate. Right from the premise, when he had reported on the greed which the inceptions of the industry created/fed upon, I found myself wishing he would take a moral stance and say something against what could only be disastrous for all in the long-term. But, alas, nothing there, and yet, robber barons like Rockefeller were touted to no end. Goes to show you that Yergin is his industry's man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book..","review":"A fascinating book...very well researched and written.Yergin expertly draws out the complications and the interconnected nature of the oil business. From humble beginnings to an industry that has shaped modern history and social order, this is must read for any follower of 19th and 20th century industry or politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most interesting books I've read","review":"Documents the oil industry since the late 19th centure until the gulf war. Early history is gripping, paricularly the author's insights into the people. Less interesting towards the end as the author tends more to chronicle changes in oil prices."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good study of oil and its effect on current history","review":"The book itself often reads more like a business reporter in a local paper reporting rather then a historical study which I was looking for. I would like to have seen more charts and table showing overall what was happening rather then stories about this fellow and this fellow and so on. These people tend to be the major decision makers so we don't get a feel of what over time the geologist or engineers are doing.Still the writer makes a very good study of oil and the industry. He shows its relationship to many political and social developments in the 1900s. I found the particularly the history of early oil industry quite fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOW THE WORLD CHANGED AND STILL CHANGING","review":"To start with it's a GREAT BOOK, will written, will documented, informing, though full of dates, numbers, and names, that's some times confusing, I would say that if you are interested to know what makes the world moving, by whom and why. Its this book, it takes you from the early days of discovering oil until the gulf war, passing by how this commodity caused wars and how it became a strategic one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and very thorough","review":"It too me forever to plough through lengthy work, but it is an excellent book that tells the interesting story of the evolution of the global oil industry.

What a fascinating book ! I got it as a present in 1996 from a business relation and since then I have read it twice. It is one of the ten best books that I have read in my life, and I have read a lot ! Being 51 years of age now, I grew up with books. Although it might be branded as a \\"history book\\" it certainly doesn't feel and read that way. At more than 900 pages it is a lengthy read. I truly hope it will be available as a Kindle e-book anytime soon so I don't have to carry around this hefty but spell-binding tome when I want to read it for a third time. If you are looking for an understanding of the oil industry and the global power it exerts in society and politics, I highly recommend this excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time for another","review":"Interesting history lessons, but time for an update. has a tendency to be long-winded."},{"rating":"2","title":"the 80's classic","review":"I can remember the first time I heard the stirring opening bass notes to the stone roses debut album, that was in 1989.

So let me just add that this is as close to perfection as, say, Echo & the Bunnymen's Heaven Up Here is.The other thing that gets me every time I listen to this album is how a band can do an over eight-minute song (\\"I am the Resurrection\\") that is not only presumptuous (let's face it this song is about the Stone Roses' sound resurrecting a Brit music scene that was in a post-punk down cycle) but rocks out.Throw in the buildup to \\"I Wanna Be Adored,\\" the breath Ian Brown takes before \\"Sugar Spun Sister\\" starts to John Squire's transcendent guitar playing and this is an album that will hold up for decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"If there was a blueprint on how to make an album from the first track to the last, all perfect, this is how it would sound.

Were they an overlooked band who never got the recognition they deserved? Not really. They have their cult following, and that's all a band that focuses more on being cool than producing listenable songs can expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh no.","review":"People are starting to bash this CD. Please, they are all wet! This CD is PERFECT. EVERY second of this CD is absolutely amazing. Melodic, timeless(!!!), uplifting, thirst-quenching, day-breaking, love-making, soul saving. The guitar playing is flawless (see: JAMMING last 5 minutes of I Am The Resurrection). The airy vocals of Ian Brown (heard throughout). The driving bass (Fool's Gold/I Am The Resurrection) and ecstatic drums (She Bangs the Drums, This Is The One, Fool's Gold). There is not one dud in the whole group. I have listened to this CD HUNDREDS of times and it still makes me feel like life is perfect (although it is far from it).If you like pop music. If you aren't a crabby, contrarian.

People I now think that just because they have never heard of the Stone Roses means they were not a good band.

So boys and girls please BUY THE ORIGINAL 46 minute album with the original 11 tracks on it, as the band originally intended. Why ? Well all the rave reviews and plaudits are from that original format. If ever there was a record that was made as one, as a complete journey using various styles cleverly joined together and immaculately paced, this, is it.I'll leave all the plaudits to the thousands of others online - this is a unique record that speaks for itself.Download the original 11 track album and let it enrich the rest of your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding Classic from Manchester Era","review":"The Stone Roses (BY The Stone Roses) is a very hypnotizing album to say the least.

This book is considered by critics to be the companion novel to Jimmie Higgins (1919) and acts like an antithetical drama to Higgins's proletarian Bildungsroman style (see Karsten Piep). The protagonist in this story is a luckless opportunist in the middle of the Red Scare who becomes embroiled in a plot by the D.A. to infiltrate and spy on an enclave of Socialists who have been wrongfully connected with a domestic bombing. In my opinion, it helps if you're already sympathetic to Sinclair's politics to appreciate or even, dare I say, be 'moved' by \\"100%.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Right cover, wrong book","review":"I received \\"A Summer Bird-Cage\\" in the mail from Amazon and Better World books, with the pink cover shown above.

'Heaven Sent\\" welcomes the reader to the Cliffside Christian Community where people act like people and life happens. Here is a well-written story by first time author Alison Longstaff, that is vivid in detail and unfolds without effort. The characters evoke empathy and emotional response with each challenge that faces them. It isn't preachy or proclaiming perfection among the members of the congregation which makes it an enjoyable read for anyone. It's refreshingly free of foul language and demonstrates that love can be written about without resorting to smut. I now feel a kinship with the Cliffside residents and eagerly await the next installment of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven Sent","review":"This thoughtful novel works on many different levels. There is a church community with strained group dynamics, trying to balance modern and traditional ways. It is also caught in solving an intricate mystery set up by a recently deceased church member, a mystery thay threatens the very existence of the community. It is a story of personal growth, where the main characters rely on their faith and the support of family and friends to rise above the pain and conflicts that might otherwise unhinge their lives. And woven through it all is a very touching, gentle love story. The young woman at the center of it is a widow with two daughters, and I like the way in which both adults never lose sight of these girls in their own emotional struggles. \\"Heaven Sent\\" was impossible to put down after the first few pages, and I feel I have grown so close to its characters that I can't wait to find out what their future holds for them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the title...","review":"I got this book because the title sounded like just the sort of good algorithm design discussion I was interested in.

Divine intervention plays a key role in finding Sabrina, a loveable quirky girl in desperate need of true love, a soul mate when an eccentric angel plays matchmaker. It's a wonderful, charming romance for anyone who puts faith in the power of love and the inexplicable magic of destiny. Sabrina's Destiny is funny, warm and tender. Filled with lively characters and pearls of wisdom, Sabrina's Destiny will leave you believing in angels and longing to embrace the love of your own life. Ms. Robins has cooked up a fantastical feel-good story of hope, love, fate with a touch of heaven and a dash of chocolate.

This leaves the reader to do his own screening to separate out important information. What I also found disappointing is that the book fails to present an exposition on Jackson, the father of the modern Democratic party. Rather the book focuses on the political parties at the time (Democrats and Whigs) and their allegedly self-aggrandizing similarity.

These are mainly recordings from Lanza's erratic Coca Cola Shows of 1951-52, all of which were studio-recorded with the applause thrown in for the dubious benefit of the radio audience. The joyous La Spagnola excepted, the CD contains no real highlights and, instead, many of the tenor's most untutored moments. Give this one (and all its many imitators) a wide berth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake \\"Live\\"","review":"Most of these recordings are not live but rather are mixed with fake applause.

But then I saw it. And while \\"The Prince of Egypt\\" was a masterpiece of animation, and as a pure movie as well, this is BADBAD!!!!!! The songs are mediocre, the voice casting is mediocre, and the animation is only decent, while \\"The Prince of Egypt\\" is totally opposite. And don't get me wrong, Ben Affleck is a good actor, but........well, lets just say he should stick to live action. And never take on a singing role again! It's boring, too! The story line doesn't have enough action, and dwells too much on drama, and almost has nothing to do with God, except for a few mentionings of Him. This is too bad, since it is based on a Bible story. Maybe I'm comparing it too much with \\"The Prince of Egypt\\", but I stick to my review. Go rent that instead, and if you've already seen it a bunch of times, then see it again; anything's better than waisting your time with this ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good effort, worth renting","review":"While \\"Joseph - King of Dreams\\" is no \\"Prince of Egypt\\". It is a good, wholesome, biblically based movie about one of the most fascinating men in the Old Testament. The songs appeal to the Disney crowd and the animation is pretty good considering it wasn't shown in theatres. There are some parts of the movie that any Bible scholar could point out as inaccurate, but for the most part this movie could be enjoyed by any person regardless of age."},{"rating":"1","title":"God who?","review":"I was very disappointed after watching this video. I loved Prince of Egypt and expected Joseph to be at least equally as on target. My question to the makers of this film is - how can you tell the story of Joseph without having God in it?!? God is only mentioned in one place in the whole movie - in a song where Joseph reflects on how he needs to trust that God has a plan for his life. Without God, the greater theme of Joseph's life is missing, making this a story with no point (it also makes it hard to understand why things happened the way they did). For me, Joseph: King of Dreams fell flat rather than being the uplifting classic it could have been (also partly due to the music being unquestionably inferior to the music in P. of E.). My advice: rent it rather than buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Quality Direct-to-Video Feature!","review":"Barring some scriptural inaccuracies (a disclaimer admits to the dramatic license taken), Joseph is a wonderful, inspiring version of the Biblical tale. The songs are decent for a video production, and some of them actually stand out quite well.The majority of the story talks about Joseph's journey of faith and hope, and how he overcame hurdle after hurdle to properly share the gifts that God had given him.A little light on the religious side, Joseph plays up the entertainment value of the story (as with most films). However, it never deviates from the fact that Joseph believes his ability to interpret dreams is a gift from God. Far too few films are willing to take this chance... Kudos to Dreamworks for a top notch production.NOTE TO PARENTS: Though there is nothing outwardly objectionable, there is some serious subject matter that you may want to discuss with your children. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful story!","review":"I think one should keep in mind that most of these straight to video movies are for children and that the things we find lacking in them as adults are really not so important as what our children may think of them. My daughter loves this movie. She asks to see it just about every day and I believe it's because she is drawn to the magnificent artwork. It is a great Bible story retold in a form that children can enjoy. As for the presence of God, He certainly was there when Joseph finally realizes that all he has suffered was a part of His plan. He tells his brothers that the evil they did, God turned into good. The music is not as memorable as \\"Prince of Egypt\\" but the songs \\"Better Than I\\" and \\"More Than You Take\\" are really beautiful and support the story. The vocal talents of Jodi Benson (The Little Mermaid) add to the enjoyment. If the next Bible story from Dreamworks is as good as \\"Joseph: King of Dreams\\", I will be looking forward to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"joseph","review":"This movie taken on the whole is very good,and is excellent to watch with the family.The film does take some liberties as they acknowledge in the opening credits,yet in essence is true to the Genesis account.One of the judeo/christian values it conveys is forgiveness and not from a pie in the sky point of view,but it portrays a young man who really,truly struggles with what was done to him,someone who has every right to hold on to bitterness,someone who at times questioned not just his faith,but his God as well.People of faith that are honest with themselves and others have had times in their life when we know our past,we see where we are in the present and we ask why is this happening to us.We know in our heads that God knows whats best for us and that he has a plan for our lives,yet we are often not willing to endure the winter to get to the flowers of spring.The film also espouses the virtue in Integrity,and hard work.An excellent family watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joseph : King of Dreams","review":"I watched this video mindful of the strong expectations I had after The Prince of Egypt and also the strong influence the musical Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat had on me. After these 2, I expected a bit more from Joseph : King of Dreams, but this was still an excellent movie! The story is slightly altered from actual biblical viewpoint, but is true to the most important points. Being an artist myself, it was the art that first captured me in The Prince, and it remains true in Joseph. The music is also wonderful, not quite so powerful as The Prince, but overall excellant, especially Better Than I, which hits home so much. I would recommend this movie to all Christians and even those who are just curious about the Christian faith. It will certainly give you a good interpretation of one of the best-known stories out of the Bible.

He loves music and sounds and I thought the colors were bright and fun. Soon I found out, my son didn't feel the same. You get the sad crumple face before the crying of sheer TERROR! We hid the ball for months, and recently brought it back out since my son is 8 months and crawling we thought maybe it was scary because he wasn't able to move after it. WRONG again. He hates it, not just enough to ignore it, but enough to literally TRY avoiding it all together. When it sings he cries, when it wiggles at him he cries.This thing is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan...","review":"My husband and I packed this toy away soon after buying it. IT IS SO ANNOYING! The weird electronic animal sounds, odd versions of nursery rhymes, the creepy children giggling... Plus it would randomly start talking or moving around the rug, even if no one had touched it for hours. My son was pretty uninterested in this toy most of the time as well- it never really caught his attention, even though it annoyed the crap out of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun!","review":"I bought this for my 8 month old son. He loves all the lights and sounds. He's not crawling yet, but this really helped encourage him to sit up unassisted. He really wasn't interested in sitting up until we bought him this toy. It has multiple colors and sounds. There are taggies attached to the top that he loves to grasp. Hopefully once he is interested in crawling this toy will come in handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like fun but too repetitive","review":"Got his for my 6 month old son because he was so interested in motion but he liked anything that was moving -BUT this. Every time you turn it on it starts playing roll, roll, roll the ball to the tune of \\"row, row , row your boat.\\" when you push a button it doesn't automatically react. It has to finish it's iterneraey of songs and noises before it says \\"triangle\\" or \\"1\\" or whatever. Then when it finally does say what the button is you pushed it will start over again with all of the other series of noises. My son never even played with it. I would get it out to see if he would eventually find interest and he is interested in other toys but not this one. It's hardly been played with and it's going on the fritz. After it goes through it's program it will eventually get stuck on playing the same thing over and over again and will not respond at all to any buttons... So it just sits on a shelf turned off. Total waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My kid loves it!","review":"I mean, why do we really give these things to babies? My 7 month old loves it but I cant really comment on educational value yet. Im not sure if it helped him crawl. He had it for over a month before he started crawling. Im not sure if its even supposed to do that. I just know he loves playing with it. And isn't that the point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with this toy","review":"I bought this toy for my 7 month old grandson, to encourage him to crawl. The ball moves by itself and I thought that would get him moving towards it, which it did. But once he got to the ball, since it moves itself, it frequently spun around and clobbered him in the head. This is a very hard and heavy toy, so a bang in the head can really hurt. Plus, I failed to consider that his 2 year old sister, while trying to help him, could really hurt him by dropping this ball on top of him. Lastly, the size of the ball is too big for a child this age to hold, which a crawling infant would be inclined to do once having moved to get it. Perhaps an older child would enjoy this product. For safety sake my daughter put this away quickly, which I think was a good idea under the circumstances, so I really have no idea as to the educational value of this toy. It certainly makes lots of sounds, but as it was considered a safety hazzard I can't really say what they all were meant for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money - Poor quality","review":"Within about a month of owning this toy the toy started having problems.

In part, I think it scared them a little. Beyond that, it doesn't move as they have learned a ball should move, so it's very frustrating to them (understandably). My baby likes to roll little balls back and forth and seemed excited to do the same with this bigger ball. She immediately disliked the motion of this ball, as it moves in odd directions and doesn't let the baby \\"steer\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"words not clearly pronounced","review":"Ball is very heavy, can dent wood floors if dropped from a table. The words that it tries to teach sounded garbled and unclear.

He played with it at a friend's house and was so taken with it that I had to buy him one (they carry them at Wal-Mart.) In my opinion this is one of the QUIETEST musical toys he has. It has two settings for volume and the quieter setting is really very quiet in my opinion. Although my son isn't crawling yet, he loves to sit with it between his legs. It keeps him entertained for a long time. The ball does make a noise when it moves on its own but it isn't loud or alarming. I noticed when it rolls away from him, he tries to go after it. Now that he is rolling everywhere, he and the ball can travel quite a distance.For me and my son, this ball is wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...not that great","review":"I bought this for the same reason as a lot of the reviewers did- learning to crawl. Not so much. I bought this when my daughter was 6 months, she had no interest in this ball. When she did learn to crawl- this still didn't catch her eye. It does not roll on carpet very well so it just wears the motor out. My daughter does play with this a little now at 10 months but she gets bored after 3 mins of it. I wish I spent my money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scares my daughter","review":"This toy scares the daylights out of my almost-11 month old. I turn it on and she starts crying as soon as it starts moving around and playing music. And this is a kid that isn't easily startled - she'll sleep through the dog barking. I don't know what it is about this toy, but she is not a fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Toy!","review":"This toy is awesome, especially for babies that you are trying to get to crawl. My two boys absolutely LOVE this toy. Also, when they start to lose interest, this toy starts to move and make noise again to get their attention. They are too young still to do the games on the ball (it tells the baby to find an animal or number), but they love to push the buttons anyway. It rolls well on our carpet on hard flooring. It's one of their favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps Baby Focused While On Tummy","review":"For my 6 month old baby boy, this ball has been an excellent wayto keep him focused on moving toward on object while on his stomach. Although he gets annoyed by it rolling away from him at times, he also tries to reach for it because he realizes that when he touches it, a sound or noise results from it so that there is a \\"cause and effect\\" situation. I think it has helped to encourage him to crawl because it's weighted to move around but not to roll away. Granted, it might bump into him but this baby is very sturdy, so much so, that he'd prefer to stand rather than crawl. He never lost the standing reflex so it's possible he might bypass crawling altogether although I think this ball helps him with the crawling and moving. He also enjoys playing with it while sitting up. I think this is a good toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I bought this toy for my 8-month old to encourage him to start crawling. I looked at many and choose this one because of its dual features - I figured that once my son started to crawl he would have an interest in pressing the shapes and animal figures. Well, to start with the motion of the ball sucks! The first time I started it up, it rolled away from him then promptly back towards him and repeatedy smacked him in the head. This caused him to shy away from it for the longest time. Now that he can crawl, the added features are a waste of time. The voice proclaiming things like \\"it's a duck\\" goes off randomly without baby having to press the said animal so it teaches nothing about the animals or cause and effect. I should have returned this toy but waited too long - now it will just sit on the shelf gathering dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"no cause and effect","review":"this ball only moves in little circles if you have carpet. It tells you to find/press a certain button, gives you about 1 second (not enough time!), then moves on to some song or something else. It randomly plays music whether you push buttons, roll it, or not, and my daughter played with it for about 2 or 3 minutes the first time, and not at all since then.Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother of Twins","review":"I bought this for my sons when they were only a few months old. At first I was concerned that they did not appear interested it the item. Now at 10 months it is a must whenever we visit people. They love to sit with it on the carpet and push the buttons or chase it around the hardwood floors. I only wish the colors used for the animals were more realistic. I've never seen puppy with blue spots before and as an educational toy I wish they would stay truer to reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUST","review":"I'm surprised, but this toy was a bust with my son.

It is interesting and rolls on its' own, keeping his attention. My son is just starting to scoot around, so this ball motivates him to get moving.One thing I don't like about the ball is that it is weighted and hard to roll the way you would roll a regular ball. I guess that comes with the territory when you have a ball that does its' own thing, but I'd also like to be able to roll it back and forth to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless.","review":"We got this to help our son learn to crawl. It makes sense to learn to crawl on something soft, like carpet, but this ball doesn't roll or move well on carpet. In addition it was very annoying. In general, our son did not enjoy it much at all. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"My dog hates this toy.","review":"No, this toy was not purchased for my dog, but for my 10 month old son. It was a gift, but my son really doesn't care about crawling--he would much rather pull up and cruise. The ball doesn't encourage him to crawl after it either. The audio is annoying and constant--even if he's not playing with it, it talks/sings constantly--\\"Hey, come play with me!\\". The sound quality is very poor because the voice sounds slurred. Our dogs have been tolerant of all the noisemaking toys that have been brought into our house due to the baby, but one of the dogs hates this toy. She growls at it whenever it talks. I would not recommend it for older babies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"There is allot going on with this toy. Loud noises, movement, different lights and textures. Almost TO much. My daughter bats it around sometimes for a few minuets then gets fussy and leaves it. I tried giving it to my girlfriend and her baby had the same reaction. Wish I didn't purchase it. We have had it for a few months and she still doesn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Record After Only a Few Months","review":"Who thought it was a good idea to build an electronic ball out of hard plastic?!

When power-cycled it wou.ld work just fine again. Things just kept getting worse though and now it won't come out of its glitch at all. Turn it on and it just plays a single note and light repeatedly and other buttons are unresponsive.It's sad that our child actually enjoyed this toy and now is totally disappointed by it.

My daughter (now 19 months) usually likes to pick it up and throw it. After all, it IS a ball! We have hardwood floors - throwing this ball is extremely loud and it can really do some damage to our floors! We don't have any problems with it moving around ... however ... when you're asked to find something on the ball, even I have a hard time finding it to push the button in time. So, I don't know how a 6 month+ baby/child could find the correct answer in time.I think this is a nice idea for a toy, but it just doesn't work. It is colorful, and my daughter does enjoy throwing it, but that's obviously not it's intended use. She never played with this toy as a crawling infant.

That said, this is just not that funny. I am a socially conservative republican and I knew that this satire of Michael Moore and the political left would have a certain perspective. However, I thought I was going to be watching a comedy in the context of the politics. The reality is that this movie is preachy, heavy-handed, jingoistic rant masked in a thin \\"veneer\\" of comedy.Yes, it had a few funny moments but a handful of successful gags does not a successful comedy make, especially when the backdrop contains serious, real life political issues. I watch comedies to escape the world, not to be challenged in my thinking related to such weighty topics as liberty, patriotism, an terrorism. For that I'll watch a documentary (an irony in and of itself if you watch this film)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great comedy","review":"I love a good comedy, doesnt matter if its girly/dorm/school/political/spoofs I just like to laugh.

Alas, this movie is just not top-quality film-making. While David Zucker's (and Jim Abrahams') Airplane! and Naked Gun trilogy make the tears roll down my face throughout, at best I chuckled a few times during An American Carol. It seems Zucker was less intent on making a good satirical comedy than he was preaching. Even though I agree with the sentiments this movie expresses, it just didn't work well as satire. I am grateful that he did not include some of the deleted scenes because a few are tasteless.

The lack of focus and humour in this movie evokes Ed Wood in its style-- it's simply much easier to laugh at it than to laugh with it. The difference from Ed Wood's style is that this film is not wacky and fun, rather just a jumble of ridiculous stereotypes. I wanted to like it, since I loved all of the Naked Gun and Airplane films. In the end, though, it just isn't funny to laugh at needless insults without any comedic value. Were you one of the bullies in this playground who always picked on others for being different in any way you can imagine? If yes, then you might like this film.

My particular favorite was the scene where the ACLU \\"zombies\\" were trying to chisel apart the ten commandments in a court room, and General Patton (Kelsey Grammer) shot them, one after another. I had to rewind that scene a few times. It's amazing that this movie came out of Hollywood, being as whacked and far left as 90% of the industry is. I would have paid money to watch Moore lay eyes on this on the first go around. That miserable wretch probably shut it off or walked out within the first fifteen minutes! The all star cast worked well together and certainly hit a home run with the mission statement of the flick. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone, particularly those that despise the vermin at the ACLU, hold Michael Moore in disdain, and desire a change of venue from the typical Hollywood slant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top notch","review":"Very well done.Makes many good points about liberal idiotcy.

In any event, this was my first Dickey novel and I have to say that all in all, I was very satisfied with the effort. The prose is interesting, lush and vivid in some parts and caustic in others. Some of the other reviewers seemed to be appalled at the plot and the surgical sterility that Dickey used to describe the deaths inflicted by the main character, but I found those exact things to be quite within the realm of believability, especially when the whole idea of the book is to survive like an animal behind enemy lines.I liked the book enough to want to go back and read more of Dickey's other works..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The audio version is a masterpiece, far better than print","review":"Narrated entirely in the first person, the reader of the audio version is superb.

Instead, this is a disturbing tale about a twisted, bloodthirsty murderer with no grasp on the value of human life (and little grasp on sanity). Dull dreamlike sequences drag on and on, slowing the pace of the book. Extended ramblings about such topics as smashing human pelvic bones and drinking blood attest to the narrator's (and author's) ugly morbidity. The narrator's boasts about his unmatched skills as an outdoorsman grow stale quickly. On the whole, this book will bore you and turn your stomach.

The reason for this, if you are studying the Fair Folk, then you shouldnt need an explination about the meaning of words used by Rev Kirk.Im sorry, but i cannot support the decision to put a 45 page explinatory essay or what seems to be a thesis infront of the works of Rev Kirk.

When this case came, I was confused and shocked to learn that someone would make a case that protects every part from scratches except the screen. I'm sure if I go back and read the product description, this is explained somewhere and I just missed it. However, it baffles me what the purpose is of protecting everything but the screen.

In this thoughtful volume, Iyer details his perplexing and wonderful experiences as he attempted to understand another culture. The process is not so easy! But I love Iyer's narrative. He set out to Japan to clear his head, to think, to be alone. Then reality hit, and his year turned into something completely different.People who chose to study or live abroad are either quite brave or quite naive. Their experiences can send them to heights of pleasure and back to their own drawing boards. Iyer's frank explanation of both successes and failures in his new culture make this book a special treasure. I was enthralled while reading every page.Although I had already been to Japan when I found this book, now I can't wait to return, not to mimic Iyer's adventure, which would be impossible, but to appreciate even more of his observations and difficulties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep immersion in Kyoto cuture","review":"Pico Iyer writes so well. His images are fitting and so graphic, yet his touch is very refined. His treatment of his relationship with a married Japanese woman reveals the Japanese culture of the 1980's (much of which carries over to today) and draws the reader into caring about these people. The way the communications are carried between people is so different than what the American direct style. It gives a lot to consider in the way we relate with others, It is not primarily a spiritual book, but way more than a travel book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"Iyer moves to Kyoto, Japan to write. While there, he meets a young Japanese wife and mother, as anxious to practice her English as he was to practice his Japanese. Thus a relationship was born, a link between the two very different cultures. A deep relationship despite the differences. Fascinating book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks trust between reader and writer","review":"I loved this book at first and then began to slowly grow distrustful of the author. He's constantly hooking up with \\"The Lady\\" to goto various places around Japan but around halfway through the book, she's gushing feelings of love to him and he's weirdly stoic. The odd clue like them sharing a hotel room and meeting up in a foreign county make it seem as if he's hiding something. Once that feeling was in me, the book became a lot less fullfilling. I kept thinking about The Lady's two kids and, really, how lame the author was acting (especially after finding out they currently live together in Kyoto).It's also a lazy book. the author doesn't even try to learn the language before moving to Japan and spends half the book with various foreigners living in the country. A far superior book about a foreigner residing in Japan and REALLY living with the Japanese and writing about their lifestyle/culture is LEARNING TO BOW."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lady and the Monk : Four seasons in Kyoto","review":"Sorry Pico, I wasn't able to finish this one! It swings between being cliche and condescending to outright fantasy! \\"A high mountain clarity sharpened the October air\\" (talking about Narita Page 3). There isn't a mountain within about 100KM of Narita, it's situated in rice fields! He makes another reference early in the book about street vending machines full of every kind of fruit juice you can imagine. I wish it were so! The only fruit juice you can buy in a vending machine is from an American soft drinks company, sometimes! I use these two early points to illustrate the distortions of living in Japan which continue throughout the book (on almost every page). Mr. Iyer has written a fantasy, which really gives an unclear picture of life in Japan."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book's not even a good read.","review":"I agree with the reader from Hong Kong. Iyer's self-indulgent, hackneyed book didn't even keep my attention. I enjoyed the descriptions of Japan and its culture, but at times the book seemed a forum for Iyer to show off how many books he's read or obscure artists he likes. The writing's not well-done, the love story with Sachiko (among other themes that could have been interesting) is wildly underdeveloped (what ever happened with her, anyway?), and his \\"gee-whiz this is so different\\" Pollyanna attitude loses its appeal very early in the book. I'm pretty lenient when it comes to books, but I'm sorry I wasted my time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED it.","review":"I would highly recommend it, extol it even, to anyone (even the greatest cultural ignoramus) who is interested in Japanese culture.

If you want a fancy-pants fairy tale, buy this book.I'd even rate Dave Barry's book about Japan as better quality journalism.If you want to read some first-rate books from an author who traveled in Japan and wrote about during roughly the same time, I wholeheartedly recommend Alan Booth.His books, _The Roads to Sata_ and _Looking for the Lost_ have a well deserved place on my bookshelf.Buy those instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I Have Read in a Long Time","review":"When I think of The Lady and the Monk, I can't think of one coherent theme in the book.

The current cover is noticeably lesser quality, very flimsy compared with the original, but more than that, it doesn't fit the book well at all. The book just slides around inside it and is on the verge of falling out. I would gladly pay the old price to have the old book.

Saving Hal Jordan for something this big wasn't a sign of poor sales, but of good taste. He deserved to be a big player, but only so many stories can be done about a character with no fear. Anyway, if you hear someone bad-mouthing this story, they're WRONG! The only reason that people think it was a rip-off on \\"Crisis\\" was because of the fact that both villains of these storylines were smart enough to get a head start on destroying all the worlds without heroes! Besides, if you wanted to destroy all reality, what better force to use then the end of time itself? This is a great read, and no one that has really read it and looked into it can say anything otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this book","review":"Zero Hour came as quite a disappointment to me. I am a sucker for a company wide team up story, and a big fan of Green Lantern, but this story just didn't resonate with me. At the end there are a few good pages involving Green Arrow and his conflicted emotional reaction to the situation. But as a whole it is just lackluster storytelling.If you want to see all your favorite DC heroes band together, do your self a favor and read Final Night, one of the Crisis on Multiple Earth books, or better yet just re-read Crisis on Infinite Earths."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was about time","review":"It was about time I looked on Amazon to get this comic!!! it took 5 minutes to find this book I was looking for ages and fast delivery made it the best present ever! thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too over-written","review":"This was writen by the same riter who killed Superman and here Jurgens destroys and then rebuilts the DCU almost from the ground up.

Before I bought this replacement, I would be lucky to get through a full day of very light usage. This battery restored my battery life to the early days of my phone, and I couldn't be happier.

Even if you zoom-in all the way, as soon as you put the camera in video mode it zooms back out.3) Even if you are unconcerned with shutter speeds, apertures, and ISO levels, you should still look for a camera that has a way to have a bit of control over these things. For instance, many consumer cameras have a \\"sports\\" mode for fast moving subjects. This mode sets the shutter speed to be fast, and therefore eliminates motion blur.

It's a real bummer because I like everything else about the camera.Updated 10/21/03 -- Purchased the Canon Powershot S400 to replace. What a great camera!!!!

You have to use the LCD interface to do it.But the real problem with this camera was the indoor photo quality.I actually returned this camera, as I was VERY disappointed with the quality of the indoor pictures.Even self timer shots from a tripod were blurry!I got the 740UZ instead. it is WAY bigger, but at least it takes decent pictures.If you are going to buy this camera, make sure you buy it from amazon or another place with a good returns policy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrible singing my rear patoot!","review":"A Life Once Lost is and always will be and always has been the best metal can offer.

For example bands usualy say it took them long time to write tracks/record ,they spent lots of hours on the album and whenever you hear \\"Most effort they ever put in to this whole project\\" it translates to we're running out of original ideas and the whole CD is gonna be crap. This cd it looked like they made in week or two, the quaility of the sound is sooo damn shiity, if a rendom band from the street would bring their demo it would of probably sound a alot better.

As a Catholic, I find much of the subject matter here offensive and misleading-- but, then again, I never listened to Slayer to \\"learn\\" anything.

Lombardo returns as drummer, Bostaph did a wonderful job on previous three albums. Kudos to him. Gets back to the older Thrash format in a modern way. They actually got a grammy for Eyes of the Insane. World Painted Blood is similar, but ups the bar on this one in my opinion. Doesn't seem to have as much Nu-ish style as previouse releases have. Of the supposed Big 4, these guys have remained consistently brutal. Haven't lost their edge in any way. If you want Thrash, Slayer would be ones to look into.If and when you come to terms with \\"with God, all things are possible\\", lyrics take on a whole new meaning. This and previous releases.

Now go watch a horor movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slayer's Long Awaited Return.","review":"Slayer's new album is one of 2006's best and it's their first studio album in 5 years. Dave Lombardo is also back on drums and it's their first album with him in 16 years. It's a return to their '80s and early '90s roots although it still has some of their later and heavier metal roots, like God Hates Us All mixed with Seasons In The Abyss. It was a complete surprise and the best they've done since Seasons. Supremest is one of the best songs they've ever done. Christ Illusion gets the best metal album of the year, in my opinion. There are a few mediocre tracks but it has some of their best songs to date also, definitely a must have for Slayer fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice return to form","review":"You won't waste your money on this one.

This is the noisiest garbage metal band on the Earth!","review":"Here is what I've expected from this crappy band they keep making incoeherent noise with idiotic \\"Hail Satan, F**king Jesus Christ, blood/death everywhere, I kill your family and eat your flesh!\\" etc. lyrics like ever before. Its a wonder how can they do it for 20 years... You must be an idiotic s**t-minded retard with an IQ of zero to like this. F**k Slayer and their fans!I agree with this \\"donkey\\" guy below, Slayer is the WORST metal band ever. For good real metal, check out some of those bands he listed. I hope Slayer will die painfully soon and their fans will commit suicide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Posing...","review":"This band is one of those bands that are scared to sing about something sensible about. They got bad stuff in their lyrics, and that's their way of trying to be tough. Mature, talented bands like Norma Jean, Demis of Eros, are tougher bands becaue they aren't afraid to sing what is logical and makes sense. Bands like the last stated are strong and fearless like who they worship: God. Other bands like Slayer try to gain a \\"tough\\" reputation by trying to be a rebel. I would stick to bands that aren't scared."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE","review":"This New release is just plain garbage...I agree with you Corpsegrinder.As a die-hard Slayer fan..The band did die after Seasons.."},{"rating":"1","title":"nah","review":"swlayer is one of those bands that is like a roach they just dont go away theyve made like 20 albums and still havent made it repetitive guitar and drums all albums sound the same give it up slayer your not going to make it just not that great of a band people need to understand that 5 4.5 stars means the album is rated a classis not you like them so give them 5 if this album was a classic it would have at least sold 500,000 copies not under 100,000"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Lombardo Is Back!","review":"This is first Slayer album since SEASONS IN THE ABYSS with the drummer DAVE LOMBARDO who is one of the greatest drummers in metal. Still, I think I was a little bit disapponted because all of the songs in this album aren't as good as in GOD HATES US ALL which was one of the greatest albums ever made. There's great songs - just as \\"Jihad\\", \\"Catatonic\\" etc. which sound really angry - very aggressive! In fact the only songs I don't like so much are \\"Catalyst\\" and \\"Consfearacy\\" but that may be that I have only listened to this album seven times. I really think I have to listen to this more, and not just because of I can say it's perfect. I listen to it because I like it.Stars: Cult, Jihad, Eyes of the Insane"},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5","review":"Best since \\"Reign in Blood\\". Great crystal clear drum sound and vibe is great. Cutting listening time to 38 minutes was a good idea. great CD.."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ok release for Slayer","review":"Christ Illusion sounds a bit cool for a new title album for Slayer. All the songs sound great, because of Kerry's and Jeff's guitar parts. The most outstanding song of all is Jihad. It may not be another Reign in Blood, but its worth listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Are Here.....","review":"then you already know you need to get this. i have always been fascinated by the fellow who carved up his forearm for that long past cd insert photo.....but never had the guts to do something so....permanent. listening to this cd makes me remember why there are so few bands capable of instilling such devotion in people.....they create the music that literally speaks to our souls. i am no satanist....but i can think of no religious experience more powerful than that of slayer at their prime.....hand me the knife, i have some long overdue blood work to get done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"any real Slayer fan who has followed their career would agree that there was no effort put into this album.before you disagree listen to the damn thing, it sux. sample before you buy, trust me, even though most will find out the hard way.the lyrics are the same old slayer lyrics except chewed up and pooped out on this album.there are some ok riffs on this album but most of them are boring as hell and the solos are jeff and kerry's worst yet.drumming is ok, but nothing and i mean nothing compaired to daves other work.this whole album is lazy and was only put out there for money. im sure their will be a lot of kids who are new to slayer and metal and think wow what an awesome album, but its not.i would still reccomend any other slayer album, but any more good tunes from slayer may be the real illusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is terrible","review":"As a long time Slayer fan from the 80's, I will agree that this album is their best since \\"Seasons..\\". But it does not compare to Seasons, it's just merely \\"the best since\\". Musically it's decent. There are thrash songs on it however this is not a \\"thrash album\\".The lyrics on these songs are just downright awful. There was obviosuly no time taken or thinking through with the creative process of these lyrics AND the way they are delivered. Tom is just yelling words bluntly!! You mean to tell me this is all they came up with in 5 years? IN 5 YEARS since their last release? If anything the lyrics on this album sound like they were just trying to make studio deadlines...The only reason I'm giving this album 2 stars is to show that it is set apart from God Hates Us All and Diabolous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive for how old they are getting","review":"I've been a Slayer fan for about 8 or 9 years now. We didnt come to expect this album to be a Seasons in the Abyss or a Reign in Blood. I was suprised at how well they did on this album. I'd have to put it up to par with their Diabolus in Musica release, much better than God Hates us All. There are some great guitar riffs in this album, yet there are a few songs where it's just too fast paced, no intro, etc..My favorites on this album would have to be Skeleton Christ, Jihad, Catatonic and Cult.For how old they are getting i'm really impressed.I hope it's not their last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal, not in a good way","review":"yes, very brutal, slayer has earned the new monicker nu-slayer that seems to be all the rage these days .

The Band can create a very dark and cool ambiance. Then the solos hit you and your like wow. If your not angry and you listen to this album you will be, you'll just wanna hit somthing. I may say that it's better than Reign In Blood"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent progression of style and aggression","review":"I found this album to be an absolutely fantastic change in direction. The style is very reminiscent of the agressive feel of their older album, Reign in Blood. Lombardo is still virtuosic as ever on the drums and kerry king and jeff hanneman still make their guitars sound like you are on the ninth plane of hell.The only aspect about the album that kept me from giving it 5 stars is Tom Araya's vocals. At times they do not seem to be quite in tune with everyone else and it's much more yelling than singing these days. I don't think I've heard any of his higher pitched screams in over 10 years either. It's a shame that such abuse over time can ruin the voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in 16 years, buy it now!","review":"I got this album for Xmas (ironic isn't it?) and the first thing I noticed was the drumming, Lombardo was like a good dose of Viagra to Slayer. Bostaph was good but Lombardo blows him away, fast and precise drumming but not quite as good as SOH. Guitars bleed excellence KFK and Hannemans riffs are precise, fast and creative. Soloing is best Ive ever heard from them. Vox+ bass are good by Araya but no trademark screams and they are a bit monotone, just shouting. Jihad, Eyes and Cult are best songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is why Slayer are THE thrash metal reference","review":"Finally, Slayer have picked up where they left off after \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\". This is the real deal. Listen to this album and hear why Slayer are fanatically revered the world over and for decades by bands and fans alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most consistant metal band in history. They always deliver","review":"You know what you get with a Slayer CD........every CD of the band's career is worth the buy...and that's the highest compliment I feel a band can get.If you dig Slayer, check out the new SkinnedAlive live cd from Skinlab...a brutal, intense live cd...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christ reissued","review":"Slayer makes up for releasing two versions of the same album less than a year apart with some nice additions that will please the hardcore fan, this edition contains two additional tracks and a bonus DVD.Pros:* Cool artwork* \\"The Final Six\\" and the new version of \\"Black serenade\\" worth it.* \\"Eyes of the Insane\\" music video makes the bonus DVD worth the watchCons:* Many fans will wonder why Slayer couldn't have released the two versions at the same time, and not enough reasons to buy this new edition.* Only small differences between the two versions of \\"Black Serenade\\"Overall, the special edition of Christ Illusion is worth the pickup if you're a hardcore fan or haven't yet bought the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disheartening","review":"I love Slayer and have for years however other then the first track on here, I just didnt feel it with this album. Alot of it just sounds fast for the sake of being fast..Where are those riffs that make you want to throw a relative from a ten story window? A joke folks but as much as some people on here whine about God Hates Us All, I find that alubm much more interesting then this one. People whine about how Tom's voice was \\"jarring\\" and \\"grating\\" on God Hates. Look if you want phantom of the opera go somewhere else. Tom isnt a singer but what I like about his vocals is the feeling behind them. He honestly sounds like someone in torment..screaming and not giving a damn what people think about it.. I respect the brutality of it, most fans do. Look if you like Slayer then buy this album..however I will have to agree with one of the above commentaries, Jeff needs to start writing some material again. I think he balanced Kerry out, so hopefully that will happen sometime in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUK","review":"Listened to this album 3 times so far today, what a dissapointment.

Kerry/Jeff need to take guitar lessons. The riffs/songs are all recycled some really weird riffs. Besides the new Iron Maiden this will be the 2nd worst cd of 06Slayer really needs to start going on tour with some real metal bands. All this Nu-Metal bands they take out with them is embarrassing. They are starting to sound like them.I was really excited when I heard Dave was back in the band, going to record the new Slayer album, but his performance is also disappointing.If you are just getting into Slayer, buy anything up till Seasons, after that it is GAYER.Can't wait till Slayer do their show with Stryper...Way to go guys.......RIP SLAYER...RETIRE PLEASE"},{"rating":"2","title":"1000 mph THRASH METAL !!!","review":"Brutal, fast paced, relentless, as if Dave Lombardo had never left the band. Guitars riff more and solo less than before but this album picks up where Seasons In The Abbyss had left.Lyrics are still satanic but deal more with present subjects like war and religion (enough evil there to write 100 albums ).Production is( maybe purposely) very raw and dirty (similar to the latest Venom album) and lacks bottom end and upper treble, making it a nightmare to eq. Vocals are very low in the mix but I like that way.Great band, great record; this album comes to rescue them from their horrendous past albums like God Hates Us All and the like."},{"rating":"2","title":"buen reloj por el precio","review":"muy buen reloj, la unica contra que para cambiar la fecha hay que ir corriendo las agujas de la hora."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Suess's classic portrayed badly.","review":"\\"The Grinch\\" offers very little to the audience other than overwhelming visual candy.A few comments:~ Many people went to the movie to see Jim Carey. Unfortunately that is all the audience saw in the Grinch, Jim Carey. The producers let Carey use too much of his own persona which only served to overshadow the character of the Grinch.~ The movie relied too much on visual tricks and make-up versus a solid script and plot, this immensely takes away from the storyline.~ I highly doubt that Dr. Suess intended for the story to contain gross humor i.e. belching, farting, etc...Overall, I found the movie to be less than appealing.Take your family out to a different movie, your time will be better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD! NOT recommended to kids!","review":"I can't believe they took a good classic into something SOOO dumpy! First of all, this should be a kids movie, but the language, the jokes, etc is adult. The story is just terrible.If I'm not mistaken, I thought the original story was, that the Whos didnt care for presents, but being together as one, being like a large family.In the beginning of the movie, they're talking about presents as being the important thing for Christmas.NOT recommended for kids, due to language, adult jokes, scenes they play, etc.NOT recommended to anyone, due to a bad story, bad jokes, dull gross parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"too big a dose of Jim Carrey","review":"Ugh. Too much unfunny Jim Carrey. I haven't laughed at him since his days on \\"In Living Color\\", which was hilarious.

Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie that shouldn't exist","review":"Normally I enjoy Ron Howard films, but in this case he should have left well enough alone. \\"The Grinch\\" was just fine being only a half hour cartoon, thank you.

I spent more time trying to figure out how the makeup people made all the people's noses look the way they did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic At Our House!","review":"One of my favorite Jim Carrey performances and definitely a staple holiday-flick for us. The music is great and the way they brought the Who's and Whoville to life is spectacular! Also, Max is even cuter and lovable than in the book. Grinch/Seuss purists may not be the biggest fans because of the improvising they do with the Grinch's origin story but I think it adds depth to the character and to the moral of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true delight!","review":"If you ever thought to yourself \\"I love the Grinch, but 26 minutes isn't enough!\\" then you'll be delighted by Ron Howard's masterpiece, Dr. Suess' How the Grinch Stole Christmas. The extra 60 or so minutes of adventure feature great moments such as the origin of the Grinch and the story of why he hates Christmas. Young or old, it doesn't matter.

I really loved the way they gave background on how the Grinch became the way he is. Baby Grinch is adorable. This movie is also geered for the young as well as old-everyone will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was This Even Necessary?","review":"The original Dr. Seuss Story on How The Grinch Stole Christmas was a mere half hour cartoon. The original cartoon version kept it simple without any extended sidebars and remains more successful.Ron Howard tries to exaggerate this story and more or less fails quite miserably. Jim Carrey tries his best but even he comes up short with his over-exaggerated antics. The other actors and actresses in Whoville just sit there and take up space. They just all look like a bunch of wierdos without adding an ounce of humor in this attempt at making a childhood story into an adult oriented comedy. Truthfully I wonder if this movie should have ever been made. Its not a children's tale with its crass language and scenes. And the humor is so cheap that any normal adult would find it sophmoric if not downright stupid.If you like a good Christmas fable, seek out the original cartoon. This mess of a movie just does not cut the mustard."},{"rating":"1","title":"sacrilege","review":"As someone who worshiped the original animated version of this film, I can only say that this film has irrevocably soiled the image of Dr. Suess. In my opinion, this film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. If I could snap my fingers and make this terrible film go away forever, I would, in a heartbeat. Shame on you Opie!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excessive, loud & appalling","review":"The Grinch makeup has rendered Jim Carrey unrecognizable. Just as unrecognizable is the original Dr. Seuss story after it received this dreadful Hollywood mauling.The movie is over-produced & unbearably loud. Jim Carrey, as he so often does, over-acts and is generally obnoxious. The movie is overly long, which only adds to the misery it causes for the viewer.I was never overly fond of the 1966 animated Christmas special, narrated by Boris Karloff, but compared to this turkey, the 1966 version comes across as High Art.I guess this is one of the sacrifices one makes for having children. Any adult without kids who subjects himself to this garbage is in need of professional help. It is movies like this that make me glad that Christmas is only once a year (of course, now we have The Cat in the Hat with which to deal!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Critic says it all, \\"It Sux!!\\"","review":"Here I thought this movie was going to be an instant classic. Boy was I wrong. First of all the movie strts out well and goes down hill from there. I mean the ending isn't even the original one that we have all grown to love.

My children loved it and I watched it with them. I totally reccommend this movie to anyone of all ages. Enjoy, because we did!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"I think this movie is hillarious. No it isn't the same as the original grinch (originals are always #1 IMO) but it's a great follow up. Jim Carrey brought a new spin on the character of the grinch. It's more contemporary but it's still has a basic outline of the original. In this movie the grinch is cold, angry, heartless but also comical despite his bitterness and it's refreshing. It has more of a hollywood spin on it but it doesn't mean it isn't good."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad for a live action version","review":"I wasn't sure what to think of this when I first saw it but I can say that the live action version of HTGSC made a decent effort as far as holding up to the original. Jim Carrey definately steals the show for the most part (no pun intended). The other characters however did not hold up well enough in my opinion to make this a superb movie. Kids will certainly enjoy this to the fullest but adults may only be amused by Jim Carrey's performance and not much else. Don't get me wrong, this movie is good for family get-togethers over the holidays. The special features on the DVD are a definate plus which is why I'm giving HTGSC a 4th star. As I said before, Jim Carrey fans will be pleased with this and I don't think anyone else could have pulled off the Grinch the way he did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This movie is insanely funny. I was expecting more DVD extras. The extras do not last that long and some of them are just advertisements for Universal Studios. The outtakes and deleted scenes are pretty funny though. If your buying the DVD for the extras buy it from one of the marketplace sellers because it is not worth more than $15.00."},{"rating":"2","title":"So THAT'S how he stole it...","review":"That was Jim Carrey in that costume? I don't think anyone could have pulled it off better, but for me, Taylor Momsen, who played Cindy Loo Who, was the most enjoyable to watch. What a gifted little actress. Christine Baranski and Molly Shannon, both musically-inclined favorites of mine, also danced across the screen.So this isn't exactly the same storyline as the one penned by the good doctor himself. But it is very close, with some details added in to give adults a few more chuckles.And if you like it for nothing else, you will love the fantasy world created by some outstanding set and costume design; terrific old and new music; and vivid special effects.Worth a viewing or two for all of you Who's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Favorite","review":"This is a great family movie. I watch it with my grandchildren and they LOVE it as much as I do. I also own the original animated version and we watch both of them and enjoy both. There is a great lesson taught in the story while we are entertained. It has enough \\"adult\\" humor to keep us older folks chuckling and enough fun for the kiddies to keep them laughing too. I think the kids get the message that Christmas isn't just about the decorations and gifts but about sharing it with the people they love. Dr. Seuss was a master story teller and having his story presented in this wonderful holiday movie is a way I really enjoy spending quality time with the little ones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's The Grinch, Do Not Critique It!","review":"Come on people, this is The Grinch. You cannot critique The Grinch. This is my favorite movie. It sends the same message that the cartoon did. It's THE GRINCH! It's the way it should be. Don't bother with your Hollywood crud, this is Dr. Suess and it is a joyous movie for the holiday season. God Bless, and Happy Holidays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I don't know where the numerous praises saying that this movie was good for kids came from. I'm a kid and I hated it. Compared to Jim Carrey's previous work, this movie barely had a serious moment and wasn't even funny. The extras that they added were gross and juvenile. I'm not Carrey's biggest fan, but some of his comedic talent are bizzarely hilarious. This isn't one of those moments, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money BACK!!!","review":"I just bought the video of How the Grinch Stole Christmas, and all I can say is I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I was horrified by the entire movie. It was like the Mask only with a Christmas theme and no gangsters. This is a shining example of everything that is wrong with Hollywood. A big budget and scads of special effects do NOT make a good movie. In this case it didn't even make a decent movie. This movie lacked all the charm, humor, and fun of the original. It is by no means endearing as the original is and always will be. And the original, made with the simplest, purest, truest form of animation will remain beloved and treasured while I would like to fling my copy of the new one into a toxic waste dump. I am sure that Dr. Seuss is rolling over in his grave. My kids weren't even mildly humored by this movie. I gave this movie one star because there is no option to give it the big NONE that it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and Funny!!! by Jodi","review":"I have seen the animated version and now real life and it is hilarious! It also is kind of different. it also tells how the Grinch was born. Cindy Lou also tries to convince the Grinch to come down to Who village to show everyone that he is not green and mean. The Grinch also has a crush on a hot girl since he was at school but she was in love with the mayor. The Grinch wants his revenge on the mayor for the Grinch shaving himself and got everybody to laugh. That is why I like this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Stupid, It's Funny","review":"I love this movie! It is so incredibly stupid and funny. It is absolutely ridiculous and slightly crass. The grinch and the whos look like a bunch of clowns. The film was predictable and completely ripped off from the animated TV special. This isn't as stupid as Barney, because at least the makers of this film actually tried to be funny, rather than just childish and retarded.

The houses and all the props are done well and artisticly. I could watch the movie on mute just to see this but of course there are so many good lines to laugh at you can't do that.Bottom line 1-like Jim Carrey? 2-like the original grinch? 3-want a funny clean christmas movie? yes yes and yes = a must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I love this movie sooo much!

Amazon saved the day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good idea.","review":"I don't own this yet, but I have watched all 2 of them. This is, of course, the only 2 Dr.Suess movies in 1 pack. The 1 thing that makes it a 4 stars is that it does not have a bounes disk full of extra's, but besides The E-x-t-r-a-d-i-s-k, this sounds Exelent'a. The stories are queit the charming that makes this enjoyabele for the whole family. This be the perfect gift for anyones x-mes preasents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too childish for my tastes but it has it's moments","review":"The Grinch was a great film if you're eight.

The film is good family entertainment though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Scenery Bad Story","review":"I've been a fan of Dr. Seuss's book and the original TV version of this story for as long as I can remember. When I first heard about this movie, I was skeptical yet hopeful. As I saw pictures, I became encouraged. But when I actually got to see the movie, I was highly disappointed.First, the good. Everything from the costumes and people to the sets looks exactly like a Dr. Seuss story brought to life. The cast does a wonderful job, even Jim Carrey, who I'm a marginal fan of at best.However, the best part of this movie is the 30 minutes that tell the original story. The back story, while needed to make this a full length movie, does nothing for the plot and lessons the impact of the themes regarding Christmas. Frankly, I was bored waiting for The Grinch to start stealing Christmas.My recommendation? Skip this movie and get the Boris Karloff cartoon. Or better yet, read the original book. Either would be a better holiday tradition then this disappointing movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Christmas favorite for years to come...","review":"Ron Howard's directing at its best -- Jim Carrey seems to have found a role where he doesn't seem annoying.

I plan on watching this every Christmas for years to come!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems to Be a Copy","review":"This is a great movie...one of my Christmas favorites. I would not recommending buying from this seller. The video quality is poor, grainy, and it has black spots as it plays.

Not sure what the problem is, but I have not seen such poor video quality since VHS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviewer: Big Zach! NOT A KIDS REVIEW! although a kid!","review":"This movie is a christmas classic it is very funny. Jim Carrey is excellent one of his top 5 performances.

Jim Carey could have been great, but the tasteless scenes of him eating glass and closeups of the termites in his teeth totally ruin this movie. I know the grinch is ugly, but they went overboard. The silly makeup takes away from the story. I was so busy looking at the noses and hair that I couldn't get into the story. The only word I can think of is \\"tasteless.\\" I rented this for my family and only the 7-year-old liked it; however, we all enjoyed the cartoon version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your a vile one Mr. Grinch","review":"After walking out of the theater I regreted paying to see it. Owning it would be throwing good money after bad. I've seen much better remakes done by Golan and Globus. Why a wonderus, joyfull, entertaining story needs a rewrite is beyond me. Stay away from this one, get the original 1966 TV version directed by Chuck Jones with Boris Karloffs hauntingly memorible narration and the voice of Tony the Tiger singing the Grinch theme. As for the remake I wouldn't touch it with a 39 and a half foot pole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave the classics alone","review":"it was the worst movie i had seen in a long time. it had no soul and no feeling. and i was about to pull my hair out having to sit thru it. and then i breathed a sigh of relief when it was over. and i was so down from watching it that i had to see somthing good so i . poped in saving private ryan and my hair pulling was over.then i was happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully Bad","review":"This movie would be bad enough on its own, but the way it disrespects the classic children's book it's based on is just awful.

In one sceen with him \\"naked\\" and the way he moves around the little girl is scary and almost sexual.

I would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the cartoon instead.","review":"The cartoon is a classic and one of the best Christmas shows of all time. This move, however, stunk. I honestly hated this movie. There was no need to build a backstory for the Grinch! Yet so much time was spent in building backstories for both the Grinch and Cindy Lou Who that the movie felt like it was an hour and a half too long. Jim Carrey was terrible in it. His improving through the film made him more of a goofball instead of a \\"Grinch\\" who should be feared. I found myself saying, \\"get to the point, get to the point\\" over and over. By the time they got to the part where the Grinch was to steal Christmas, I long stopped caring. Another thing I hated about it was how they made Cindy Lou Who a central character. That it was her who turned the Grinch. It changed the whole meaning of the show and was unnecessary. Get the classic cartoon instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too scary for my 6 yr old","review":"Yes the story ends on a good note, but i found the grinch figure to be too scary erratic and psycho for my 6.5 year old. It wasnt fun... i kept watching with her waiting for the story to turn, but it came very late.Besides the scary grinch figure, the story is boring - the plot is thin. Nothing really happens there. Just another Christmas movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are a fan of Jim Carey. ..","review":"I ordered this movie for the kids but they didn't finish it.

It was visually interesting although the story lacked charm."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BORING CARREY","review":"Carrey overacts like always here.

This on the other hand is a far cry from the original Suess. I love Jim Carey in most of his movies, amazingly talented man, but in this movie his make-up was so grotesque and the tone of the film was so terribly dark that it really did not do well with my 4 young kids. Two thumbs down on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas movie for the family","review":"I love this version and recommend it for all families to enjoy for the holiday seasons.

One of the ugliest things Hollywood has ever manufactured."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!","review":"Dr. Seuss NEVER would've allowed this movie to be made if he were alive! It was his money grubbing ninny of a wife who gave the nod on this disaster. I'm sure he is turning over in his grave. It was really awful! Not to mention dissapointing considering some of the talent that was involved (Ron Howard directing, Rick Baker providing the makeup, and Sir Anthony Hopkins providing narration)They took FAR to many liberties with the original story simply to drag it out enough to make it movie length. No real Suess fan could possibly enjoy this movie. The only good thing I can say is that the computer animation was done quite well. It was used judiciously and is virtually imperceptible. PASS THIS UP AND GET THE ANIMATED ORIGINAL. It is far, far superior!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst piece of crap ever,0 stars","review":"This movie is one of the worst movies ever ,with Jim Carrey messing up this crap as The Grinch that needs to ruin Christmas and then has bad thoughts what he done to the Christmas.This is no kids movie this movie is dark,mean-spirited,crude,and stupid who thought to put Jim Carrey in a kids movie.this movie had potential when it was popular then Jim Carrey messed up his role as the grinch then the plot ruined this movie.hope Cat in the Hat does better than this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"The movie was open when it came in the mail.

The original Grinch has a poignant message of the true meaning of Christmas - coming without packages, parcels or bags. This one has Jim Carrey celebrating excess. Somewhere Dr. S. is rolling in his grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"GO AWAY GRINCH!","review":"This movie is so bad, it's good, to just watch at how terrible Jim Carrey over-acts in this stinkbomb makes me laugh hard, not only the most unneccessary additions, including the Cheerleader title, which believe me I don't blame Ron Howard, who had to try and make a movie with a suitable running time, but that bit was unneccessary, I truly think that this film had hope but too much unneccessary material was introduced into the movie and it took away from the main story, granted I will tell you the costume design and art direction are simply astounding, but that's where it ends, I strongly believe that Tim Burton should have done this movie and probably would have made it absolutely stunning, if you want a real christmas movie, go rent the original grinch, or Christmas Vacation, it may be innappropriate, but it's a hoot."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete waste of time","review":"This movie was...HORRIBLE!!!!! If I had to pick one good thing about it, I would choose the makeup job on Jim Carrey (you can't even tell it's him). But everything else was horrible. This hardly followed the book at all, and hardly used any dialogue from it. If you want excellent Dr. Seuss movies, go see \\"In Search of Dr. Seuss\\" and \\"The Cat in the Hat\\" with Mike Myers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crude, Rude, Ridiculous","review":"This is not for kids.

We like Jim Carey and did not think he was very funny in this one. Trying to stretch a 30 minute cartoon that was perfect the way it was does not make an entertaining feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre new film about the legendary Grinch","review":"OK, I admit Carrey gave a lot of good, witty lines to his character in this film. Watching scenes with him alone in his cavern is simply a pleasure, but everything surrounding those scenes is dull, dreary, and damn near unbearable. The sets are colourful but the hazy photography doesn't let them shine through. This film was more depressing than uplifting: at a certain point I just couldn't wait until it finished. Especially from director Ron Howard this is an appalling mess of a film. Let's hope his upcoming A BEAUTIFUL MIND is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MOVIE EVER","review":"I think that The Grinch is the best movie ever created. I recommend it to everyone to watch.

I have a countdown going on until i can go and get it on the 20th."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute WORST movie I have ever seen!!!","review":"All I can remember about this awful movie is being disapointed at every turn. The constant bending and revision of the original story-line, the unlikable poorly done charecters, the terrible acting, etc. Really not a movie that I would recommend. The book is much better, best to stick to that and forget this sorry excuse.If I could give it zero stars instead of one I would, but apparantly amazon will allow one as the lowest possible rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real stinker","review":"First of all, i don't see any reason for this movie to have been made. The half-hour cartoon was by far better made and more memorable. 30 minutes is all it takes to tell the story of a Scrooge-like character who get his Christmas comeuppance. We really don't need all the back-ground fill, childhood experiences, and toilet humor (a sleeping mayor being duped into kissing a dog's backside - and this is a kid's movie?!) to pad out a simple holiday tale. Not fun. Not amusing. Just dull dull dull!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"I saw this movie in the theater last year and I didn't like it. It was one of the worst family movies I have ever seen. Jim Carrey looked good as the Grinch but I was expecting it to be Jack Nicholson or Tim Curry. Because you know in Home Alone 2 when Kevin was watching The Grinch in the Lemo and Tim Curry had the perfect Grinch smile. But I don't know Jim Carrey was allright as the Grinch. If you want to see a good Grinch film go get the animated version. This version of the Grinch is really dumb and it's not good for kids to watch. The only thing that's good about this movie is the song by Faith Hill \\"Where Are You Christmas.\\" Stick with the animated version don't see this piece of ...!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Dr. Seuss","review":"I loved the book and the cartoon of the Grinch.

It's slow, it's shabby, it's shotty and it sucks. Too much garbage was added into this movie. The Grinch going to Whoville to accept his award made me fall asleep. The Grinch \\"casing\\" Whoville in a disguise was another disaster. The ending above all should have been left alone. It should have ended just like the original. Ron Howard in his infinite wisdom couldn't even do that. All around this movie should have never been made. The extras on the DVD were boring as well. Keep away from this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"How the Grinch Stole Xmas","review":"Christmas classic; Share with everyone the true meaning of Holiday spirit with the fun creatures of Who-Ville.

In this instance, the Grinch, a hideous abnormality that lives off his passion for yuletide misery, is eventually persuaded from obscurity to join the Whos in their picture-perfect village. Under the layers of leathery green skin, Jim Carrey is instantly recogniseable as he writhes and extends his facial features to the limit capturing the loveable rogue stature perfectly. Ron Howard's takes charge of the direction and provides an magical yet comprehendable depiction of the dedicated Whos as they prepare for the festivities. Its not laugh a minute entertainment but it is inventively produced and provides a credible reproduction of Dr Seuss classic childrens stories. Hilarious in parts and cringeworthy in others, this is family fun encroaching upon the the best in DVD entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfully Funny!","review":"Jim Carey as the Grinch is the best casting since Charlie Chaplin played the Little Tramp.

It stunk. This is the most wandering, stupid, over-budgeted waste I have seen in a long time. Jim was given plenty to do, largely because he had to fill-in a character who didn't exist on the script.

If you're here for that, go elsewhere, because I'm not offering it!This movie tells the story of a poor soul that everybody is scared of and that nobody really \\"likes.\\" The character is portrayed as a moderately evil (Dr. Seuss style) character that is misunderstood and has a dark past, which is why he hates Christmas.Having said that, this movie is basically saying that anybody can be a dark and misunderstood person that nobody \\"likes,\\" but it's the inside that counts.

In watching the live action Grinch, Jim Carrey was obnoxiously over the top. and the movie didn't have any of the wholesome goodness I feel that the cartoon has.

It was bad on so very many levels, from the rediculous characters and dumb video effects. Very weird and disturbing movie. I can understand how some people might think it's funny but you def. don't want your kids watching this poo. The original 30 min. cartoon is charming and offers a beautiful and hopeful message.

They took the basic IDEA, not the basic PLOT, and added a bunch of other junk all onto it, making Cindy Lou Who one of the main characters, and making a family, and adding a bunch of stupid things like the Whobilation 1000 and the Mayor and all this stuff that WAS NOT IN THE CARTOON OR THE BOOK. This is disgusting."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU BETTER WATCH OUT!","review":"The Grinch is a wonderful film for children of all ages. Not only is it a funny holiday film it will also fill the hearts of grinches, Scrooges and Jeremey Creeks everywhere. Jim Carrey's crazy antics keep this film alive in our hearts. Maybe it doesn't follow the story but hey people would hate a film about a monster stealing Christmas for seventy five minutes then it would be a stinker. Parents if your kids love Christmas films and Jim Carrey then buy it and put it under the tree this Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A NEW INSTANT XMAS CLASSIC!","review":"I was prepared to hate this movie because what I had seen of Dr. Seuss books, I didn't really care for. But not having grown up with the wierd Doctor may have helped me get over the complaints of some Grinch fans out there who are quibbling over the adaption to the widescreen.I am now prepared to sit thru this Jim Carrey vehicle just like I sit thru NAT LAMPS CHRISTMAS VACATION, THE CHRISTMAS STORY and, yes, even IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE once a year. I must admit it's a little harder to get into the spirit this year but this movie had me thinking about nothing but the holiday coming up.Jim Carrey is perfect as the Grinch but the little girl looks too much like Jon Benet Ramsey. Other than that, this DVD goes right next to the other classics I mentioned above. I haven't given it 5 stars ... yet! (A couple of Christmases to go before it seeps in.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood has wrecked another classic.","review":"I loved the animated Grinch ever since I was a kid and was wondering how they were going to turn a perfect little 20 minute story into a movie. Well, they didn't. It isn't a movie. It is an abysmal bore. Like so many others before, Flintstones,shudder, rocky and bullwinkle, ugggggh. now the grinch. I actually turned it off halfway through. It was that bad. I never turn off a flick if there is anything even remotely interesting or there is any thread of compassion for any of the characters. I am by no means high brow. I love the stooges, both the ones supporting iggy and the black and white ones. I even like Jim Carrey in some but not all of his movies. This just plain sucked. avoid this lemon at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"I find Jim Carrey's rendition of the Grinch to be hilarious.

EVERYTHING was great!I am also a big fan of Jim Carrey since he was In Living Color. I own most of his movies and love him as an actor/comedian.This combination was supposed to WORK!!! It had the production money, the right costumes, the right actors, and the right direction, but there was something missing. Carrey's voice was nowhere near as good as he is capable of. The story was changed around quite a bit. The narrator's voice was off. The whole thing just reeked of \\"Not Dr. Suess\\". If you want a good movie, get the original cartoon, and Carrey's Truman Show or Me, Myself, & Irene. Sometimes you can't combine two great things successfully..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Movie Nobody Should Miss At Christmas Time!","review":"Who says Dr. Seuss is just for the youngsters? Jim Carrey delivers a stunning performance as the cunningly evil Grinch in this Christmas movie, everyone should see!How The Grich Stole Christmas, is a timeless Dr. Seuss tale of an evil Grinch long isolated from his fellow Whos, who as a result of the spirit of Christmas finds it in his heart to let go of his miserable ways. This story is brought to life for the 21st century to enjoy, in ways before unimaginable.This movie is hysterical, prepare to laugh almost non-stop through the movie. This movie is theatrical, and in a way almost romantic. Timeless values of love, peace, and friendship will be tried and acquited of all wrong.Prepare to enjoy your Christmas a little more, and let Jim Carrey get you in the Christmas spirit before its too late!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cute","review":"I knew Carey would be the perfect Grinch. No other actor couldve played that role. The little girl was sooooo adorable I wanted to reach through the screen and hug her!Its plot is a little lacking. Seems like a lot of it is filling in time.

But could have been better...","review":"I saw this movie in theaters and I did not know what to think of it. The cinematography and the sets were absolutely amazing, and the two dimensional world of Dr. Seuss so effectively brought to life visually was stunning.But despite the beauty of the setting, there are a few details that do muddle this movie. Although Jim Carrey as the Grinch is outrageously funny (The presents! They'll all be destroyed! AND I CARE! What's the Deal?) some of the humor goes a bit too far and eventually stops being funny. Had Ron Howard used restraint on the crudeness and pushed the emotion and story forward a bit, you would have a wonderful heart-warming retelling of the classic story that does have a few hilarious moments that are truly hilarious and not crude or stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Christmas Movie","review":"I saw this when it came out, and it was more than what i had expected of it. It was great to see the book come to life, in all the colours of christmas"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"\\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\\" is a classic story by the master storyteller Dr. Seuss. It has an anti-commercialist message, but isn't overly preachy. This, however, is disgusting. It's hypocritical in the way that it was over-commercialized, and the plot totally strays from the book. In an attempt to lengthen the book's plot into a two-hour movie, it was mutilated and convoluted. Not only did the costume manager manage to make Jim Carrey thouroughly disgusting, she or he did so with the Whos too. The only good part was the sets, which were pure eye candy, from the bright colors of Whoville to the dank musty caves of the Grinch.All in all, get the original animated version. Don't waste your precious cash on this travesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks wit. For die-hard Carrey fans and the very young.","review":"This is a mishmash of a movie, full of Jim Carrey making his usual faces, but with an implausible addition to the classical Grinch plotline, in order to make it \\"interesting\\" to adults.Save your money for the classic Grinch.

It sucks. It sucks. Took one of the greatest animated movies of all time, added meaningless psychobabble to a story that was supposed to tell us about the possibility for reform in all of us and tried to make us feel sorry for the grinch, thereby avoiding the principal idea - even the WORST person can become better. HORRID film. NO redeeming qualities at all. Not worth sitting through. Not worth watching. If you buy it, burn it. I can't believe I had to give this film a star at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Always Listen to the Critics","review":"I must admit, when I first saw \\"Grinch,\\" I didn't know what to expect. The critics completely apalled it, but most of those who had seen it said it was very good. All I can say is: The critics, as they often are, were wrong.Jim Carrey is his usual self in a role that no one else could have played as well. This part was the perfect match to his acting. His verbal and physical humour will have you howling.And kudos to the set designer and the make-up artists. Both are slendid, and make this movie a holiday treat for the entire family. Ron Howard did a magnificent job bringing this beloved tale to the big screen.Be sure to buy it, especially if you have kids. It will become a holiday tradition to watch... and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been a lot better........","review":"Before I went to the theater to see this movie I heard on the radio that this movie was going to be \\"the next Wizard of Oz\\", but it wasn't! I enjoyed it a little bit, but haven't cared to see it again. Co-star Taylor Momsen makes a very unconvincing Cindy Lou Who. She should've won a Golden Raseberry Award for 'worst supporting actress' or something. Jim Carry is kind of funny but not as cruel and bitter as the Grinch in the cartoon. I'd rather stick with the Wizard of Oz than this. But everyone has a right to their own opinion. Rent it first. Then decide on whether or not you wish to by this."},{"rating":"1","title":"How bad can you make it!","review":"Being a long time fan of DR. SUESS's true version of the Grinch, you wouldn't think they could destroy the story that badly but, congratulations Ron you've succeeded. Don't get me wrong I really enjoy watching Jim Carrey acting or a Ron Howard film. The only reason it got two stars out of me is because no one could've played the Grinch better than Jim Carrey. I don't know it really upset me that they even had the audacity to make a movie out of this classic tale. Sometimes it is better to leave things the way they are, we didn't need a live action version of the Grinch the original was just fine......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragedy","review":"This movie is horrible! What were they thinking when they took a classic and turned it into a trash. I would not be surprised if Dr. Seuss would be rolling over in his grave from this movie. How could they take the integrity of the original story and add sexual references. It&#65533;s gross and makes my stomach turn. Children should not watch this version of the beloved story line of The Grinch who Stole Christmas. The costumes are the only good and creative element of the whole movie. Otherwise, this movie is horrible! Please spend your money on something that is worth while, like the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"this dvd is stupid","review":"*THIS IS FOR THE DVD NOT THE MOVIE*the movie the grinch is great and i love the story but what made me give this dvd a one * (star) is because they brought out the collector's edition last year and now they have the deluxe edition which has more special features but those of us who bought the first one can't get the new one because who wants two of the same movie. all i'm saying is if you have the first one don't buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appropriate for children","review":"This is a horrible mutilation of the beloved children's classic. I was trying really hard to find something to like, but the scene with the grinch eating a light bulb finally put me over the edge. The scene lasts forever and was so horribly disgusting. Dr. Seuss would be appalled. Buy the animated version instead, or better yet, turn off the tv and sit and read it together. Discuss the meaning of Christmas with your children, don't let hollywood try to teach them values through this lame, offensive rip-off."},{"rating":"2","title":"I. LOVE. THIS. MOVIE.!!! The BEST!","review":"Last year my mom and I went to see THE GRINCH. About three weeks before, I did something - I can't remember what - and so inexchange my mom promised we'd go see The Grinch, on at least thesecond day it was out.Well, I waited and waited, and the second day came. Mom couldn't take me. Nor the next day, or the next, or the next. Butabout two weeks later Mom FINALLY took me, and I LOVED it! Humor,sad parts, slapstick scenes, and a good moral. I was twelve, atthe time, and so people didn't think I wouldn't understand the few adult parts, but I did.My favorite Christmas movies ever are THE GRINCH, HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS, A CHRISTMAS STORY, A CHRISTMAS CAROL,It's a WoNDERFUL LIFE, RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER, and thatone Garfield movie. I also love THE SANTA CLAUS, JINGLE ALL THEWAY, SANTA WHO?, and THE BEST CHRISTMAS PRESENT EVER.Take it from me; this movie is great. I'm gonna buy it the dayit comes out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!","review":"Ok, here is the deal. I watched this movie in class today and I have to say that I HATED it!But, it does have it's moments. Here is a list of the Pros and ConsPROS:1. Jim Carrey once again does a great job acting2. Some funny jokes and comedy bits3. Most of the scenes on Whooville lived up to the original (The toys and the look of the people were great.)4. Good randitions of the original songsCONS:1. I find that the movie is way too long. Especially around the end. This one scene goes on, and on to the point where I was bored with it2. They changed the story a bit. They showed a bit of the Grinches childhood saying why he gates Christmas. Personally I hated it.3. Althought Jim does a good acting job he overdoes it sometimesSo overall this movie is... Ok. It's worth a watch if you must, but I would never buy it. If you are buying the grinch you should buy the cartoon version. That's a five star movie :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'r a mean one mr. grinch","review":"this movie is awesome.

It can't just be the absence of the magnificent Boris Karloff. Somehow, this movie feels loveless. It has a cold, cynical feeling to it to me. I simply do not get the feeling that this was done out of a love of Christmas or Dr. Suess or anything other than Mammon, the Holy Dollar. It isn't \\"nasty\\" or anything. IT will certainly entertain small children. The \\"backstory\\" of how the Grinch became \\"grinchy\\" feels forced and shallow. I just think it was ill-advised to stretch this simple, beautiful original story into this long, empty movie. To me, it's as if I decided to \\"improve\\" the Mona Lisa, because, for example, I think I can \\"show people what she is smiling at.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Grinch is almost as classic as the book","review":"This movie was absolutely delightful... It kept me laughing constantly because the humour was well delivered and written (thanks to the great Dr Seuss himself) and it was so full of fun.

I didn't care about any of the supporting characters except for the originals that were in the book. Jim Carrey does a wonderful acting job as the hated Grinch. But not even he can save this movie.

TAKE THE PILLOW FROM YOUR HEAD, AND PUT A BOOK IN IT!\\" That in itself should prove that this would be a different kind of album. This album pushed you to think, at the same time KRS was experimenting greatly with various lyrics flows at this time. The result is an absolute masterpiece o from a hip hop standpoint.

If you like KRS-1 or BDP, you MUST own this. Much like the Digable Planet's \\"Blowout Comb,\\" Black Star, and Lauryn Hill's group and solo work, this is the essence of hip-hop and a testament to a period in hip-hop when there seemed to be positive changes brewing.

There are six discs total including an extra feature disc for each movie. I guess the extra stuff is cool to a point, but it generally doesn't make a difference to me if it's included or not.As for the discs themselves.....Volume two contains Thunderball, You Only Live Twice and my personal favorite Diamonds are Forever.

Thunderball has the most gorgous trio of women in any Bond film. This exciting adventure has Bond foiling a SPECTRE attempt at nuclear blackmail. You Only Live Twice has Bond face to face with his arch enemy Blofeld in Japan. This movie features one of John Barry's best scores. Diamonds are Forever has Connery back as Bond after a one picture absence. This Bond is a little older and world weary but is as entertaining as ever.

Only one flaw, with the frame left assembled and in the weather all year, rust forms on the inside of the framing and starts to discolor the power coat. Suggestion, build and then use with legs mounted in 75lbs or more of quikrete in 4 plastic planters from Lowes. I have it this way on my concrete patio. It will not move/fly away and it can be easily dissasembled. Since the canopy is tall, you have to stand on your table under the frame to put up the canopy, or have a ladder.

However, \\"Martyrdom\\", along with several other cuts, arenot musical. These are absolutely hilarious, especially \\"String\\", \\"Bookshop\\" and \\"Bells\\". Aside from \\"All Things\\" I think the best musical numbers are \\"Never Be Rude To An Arab\\", \\"Chinese\\" and \\"Finland\\".

Georgia Blue, former government agent turned killer provides a special tension for Durant in this novel, and con man Maurice \\"Otherguy\\" Overby (It wasn't me - it must have been some otherguy who looked like me) brings his own just outside the law talents to bear.The plot seems a little extreme, even for Thomas whose plots can twist like you wouldn't believe, but he always seems to exaggerate a bit when he is dealing with either California and/or the entertainment industry. Still, the book moves at such a pace and the dialogue and one-liners come so thick and fast that one doesn't have time to fret about how likely some of the convolutions are.

Dark red writing on black is not so good for people like me who don't see well without reading glasses, I brought these weights because I currently have absolutely no space in my apartment so that's working out fine for me. I'm currently using these weights with a DVD training program and because they are using regular dumbbells I often fall behind while switching weights but, I find as I get used to them, I am getting a little quicker on the dials and hitting the pause button less often.I haven't tried anything else other than these so I can't at the moment compare with anything else. If you are about to buy these here are answers to questions I had.1. Yes they do come in pairs (two each)2. They both came in one box which is pretty heavy so you may need help or if you open the box each set is secured separately with safety strapsPS handle with care, do not drop these weights."},{"rating":"2","title":"great deal for money !","review":"the 552 dumbbells are great. compact which is wonderful beacause of my limited space. also i've heard some say that the stand was hard to put together and the wheels were flimsy, dont belive it its great. if you buy these dummbells spend the little extra and get the stand, you'll be glad you did. in my opinion these are the best piece of fitness equipment you can buy. i hope this helped you in you're decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful - they break very easily","review":"I was happy with these at first. Then I dropped one of the barbells a short distance (about 2 feet) while working out and one of the plastic pieces that hold one of the plates broke.

Bowflex should use stronger materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give 0 stars","review":"I was excited to receive these, but within 6 months they were not working well. They do not always pick up all the weights that I adjust them for and occasionally some of the weights slip out after I pick them up. These have been a complete disappointment. I understand, from a personal trainer friend, that the only benefit of these is the brand name - there are a couple of non-Bowflex products that are very similar, cost less and perform better. My discussions with Bowflex for customer service have been completely unproductive.

Unlike other fitness equipment that I have purchased, my Bowflex SelectTech 552 Dumbbells are not just expensive paperweights collecting dust. I have a schedule that I have been sticking too and have been getting the desired results. I always wanted to have free weight but never had the room to store a rack of dumbbells or the patients to switch plates during exercises. The Bowflex SelectTech 552 Dumbbells are so easy to use and have a great range of weight. I can go from chest to shoulders to back with no problem. They can sometime be a little unwieldy due to the length of the bar but this is easy to adjust to and a small price to pay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good...","review":"As with most reviews, there are already tons of folks on here that have broken this item down peice by piece in their reviews. To save time, I'll just say that this is a good set of dumbbells. You can do all your curling and chest fly's etc. with these bad boys. Perfect if you can't get to the gym and want to avoid that \\"weak\\" feeling you get after you miss a couple days of gym time. My only complaint is that I out grew them, and now I can only use the 52.5 pound waits for toning, but then again I'm a power lifter, so I guess out-growing them is a good thing. All in all a good product, just wish they made bigger sets for the same price lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bowflex will not back these","review":"After only a year of normal use, the weights will fall off. the chintzy plastic pins that should be keeping the dials from turning wore out and the weights fell on my wife's toe while she was using them.

You can store all of this in a milk crate that takes up the same amount of space as the SelecTechs and weighs the same amount. The whole thing will cost you under $[...].If you are willing to pay $[...] to avoid having to change plate weights a few times per workout, then there's no hope for you anyway.

My only concern is when I do certain lifts and the dumbells rub against my body because they are so wide. Good quality and very durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works Great for about 4 months","review":"This is a good product for about 4 months until it falls apart. Everyone i know who has this says the same thing. Your better off just buying dumbells, this product is nice because all in one, but its fairly dangerous. Many times the weights have come apart while ive been lifting. They feel cheap and clunky. However for an all in one weightlifting device its decent. Major improvements need to be made to make it safer though or they will be seeing some law suits in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I got these just a week ago. The dumbells are well designed and constructed. The handles are firm. When lifted, the weight plates are tightly locked in place. Very space efficient and user friendly (the weight dial makes it really quick to change weights).However there are 2 cons:1. Due to its mechanic, the Selectech are significantly larger than normal dumbells. They might be difficult to manuver in some exercises. I advise trying them out at local stores before making your decisions.2. The price. Although the materials used and the product itself are flawless, there's no way this thing costs $400. In the first week, everytime you stare at them sitting on your floor, you might feel stupid for spending $400 on a pair of dumbells. But as you use them more and more that thought goes away. Instead you will feel that you have made the right decision.I also ordered the Bowflex 3.1 bench to work with these dumbells."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best exercise equipment I have ever purchased","review":"While I hesitated to spend so much, the decision was the right one. Great at home for small spaces and so easy to use. You can tell they are finely manufactured and good quality as soon as you begin using. The best part is that my wife loves them as well and uses them regularly so I am not keeping so many individual weights around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engenius Design - No Regrets - Love it!!!!","review":"Not only can you select any weight you want with the turn of a dial, but the dumbell grips are the most comfortable I've ever held. My hands never hurt, and I never lose grip. And for all the weight settings that you get, the space they take up are extremely minimal. When I rec'd my dumbells, I could clearly see how durable they are, and how engenius the design really is. I truly LOVE these dumbells!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boflex Dumbbells","review":"These weights are easy to use and a great addition to a workout room.

There are still some lovely views and scenery but the scope is lost, and even White Fang himself has a diminished presence and function.Overall White Fang 2 feels and looks a lot like a Disney Channel TV and not like a theatrical movie.

She apparantly sang it to Paul Stanley of KISS because Paul had written a song about her called 'Heart of Stone' which appeared on the KISS album 'Revenge'.I think Miss Fox was scraping the bottom of the barrel for material on this album.

Of course, I check it out and read it. I especially was drawn to the chapter on action films and Burt's point that while the films cannibalize others, no one in the films ever eats; the characters are anorexic. The book is full of similarly wonderful insights. I am a cinephile, and very much appreciated Burt's quite hip approach to ShaXXXspeare.

For example:- Lex Luthor is a buffoon.- Mercy is a brainless twit.- Braniac is a laughing witless maniac.I really wish I'd looked at the reviews here before watching this (let along buying it).

At one point in the movie, Brainiac boasts that he has brawn as well as brains, but this movie is mostly a string of boring action scenes separated by and interwoven with insipid and ridiculous dialog. Powers Booth's depiction of Lex Luthor made ME sad, to paraphrase the character. There are moments that are reminiscent of the series, especially with Lois and Clark, but as a whole the movie feels like a rejected episode from the series that was padded into feature length. It is literally laughably bad; I guffawed when Superman kissed Lois and resuscitated her a la Sleeping Beauty.Save your money and time - don't buy or rent this movie or bother watching it even if it's free."},{"rating":"1","title":"brainiac attacks... my wallet for $15!!!","review":"as usual, great action & superman is the man. but, luthor is way too goofy compared to the series & brainiac actually has emotions, which takes away from his appealing detachment. probably why lex or brainy's voices had to be recasted.

STAS was one of the best animated shows around. This garbage is insulting to think of it as being related in any way whatsoever to STAS.Warner Brothers, the production company, the animators, and the horrible writers should be ashamed to put their names on this.

I liked it even better than the TV series' pilot and just as much as the 1978 Christopher Reeve Superman film.Let me get the bad points over with first. Lex Luther is way to comical. In the series he was protrayed as a serious villain, but in this one he's like the comic relief charater. Fortunately, the rest of the film saves it. The film was action-packed, the action scenes are really epic and well done, the film has a great story, and we have a lot of great and dramatic charater moments in this one. Like Clark's/Superman's relationship with Lois and how he sacrifices everything in order to save her when Brainiac almost kills her. I actually found it to be one of the most epic, dramatic, and best animated Superman I have ever seen. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to standard","review":"This is very much a child's dvd. It has nothing to do with previous Warner Animation series starring Superman.

It was really bad.Don't waste your money on this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superman: A bad movie in search of quick cash!","review":"If you are fan of the animated Superman this isn't for you. I hated how they turned Lex Luthor into an idiot and the animation was worst than the last season of Justice League Unlimited. This story didn't fit into the continuity of any of the Superman or Justice League worlds and it really was horrible to watch. I got to see this for free on Cartoon Networks and thank God, it saved me a from buying this sight unseen. Wow!!! WB is really trying to destroy one of their francises for some quick cash.

It had no real storyline at all. They also stab fans of superman by teasing them with a romantic relationship of Lois and Clark/Superman. But guess what it doesn't happen and they go no where. After being married in comices over 10 years they get it right on animated side.Characters: God Awful. They totally blew with Lex Luthor with terrible voice acting and lines. Other than Superman and Lois, the rest of the cast were totally cheezy.Animation: Almost like the series but pretty bad in certain parts of the movie.Redeeming factor: NoneIt is worth watching even on a rental: Nope.

The loss of Clancy for Lex Luthor was bad enough, but to make him a campy comic relief that's not worthy of a 6 year old's sense of humor adds insult to injury. DO NOT BUY THIS! I wouldn't even rent it. If Curt Geda has any sense at all, he'd drop this new line/direction they're trying to take Superman Animated and stick with what worked. They haven't targeted a fickle kid audience, so give up on the changes and for the love of god, look back at what you've done and at least bring back the theme music used before!!!!

I've followed the previous animated series over the years and enjoyed the rich continuity developed within them. This animated movie fairly ignores previous continuity and creates a whole new reality of its own. I'll agree with many other reviewers about the negatives on this movie, so I'll say simply this. Before you buy this movie (even to get the free movie pass), rent it and decide for yourself. I spent the full price and was very disappointed. See what you think for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A glorified episode, and not a good one at that.","review":"Brainiac Attacks is all about the fight scenes. You'd expect this from a movie with Attacks in the title, but really, a lot of really ridiculous fighting. Brainiac arrives on Earth, fights Superman, Lex Luthor gets involved, and... That's pretty much it. There's one or two emotional moments where Lois is poisoned and Superman has to travel to the Phantom Zone to harvest a cure. But even this interesting subplot fails to meet its potential. Brainiac basically follows the \\"Power Rangers\\" formula where near the end he adds on pieces until he's just a massive tank-thing. Not quite the intelligent Brainiac I'm used to seeing. Oh yeah, and the thrilling dialog like Lex Luthor saying \\"Super Duper Man\\". Okay, setting my harsh feelings aside, it's probably worth seeing once and a fun (but disappointing) watch if you liked the Superman Animated Series."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST DC ANIMATED MOVIE EVER","review":"This is for sure the WORST DC animated movie ever released. How can they take the designs from Superman The Animated Series to make this movie is a complete lack of respect for that animated series. This movie is not worth it in any sense at all. The voices, the acting, the plot, the fights. The list could go on and on. This movie was made to get more cash because Superman returns. Thats the ONLY reason they would dare to produce this pile of crap. What a letdown. After so much years waiting for a Superman Animated movie they come up with this. Dont spend your money on this, it doesnt deserve it AT ALL. Get Superman The Animated Series Volumes 1, 2 or 3 instead.

I agree with pretty much everything already stated in regards to complaints about the movie.

No wait, I'm glad!\\" Ugh!), but nothing ever came of it.However, I would like to add that my six-year-old son grew bored with the movie after about 15 minutes.

This movie was an absolutely disgrace to any of Bruce Tims previous works that feature Superman. I don't believe he had anything to do this production(I hope). The animation was bad, the plot was targeted at three year old children, and the character of Lex Luthor was goofy and his voice had been replaced by the Gorrila Groad's voice for some reason.

A Phantom Zone sub plot. And of course Brainiac wanting to take over Earth, while Superman is in the Phantom Zone...did you get all that? If you did, you are at the head of the learning curve...Now try to watch it in a cartoon version...NOT A GOOD THINGThe animation is standard TV animation, so it is not that special or worthy of a made for DVD presentation.

They don't even use the theme song. Luthor, Brainiac, Mercy, and (I think) Perry have had voice replacements, and lousy ones. Luthor is a (badly animated) buffoon.

Could it be she was considered intractable and was thrown out of this unnamed Community, and now has a \\"beef\\" with the entire Roman Church? At any rate, the book is well researched, and typically expounds the usual Fundamentalist attitudes towards the Roman Church. If one is a raging anti-Catholic, you will find all of your stereotypes met, and can say to yourself, \\"I knew it all along.\\" For Roman Catholics, it may cause you to think and do some research on your own beliefs, and that of your Church. If it does that much, perhaps the book has acheived its purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Catholic Undertow","review":"I have found this book to very unrepresentative of the Catholic Church. Mary Ann Collins facts are skewed to convincing others that the Roman Catholic faith is not to be believed or trusted. I would suggest that anyone interested in reading this book, also go to solid Catholic sources and to double check her support for her 'facts'. The Catholic Church is based solidly on scripture and tradition. Study the history of the CC beginning with the Apostles, and 1st and 2nd century Church Fathers to better understand the Catholic faith. Clement of Rome and Ignatius of Antioch, who learned from the Apostle John, are an excellent place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another bitter diatribe","review":"No one has ever actually seen Mary Ann Collins in person and there are questions as to whether she actually exists. If you remember Maria Monk, it to was ghost written. I myself am a former fundamentalist preacher who is now a Catholic priest. How did that happen? I actually bothered to get the facts and discovered I had been misled by books like this. If you want to know the truth go to the source...the Catholic Church."},{"rating":"2","title":"a beautifully realized short novel","review":"This is a beautifully realized account of a day in the life of a small town in eastern Poland in the early 1930s. Szewc has an eye like that of Proust. Details are lovingly recorded, all in an effort to preserve the day-to-day--a day-to-day that will be destroyed, one might add, during the Holocaust. The book is also beautifully translated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful failure","review":"The intent of this beautifully written, poetic book is to capture a day in the life of a village. While there is wonderful use of symbolism, the book ultimately fails on two counts. First, there is no reason for the selection of whose lives to follow through the day. Second, the narrator vasillated between omniscient (even knowing dreams and memories) to limited only is visible. When limited, the narrator engages in speculation and philosophic reflection.This has an author worth watching, but as a novel it is an interesting, beautiful failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad piece of journalism","review":"It is sad to think that so much time and energy is put into attacking a group of people for thier belief structure. It is even sadder to twist thier own words to put them in a bad light. Mr. Jones claims to simply quote the Catechism of the Catholic Church and the Bible. He is correct in that but more often than not the quotes are partial quotes that do not even give a glimmer as to the theology being discussed. If you do read this book then be sure to check all references and really seek, with an honest heart, to understand. So much of what Mr. Jones makes out to be Catholic belief is misconstrued and presented wrongly. Some of his chapters even stab himself in the foot. This book is not good for a person who is genuenly searching for good and honest information. If you want to know about Catholicism then read a Catholic author. Good Luck and Blessings to you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Unfactual -- Poorly Researched!","review":"I am trying to be honest in saying that this is one of the worst, most poorly presented, poorly researched books I have ever read. It is riddled with so many grave errors, one wonders if this gentleman has ever researched Catholicism at all. The misconceptions and the misunderstandings that the author has is off the charts.If one wants to find out about the real Catholic Church, they will never do so from this book, not even close. They will only receive the many misconceptions and misunderstandings that Mr. Jones himself has apparently received.I have read many anti-Catholic books... this is one of the worst. Unfortunately, it is full of errors from cover to cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the best Fundamentalists can do?","review":"As a soon-to-be Catholic, I need to see if Catholic beliefs can withstand all sorts of \\"Biblical\\" attacks.Firstly, this book presents nothing new. It just repeats the same rhetoric Protestants have been using for 500 years. This book also does not respond to the Catholic counter-arguments and defenses. Why? Because it can't.All it does is state a Catholic doctrine, then patch together a few out-of context verses to try to disprove it. It also is full of false assumptions, like;*The Bible says you are saved by faith. Therefore you are saved by faith ALONE.It tries to give Catholics more reasons not to believe something rather than take away the reasons they do believe in it. I don't have room in this review to defend every doctrine, because that would be 37 examples. This book is either horribly written or Protestantism just has a really weak foundation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fallacies galore!","review":"This is a well researched book with plenty of cross-references. However, there are plenty of inuendos, fallacies, and questionable conclusions that the author said there wouldn't be any so that readers can make their own conclusions. The author broke his own word and went so far as loosely interpret some of the biblical passages he is quoting. This is rather offensive to a Christian. Although I read this book cover to cover, this was a total and unfortunate waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The very best book ever exposing false Catholic teaching","review":"This book is so good I don't know where to start. It exposes all the false teachings of Roman Catholicism simply by presenting scripture alone.The book even cites the Roman Catholic Catechism to show precisely what the RCC really believes on each topic, so there is no mistake in quoting their actual beliefs. This a great witnessesing tool, where you can easily turn to a particular section and find what you need in minutes.It gets right to the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK AND TRASH, HATRED.","review":"This book is absolutely horrible scholarship. Get real.If you want a TRUE source of true and solid teaching....goto the teachings of the Church and not some horrible and trash,wasted writing that is present in this anti-Catholic book.I'd recommend \\"Rome Sweet Home\\" by Dr. Scott Hahn. \\"Upon this Rock\\" by Peter Kreeft. If you want solid books these two I'd recommend.Not this book. This book is false and it lies.

Very effective without being mean spirited."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible, a blatant lie","review":"I was a convert from Roman Catholicism to a bible based, born again church. I fell for the lies about my faith for about two years. I decided to study the Catholic faith so that I could be a good witness to these folks. Reading this book along side the Catechism of the Catholic Church and the bible has converted me back to the Roman Catholic Church. I will not live a lie. The truth is not a somewhat or a something, but a person. And that person is Jesus Christ and His body is the Catholic Church.2 Corinthians 11:13-15 says: For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. So it is not strange if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.Outside of the Catholic Church this is what your dealing with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seek and you shall find!","review":"This book is a great blessing. As a former Catholic who never even considered leaving the Roman Catholic \\"Church\\" this is a real eye-opener. The book methodically details the difference between God's Word, The Bible, and the TRADITIONS OF MEN, the Catechism.If you no longer want to be brainwashed and realize the bondage you are in when it comes to the Catholic religion, read this book. God Loves you! That's the Good News. The question is, do you know Jesus?Jesus says, \\"I am the way, the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\\"READ: He did not say through RELIGION, nor did He say THROUGH MY 'CHURCH', nor did He say THROUGH MY SACRAMENTS.Trust Jesus, and Him alone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it was...........interesting","review":"After reading this book and reading the reviews I have come to the conclustion that everyone should read something else. It added nothing to my understanding of Roman Catholicism. I'm a devout Catholic who has studied my faith and the scriptural basis for it, and the reasoning behind it. As a result, I am more devout, closer to God, and love being Catholic even more. I urge everyone who wants to discover truth to study christian history. Read the ancient church fathers who came right after the apostles. They know Jesus' doctrine better than anyone. Research for yourself, don't let me, Rick Jones, or anyone else tell you what to believe, but faithfully find out what Jesus taught as best you can by READING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rick Jones should have done his homework.","review":"This book doesn't even deserve ONE star, but I couldn't post this without choosing at least one.Rick Jones should have done his homework.This book is neither factual nor historical, but full of fabrications.He presents what he THINKS the Catholic Church is, rather than what it truly is, making him look like a most unscholarly, biased anti-Catholic.The book convinced me of nothing--and instead it made me want to look deeper into Catholicism.At least the Catholics I know have a better (and solid) defense of their faith.From indulgences to the \\"worship\\" of Mary and papal infallibility, Rick can't accurately talk against the Church because he doesn't even understand what it teaches. He proved that in his book."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Misunderstanding","review":"This whole book is one big misunderstanding.

But no, they're too busy with putting us down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misunderstanding Roman Catholicism","review":"Nice cover! That is about the best thing that can be said about this book. It takes selected quotes from the Catechism of the Catholic Church out of context then applies Biblical verses inappropriately. Don't bother wasting your $10 on this book, or even printing out the on-line version. If you really want to try to understand Catholics, try some good books by Catholic authors, or spend the $10 on the Catechism of the Catholic Church. If you are looking for a \\"good\\" anti-Catholic book, don't bother with this one - Rick Jones doesn't even try to understand anything except his own rantings!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Anti-Catholic trash written by a Protestant.","review":"This Anti-Catholic trash is written by an Anti-Catholic Protestant and is totally false!

I should have saved my time by just watching the movie. Pete's character was the most entertaining part of the book. His thoughts were realistic which made it funny. The ending made me want to retch.

Music is the best therapy, and Alabama 3 (A3) certainly brings this home. Whenever I feel like I'm sick and just don't want to do anything, I'll throw on A3 to help soften the state. A3's silly approach to religious and political satire feels just right in a world that takes itsself too seriously, throwing in a dash of wild partying. The energy that comes through in the music is truly uplifting and soothing. The mock-gospel aspects of it give it that gospel feel (which to me has always been a wholesome feel) while the intellectual hooks and well-written lyrics provide a thought-provoking experience. \\"Don't you wish you didn't function, don't you wish you didn't think, beyond your next paycheck and your next little drink, well you do, so make up your mind to go on, cause when you woke up this morning, everything you had was gone.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Toxic County","review":"An album that really rocks, replete with whacky soundbite collages midst its country/gospel, three-course meal. The drug references are delivered with such aplomb I thought, at times, of the cool despatch of Velvet Underground.

A friend had seen this mob at the Colony Room, in London last year(Francis Bacon's old hang-out) & recommended them; a great setting for this sort of music, I would think.

Oh, my gosh, it has been a nightmare from day one --- water all over cabinet every morning, it takes two hands to push the button and pour the coffee, and most important, the coffee is horrid!!!! I don't claim to be a coffee expert, but when the coffee is lukewarm after putting creamer in and there is absolutely no way to get a decent cup of coffee from this machine. I have tried everything, even putting it on the strong setting hoping that the water may heat up more. No luck!!! I don't have the problem like some of the other reviewers, with the overflow of coffee onto the cabinet, but we usually have coffee grounds in the bottom of the caraffe.

For the first 3-4 days it was fine. Then the \\"clean\\" light came on. Then it would just stop brewing in the middle of the pot for no reason. Now it just shuts off after less than a minute, despite having brewed NO coffee at all. I actually made coffee this morning by pouring hot water from the tea kettle into the top. I'm pretty sure this isn't how it was supposed to work. And the coffee isn't really hot on the rare occasion that this piece of trash brews a little coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 days after purchase...","review":"Alright, my glass caraffe coffee maker broke. I decided I wanted something not breakable. I stood in the aisle of the store comparing different brands for almost an hour and decided this was the one for me. 4 days after I bought it, it malfunctioned. It would not brew more than 2 cups at a time, and for some reason it was over heating so bad that the steam rising up ruined the clock. Now I can't set it at night to brew in the morning. It's useless to me, and a waste of amlost $60 hard earned American Dollars. Mr. Coffee needs to not make anything any more. This was my 2nd Mr. Coffee, and my first was a cappuccinno/coffee maker and the burner plate crackled and popped then shot sparks across the kitchen and would no longer heat. Another malfunction that could have started a fire if I had not been there baby sitting it because it leaked really bad to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let the looks fool you! It should rate 0 stars!","review":"Yes, it looks cool, but it's disfunctional junk!Lucky for me I don't have the leaking problem most people have.The problem I have is that it steams so much that you loose almost 50% of the water you pour in!I'll pour in all 10 cups of fresh water, and after the 900 watt element has over-steamed the water, I'll be lucky if I get 5 cups!Then, those 5 cups are too strong! I then have to add fresh water to the coffee!!Most of the steam comes out where the coffee exits, then goes up into that pretty green LCD display! The display turns black until it dries out. After so many brewings, the display is starting to form dark spots. I don't expect the display to last too much longer.Save yourself a headache and don't buy this thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This!","review":"I can't imagine that the people at Mr. Coffee tested this product before they put it on the market. Somehow, the coffee gets backed up into the strainer, floods the whole machine, and leaks out of the bottom all over the counter! I didn't even realize this was happening until about 2 weeks after I started using it, at which point I picked up the coffee maker to get to some crumbs and found days old coffee sludge and mold! Gross! The carafe is poorly designed too. The coffee doesn't flow into it when it brews, and a lot runs down the side. It also has to be tipped practically upside down to pour the coffee, unless you take the push-button lid off. This is the worst coffee maker I have ever owned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Counter top full of coffee!!!!","review":"After the fourth time cleaning coffee off my countertop and floor, I've had it. This coffeemaker will be returned. The only time I used the timer (had to get a real early start one morning) I ended up with four cups of coffee on my countertop, floor and rug. The rug is now stained since I didn't have time to clean it before rushing out the door (late). Didn't even have a morning cup of coffee. Believe all of these bad reviews. The coffee is lukewarm when brewed and even cooler from the carafe, since it uses it's own heat to stay hot, and there is no heat to keep it hot. The two hour cut off is a joke. There is no heat coming from the burner to cut off. I wanted an insulated carafe so I would have hot coffee in the carafe longer. My microwave has been used more with this model than the others I've had in the past. I think Mr. Coffee spent their R&D budget on the looks and none on the functionality of this machine. BEWARE!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice but thats all","review":"We have exactly the same problem as a previous reviewer - steam. Its unbelievable. Its supposed to be a 10 cup coffee maker but you are lucky if you get 2 cups. The steam is so bad that it has also somehow damaged the clock face so that we can only see the time at certain times of the day. We have cleaned it as per instructions but it makes no difference whatsoever. We only bought it last month and we arent even using it anymore. I have had really cheap coffee makers that lasted years.

I would have to turn it off, wait a minute or two and turn it back on to finish brewing.After calling Mr.Coffee, they suggested that I put the pot through the 'clean' cycle. I did, it brewed great for about 4 days.So, along comes one paticular Saturday morning, my son's birthday party...lots of kids (15) and I have to make pancakes! WHAT! NO coffee!!

It's a disappointment, and I plan to return it to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked all over the kitchen.","review":"I have to agree with another review I read about this machine. Mine brewed 3 times perfectly, then would leak the next batch. There is an extra feature on this model which allows you to pour while it is still brewing, but the mechanism that allows this does not always funtion properly, causing the water to back up inside the unit instead of flowing into the carafe; it eventually finds a way out and ends up on your counter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with this machine","review":"Christmas morning and the slow, ongoing leak, which we worked around over the last year, finally gave way and voila! hot coffee and water and grounds all over the counter and floors. And yes, we clean our coffeemaker daily, and yes, we know how to properly run the thing too. (We gave up on the water filter soon after purchase--it kept falling into the coffee grounds.) Why the two stars? We wanted to love this machine! We wanted it to work! It is a handsome machine with a handsome pedigree (a Mr. Coffee!). The clock is nice. The thermal carafe is lovely. Until the BIG LEAK, we made do with its daily dribble and sputter. But really, after examining the unit carefully before its trip to the trash can, we realized how foolish we were in keeping this fire hazard going as long as we did. That's why I've bothered to write this review. It is not an inexpensive machine; the quality isn't there. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't had any problems with this coffee maker!!!","review":"I disagree with the other reviews! Have had this coffee maker for awhile and actually love it. Have had other more expensive coffee makers and this one is one of my favorites. Use both grocery store coffee beans and high end coffee beans...all turn out great! Did have to figure out the right balance of coffee grinds to add when using the \\"strong\\" setting.

The reviews are exact when they say you have to rinse the thermal carafe out with hot, hot water if you want hot coffee. There is no warming plate on this model and if you are expecting your coffee to stay hot for more than 20 minutes then I suggest not buying this product. You are forced to \\"re-heat\\" the coffee and once you do that you lose the flavor. It looks pretty on the counter, but that's about all it's worth. I am now looking into purchasing a Braun with a glass decanter (the thermals are all getting the same reviews regardless of the maker)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE!","review":"I didn't buy this coffee pot from Amazon, I actually bought it from Wal-Mart. I am currently trying to negotiate an exchange with Mr. Coffee directly since I lost my Wal-Mart receipt and could not return it for a refund. This coffee pot never worked correctly, ever. I've cleaned up several massive floods from it, and the coffee has stained my kitchen counter tops (ARGH!) and it ran down my white cupboards staining them as well. Please, no matter how cheap the price may be, please don't buy it, it's just not worth it.

I thought something was wrong with just mine but most people have the same issues........leaks. Couldn't really ever figure out if it was one leak or two but keeping a towel under the coffee maker is just too much of a mess. Also, I agree with the person who wrote about having to pull the coffee maker out from under the the cabinet to pour water in. Too much drama. Oh well, Mr. Coffee, it seemed like a good idea at the time I guess. Very sad that it didn't work out."},{"rating":"1","title":"............................The damn thing yells at you! ................................","review":"1. The black ink that describes the tiny buttons have poor contrast against the chrome.2. You have to pull it away from the counter to pour in the water.3. It has a beeper that disturbs the whole house. Did they think we welcome yet another annoyance from an appliance that reprimands us that it has some function to fulfill?4. The buttons have poor tactile response.

But my customer service experience on complaining about it was the best I've received from any company in years.

It would work ok for a while, but then it would proceed to flood my kitchen with coffee pouring out of the bottom of the machine. This has happened on multiple occasions.

Luck of Lucien? Push It Along? Youthful Expressions? They had the mad jazz and hip-hop beats with the high treble and bumpin' bass, right? This CD was just tight.

So I listened with an open mind, as one should with any album by any artist, and I found myself pleasantly surprised. The older Mortiis albums were of a \\"god\\" showing himself and his world via his music, but now this \\"MortIIs: Era2\\" music is that very same \\"god\\" questioning his own existence - which I think is a very powerful thing. I'm not sure if that is what Mortiis had in mind, of course, but that is my personal view and it seems to make sense.

His approach is to let the chips fall where they will. He is courageous and straightforward.The chapter I found particularly insightful was the one on consumerism. In it he explains that the media create \\"needs\\" for \\"perpetual teenagers.\\" He contrasts this with maturity, i.e., self-control--which the media portrays negatively. He concludes that \\"consuming passion means self-destruction.\\" The media feeds the consumerism impulse.

I am not hard on equipment so believed this to be a manufacturers defect and called Olympus who stated they will fix it... for $150. Great... I'll get it fixed and then have it break again 18 months later? Not a real good deal. What I've got now is an expensive paperweight.

I added a 64MB memory card to my order, an extra battery, and a PC card adapter for use on my Powerbook. I am operating my Powerbook with OS X, so I didn't need to load in any software.

The battery life is excellent (and the battery, like the XD card, is tiny). The major drawback--even on a very bright, sunny day, it cannot take pictures indoors without a flash; without the flash, pictures are dark yellow and severely blurred--surprisingly, they were yellowed and blurred sometimes WITH the flash.

Beyond that their customer service manager, Vince was rude and sarcastic over the phone and made several degrading remarks during my call with him. I am elevating this up the Olympus management chain but I think people should know that this camera does not perform as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with the Service","review":"I had touble with the camera 2 months after I bought it. The camera just went dead one day. I was living overseas and the warranty didn't cover there (Beware!). I mailed it back to Olympus service center in CA. After 15 days I got the camera back, as good as new, just in time for Christmas. Now I love it! I carry it with me everywhere. Absolutely pleased with the quality of the pictures and ease of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many grainy/blurry pics","review":"This is our first digital camera and, if the lighting is good, the pictures come out beautiful. Unfortunately with children, we do not always have the opportunity to adjust the lighting to get a great picture. When this happens, the pics ALWAYS turn out grainy or blurry (and the flaw isn't noticable on the LCD screen. Only after you download or print is when you see it). It really is disappointing because we have taken many pictures that would have turned out great if not for this problem. My parents have a Canon Powershot (not positive on the model) and they never have this problem--always beautiful pictures. I would definitely suggest that anyone in the market for a digital camera look at a different brand, or at least a more recent model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Point and Shoot","review":"I have now owned this camera for about four years. I purchased it to take kayak fishing. I have taken over 10,000 photos with this camera. I use this came about 90% of the time taking construction job site photos. The camera is great. After four years the only problem is that the movable cover has gotten real loose and closes way to easy to the point of frustration. It costs about $90.00 to send it back to Olympus for repair so I just purchased a new Olympus Stylus 850 SW. This camera is a real step up from the 300. You can not go wrong with any Olympus point and shoot cameras. If you are a Sams Club member the 850 comes in kit for about $159.00. This is a real killer price. Better than what I paid for my 850 via Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"olympus stylus 300 review","review":"Product arrived in a timely manner. Price was OK.

The problem is the lens cover slider track.The metal track has just worn away just from opening and closing the lens cover.Now the lens cover will not stay on the camera causing the battery to die.This is a manufacturing defect"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for taking pictures!","review":"The picture quality on this camera is impressive. Even after three years and many bounces on concrete. I must have dropped this camera at least 10 times and the thing is solid as a rock. The picture quality is unbeleivable as well as many people look at the 3x5's and say, \\"this isn't a digital\\" The only reason I gave it less starts is because it doesn't have a built in date feature, or a built in microphone. The date feature is super convenient when you want to capture certain events."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute and Small, but not long-lasting","review":"I have had this camera for about a year and a half. The first six monthes I had it I loved it, its cute and takes really clear pictures, and is pretty easy to bring anywhere. After using it a few times a week for six monthes the slide cover stopped working, and I would have to try two or three times before it would open or close for me. I would recomend if you buy this camera to always carry it in a case, the images have started to become less and less clear, perhaps due to me not using one. I enjoyed the camera while it lasted, but I'd recommend going with a different brand if you're looking for a longlasting purchase. (but I guess for the price it's being offered at now is more reasonable.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine died too! This is a \\"use and throw\\" model","review":"I've had this camera since June 2003 and was so happy with my purchase... until, last week during my precious vacation, the camera died (exactly in the same manner as described previously by someone else) and I have to throw it out of the window (or pay $150 for the repair).I also did the blunder of recommending this camera to my friends(after 6 months of my purchase/use)... now I'm really regretting!!!!It was working perfectly until this happened, when both the green and orange lights started flashing simulatenously and the camera stopped responding. Replacing the battery(as per the manual) did not come to the rescue and I had to buy a \\"use and throw\\" camera for $10 that was far more reliable that this piece of junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"blurry indoor pictures","review":"I bought it cause I like the remote control mostly, but I took it back cause indoors it takes lousy pictures, especially close up. I tried the Canon G2 Camera, although a lot more money, that's the indoor image quality I expect for 400 bucks. I'd say, if you like this camera, buy it, try it, then pawn it on ebay, but I'd go for the Sony P72, which I also have now. That's quick and puts the nifty date on the pictures. Plus some sony tv's now have memory stick slots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Olympus = JUNK","review":"After having my camera for less than 6 months and taking numerous blurred pictures, the camera finally stopped working all together because it would no longer turn on when opening the sliding lense protector. After sending it back to olympus who wanted 150 bucks to fix it, fat chance!, i took it to a local camera guy who told me that this problem happens to this camera all of the time. And whats worse, olympus refuses to sell the part that is needed to fix it. Currently my camera guy is waiting for a junk olympus to come in (i'm sure it wont take too long) and he will extract the needed part. Problem is, that it will probably have the same problem as my camera! Until then, I wait and take no pictures. One thing is for sure though, I will NEVER EVER buy a product from Olympus, a company that treats its customers so badly and with such little respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't purchase","review":"Believe the reviews that the slider will break after time. The camera worked ok for about 2 years, but now the slider won't activate the lens. Very poor design. The camera also is horrible at night or with low light. The battery life is realy bad. Will only last for about an hour. Now I'm stuck with all the extra memory cards and batteries for an Olympus. Even so, I still won't purchase another Olympus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I am so disappointed in this camera. I loved the feel and ease of it. The battery life was great and all the pictures looked so good on the screen but when I downloaded them they were terrible. A few pictures were taken from a close distance in perfect lighting and they were great but any pictures that used the zoom or had lower lighting were extremenly grainy and poor. If I had gotten a cheap deal on this camera I would not be so dissappointed but I paid a little more thinking I was getting a better camera. Don't waste your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design and performance","review":"The camera takes reasonably good pictures when it works, however the basic design and construction make it unreliable. Olympus markets the Stylus as a tough camera suitable for outdoors however the operating design is poor. Notably the battery compartment is where your thumb holds the camera, frequently opening the battery door and interrupting operation of the camera. The power ON/OFF switch is under the sliding cover. It is very sensitive and failed within 9 month. Olympus did a poor job with this design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead after recharging...twice...beware","review":"I'm a photo amatuer, so I purchased the Olympus Stylus 300 based on its reported ease of use...and I have to say I was initially impressed by that and the quality of the pics. However, after about a month of use the camera would not power up after a recharge. It was completely dead, as I tested the unit with AC power. I exchanged for the exact same model, and the same dang thing happened with that one after about a month also. I returned the second one, and the technician at the store said that this was a common complaint...there appears to be a bug in the Stylus software...anyway, I exchanged it for the Canon Powershot S400 so goodbye Olympus"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pricey & not the best camera!","review":"Nice design and good looking. (Although not yet stylish as Canon Elph's.) Good battery life but the extra battery costs a lot. You can't put in AA batteries in this one.Average image quality indoors. Good outdoors. Slow to focus and has annoying shutter lag. No manual features and many photos need to be tweaked in photoshop. Video mode is junk.Uses propreitary xD cards, just another way for Fuji/Oly to rip off consumers. What was wrong with standard SD or CF cards? Imagine the chaos if every manufacturer used different memory cards.Back to the camera, its a good attempt by Olympus but still way behind Canon, Sony, Pentax, Nikon and Minolta. This camera has nothing special warrant this high price tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"good camera ; bad seller","review":"I own another camera just like it. The seller sent me a damaged camera and has refused to refund the cost. I would never buy anything form her again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for the slider switch...","review":"I love the security of knowing the camera is water resistant, and the battery life is so good I have hardly ever used the second battery I purchased.But... it has a big flaw, one in common with other Olympus products. If you hand the camera to someone to take a picture... 99 times out of 100... they will accidentially turn the camera off. The slide switch is annoying, overly sensitive, and very very fragile. If (or when) it breaks the repair charge is a minimum $125.Flash pictures are another issue... they always come out with wierd yellowish colors. Overall I'm just barely satisfied with this model, and very unhappy when compared to my prior (stolen) Canon PowerShot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Use, Reliable Results","review":"For the snapshot photographer, you'll get great results with this little guy. It's almost hard to take a bad picture with it. And, with a little care, you can take really great pictures.The cards are easy to use, and the camera can take some serious abuse and shrug it off. I'm very happy with it. I wish it was less expensive, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for day trips","review":"This is a great camera for day time use.

I've had mine about 3 monthes. This camera is very small and light - which is important for me, because I take it almost everywhere I go. It is also durable, and weatherproof. I've taken it out in the pouring rain, and taken pictures, and it's held up great. The 'night mode' setting is my favorite feature, and I wouldn't buy a camera without something like this. It keeps the shutter open until the camera feels it's gathered enough light (and it's almost always right) - meaning you can take pictures in near total darkness. This allows for some great shots that you wouldn't otherwise be able to get...of course, you have to hold the camera perfectly still while it's taking the shot (I ussually prop it up on a railing or something). Yeah, in conclusion - i's a great camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mysterious New England","review":"My sister had this book years ago and I found the stories in it fascinating.

His spaceship looks like a giant golf ball, and his major weirdness is that he often appears in negative form.

As a result, you get this antiquated, nearly illegible typeface with lots of blurs and marks that make it a headache for a modern reader.If you're looking for a reissue of an obsolete history of Belgian, this should appeal to you.

I think she does a lovely job narrating and instucting yoga. She's one of the few out there who can lead you through a pose while you're not looking at the screen. Sadly, this workout is just silly. If you want to work out with weights, don't do it with yoga poses... it is the antithesis of yoga, and it feels awful. Coming from someone (me) who works out with light weights, dances, and does pilates and yoga on a regular basis (changing it up daily to keep my body guessing, flexible and hopefully, fit) I found this workout nonsensical, and, sorry Sara, stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quick Yoga Workout","review":"I am so excited about Sara's 20 Min.Yoga Makeovers!

Because it is such a well-rounded, quick program, I know I can get through it even before I start. This is what keeps me popping in the dvd each morning and evening. The yoga poses are manageable for even the very beginner! I only wish I lived in Santa Monica where she teaches classes...good thing I have the tapes! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and functional!","review":"The purse is large enough for my license, debit card, cash, keys AND my small digital camera, with room to spare for face powder and lipstick. The fact that there's already a mirror in the purse is a plus as the mirror is larger than most compacts. The purse isn't 'pretty' - it reminds me of a guitar case. But I wanted a coffin purse for a Goth function I'm going to and I like functional purses. I'm not one of those types that gives their date a billion things to hold for them. My only concern is that there is one latch to close the purse and it doesn't look very sturdy.

I thought the reviews where they talk about the mirror falling out were probably just random occurrences and that I would most likely not have a problem. Well, it arrived today and I have the very same problem. The outside is adorable but the inside is held in place with cheap double stick tape. The tape did not hold and the entire side with the mirror is separated and out as well as the mirror itself. I do not understand what the manufacturers are thinking, use some darn glue! I am not the first to report this problem, it is not like they are unaware.So, off I go to find some glue and fix it.If you are not prepared to fix it yourself do not buy this purse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nice","review":"Product is not as nice as the picture makes it look.

I think that the adolescents where one of the better punk bands for the time they where around aswell and where better than the descendents in my opinion, i liked the style in which they played it was as if they just got up recorded an album and just came out with the lyrics and the music off the top of there heads."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Colossal Waste of Time","review":"This book is mostly a rehash of Tom Hopkins' past work.

The needle would just stay in this one groove until you lifted the phono arm off the vinyl. With the obvious limitations of cd, this locked groove is exactly replicated in sound and lasts longer than it would take to finally notice it on the original vinyl. This, combined with the marvelous sound quality of the remastering, makes the cd easily superior to the vinyl version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noise! Noise!

Lou Reed trying to experiment with layered sounds and feed back or b.) getting back at the studio for making him release a certain amount of albums in a short time span.

Some of it's clever, the noise bounces around the speakers (don't try to listen to this with headphones 'cause you get a major headache).

This album is legendary among people who are fans of bad records. It is so bad Lou Reed himself reportedly never heard the album all the way through! It's easy to understand why. The entire record is a chaotic mess of squeaks, squawks, drones, and every other sound effect imaginable to drive you to the medicine chest for a Tylenol. Even I had to stop listening to this water torture after 11 minutes (out of about 64 minutes).Most of the world's bad albums, including the Shagg's album THE SHAGGS and William Shatner's THE TRANSFORMED MAN, are very listenable and are so bad they are good. This is not the case here. Reed apparently set out to make a terrible record, but this one is simply has no redeeming value whatsoever.

However as a piece of music, MMM just doesn't hold up. If I compare MMM to other challenging (unusual) pieces of music (John Coltrane's Ascension, Anything by Cecil Taylor, Lemonte Young's Well Tuned Piano, Capt. Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica....), MMM just doesn't have the depth that these other pieces have. With that said, as a Velvet and Lou Reed fan I sought out a copy of MMM on vinyl in my youth, and do not regret shelling out the $$ for it. It does clear out the room faster than shouting \\"Cops at the door!\\". I even digitized the vinyl, and tagged it as \\"Noise\\" genre (along with Yoko Ono).If you really need to hear/experience MMM, I recommend purchasing the \\"Between Thought and Expression\\" CD which has a small 3 minute or so excerpt from MMM along with a reasonable collection of Lou Reed tracks from 70s and 80s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the LP - NOT the CD!!","review":"The greatest thing about this album is that it was meant to play FOREVER. On the LP, the final groove on side-4 was an unbroken loop, allowing the turntable to play and play and play and play...It is not a Rock record. It has no songs, no melodies and no words. It is 100% pure feedback. It is only meant to be listened to by rock critics and prententious \\"fans\\" of avant-garde music. Actually, this is about as close to LaMonte Young as Lou ever got. Or perhaps...it is the closest to John Cale that Lou ever got!!!This should NEVER have been issued on CD because it simply was never meant to be (all LP sides are the exact same length, not including the \\"never-ending\\" 4th side), so my suggestion to you is to get this thing on vinyl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not music, literally just noise","review":"I guess I don't do enough hard drugs to make sense of this thing, so I'll just put it straight. It is literally feedback (squeaks and scratches) being recorded using amps and a guitar or two. There is no music-just noise. Some people say this is groundbreaking and genius. I say it is crap. I know the story (basically a f u to the record company) and I get it as a joke-I even think it is clever. But to buy this album and put it on proves that the customer is the real idiot here. What makes me laugh even harder is that he just reissued this album not too long ago-meaning that some moron is willing to buy and listen to this more than once! If you are considering a purchase of this album, do yourself a favor. Lock yourself in your bedroom, then punch yourself in the we!ner.

In some ways I think he had more than a little Andy Warhol in him; cranking out so many albums with worthless tracks, almost tempting his audience to reject him while still reaping the monetary benefits from the music industry.This was Reed's best attempt at alienating everyone, with a double-album of harsh feedback, though it often sounds like a transistor radio that was deliberately set between two stations. Even at its initial release the debate was furious on whether it was Reed at his most creative genius - bringing avant-garde to a bigger audience - or if it was a joke and a means to get out of a bad record contract.I feel it was the latter and still wonder why the project retains a number of fans. Reed stopped laughing years ago and certainly can only shake his head in amazement that some people still don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"And the little boy said, \\"But the emperor has no clothes!\\"","review":"I wouldn't recommend buying this CD unless you have first listened to it. It consists of feedback, screeching, and rumblings. The recording is boring and monotonous. It is the recorded equivalent on running fingernails down a chalkboard or chewing tinfoil. What amazes me is that people take this recording seriously. Some see it as the starting point for the genre known as industrial music. Look, if you want to listen to bad music, that's fine. Just don't assume that there is anything close to fine artistry in this recording.

But If Yoko Ono's name was on this CD instead, it would get the review it deserves. Two Virgins, the Wedding Album and Metal Machine Music make good coasters, and it's cool when your record company thinks you're so brilliant that you can be completely indulgent.

He then asked me where my line was, and I replied \\"Metal Machine Music\\". This is not music, this is noise. Is it impressive that Lou Reed got this released? Yes. Is it a bold statement of his artistic beliefs? I guess. Is it music? No. Is it worth listening to? Certainly not! It has no melody, no rhythem, and nothing to make it worth a listen.

However, here comes my two main reasons why you should never even consider to buy it:1. It has no substance. The painting by Jackson Pollock and music by John Cage most definately has a substance to it. MMM hasn't, for one simple reason: Lou Reed is a songwriter, not a composer. He never had the skill to carry out a project as this.2. The CD format. As the music has no substance, the nature of the double vinyl album was of essential importance. As one small, convenient compact disc, the album simply isn't the same, as a lot of its conceptual value is lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"A useless record that isn't worth two cents","review":"If there is a record out there that deserves 0 stars, this would be it.

The characters in the book permit the reader to relate to the type of everyday life that goes on. Though the book seems to be several broken events placed together, upon finishing it we are able to witness the great symphony of literature that Garcia Marquez composed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an enjoyable book that I would read again.","review":"This is a well written book that grabs you in the beginning and is even better in the end. The plot is masterfully interwoven and keeps you reading. The only downfall is that it is difficult to relate to any of the characters because of the magic realism. This made the reading a little slow in a few parts, but on the whole it was a great book. The family is stuck in a town isolated from the rest of civilization. It is interesting to see the progression of Macondo and the affect it has the the citizens there. It is ironic that even though the the characters are part of a huge family, they are all lonely. The end of the book is the best part that puts the whole story into perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Low Quality","review":"I didn't expect really sturdy or exceptionally well-made paper umbrellas. I bought a whole gross (144) because I knew there'd be several unusable ones or they'd break. I didn't have terribly high expectations, honestly.That said, I'm very disappointed in what I got. The little plastic stays to keep the umbrellas open don't work on half of them. Some of them didn't even have the little plastic stays. I got ONE blue one in the entire gross. Definitely not a very good assortment of colors. Speaking of color, many of them weren't even completely colored and had white patches at the edges. I was very frustrated with this low quality product which ruined the project I'd bought them for."},{"rating":"2","title":"great if having a parties","review":"The cocktail umbrellas are nice if you are having party.

I would recommend it to any teacher (or parent for that matter)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasured Spanish reference","review":"A massive and informative book that I recommend to anyone who wants to travel in Spain or study its culture. The writer's vast knowledge on Spain is told in an interesting manner which includes conversations with Spaniards of all backgrounds. He covers everything from Spanish art to betting on soccer matches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Estupendo","review":"Written in 1968 this is a non-fictional account of James Michener's travels throughout Spain during his lifetime. He includes much history, local culture, tradition, and insight into this somewhat enigmatic country. Still relevant, but if you'd like to complement this book with a more recent follow-up, I would suggest Ghosts of Spain by Giles Tremlett, but first read Michener if you want to get some great comprehensive background. The two in fact complement each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I really wanted to read this book, even though it's outdated, to get background for a trip that's planned. However, unlike any other Michener book I've read, this was dull, dull, dull.

If you must buy it, get some tissues -- you'll be bored to tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"My gosh, it is NON-Fiction","review":"As a James Michener fan I thought this would be his usual excellent book. It may be good for others, but it wasn't for me. Well duh, it is NON-Fiction. I'm sorry but it didn't have the usual Michener way of grabbing you. This is probably a great book for a studious reader, someone interest in the details of Spain (Iberia). Unless that's you maybe you should skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some interesting observations but much too long","review":"Last winter I visited Southern Spain for a short holiday. I took Michener's book with me, a long pocket not too heavy. I have never read a book by Michener before. I found that Michener takes a lot of words to tell his story. Parts of the book are interesting but also a lot is very boring. When I was in the plane back home I stopped at page 500 and never started again with the book. I'll probably not try another Michener."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY inferior bookbinding","review":"After reading about 50 pages the pages began falling out and continue to do so. It is a book that should be removed from the inventory of the seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't work","review":"Beware of long convoluted gobbledygook from anyone. It won't work. This book is a fine example -- Check out chapter 10, \\"Future Forecasts\\". Carolan says there will be a big top about October 1995. Was there? No. Then \\"Expect a major low in the Dow Jones Industrial Average near Monday, July 27, 1998.\\" There was a small low in October which led to the rally into 2000 but all July had was a small top. This guy is batting 0 for 2, which is perhaps to be expected given his odd semi-astrological methods. There are tons of good ways to measure the market that do work. You don't need this book.

It is comfortable to wear and gives the information I need instantly. Thank You!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not mineral crystal","review":"I got this watch at Wal-Mart as I needed a light, thin, digital watch for wearing on the job site. I thought it had a mineral crystal. I wore it for a year and it did well. Then I had to work under a trailer in the gravel and saw that the crystal had scratched. Upon further examination, the crystal is not mineral. However, the watch is light and relatively thin, though designed for a small wrist, which I have. I gave it a 1 star as I find most people will check out the low scores more than the high to see what the real problems are. I continue to look for and inexpensive 12mm or less digital watch. I have the MTG-900 which is an atomic clock, solar charging, LCD and love it except it is so bulky - 16mm in height."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Read, Easy to Set, Good Value","review":"This watch is very easy to read in various lighting situations, the contrast between the characters and the background is good, the numbers and letters are large and clear, the design is pleasing and intuitive.I had no trouble setting this watch. I have not worn a watch in a few years, but wanted one to keep on schedule with a tour group I'm traveling with to the Galapagos Islands. With airports and boarding times to get there, and a busy schedule of activities each day of vacation, I wanted to know the time at a glance even with my hands full. At under $20 it is a great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor crystal","review":"When my last Casio's band broke (about the 3rd in 6 years), I looked at my replacement options. I ordered this one because it looks a bit classier than the standard Casios (I wear it to an office), and the last one I owned was so complicated I gave up trying to set the alarm. In the week that I've owned this one, two significant annoyances have become apparent: it has picked up two obvious scratches to the watch face, even though I've done no contact sports or anything else that would likely have led to scratching the face. At this rate, it will look pretty bad in a year. Second, the numbers are only readable if I turn my wrist further towards my eyes than I've ever had to with prior Casios (in other words, you have to be looking almost directly down at the face to read the numbers.) I think both problems stem from the fact that the crystal bows out slightly, rather than being perfectly flat like my prior Casios."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short lived","review":"I really like the style of this watch - it is my personal favorite. I am ordering the third one now because the armband lasts maybe 18 months or so. Keep in mind I wear this thing day and night, under the shower, hiking, camping, swimming etc. It's not unexpected for the armband to break, I just wish they made an inexpensive replacement. I looked and found a replacement armband for the same price as a new watch.I don't like to waste stuff. Getting an armband replaced should be easy and inexpensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best 'bang for the buck'!","review":"I originally bought one of these many years ago for work and it performed very well considering the type of work I do. Paid about $10 or $11.00 for it and after about 3 years the band broke. Since it's not cost effective to replace the band on a $10. watch, I simply bought another one for around $13.00 a couple of years ago. The 2nd watch and band are still going strong. Since I like the watch so much, I just ordered a 3rd one on Amazon to be sure I have it if/when the 2nd watch or band fails.Pros:Keeps good timeStopwatch functionWater resistantLong battery life (I still have the original watch with the broken band and it's still running)Cons:Cheap band (but hey, it's a $15.00 watch)Alarm is too quietAll-in-all, this watch offers great 'bang for the buck'! I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet deal and good quality!","review":"I bought this watch for work and absolutely love it. It is a basic Casio digital watch that is easy to read and is very comfortable on my wrist. In fact, the minute I put it on, I was more than satisfied. Most complaints about the strap are the fact that it breaks and is not replaceable. I accept that, so I am being careful when I put it on and take it off. Another point is that the face is all glass. I have already scratched the front, but the digits are still clear and I can probably just get a scratch remover product to fix it. Overall a great purchase for the super low price."},{"rating":"1","title":"good as long as strap holds up","review":"Have had two. First the strap broke and it was as cheap to buy a new watch as the strap. The second one which was only 6 months old had the plastic break where the screw holds the strap. The watch was not abused. Don't even have a clue as to what caused the plastic to break since there was no traumatic event that would have caused it. I liked how light and thin the watch is but will not buy another . Will go buy a $5 watch somewhere. I had one that lasted me for years. Casio needs to improve its quality with regards to the strap and how it is held on."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOR THE SURFACE OF THE POOL - NOT THE DEEP END!","review":"This watch was fine as long as I swam on the surface of the pool. After 20 months I made several trips to the bottom of the deep end - 9 feet - and the slight increase in water pressure caused condensation under the crystal and I had to replace the watch with a 100 meter model. Other than this, the watch performed flawlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT! CHEAP! EASY TO SEE! BASIC WATCH","review":"This style (Casio makes a couple similar) is my favorite watch because of the large clear numbers and date. I personally find over the years that I prefer visibility of the time over all else when using a wristwatch to tell time.The price is amazing (under $15) and my repeat buying of this style is only due to a phenomenal innate ability I have to lose a wrist watch that is basically securely strapped to my wrist whenever I am not sleeping .... Yet this year alone I've lost 3 watches (the last 3 were not this model) and was glad to see this one back on sale, and my memory of how much I like the simple, easy to see time and date was not a 'good old, yet untrue, memory'."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!!","review":"In service since 9/4/2008 and still working, best $16-$20 watched I've own, swim, shower ... hard use. I only buy CASIO watches. Big easy to read numbers, 10 year battery, stop watch, 12/24."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware watch strap","review":"If watch band breaks, almost impossible to replace. Standard straps do not fit. Search Amazon yourself. Unless you can pay to have a watch band shipped from England, do not buy this watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Deal of Its Kind","review":"Pros: Light weight. Bright light. Intuitive adjusting buttons. Big Letters. Decent price (about $19 after tax at Sears, and about $20 including S/H at Amazon Marketplace).Cons: No multiple alarms (i.e., can't set the alarm to turn on every 6 hours, etc.).More advanced models, such as Casio DB37HD-1AV and DB37HD-7AV, have similar designs but more functions, such as data bank, weekdays in foreign languages, etc. This model (W96H-1AV) and its variant (W96H-1BV), however, offer only the standard basic functions for a digital watch. One thing that may bother people is the way the band is rigidly fixed to the case. The hinges cannot be turned. As a result, the watch cannot be laid flat on table. This \\"feature\\" does not bother me. But it may be something for other people to consider. All in all, this watch is a good deal for its decent price and good design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"D.I. is the greatest Punk Rock at its best and its live!!!

The album track featured on it and the rest of Radiator really took Britpop to an area it's never been before. B-side tracks 2 and 3 go back to the sound SFA had in their debut, Fuzzy Logic. They're light on the electronic ingredients but great sounding Britpop none-the-less. Wrap It Up and Foxy Music are very solid tunes.If you're a fan of the band and have some extra cash, be sure to pick this one up.

Her voice, her styling, her clarity of tone, her interpretations are sheer perfection. I can almost believe that God wanted her in heaven because she sings like an angel. \\"Songbird\\", \\"Time after Time\\" and now \\"Imagine\\" show us her talent and versatility, which is no more. So all of her many fans , like myself, play her music over and over, listening to all of the nuances in her singing and , yes, we shed a tear as we bask in the beauty of her music. Instead of feeling sorry for ourselves at having lost Eva Cassidy, we ought to thank God for sending her to us, if only for a short while. Please excuse me now as I return to my stereo to listen to more Eva Cassidy."},{"rating":"2","title":"inagine","review":"LIKE MOST OF EVA CASSIDY'S MUSIC, THIS ALBUM IS SPELLBOUNDING.

Stick with her earlier recordings if you want to hear her shine. A tremendous disappointment. YMMV"},{"rating":"1","title":"Voice: yes. Music: no.","review":"Eva Cassidy has a strong voice, with a softness as smooth as silk and an ability to writhe in anguish. I understand why she has fans.But I'm not one.In her albums Imagine,Live at Blues AlleyandTime After TimeEva delivers the same promising starts on every song. But her phrasing, particularly her use of volume, is too abrupt and broad. Songs sound bipolar, either stroking with smoky allure or punching with emotional angst. There ain't much in between. On the jazz classic, \\"You've Changed,\\" Eva invites in with a soft croon, throwing in loudness for emphasis at points that capsize, rather than rock, the boat.I find Eva's approach disjointed and undesirable in most songs. Then again, there are a few songs where even Eva's weak musicality can't crush a great standard. I'd nevertheless prefer to listen to another artist sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, for an Eva disk.","review":"Don't waste your money on this one.

And like a lot of her fans, my emotional reaction was to stand there, mesmarized, and all of a sudden feel unstoppable tears begin to flow down my cheeks. Picking up the cd and reading the liner notes devastated me when I realized that she was no longer with us. I am grateful for the recorded legacy she has left behind and for the wise souls that are compiling this legacy into the albums that are now available to us. I have listened to Imagine several times since receiving my copy yesterday.

I had chills from head to toe and demanded to know who the singer was. After purchasing the CD, I could not stop listening, and immediately got online to purchase more CD's via Amazon. Eva Cassidy's voice is so riveting, so original, so stellar, that I can think of no one who even comes close to her. She ranges from folk in \\"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\\" to traditional in \\"Danny Boy,\\" and every note in between is a work or wonder. Though her life was brief, there is something of her very present in her CD's. And though some would think her story tragic, it seems to be exactly as she would have had it. The beauty, the spirit, the musical magnificance---is all captured in this CD by this beautiful soul.I would buy it 1000 times!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tennessee Waltz - she makes it her own","review":"IMAGINE brings together more of Eva's solo material.

It's not a big, greedy record company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eva sounds great - but the same.","review":"Eva has a permanent place in my music library and I love to hear just about all her songs, but, there is a 'sameness' about all her music and one can only take so much of a good thing. I don't actually like her rendition of 'Danny Boy' wishing she had kept to a more traditional drendition, albeit with her usuals highs and holds. Whatever, Eva has to be part of my listening, and anyone elses.

It wasn't complete songs and the sound was hi-fi not stereo quality. I knew it was going to be a different album from Songbird and Time After Time as some of the songs were only guitar accompliment.From the beginning I knew I was in for a treat as the first song was different from the BBC's site. The music is marvelous every song plays well. I'm used to Eva's music by now and expected a quality album. I waited for \\"Danny Boy\\" most of all as the clip I heard did not have the full lyrics. The last song is \\"Danny Boy\\" and Eva sang it so beautifully that as she sang the final lyrics I lost control and all the memories from childhood through my lifetime just welled up inside of me to a place I've never been. If you've never seen a grown man weep before, it was all there, the journey to that special place. It's worth the whole album and then some. I finally have come home.

If you base the page count on the 96 pages of the first edition, then this second edition has only 91 pages. So it's not possible for it to have changed substantially. I was a little upset when I first got it, but I decided to justify the purchase through the study of the actual differences, which can't be many. OK, so if you own the first edition, don't think this one is much different.Peace and Love, fits like a glove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thsi is a great accompanyment to the big bood of AA.","review":"I've been sober a while and struggling with letting go of some defects.

Those kinds of accolates are what suckered me in to buying this when it first came out back in 1981. I was in eighth grade and had been listening to classical music for about three months, and I could immediately see these tunes had nothing to do with it. They are pedestrian pop songs. Instead of a singer or chorus, we have \\"waa-waa\\"ing synthesizers, but these are simple tunes with repeated drum machine beats on a synthesizer, nothing more. If you play the samples here and you like this sort of thing, fine and good. Many people like Britney Spears too. But it's not \\"classical music\\" and does not owe anything to it. It may be part of what brought the likes of John Tesh and Yanni out of the woodwork, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite books!","review":"astonishingly good! glucklich has a brilliant, original mind (as well as being extraordinarily erudite) and it is absolutely entrancing to see how he interprets and synthesizes a wide range of material (& i don't ordinarily get excited about academic books in general or theology in particular...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"See Jardine Complaints","review":"It was curious to see why so few of the BRU gliders had ratings compared to many other products on the site.

There was damage on the base but we called the 1-800 number and they sent a new one (however it took about 6 weeks so we ended up puting it together w/the scratched one). It is very attractive and sturdy enough, plus the microfiber is easy to clean for the inevitable milk spills - the reason I'm giving it a low rating is the seat cushion. It went flat where you sit within a month. I am not huge or anything - to give you an idea, I was using it w/a newborn and I am about 133 lbs. I have not called to get a replacement but even if they send one I'm sure it'll go flat again.

The writer has to be careful not to drown the story with the details of the period, or color the characters with the too modern traits. And lets not forget the whole point of this genre- the puzzle.Pat McIntosh unfortunately fails miserably on all accounts. Far too many characters, the thick Scotish brogue, and realy bad dialogue.

Rhodes gets to tag along as Taverner enters into combat with the forces of the shadow and many other aspects of the occult scene along the way.

The script seems to have way too extraneous elements that have nothing to do with the cliched story, like the Quintessons and the Junkions. Unicron, the planet-eater is coming and chowing down on everything in his path. The only thing that can stop him is Optimus Prime's Matrix of Leadership. The movie never bothers to explain *why*. But after Prime dies, the Matrix ends up as a McGuffin of sorts until the resolution of the plot. Hot Rod, a teenager Transformer, who the movie plays up as a impulsive wildcard, finds maturity at the end not through his own means but by stumbling across the Matrix by accident. This movie did not satisfy me in any way, and in my opinion is a mockery of the Transformers. Read the comics. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"greatest animated movie ever!","review":"I was a big fan of the cartoon when it came out in the mid-80's.

For any Transformers fan,loose or diehard,the movie is one thing you must see.There are as many unpleasant as fascinating surprises in store in the movie.Personally,Transformers the Movie not only represents the highlight of the series,but of modern animation as well.So many of childrens action shows today feature ridiculous and violent plots which are a waste for tv..I just hope that someone will bring the original series back.I loved it as a kid and I still do as a young man.It is childish,but a person to me is entitled to at least one childish hobby..Don't get too carried away,though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"read it for sophomore history class","review":"i am a sophomore and my history class read this book. i was a little reluctant to open it, as i am with all assigned literature. when i begain reading, i figured i was in for some really boring play that my frivolous history teacher had some sort of affection for. however as i read on past the introductory mumbo jumbo, the play suddenly became engrossing. i just lost myself in it and before i knew it i was really enjoying it. it was very easy to understand, and with an open mind i believe anyone can enjoy this play. its not written in old shakespearean english, either, so you dont have to play guessing games with some of the words. all in all, this book is a winner and should, while not entirely historically accurate, be entertaining and impressive. however, i would not recommend it to a cynical reader who trashes a book if its cover isnt interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This books is crazy interesting!

I adore plays, and this era in time, but this play disappointed me, and I'm disappointed that I didn't enjoy it, as I had high hopes. I looked at the play, as if I were to perform in it, and it did not strike my fancy.

I saw the movie first in high school, and then found out it was based on a play and read the play in an afternoon-- it is absolutely fantastic! Deep, moving, and ultimately a grim tale of the state of society as a whole, when we as humans view badges of office and their concommitants as more important and desirable than the human characteristics that lead to the acquisition of those badges. See it, read it, in any order, I think, because the movie is almost exactly the play, and both are unbelievable. This is literature that will enrich your life. Forget Grisham."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent","review":"I first saw the movie, and was riveted by the dialogue. The clarity of thought, the elevation of principals above self is awe-inspiring. I rushed out to buy the book (the script of the play), and read the wonderful dialogue over and over. Many of the lines simply cry out with logic and integrity, and some have found a place on the wall of my office.Whether one characterizes Thomas Moore as a saint, a statesman of unbending principals, or both, his strength of character, intellect, humanity and general goodness shine through with brilliant clarity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, quick read","review":"I had a few hours in between flights this Thanksgiving and brought this along. It's considerably deeper than your typical airport reads, though since it's a play you can finish it quickly.Bolt does an outstanding job in the Preface talking about his motivation, his direction for the character and persona of Sir Thomas More. What's most interesting I think is how he handles the character development. I won't ruin it for you, but I think it needs to be said that this is not the story of a man changing because of events but almost the inverse.Language is very easy to read and understand, though some passages will certainly benefit from rereading just to consider what the message is, what Bolt is trying to get across. I loved the book and would love to see an adaptation of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action - Take one!!","review":"Garbage Head reads like a movie.

The artists are well known throughout Europe and South America for their excellent voices and interpretive skills. They range in style from classic interpretations like those of Cristina Branco and Ana Varela to the definitively fantastic range of Liana's style. In addition, the classic Cape Verdean 'Sodade' usually sung as a morna, is also included here.The classic world of fado as sung by the traditional artists such as Amalia Rodrigues has finally entered a modern age and shows great promise, especially if a new generation of song writers follows in the footsteps of these new divas. Fado, unlike the Spanish flamenco, is an urban medium and it lends itself more readily to the modern, with its' melancholy melodies and lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless!","review":"How pleased was I to get this series 1 dvd set in super quick time...great I thought!

This wasn't the mini tear that nobody sees; it was a 7\\" tear that everybody could see. Had I not been wearing compression shorts under the pants, my private area would've been fully exposed to everybody who stared. This situation is unacceptable for a relatively new pair of pants. As a disclaimer, no, they weren't tight on me and I'm not fat.

I suppose that we can partially blame Nokia for this proprietary and somewhat retarded connector style.

Gaines smoothly braids his stories of us, them, and the properties thereof into an engaging soap opera. The cast swings all the way from the old-guard, dullsville entitlement of the folks at the Maidstone Club to polished avant-garde goings-on at The Creeks, in between which Ted Dragon nicks furniture for a hobby. Gaines's adroit telling of these stories will even surprise you into empathy for the neighbors round Barry Trupin's mansion, a poster \\"child\\" for matters done with gaucherie and lack of moderation. It's those last which seem to be the ultimate sin against the Hamptons, and its Wodehousian, overprivileged world."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOOTHAMPTON","review":"As a rule, compassion for swells makes only an occasional, tiny, brief blip on my radar screen. It's a testament to Steven Gaines's skills as a story teller that I found myself engrossed in and sympathetic to the problems of these over-privileged Hamptonites. Obnoxious neighbors, dysfunctional relatives, and inept governing bodies are universal conditions no matter how many or few zeros in your bank account. An elitist book? Maybe. An amusing and entertaining read? Definitely!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too High Strung","review":"Philistines at the Hedgerow traces the roots of fabulosity in New York's most famous vacation spot, providing an insider's, gossip-filled look at the scandals and quirks of the area and its inhabitants. Gaines examines the relationships between property and personality that have developed over the years at the beachfront, from building castles to accumulating mass amounts of acreage where parties can be thrown and paparazzi shots can be taken. Philistines at the Hedgerow provides yet another glimpse into the celebrity backdrop of American life in an area that has radically altered itself over time from simple farmland to idyllic playground."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH OLD HISTORY TO HOLD INTEREST","review":"I WAS EAGERLY WAITING TO READ THIS BOOK AND SEE WHAT ALL THE FUSS ABOUT THE HAMPTONS IS. WHY IT IS THAT SO MANY STARS AND RICH NEW YORKERS CONSIDER THIS THE PLACE TO BE. AFTER READING THIS BOOK THEY CAN KEEP IT! IT STARTED OUT TO BE INTERESTING BUT EVERY TIME THE AUTHOR STARTED A STORY HE FELT THE NEED TO GO BACK IN HISTORY AND EXPLAIN THE ORIGINS OF A HOUSE OR A PIECE OF LAND. WHO CARES? I WANTED MORE OF THE PRESENT DAY PEOPLE AND GOINGS ON. I FELT MYSELF DRIFTING OFF EVERY TIME HE WENT INTO ONE OF HIS HISTORY LESSONS.

I told my husband not to bother. Don't waste your time reading this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Summer's Read","review":"This is not Rand, nor Tolstoy, nor Fitzgerald, nor Dunne. One needn't think too much about such a book. Suffice to say that it is simply amusingly written and quite informative about such a seemingly provinicial world and the moneyed individuals who inhabit and have inhabited it. A good read, especially if one's planning to visit the region."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy read...","review":"Everyone heads to the shore in the summer to play in the ocean and mingle with the rich and privileged. Open Gaines' book and discover the wonderful steamy, seamy side of that privilege. Just because someone has plenty of money doesn't mean that they have plenty of sense. Reading Philsitines at the Hedgerow is like peeking through a porthole into a first-class cabin on a luxury liner. One sees aspects of being rich--filthy rich--that one never expected. Gaines is a professional. His writing is beautiful, clear, and logical. His attention to detail is so obvious that no one would ever question his research. If you love detail, if you love \\"real writing\\", read Philistines."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrist band","review":"Although they look very nice when brand new, the color (blue) fades dramatically after a fewuses of playing tennis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innovative and Inspirational!","review":"This compact disc covers a wide and powerful expressive range. The first symphony starts out ike a quiet snowfall--peaceful and gentle. After a brief pause, the music shifts its energy to an exciting pace; a wave of sounds call out and respond to each other with an innovative mix of syncopated rhythms and melodies. From the strings to the horns to the woodwinds, the themes arising from every instrument voice create a sense of mystery and drama. The crescendos are magical, and the themes ae haunting and beautiful. Congratulations to Brian Sager for composing a set of symphonies and sonatas that are thrilling to listen to and at the same time an incredible inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst CD I own.","review":"If I could give this CD 0 stars I would.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Press Wasn't Always Liberal","review":"Olasky used his courage and wisdom to do the research it took to write this book. He has shown us how the print press in particular has changed in its coverage of events and society. The New York Times and Boston Globe with christian-based news reports? Yes. God fearing editorials? Yes. Its all there and more! A great read if you are into subjects ranging from Christian Press to History. Geron L - a reader"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read for Troubled Times","review":"A very wonderfull historical look into the press and how it has changed in its views as well as its abilitiy to reach a certain sence of objectivity. The author states that you can never really be totally objective, but you can strive to get as close to it as possible. I would address that the study of a few of the major members of Journalism's history was one of the best chapters of the book because it gives you a shocking prespective of what these men really were and the terrible ends they faced at the end of their tourtured journeys. I was very surprised to read exactly who Pulizer was and what exactly the Pulizer Award may insue when one obtains it.I gave it less then 5 stars because at times, the religious portions of the book get a bit too preachy for my tastes, but then, since it is a christian like peice, it is to be expected and that is fine. It may turn away some readers but I think it still is a great peice of knowledge for research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath of Fresh air in the tax debate","review":"I have to hand it to Slemrod and Bakija, they cut through the intellectual garbage that dominates the debate over taxes in America, and give you a 100% unbiased look at the facts. It discusses the issues of fairness, simplicity, economic consequences, and alternatives like the flat and sales tax. This country would be a lot better off if everyone (especially politicians) read this book. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Manics are pure genius and I love them!","review":"As we all know,this is a great song with eloquent lyrics by a fab band.

I remembered thinking it was so amazing that real scenery could be combined with animation. I hadn't thought about the movie in years, then one day a few weeks ago, the \\"clickety click\\" song from the movie popped into my mind and I knew I HAD to find it!! I got my copy a few days ago, watched it immediately, and all the memories came back. However, I think my memory of the \\"vivid\\" scenery was a little skewed because it looks really old and dingy now (maybe the quality of the restoration before putting it on DVD?). The music was just as I remembered, except now I can definitely hear the 70s influence. A great movie about how a little girl finds her \\"way\\" with the help of a very sweet kangaroo. So the kangaroo never found her joey? how sad! Great movie and I can't wait for my 10 month old to watch it when she's a little older."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I guess I didn't remember the story like I thought I did.

I remember wanting to \\"rewind\\" the tv so i could watch it again. This is certainly one of the best children's movies out there, though i haven't watched it in ages. I am going to buy a copy on DVD for my children (and myself). I had completely forgotten the title of the movie and had spent about 2 years searching on the internet for what it might be. I just remembered that it was part-animated, and had a kangaroo, a girl, a platypus, and some caveman drawings. When i finally happened upon the actual movie, i was ecstatic... and then to find out that it is available on dvd :)You can't go wrong with this movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming But Not Saccharine...","review":"I remember this movie from when I was younger. I believe I first saw it in the really early 1980s, when my family first got HBO. I still remember it fondly to this day.This is a cute tale of a young girl and a kangaroo. It's a very enjoyable story about friendship, although there are some scary moments involving dingos and the mythical Bunyip, whom I always called \\"Bun Lip\\" for some unknown reason.I think this is a great movie for parents to watch with their kids, far better than any over-commercialized Disney garbage you might find. Be forewarned, though. As I said, there are a few light scares. They may frighten younger views. I still highly recommend this selection, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dot and The Kangaroo","review":"I agree with Brandon in VA and Deborah in NV!!I've been looking for this movie for so long. Every now and again, I'll think about this movie and think about the heartbreak. I'm planning on ordering it but from memory, it's a good transition (as in growing up) movie for the elementary school age. I remember watching the movie somewhere in the 1st-4th grade range. The Last Unicorn movie also reminds me of the heartbreak of breaking ties.I really enjoyed this movie growing up, even if it was sad at the ending. I've always had a special bond with animals, so it was sad for me (not to diss my family!). Wasn't the 80's a great time to be a kid?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG!! I cant't believe it's here!","review":"I was planning on buying a used vhs on ebay. Then they bring it onto DVD! This is a movie I remember since I was 4.

A wonderful movie for children or those young at heart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary for little kids","review":"I was looking at childhood nostalgia on Amazon when I came across this DVD. I am glad the review includes a warning about the bunyip. I am not joking when I say this movie TERRIFIED me as a kid. I remember watching it once on tv, and I have honestly had nightmares for years. It's not supposed to be a scary movie! Why it scared me so much I can't say, but it did. It even baffled my parents. But the bunyip still pops up in my nightmares to this day (I'm 27!) Many people love it, but I just caution that young children should be with a parent when they first watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS MOVIE","review":"I USED TO WATCH THIS MOVIE WHEN I WAS A KID ALL THE TIME.

I AM SO HAPPY I FINALLY FOUND IT ON DVD I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR THIS MOVIE EVERYWHERE. IT IS A LITTLE SCARY, KIDS 5 YEARS AND OLDER WOULD APPRECIATE IT MORE THAN YOUNGER KIDS AND NOT BE SCARED.

It is often the problem that people show little concern for their work. The rule seems to be something like this- Do just enough to get by while exerting the least energy as possible. I like this book because the information is not a story of what a good manager has as an opinion as to what works best but it is a scholarly book in the sense that it provides information based on research that is proven. This is to date the best book that I have to reference when dealing with teams that act out of extrinsic motivation or no motivation at all. I applaud the author for this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music to my ears","review":"It is always refreshing to be in the company of a child with polite verbal manners. This is, of course, true for adults, as well. How to Speak Politely and Why, is very helpful to those a bit confused with proper speech etiquette. Perhaps this book is a beginning in keeping it from becoming a lost art. While reading it with fun, it could become a valuable tool for your childs entire life."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a preachy, prescriptive grammar book, not a manners book","review":"I thought these books all sounded great when I bought them, as I wanted my kids to read about manners and how to act nicely around others. Instead it's full of rules about saying \\"VERB-ing\\" rather than \\"VERB-in\\" so poor G doesn't get lonely. It uses cutesy little things like that, and poor wobbly-necked \\"Uh-uh\\" and \\"Uh-huh\\" to nag kids in an annoying way about how to speak \\"correct\\" English. Maybe this worked in the 1930s, but it sounds bizarre and irritating now, and my kids and I just don't relate to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speaking Politely","review":"Good book for young children.

I found it to be all about Grammar. We send our kids to school and we speak to them correctly, so why do we need a book to tell us the same thing. I thought it was going to be about how to speak nicely, without getting upset, waiting your turn to speak, using your manners, and not to back talk. Maybe I should've written a book like that myself. If you already know your grammar, and practice it with your child, please do not waste your money. my son found the book very boring and confusing, since it also seemed like it was written for children born in the 1950's."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unknown gem","review":"Although Palace left little impression on the SF community, I regard it as one of the most solid, entertaining and innovative SF novels of its generation. The Hugo and Nebula Awards fell down on this one. Palace effortlessly juggles many SF archetypes in a way that's really fresh. The novel previsions trending social topics voted on in real time by citizens of the city in a media context.There's mysteries galore in Palace that involve a technological past, a lost heritage and what it means to the entire civilization, a mysterious terrorist, the nature of Palace itself, cyberattacks and more.But Palace isn't good because of the nature of what it chooses to deal with, it's good because it's streamlined, well written and without any nods to faux artistry or political correctness. It's just good, just about as good as any SF novel you'll read. The characters are distinct and believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally underrated! Nice grooves, great production, songs","review":"Hari fan here! Okay, the man is lazy and admittedly needs Macca to produce him (and play bass) rather than that disgusting Electric Lynn Orchestra character (as in more recent releases). Anyhoo, this album rates in my mind as one of George's better efforts, probably as good as '33 1/3', and more uptempo than 'GH'. 'Wake up...', 'That's the Way It Goes', 'Circles', are all great songs. There's a bit of annoying synth and one oddity ('I Really Love You') but overall worth your entertainment dollar if you need that George fix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nevermind critics! Excellent album!","review":"This is \\"Gonne Troppo\\", which is considered George Harrison's worst album ever. In fact, this album s great! Features many memorable songs: \\"That's the way it goes\\", \\"I really love you\\", \\"Wake up my love\\" and \\"Greece\\". The other albums released by \\"Dark horse records\\" are even better, though. If you don't want to buy this album, try \\"All things must pass\\", \\"33 and 1/3\\", \\"George Harrison\\", \\"Somewhere in England\\", \\"Cloud nine\\" or \\"Live in Japan\\" instead. Therefore, this is a very good album, but not one of his very best solo efforts.Thanks for reading, again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the solo CDs","review":"This is by far the worst of the Harrison solo CDs.Time has not been kind with this release with some tracks really not happening.The track 'I really love you' is truly awful.There are a couple of good tracks such as the Time Bandits theme and Circles.This is for die hard fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice garage/hard rock amalgam","review":"Live from Germany in the late '80's, this is a good record.

UGH. All the talk about phalluses made me queasy.And the handfasting ceremonies in this deal with the bride and groom cutting themselves and then mixing their blood?

I watched it in totality and that's 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back. I have read the entire Deathland series - twice. This dreck has nothing in common w/ that James Axler series of the same name. The red filter made the outside shots unwatchable, and the poor acting made the rest of the scenes unwatchable. The script bore no resemblence to any of the books and the action was akin to all the clowns getting out of a car at the circus. God this thing was terrible. If you get this DVD somehow (and I hope you haven't bought it) it's only good to hang from your rearview mirror to keep off the radar. Please, please don't buy this crap.

And Jak Lauren was good in the movie but he wore a football jersey and had short curly while hair in the book he had long white hair and he had his jacket with throwing knifes that was not in the movie Ryan and JB were about the same as in the movie and book everbout else was the same in the movie like they where in the book so the movie was good butthey should had Doc Tanner and Lori quinn"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deathlands wannabe Movie","review":"Being a huge Deathlands reader mark, I was extremely excited to finally see a Deathlands movie come out.But alas, it failed miserably on so many areas.Actually the actors who portrayed Ryan Cawdor and Krysty Wroth were good, and actually dressed and looked the part. The other ones who played Jak Lauren and J.B. Dix were terrible.Even with a low budget, this easily could have been a classic B-movie post-holocaust action/adventure movie. It actually showed promise at times, but failed miserably at its very core. Too bad. This long running action series could still be made into a hot Hollywood production hit if it were made right. And it actually would not cost that much to produce.But if you are not a harcore fan like myself, you might see it in a different light.

Spano spends most of the movie in a full length brown leather coat that had more of a pimp dressing gown look than anything approaching Keanu Reeve's. Traci Lords WAS scary but then I think we always knew that. Jeny Lano was at least eye candy in a yoga tube halter, but that was all the skin you ever imagined in this could-have-been.Best to wait for a solid REDO.

Why, well first of all the supposed religious retreat is called 'Heavens Gate' and those of us that are familiar with the real Heavens Gate thing in the usa with DO and RE and MI, the leaders brings visions of simpleton idiots that were waiting for their spaceship to come. Nothing and I mean NOTHING erotic about that, matter of fact, every time I read the reference to Heavens Gate it jerked me into a reality I hope to escape from while reading an erotic book.Contrary to the main Black Lace themes of strong women taking what they want out of life, the heroine in this book, Mary Grace, does little to show any strength and is a far cry from other heriones in the genre. I gave this book two stars, rather than one, for the inclusion of Yu Ling, the politically correct and currently necessary Oriental young girl in the midst of a tryst...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steph's Patio","review":"I was very pleased with this purchase.

Set in Beirut in 1975, at the start of the Lebanese civil war, it follows the actions of three teenaged friends (two Muslim, one Christian) as their city and country rapidly descend into division and sectarian strife. There is a lot of humor in it, befitting the resilience of youth, but always in the viewer's mind it is tempered by the awareness that around the young people their world has descended into war and anarchy. I think anyone interested in modern Lebanon or, more broadly,in the way people adapt and struggle to get by when forces beyond their control take over, would enjoy this witty but sad film."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Sucks !!","review":"Lots of BAD language, not the kind of movie u would like to watch with your family or friends !

Very funny moments are carried throughout the movie, yet these and set in sad undertones and background. The acting is simple and amateurish yet very natural.

It wasn't about the JJ I know, as I first thought it might be.I thought the book was rather interesting, but it was written to a junior high level audience; except, some of the content seemed a bit beyond that age group (but not as bad as some TV). And some of the behavioral patterns of the main character just seemed to be inconsistent---being such a caring person, then such a jerk. A single event in JJ's life destroys her childhood, then she is reformed; but she can not get her life back.The story seems to be telling young teens that mistakes in life can be forgiven and won't destroy you, so get back on your feet. While at the same time, it seems to be telling young teens not to make a mistake because your life will be ruined forever, and you will need to live in obscurity. Best just to skip teen years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Hidden Power","review":"The Hidden Power of Photoshop Elements 2After 7 years of struggling with Elements 2 and various books, I bought this, used, and discovered the way to think about images and the Elements software interface.

None of the preview material I viewed on Amazon mentioned this part of the book. Found out afterwards I should have read the customer reviews.

I don't think any watch that is labelled water \\"resistant\\" should be expected to last through a full day in a huge wave pool. So I returned to Wal-Mart and bought another one.Now it, too, is dead. I even thought I put the old watch back on by accident after washing the dishes. I haven't done anything differently than I did with the original one that I owned. This watch simply is no longer water resistant.

It is totally too small of a face for a person with poor vision. The men's Easy Reader however has a much larger face and is more readable. I went to the store and looked at all the Easy Reader's after receiving this watch and all of the women's Easy Reader's were too small.

Today the battery finally died. No problem, I thought. The number for the battery is nicely etched on the back cover, easy to find and read.Where the watch fails miserably is in re-attaching the back once you've replaced the battery. Unless you want to go to a watch store and pay extra $$ to have it professionally replaced, or have the specialized equipment and knowledge to know how to put the cover back on, chances are you will either break the crystal front or the watch entirely or never get the back cover back on properly. After trying to pressure it back on with my fingers, I went on the internet and found out it was almost impossible to do so in that way on these watches.

Whereas Red Rain was bogged down by the need to introduce the concepts of vampire lore, character reaction and setup, and other formalities, this book can leap right into things and get to the important business of telling the story.In this Elseworld's tale, Batman is now a vampire. In many ways it is a vindication of his self image as a creature of the night apart from normal humans. At the same time, Batman is built on the one thing that separates him from the monsters he fights- he will not kill. As the vampiric urge to kill grows, however, he must go to extraordinary measures to fight it or lose all that he is.Great storytelling with an ending that even shocked the hell out of me.

I used it for 2 weeks, and ran into so many paper jams, incomplete transmissions, and annoying features. I called Xerox tech support to see if I could turn the modem volume off or make it lower in volume ( the lowest volume setting is still very loud), but was told that there is not a way to do this, that I could take a piece of paper, fold it many times, and tape it to the side of the printer to muffle the volume.Whenever I received a fax, the machine would totally startle me as it prepared the paper tray loudly. I don't know how to explain it, but if you decide you want to buy it, you should have them perform a demo in the store!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cross your fingers every time you print","review":"This printer reminds me that my father always told me \\"you get what you pay for.\\" This printer:1) Misfeeds constantly. The paper doesn't feed well, and when it does actually print sucessfully, it often prints crooked. I probably have trouble-free prints about 50% of the times I try. Cross your fingers.2) Has other problems. The \\"ink low\\" light is always on, even with a new cartridge. Also, the print driver locks up whenever the printer encounters problems.3) Is insanely expensive to refill.I will never fall for one of the cheap printers again. It is SO much trouble that I wind up e-mailing documents to my room-mate to print rather than go through the torture and frustration of trying to make a good print on mine. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonder-machine","review":"i just ordered the xerox 470 and i can tell you that i am greatly pleased with it, even after just a couple days. ll of the features on it work great, and even the printer part is great. easy load ink and a compact system make me recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Work Center isn't so great","review":"Out of the box, it is a functional b/w fax, and a b/w copier. Once it is installed on the PC it is a decent quality, slow color printer, (5 minutes for 1 page). The Pagis software that comes with it is necessary in order to use the 470 as a color scanner or color copier. In order to get it to scan or copy in color, it is necessary to get into the BIOS setup. Not exactly plug-n-play. I tried using it with my gateway and dell laptops, as well as my dell desktop,(all less than a year old), so it's not like I was trying to install the 470 on an old or oddball computer. I kept getting port conflict errors or lock-ups. I never did get it to work well, and I returned it. I would discourage anyone from buying this product. The price was attractive, but it's not worth bringing home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality..Bad Choice..","review":"I had purchased Xerox 470, and had to swap it back 3 times for a new machine from XEROX because the paper wouldn't feed without jamming or the rollers wouldn't grab a single sheet [grabbed 5 etc.] Each machine i replaced experienced the exact same problems. Furthermore the ink cartridges are a ripoff because they do not last long and even though there maybe ink left, once the machine says \\"low ink\\" you cannot overide and keep printing. I did find XEROX support good, however this product was so poor that i simply ended up giving it away to a charity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Elsewhere","review":"Buying this was one of the poorest mistakes that I ever made. There are two basic problems with this machine. 1. Using software, there is no way to control the fax machine like the Canons. You must sit and look at the little LCD screen and punch the little keys on the front of the 470. 2. The cartridges for this are...expensive. I have had the...machine for a year and am on my third cartridge. And I print about 2 to 4 pages a week. I used to like and root for Xerox but after buying this...machine it is no wonder why they are no longer the great company they once were.In short, if you want to buy this product LOOK ELSEWHERE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I have one. It died after 3 months of use. My neighbor has one. It died in 6 months.The ink cartridges don't last. They aren't refillable, and they are twice the cost of competing products.They didn't bother to battery backup the clock, so you have to reset the fax timestamp every time it loses power.Besides the fact that you can't count on Xer-smucks to keep up with demand for their cartridges. For about a month mine was a paperweight because every store around was backordered.Buy an HP printer. A Cannon copier. Or a Brother Fax. I will never buy another Xerox product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost the best but the best you can get","review":"The 470cx is radiant in the multifunction marketplace. There are no competitors that rise to its adoration level. The built in 1200x1200 color printer rivals many other 'only printers on the shelf'. Setting the fax machine to auto/manual/telephone or dedicated fax is easier than most brands. The scan feature operates faster than expected and the print and copy speeds are faster than all of the nearest competitors. If you're spending $250 for a machine, dare not pick anything else until you've astonished yourself at the overwhelming features, simplicity of use and extended life cartridges the 470cx has. For the money (and believe me the features are top notch), its the best multifunction on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible junk, expensive ink","review":"After 3 yrs of ownership I am ready to toss it out the window.Even when it was new, the print head slammed got \\"stuck\\" and stopped printing while spewing ink inside the machine. The ink cartridges are super-expensive and hard to find, unlike Canon refills which are cheap and available everywhere.The fax can only handle about 20 pages when scanning to memory first.The slow scanner produces low-quality images which have herringbone patterns embedded in the image.The software included is terrible, this unit is not fully compatible with Win XP.The unit always indicates that it is out of ink when there is plenty of ink left."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Best on The Market","review":"After owning this Xerox printer for over a year, I am compelled to vote it a 1 star rating based upon the following:Ink goes out too fast and is Expensive!Color prints come out the Wrong Tone by a Huge amount.Often when printing from a file the Cartridge Carrier will bang on the side of the machine and stop functioning altogether.Paper has a hard time feeding correctly and WILL NOT feed with only 1 or 2 sheets in the loader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper Feeder Poor; Ink Dries out too easily; Ink $$","review":"I purchased this printer in 2003, and its now 2005. Ive discovered a few things about this device:1. The paper feeder doesnt work well at all. You cannot have less than 10 sheets in the tray at all times or else it wont feed properly.2. The Ink is over-priced.3. The Color cartidge you can never get full use of because it dries out and you lose a color before you can even use 10% of the ink in it.4. I discovered that you can get a Lexmark Model 70 cartridge to work in the 470CX by prying out a little key in the reciver of the cartridge holder and tossing it in the trash. This will save you 50% in the price of cartridges. (If you can even find the 8R7881 anywhere, anyways)5. The printer drivers for this are horrible.6.

The rollers won't grab the paper. Everything else about the machine is excellent, however this one problem makes the machine all but useless.

She goes to High Point during the furniture market without a room reservation. N.C. District Court judges have access to a sec- retary who would have handled any reservation. Maron doesn't even discuss Knott staying in the home of the Judge for whom she's subbing. It is inconceivable to image a Judge sleeping on a stranger's couch. She could have slept at the courthouse. Opps, no story! So we have an implausible story with cutsy dialogue. Upon meeting someone who recognizes her, Judge Knott replies \\"You have the advantage of me sir\\". Yes, all Tar Heels speak this way, just as a District Court Judge will take up with a stranger at a mall and follow her all over High Point.

I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to the Maron series...good plot and character","review":"I have read all of the Maron's and I enjoyed this one...it was a fun and rather wicked look at the furniture/decorating world and a good plot that was not overly contrived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always Entertaining","review":"Margaret Maron is one of those authors that I purchase the book because I love her stories and writing style.

The product is great, but do NOT buy from this merchant.About the product: I switch up rat poison so that the rats do not become used to seeing/smelling the same food. This product kills them quickly, within a few days. Be wary of where they die though. They are dehydrated by these products and often seek water sources (bathroom, kitchen and outside.) If they die while seeking water, and that happens to be inside your house/attic, you must remove their body... otherwise the smell can be horrible. Also, as they decompose you will have maggots and flies.

For the small problem of not being able to climb up, I just want to offer a suggestion: there are holes on the standing board, I ran a rope and tied it up through the 2 holes closest to the steps, so he can climb on using the rope as a help.

To pour the last few cups you have to nearly up-end the decanter and when you do that steam comes up and stings your hand. Plus the lid is prone to falling off. It is amazing to me that a company whose business is to sell coffee machines can't come up with a better design. How did this not get identified in engineering/testing?

First, my hand can't fit into it, preventing me from hand washing it, which is my preference when it comes to coffee. As a result, I wash it using a soap brush, but unfortunately, if you hit the side of the carafe a little too hard with the plastic part of the brush, it will crack. Second, there is a space between the plastic top and the glass which can leak, as other reviewers here said. This space also \\"traps\\" soapy water, so if you don't submerge it when you rinse, or rinse like crazy, you may get a little dish soap in your coffee.

The authors' discussion regarding the breakdown of time periods is excellent.Even though the passage of time and new findings, particularly in Florida, have lessened the value of some of the data presented, the book remains a peerless review of a dynamic part of Earth's history.Caveat: The reader should have some background in zoology and anatomy, otherwise constant recourse to a dictionary may be required."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly hard to understand--difficult for beginners","review":"As a student of Dr. Haskell's at Oakland University in Rochester Michigan, this text is as dry, un-inspiring, and mind-numbingly boring as the author is a lecturer.Why?1--text layout is poorly designed, requiring to flip several pages back and forth just to understand a figure. 2--poor design of figures and graphs. 3--obviously prepared, and/or edited by a committee of \\"engineers\\". 4--no color to rescue the senses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Mistake","review":"I would rather have the hair on my scrotum set on fire with a blow-torch than learn digital logic and 8086 structure from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE! Perfect!","review":"I debated on this JJ Cole Bundle Me Lite and a regular Bundle Me. I liked that neither of them went over the whole car seat w/ a little window... I don't like those. These are more like warm blankets in the car seat. For the most part, our little girls goes from our house, to the car in the garage, and back. She's not exposed to freezing cold temps, so the Lite is perfect for us. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the Original","review":"I used the original BundleMe all winter and loved the convenience and warmth it provided. When it started to get too warm for that, but too cool to go without a blanket, I decided to try the Bundle Me Lite. I assumed it would just be a thinner version of the original. It is not at all the same. I would consider it greatly inferior. We have the Chicco Keyfit and the original fit perfectly in the seat. Although the Lite seems to fit, the material (nylon or something as opposed to comfy cotton) is too slippery and it will not stay put, especially when you stick a squirmy baby on top of it. It is difficult to get it zipped once you finally get it correctly situated. The material reminds me of a raincoat or windbreaker - not a blanket. It seems uncomfortable for the baby and I stopped using it after less than a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Safe","review":"I bought one of these for my daughter.

Brilliant in its musical execution but lacking in the kind of heart one often seeks from musical theater. That said, it really does offer a lot of mind fodder as it explores the psyches of those who have attempted to assassinate America's chief executive officers throughout history. You'll be perversely pleased by Sondheim's zesty wit as displayed in the overly cheerful, sweet as candy songs. But soon his saccharin tone leaves you feelin' a bit bitter in the stomach as you try to digest the fact that we are talking something as serious as taking the life of another. Not sure this is palatable for all. But if you want something that makes you think, something that plumbs the playhouse's darker corners, you'll get some kick out of Assassins. Suggested for mature musical hounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sondheim is brilliant!","review":"I love the sounds that Soundheim creates.

Adam Hardesty and Caroline Fordyce each have secrets that could cause problems with their families if they were to be told. Adam is being threatened by a medium to keep his secret. When the woman is discovered murdered, Adam has only one lead and it leads him to Caroline Fordyce, author of serials in the tabloid newspapers. The two join forces to find the murderer and to protect each other, when another medium is murdered. The characters are multi-dimensional (though I miss the humorous aspects of earlier Quick books) and plot intricate. The identity of the villian is not apparent until the end. Overall, Quick has written an entertaining romance and an intriguing mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific, as usual.","review":"Another enjoyable read with fun and charming characters and all manner of twists and turns.

They only reason I've read this book is because I moved to a new place and didn't have any TV or computer or radio with me, and this was the last resort. Dry Dry DRY!

I read this hoping to get away from the continuing series, but it was just as bad. So many Startling Instances and really bad prose. Whoever this Harriet Klausner is, she writes reviews for every book and praises them. I think she works for the publishing companies, because it's really hard to find an awesome romance novel lately.

Joe Dever's writing style is fabulous. The way he writes fills me with suspence in that I always want to turn to the next section number. The sections usually end with something like \\" before you can do that, something happens that fills your heart with terror!\\" I always wonder, \\"What is happening, I've got to find out!\\" Brian Williams' illustrations are well done.

My suggestion to others is to have a look at Trend Micro's PC-cillan. I installed it on my wife's computer and several computers at work, including my own.

Be warned though; the \\"cooling\\" sensation it creates it no necessarily pleasant to start. I have a minor internal hemorrhoid which I have never had before. It was more swollen then anything, not terribly itchy and not burning at all. This ointment made it feel like it was on fire at first, then turned into a sort of cooling sensation which was not pleasant but not uncomfortable.It is definitely working in terms of reducing the swelling though, the pain/discomfort from the size of it has improved dramatically in just a few hours. I was using Preparation H before trying this, and it did nothing to reduce the size, it only made it slightly soothed/lubricated (vaseline would have worked just as well in my case).

Take a shower and clean the inside of rear with very very warm/hot water, this will relax the tissue and minimize the pain by a very significant amount. 2. Use Tucks Medicated cooling pads to deeply clean that area and provide some additional relieve. Basically this acts as a primer, before you apply this cream on. 3. Afterwards, apply this cream on and around the area. There is no need to apply generously, use a small amount. It will feel as if its a cooling sensation, but its working.

You should feel \\"the first need of his time, the escape from the formless mass he hated.\\" The popularity of Poe is a mystery to Bloom, except in times of hysteria when people become \\"unable to function in a normal social capacity.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting","review":"This book is shallow, judgemental, poorly researched and an insult to any the intelligence of any thinking person. There are some marvelous biographies about Edgar Allan Poe (The one by pulitzer prive winning biographer, Kenneth Silverman, is the best.) To call this a STUDY guide is absurd. It's a slanted, bias, narrow minded piece of propoganda."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Disney Movie since \\"The Lion King\\"","review":"Hercules restored my faith that Disney can still make fun, engaging animated movies (this one's much better than the more recent disappointing Road to El Dorado or The Emperor's New Groove). The animation is dazzling (from the makers of Aladdin and The Little Mermaid), the music is a new take -- gospel, and the characters are funny. The voices include a cast of famous names, such as Tate Donovan and Danny DeVito as Hercules and his goat-man sidekick. The plot is predictable and the storytelling of the Greek myth may be a bit off, but after all, it's Disney. The DVD includes a documentary (\\"The Making of Hercules\\") and a Ricky Martin music video (for the song \\"I Can Go the Distance\\"), and most Disney DVDs hardly have any extras. I wouldn't call this movie a must-buy, but it's a welcome addition to Disney's family of great cartoon movies... and kids will certainly love it, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great effort from Disney, awesome DVD transfer!","review":"Hercules is one of my favorite Disney movies. The story is funny and fast-paced and the songs don't slow anything down. The DVD transfer looks stupendous, everything is crystal clear, colors are vivid, and the sound, lemme tell ya...I felt like I was on Mount Olympus myself. Disney did a great job with this one (that's more than can be said for the Pocahontas DVD...shame on you, Michael Eisner, shame!!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walt Disney Masterpiece HERCULES","review":"Disney's 35th animated flick which isn't the best but its but it's pretty good.@ x's funny & it can be boring but it has a great score with great songs.I think Alan Menken is one of the best composers ever.Buy this Limited Issue!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bronze, not Gold Edition. should have been much better,","review":"This is a horrible transfer. Video quality is poor at best. Should have kept watching the vhs version. This is not widescreen. Fullscreen is 1:33, this is 1:66. The picture is taller and not wider. I was very dissapointed when I saw this is family friendly widescreen. If the black bars are on the sides it is not widescreen. Glad I only paid 10.00, but I still feel ripped off though. Otherwise I love the movie, just wish Disney did not lazily transfer this. Will look for laserdisc instead till bluray comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney Ruined Greek mythology","review":"I like most Disney movies but I hated this one. I love Greek mythology and they ruined it. I can sort of understand some of the changes because this is a movie for kids. However, some of the changes were just stupid. That part were Phil is talking about the other greek heros is horrible. None of them failed and Perseus is a constellation. I did like some of the songs. Disney should have done another myth that would be better suited to be made into a movie for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT one of Disney's Best","review":"The kids like it, so I guess that's all that matters. But overall, It's not what I would consider a Disney Classic. In fact, It's not very memorable. Get \\"Monsters,Inc\\" or \\"Tarzan\\" instead. Chances are your kids won't watch it a second or third time."},{"rating":"1","title":"How inaccurate can ya get?","review":"Alright, I know, I know, this is a children's movie but still. First of all, Hera and Zeus were NOT happily married; she only married him because he raped her. Secondly, Hera was not Hercules' mom nor did she love him, she tried to kill him on numerous occasions. Hercules was one of the offspring of one of Zeus' many \\"consorts\\". Another thing, this is supposed to be Greek mythology, in Greek mythology Hercules was called Heracles and only become Hercules in Roman mythology. Also, there were nine muses not five. Narcissus would be dead and not up on Mount Olympus staring into a mirror; as soon as he discovered himself with his reflection in a lake, he stayed there and slowly died. Gah! I like this movie but it annoys me too much with all the mess ups in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even a DVD presentation of this movie can't save it...","review":"On a widescreen set this over-priced, non-enhanced DVD presentation didn't look too bad. Sorry I can't say the same thing for the content. My 5 year old refused to sit through an entire presentation of this movie on VHS and when I got the DVD I sat down to view it with him and now I understand why. These characters are annoying to say the least, especially the female love interest. The only one I even vaguely liked was Pegasus because he didn't pretend to have any sense. If you want to spend your money on some good Disney animation get \\"Mulan\\" or one of the other classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"I collect Disney movies and this is one I couldn't find anywhere else I love it and would recommend it to anyone who likes Disney movies"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is good but the disc was in very poor condition","review":"Love this movie and wanted to watch it the second I got it in the mail, but put it in to play and froze after the first 20 minutes of watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hercules","review":"I purchased Hercules (Gold Collection) DVD for mynephews girlfriend for a Christmas gift.

Disney's last two films were a real disappointment until \\" Hercules\\" came along. I was really upset that they didn't write up a love song duet for the movie as Disney always does, though \\" Go the Distance\\" made up for it alot.

Maybe when the kids watch it it will lead them to read the real Myths. That's what happened to me as a child after I watched a barely faithful take on Perseus called Clash of the Titans."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best cartoon, and not just for kids","review":"I love this movie a lot. It's creative, amusing and very funny. I was just curious as to where 'Freya', the goddess of love, beaty and fertility was. She was intwined with Hades somehow, I'm pretty sure. Actually, I'm positive because my name is Freya. Anyways, watch the movie. It's excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful kids movie","review":"I was shocked at the content in the jest 10 minutes of this movie.

The animation style is brilliant and wonderous (I love the look of the old style drawing; especially towards the beginning). Tate Donovan does a marvelous job as Hercules, and proves what a wonderful singer he is.The music in HERCULES is also awe inspiring! Alan Menken has done it again! From the uplifting \\"Go the Distance\\" to the awesome '50s style solo by Meg to \\"Zero to Hero,\\" HERCULES is definately one of Disney's best soundtracks, and Alan Menkens most \\"rocking\\" score since NEWSIES!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Kids Movie","review":"This and Jimmy Neutron are my 3 year old's favorite movie. Typically, he doesn't like bad guys that are too scary. Hades, played by James Woods is great and mixes funny jokes in with his evil ways very well. The music is well done and the story is appropriate for kids of all ages. In our house we are sensitive as to whether a \\"G\\" movie is actually \\"G\\".

Don't bother with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible! Worst Disney movie ever!","review":"This movie proves that Disney does not care about the stories they copy! The Lion King was closer to Hamlet then this was to the original myth. Every single mythological character was messed up horribly! The Titans are monsters, Pegasus is a basically flying dog, and the gods are silent shadows of their former self! I expected to find some things different, like not having Hercules killing his wife and Family, but I at least expected some Labors! The jokes are either for people who know Latin, or for five-year-olds, nothing in between. And to top it off the animators tried to make a stylized slanted look to the animation, which ended up making it look like a Saturday Morning cartoon! There are much better Animated movies out of there like Prince of Egypt, Mulan, Aladdin, Antz, and a Bugs Life. Stay away from this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the only Disney animated feature I truly HATE","review":"I have been a huge fan of Disney animation for years. While I may not like many of the features, I can see why they are popular. This movie, however, stinks. Even though it has this Jazz groove going on (and I am a HUGE jazz music fan), I found it trite and dull musically, and in fact quite annoying at many times. This also has a \\"new wave\\" animation style that really is distracting as well. I think Pokemon has better animation style than this movie (I can't believe I can actually say that!).And the story! Well, if you hoped it stuck to the original, forget it. It's a total rewrite of the legend.I'll give credit where credit is due. It's still better than Barney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pinnacle Dissapointment mythology transformed into 'film'","review":"A painful squirm compared to classic mythology.

When I finally did see it, I was pleasantly surprised. It has a fun different feel than any other Disney movie. I dont really like a lot of the modern Disney movies with their different spin on classic fairy tales, but this didnt feel like that. Its very cute and still retains its message. To me, its actually more mature than alot of older Disney films. So, while this is not my fave Disney movie by far, its still a wonderful addition."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Spanish language version has a special guest voice!","review":"Although this one is clearly not one of the all-time best Disney films, and the content is mor haphazardly put together than the hair on Hades' head, there are some razzle dazzle moments and sentimental scenes to warrant a few viewings. But more interestingly, this DVD does include exclusive alternate language versions of the film (in Spanish and French). No one seems to have noticed that in the Spanish version of Hercules, the speaking voice of the adult Herc is provided by none other than singer Ricky Martin! In essence, we are paying essentially for 3 different versions of the movie, and while Martin is still hot, an exclusive collector's item! I am also glad that the alternate versions took enough care in duplicating the voices as closely as possible. It's hard to recommend this film on its own merits, as there are few. But these little extras make the Special Edition DVD worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who put the glad in gladiator?","review":"i love greek mythology , and I don't care how \\"inaccurate\\" the story line is!!

It's Paced like a TV Movie, Most of the Content makes absolutely no sense, It's has too many superhero cliches. The whole idea of a wide eyed Calvin Klein Model that is suppose to be heroic but clumsy: god I've seen this idiot a million times before. To make matters worse the main character has absolutely no life other than moping and wanting to be practically Justin Bieber, at least Cinderella and Snow White had hobbies this guy does nothing! The only part I really enjoyed was the characters of Hades and Meg, that's really it. The rest of the characters are recycled and cliche, the songs suck (except for that mow town song), and it tries to be epic when its giving off an \\"Emperor's New Groove\\" theme.

The wit of Disney story-telling shines through with a perfect fit of rousing musical numbers. All of this, and still you get characters full of charisma and heart (not all, but most).I'm sure that you will find something that you will find appealling, whether it be a new insight on something in your own life, or even one as simple as experiencing a creative and touching Disney film for a few hours.Absolute seal of approval from this Disney fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, terrible video quality.","review":"This review specifically refers to the Gold Collection DVD.

This one I hate with a passion!) and how it made the main character come across as a self-absorbed pig! And the character designs were so Ugly!

Marrying a Pakistani Muslim, he feels he hasn't converted to Islam but has no guts to stand up to his convictions when being forced to change his name to a Muslim one. Despite acknowledging the Official ban on Hindu-Muslim marriage in Pakistan and unbroken legacy of forced conversions, he has the gall to spend 99% of the book criticizing India's openness and secularism (however flawed) & Hinduism in general hiding behind the excesses of RSS, Shiv Sena and BJP. What is sickening is that he feels very little compunction to apply the same standards to a much more closed and brutal society and religion in Pakistan.So here is one more spineless Hindu intellectual essentially apologising to his \\"superior\\" Muslim Masters and in the mean time collecting a few more browny points with the appeasing Liberal Intellectuals in the West.

The atmosphere remains until about the middle. Then it gets stuck in a number of scenes that are too slow, and a description of a villain who is supposed to be provocative, but turns out to be a bitter and disappointing stereotype. I realize that because this is a book about a murder, whoever the author picked to be the culprit wouldn't be nice at all. Still, some of the passages which explain the criminal's character could have been pulled from any cliched argument on temptation and related topics. Another series of scandals, another person who thinks he or she is justified because they were frustrated, and so on. Meanwhile, the countless men and women who don't scoff at their commitments and don't wind up murdering anybody, don't seem to have novels written about them. Pity, that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of good characters...","review":"In fact, way too many of them.

Too many characters and subplots that don't have much bearing on the actual mystery was rather confusing to me at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not blown away by this","review":"I listened to the audio version, and was pretty disappointed. I'm hoping some of the problem is the abridgement. While the book is ostensibly about Hardy, he didn't really seem to play a major role. It was just a grim tale about a LOT of people messing up their lives, and killing a lot of other people in the process.In the middle, Hardy gets some romantic action, after reminiscing about the death of his baby, for which he feels responsible. From his description of events, he IS responsible, so that did nothing to endear the character to me.I saw every plot twist a mile before it happened, and I consider myself a pretty naive reader, so that's not good.I gather this book is one of a series, and wonder if maybe the author is counting on us to already like his principal character. I'll try another Lescroart book, but if it's like this one, it will be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"JVC DRMV5S is defective!","review":"I'll keep this brief: the JVC DRMV5S does NOT play the vast majority of DVDs.

I needed the chairs for a family funeral otherwise, I would have returned them - they were of poor quality - the legs had a gap of at least 1/2 inch between the leg and the seat and they were not of good quality.

It appears that Howells had nothing to write about and did so for roughly 400 pages. The conversations, especially those with the Reverend Walker and more especially those about Savanarola, are dreary, virtually pointless and meander on for an eternity--filigree and no more. The descriptions of Italy would have been best left to travel books and those of the carnivals are ordinary at best. The conflicts confronting Colville, while typical of the literature of this period, seem as forced and artificial as his surrounding characters. Altogether, the novel has no spark and had I not decided to read all of Howells' novels, I would have put it down long ago.\\"The Ambassador\\" leaves this work decidedly in the dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop-Motion in Motion!","review":"This disc proves that the Resfest DVDs are NOT strictly a showcase for digital films. Two outstanding stop-motion shorts are included on this volume: \\"More\\" and \\"Dog\\". Mark Osborne's \\"More\\" is, without question, one of the truly great animated films -- a parable about passion and routine, simple pleasures and self-satisfaction. It's been included on other anthologies, but if you've missed it - SEE IT HERE! Suzie Templeton's (nice to see the work of women directors get some visibility, I might add) \\"Dog\\" is dark, deep and harrowing. A quiet tension builds between son and father, infecting the scene and giving it an urgency not often seen in a short film.That's all I can say. The rest of the films are good, as always, but if the disc were to only include the two stop-motion marvels, it would still be well worth the price. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Intermittently works great","review":"I purchased this device after having to separate our file/print server from the printers by more than the 5 meter USB limit. I first tried a USB-to-cat5 adapter that was way too slow for printing, and instead of getting a dedicated print PC went for the Keyspan PS-4A because it supports all 4 of my printers.I've been using it for a long time now, and for two of the four PCs on our network it works well. The auto-connect feature is good, although I'm finding that users often just manually attach to a printer and forget to let go later. The auto-connect seems to only work intermittently too, and not at all for one of the computers. I've had to periodically unplug/plug the device to reset it. The bottom-line is that after a year I've given up and am looking for another solution. There's just been too many headaches for a device that I should have been able to set-and-forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time and money","review":"This print server is totally unusable device.

Even after getting it set up, it was flakey and kept losing the settings I put in to get it to work. The set up software and instructions were useless and I had to do everything manually.

I am shocked by all the positive reviews. Esp. when so many critics rip apart good movies. This movie came out in '99, so the whole gay thing was already kinda tired then.Jeremy Northram does not work in any way as a redneck convict. He even periodically loses his accent. Much of Zahn's antics seemed a litttle more groan worthy than funny. Macy is kind of sweet as the town's closeted sheriff. But overall this movie just didn't work or seem believable. None of these actors seem like Texans. The plot was kinda stock. Simply not a 5 star movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent in theory","review":"It's difficult to criticize a film whose intentions are so good. Theoretically, Happy Texas has all the elements that make up an entertaining, if forgettable, comedy. Unfortunately, few of those elements come together. The film feels deliberate, labored, and just not very funny. If anything, it's an interesting study in how filmmaking can go awry. The plot is theoretically sound - funny setup, decent nods to the counter culture, a little bit of action... And then there's William H. Macey, a proven powerhouse... A recipe for success, right? Wrong.

Macy plays the closeted gay sheriff of the small town of Happy, TX, who goes by the name of Chappie. This was the only unexpected twist in the movie--when he \\"came out\\" to \\"Steven,\\" or one of the pretend-gay child beauty pageant organisers who come to town. The rest was sort of like \\"Waiting for Guffman\\" by Christopher Guest, but more slapstick-y, more predictable, and more...well, \\"so-what.\\"Watch \\"Happy, Texas\\" on a lazy Sunday while nibbling on crackers or talking on the phone, for that way it will have fulfilled its purpose beautifully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movie!

Also, because I'm a huge fan of Bill Macy, since I enjoyed him so much in Fargo. Do not buy or rent this movie under any circumstance. I could not empathize with any of the characters. For example, the blonde chick who played the banker reminded me so much of Holly Hunter, who I cannot stand whatsoever. The two guys who played the pageant directors were so dumb and ignorant, that it insulted me beyond belief. I had no compassion or feeling for them either way. I didn't even bother to read their names listed on the DVD. Macy did a good job in his portrayal, but I'm amazed that he would be involved in this piece of .....!

At the very least, it sounds like it'll be an unholy meld of slapstick and cheeseball cutesiness. It does incorporate both elements, but with honest restraint. The rest of the movie is warm and enjoyable, chock full of characters you actually *gasp* care about. And while you're busy wondering how that happened, you're also laughing your ass off.

Steve Zahn is brilliant, discovering it's okay even for a macho man to have a feminine side (after giving a young charge what will prove to be an invaluable lesson in landing a punch!).

I was very pleasantly surprised, however. It is a well-written comic farce, with a great script and a first-rate cast. Along with the inventive and very funny script, there is even a touch of pathos.

This book is one of the best of the series; it is loaded with action, suspence and mystery. It doesn't take you long to get into the book and the last half of the book was especially good. Although, as good as this book is, the original edition, which is nearly the same, is even better and is the version that I would recommend reading because the writing is more rich and descriptive.
