Then one day, a friend of mine showed me the day the whole world went away single. I had not known about it, I do not listen to the radio, and no longer watch MTV. I was pretty saisfied with it. So I thought The Fragile would be really good. I was wrong. A lot of the songs are boring and repetitive in a Ministry-like way. I did in enjoy a few of the songs, but overall, its quite a disappointment. Pretty Hate Machine gives you beautiful electronic music. Broken gives you some really loud guitar filled songs. And The Downward Spiral is just amazing. The Fragile gives you nothing. I feel Trent Reznor has lost it. And I noticed he had some help from Dr. Dre on The Fragile, too. It is sad his good talents will be wasted with Dr. Dre. But, all good things come to an end. It was nice listening to you Trent, now go sellout and enjoy yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzz........","review":"Wake me up when it's over. This is the most boring album I own. There are too many interludes and any interesting musical idea is dragged on six minutes too long. This album makes mid-seventies King Crimson albums sound focused. The only similarity between this and The Wall is that there are two cds. Pink Floyd kept things moving, conveyed its ideas and had GOOD SONGS. I don't need to go track by track because each one sounds like the last one. Glut of content does not make a good album. Trent is creatively dead. This cd gets one star for ambition, zero for performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Fragile for taste","review":"I am a devout NIN fan and it pains me to say this album was a disappointment beyond belief. I had to force myself to listen to this twice(with a 4 year gap in between). It seems Trent has been treated for his maniac-depressive behavior so apparent on his other albums. With the exception of Starfu**ers inc (where he obviously missed his lithium for the day)the album was a total waste of creative flow. The songs lacked any type of energy and seemed to be incoherent mumbled sounds. Come on Trent! Please do better next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"the hopelessly redundant","review":"This is the worst CD purchase i've ever made.

I gave mine away for 75cents to get a drink it sucked so bad. If you like this then you suck just as much as trent reznor does. Go spend you money on something more worthwhile.

This Cd is crap and so r u if u own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Genious","review":"I, like many other TRUE Nine Inch Nails fans have been anticipating The Fragile. Finally, the day it is released. We've heard TDTWWA single (most of use about 80,000 times) but those are only 3 songs. We don't know what it's going to sound like. I must admit, the first time I listened to it I felt disappointed with Trent. However, just like the TDTWWA single you must listen to it 4 or 5 times to really appreciate. Now I feel that this album is sheer genious. Even though it kind of seems to sound more like Pretty Hate Machine than any of the other albums, it is totally different. While it isn't as heavy as The Downward Spiral or Broken the complexities have increased. For example, one of my favorite tracks, The Great Below, is the same kind of sound as Hurt, but much more complex. IF YOU ARE A TRUE NINE INCH NAILS FAN YOU ALREADY HAVE THIS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't blow me away","review":"This record left me pretty disappointed. For a double album, the range of textures and tempos is amazingly flat. There's no \\"Big Man with a Gun,\\" no \\"March of the Pigs,\\" no \\"Head Like a Hole.\\" Nothing that really rocks loud. Even after a dozen listens, the only impression I get is that this is a sluggish record. I wouldn't rush out to buy this record if you haven't yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good-But Long","review":"Let me start by saying that this is a good CD. Don't get me wrong I like the CD and it is probably NIN's best (better than \\"the downward spiral\\" definately). But, it is a little bit too long. Navigating throught this two disc collection is usually a good experience, except there are some very inconsistent parts. I fell asleep listening to both CD's in a row. Still, I would recommend the CD, although it is long and inconsistent at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"End Your Millenium in Style!","review":"Fans of the old NIN can whine all they want. They will always have the old albums. Something about NIN always seemed special to me, yet I couldn't quite put my finger on it. The old stuff sounded like it was on the right track but I didn't seem interested enough to plunk down the cash. With \\"The Fragile\\" the band seemed like it had reached a turning point. I am really impressed with the double album and it is one of the best I've heard. This music just seems so more colorful and interesting than thge old, dark stuff. I know Trent looks up to many influences, including Gary Numan. The electronics remind me of Gary Numan's \\"The Pleasure Priciple\\" with guitar bleended in perfectly for the NIN feel. \\"The Fragile\\" is a great piece of art bound to possibly become the event of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"i have been a NIN fan for years. i was highly anticipating, yet fearing this album at the same time. everyone was saying that Trent was going to sell out and everything, but i was quite surprised to see that this album sounds similar to TDS, which is good. both the CDs in this album are good, but the first one (\\"left\\") is definately a little better. you MUST get this!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hauntingly Beautiful Masterpiece","review":"Amidst the hype, the MTV apperances, arrives a new Trent, and a new album. To anyone who says it wasn't as good, or NIN sounds different, they are truly lost. The new album spins further into our deep dispairs, and through such loss, we find an unyeilding sense of hope, that even the damned can overcome the odds and live and love. Each song from the Fragile is like another layer of genius from Trent, with deep and rich melodic tones, and overwhelming drums and riffs, this double disk set delivers it up on a silver plater. A CD for all emotions, a must have in any collection, The Fragile is yet another insight to the music of tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A album that gets under your skin and defines a generation","review":"For years, I've been looking for an album to define the '90s. Each decade had its band and album. The '50s saw the height of the Beatles. The '60s saw the Doors. The '70s had Led Zeppelin. And the '80s had Metallica. But where does that leave the '90s. Some think it was Nirvana, but most definitive bands last at least the decade it defines. Pearl Jam could fit the mold, if only they wouldn't define the hippie-gen as well. But enough, the band/album has to adhere to the social climate. Ours has been an uncertain one, where techonology and conflict escalates. Where the youth feel helpless but still hopefull. Looking to an future that's both awe-inspiring as well as horrifing. With that, i define what our album, and band, needs to be. One that captures both the faith and the confusion, along with the love and hate. And that band/album is Nine Inch Nails' The Fragile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Better Than Pretty Hate Machine","review":"I absolutely fell in love with NIN's Pretty Hate Machine and have been waiting for a follow-up album that was at least half as good. Unfortunately, Broken was simply a loud noise-fest. The Downward Spiral was a sufficient purchase with tracks like \\"A Warm Place\\" and \\"Hurt\\". The Fragile, while much more satisfying than The Downward Spiral, still does not come close to the emotional journey of Pretty Hate Machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"a dark, ecliptic trip to the egde of the universe.","review":"With \\"Downward Spiral\\" Reznor picked us up and brought us on a voyage like no other. Now, much later, he's back and continues to express his personal angst and thoughts on life. It also seems like Reznor was less inspired though in making this very appetizing album. It seems almost as if he used so much emotion in the last album that he's all out and now he's taking a breath and relaxing providing more trip-hop grooves and less aggressive vocals. I think this album lacks the confidence of the last but clearly shows an artist maturing, reinventing himself.............cheers to the man, he's been under enough pressure to make this album- I'm amazed he pulled it off as good as he did. Kudos Trent."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the wait","review":"I don't know why Trent Reznor can never seem to get happy, but it's good to be angry again. This album isn't quite as awesome as Broken but it definitely betters The Downward Spiral. It may not have a \\"Closer\\"-esque single-worthy dance number, yet it certainly does pack a punch as a whole. Very inventive sounds, not at all redundant. Into the Void is a huge highlight. Not for the fragile, but not just for long-term, hardcore fans, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius!","review":"Trent has done it yet again- this is a work of genius. Every song is amazing, a symphony of pain and delight mixed into one. I will not be able to take this out of the CD player for a very long time. Thank you Trent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reznor gets into his Fragile side","review":"No more headbanging. Reznor uses all his musical capabilities in this record. If you think NINE INCH NAILS was all about senseless rocking, listen to this record and send me your impressions. You will be taken into a world of atmospheric moods that you can harldy notice in another mainstream recording. Reznor is a very influentil musician. It still sounds like Nails, but it has reached it's mature state. The Fragile is a very versatile product, listen to it carefully, you will find new stuff every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important album by NIN.","review":"My favorite NIN album remains The Downward Spiral, allthough who can deny that This album (The Fragile) anything short of great. The songs on this album are smart and unusual. The music is dark and industrial....the whole album (2 CD's full of music) makes any fan of music extra happy. Awesome album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a musical masterpeice","review":"Trent Reznor is an extremely talented singer and song writer. His writing is perfect, music is mezmerizing and wonderfully crafted. He has a message that should be heard: the world is not all daisys and fairytales. In my opinion, his music is not intended for the mainstream pop culture. It is simply intended to tell a story that in in is mind. The music has an appeal to the deepest parts of the soul. In my opinion, this is the perfect album to sit back and reassess the thoughts and views of such a horrible time we live in."},{"rating":"2","title":"nINE iNCH cREATURES eXPOSED","review":"In case you didn't find my little acranyme, the fragile is NICE. It is that and a WHOLE lot more. I had been anticipating on the release of this album since the rumors started that recording had started. I waited and waited and waited like many others for the long over due release date. When the day finally came I was in complete awe. I thought the Downward Spiral was the best piece of musical genious until I heard the Fragile. It was all I could ask for and a ton more.

It does what only great music can do well. Reznor, like Beethoven or Mozart, can, and does on many of The Fragile's tracks, create music that encapsulates a mood in its entirety. This, to me, is a tremendous feat. Few musicians can do this. It is a sign that after 11 years, NIN has finally reached maturity. It has been a long process, each studio album better than its predecessors, and this is the latest step. Where Reznor goes from here I do not know, though I shall watch attentively. I know there is more music left in him. Like I said, this album is better than all other NIN albums before it, but it is still NIN, and NIN fans will still like it. If you like good music, try this album out a couple of times and try not to like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece!","review":"Simply put this is a concept album masterpiece! It flows together very poetic lyrics it also strikes emotion on the listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fragile","review":"Nine Inch Nails' the Fragile released in 1999 was the first full length album released by the band since 1994's the Downward Spiral. The album begins with the anger and depression assiociated with Trent Reznors life and takes you on autobiographical journey through the loss of his grandmother and a life or death struggle with heroin addiction. The music illustrates his pain in the two discs of amazing music; it is definitely an album to listen to from start to finish. Although this album did not enjoy as much popular success as The Downward Spiral I believe it is a much better album and it is worth the extra money for the double disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb masterpiece","review":"this album is pure genius, something only trent reznor could create. unique and hypnotizing-the more i listen to it, the more i love it. somewhat slower and deeper than previous albums. so, if you only like the harder, rawer sound of nin, maybe this album is not for you. otherwise, you will love this two disk set. speaking personally, this is my favorite nin album yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's lost his touch, will someone please piss him off again.","review":"I was a BIG fan of NIN, until this one, now I'm just a fan.

These songs lack so much of the originality of previous work that I must ask, why not a triple album, these songs could've been written in a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is Reznor's best work to date and easily the greatest album of 99.If your looking for the older Trent like in Broken which is all loud and crazy don't look in this album.This is more of a mature Trent,there are still a couple of loud ones.Don't get me wrong if he wanted to do a crazy album he can do it better than anyone that's out there.If you are a hardcore NIN fan you need to get this now it is amazing.There is so much emotion in this it's just great.

One thing about NIN that really makes the band (or should I say Trent) stand out is the track-list order. This album really is best listened to on the computer, one song flowing into the other, both Left and Right CD's, and then just delete the so-out-of-place \\"Starf***ers Inc.\\" track. This is not an easy album to get into, but once you've given it a chance it'll easily rest atop NIN's other excellent works with its cohesive design."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I expected much more when listening to this cd, especially after waiting so long for it's release.

He's lucky to have great machines that create sound effects, otherwise he'd be out of a job. And his voice, the only time it sounds good is when he distorts it to make it sound interesting, when really it has nothing to do with talent. The instrumentals on this album sound good, especially the piano snipets. But doesn't all piano music sound good and intriguing when looking at it in the right angle? He could be playing 3 Blind Mice on the piano and adding all these special effects to it and you all would love it and call it original music, especially when he throws in some violin sampled loop. All this album is, is mainstream music's attempt at sounding original. You people are reaching out to fill your artist void, I just hope you fill it in with something else. Maybe the Dixie Chicks really are a better alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring music, moronic lyrics","review":"I WAS a NIN fan...until I bought the much anticipated, much delayed Fragile 2CD experience. He takes five years to write this stuff, and whadda we get? His BAD Aphex Twin impersonation. After trying for 3 days to listen to the first CD through, I got to the marginally better 2nd CD. Of course the songs that caught my ear, I soon realized were the ones that sampled from his previous CDs. Nothing caught my attention (not a problem with Broken, TDS, PHM & FDTS) The lyrics were also crawling up my butt, cmon, \\"I try to save myself but myself keeps sliping away\\"? please! Maybe he can help the local High School write their rally cheers too. The album is boring, bland and a shining example of filler gone wild. So my point is, save your money, keep your pants on and buy ...Sarah MacLachlan she seems to be doing harder stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prog Rock Shame","review":"This album is as bloated as a whale in labor. The Fragile is an inert mass; it just sits there for 104 minutes, wasting time and space. Trent is like a second-hand Yes, in as much as he's putting out terminally pretentious, self-indulgent records. Of course Yes were at least technically proficient and somewhat inventive. Trent's music is like an hour and a half of flatulence. This bites, buy The Dead C."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album really blows!","review":"For once NIN actually came out with something new and not re-mixed and it sucks. They randomly throw sounds out througha computer and they call it music?!? I have the other albums (all but broken and fixed) and they are ok -- aside from the remixes...

You cant put garbage on a CD (double cd at that) and expect that just because your name is on it people will worship it.... this NIN can stay on the shelf IMHO..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite CD sets that I own","review":"I could have kicked myself when I found that I had left this CD set at my friend's house one night. Much to my relief, two days later when I came back over it was still there! This set is one of the best albums NIN has ever done. Some of my faves are: The Wretched, The Big Come Down, and Where is Everybody. Really very edgy and completely different from most of his earlier work, Reznor outdid himself on this CD. This set is a must have for any NIN fan. The set comes with a booklet with the complete lyrics to every song on the 2-CD set, something which I place high value on when I look for CDs because there is always that one song where no matter how many times you listen to it, you can never quite get the words down that someone is saying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manson has Overtaken Reznor","review":"What a let-down. I waited five years for this? This is artistic progression? The sad thing (for Trent) is, how he knocks Manson (his protogee,)all over the place, but in the five years it took Trent to deliver this half cooked, overstuffed load Manson progressed from the underachieving \\"Portrait\\" to the watershed of \\"Antichrist\\" to one of the best albums of last year, \\"Mechanical Animals\\". In that time, I became a huge Manson fan, so the mediocrity of this album was a sad revelation. Once again, the student has surpassed the Master. Reminds me of \\"Amadeus\\": poor old Salieri, cursing Mozart because his talent casts a shadow on Salieri's Weakness. (No, I'm not comparing Manson to Mozart, so don't even think about calling me on that!) Anyhoo, as long as it's one less album from some airheaded teenage dance pop slut/prettyboy, it has some value...I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"I've been listening to this all day and it isn't doing much for me.

However, as a jazz lover, I heard \\"La Mer\\" at a social function played by a totally eclectic DJ. I quickly asked, \\"Wow, WHO the heck is that?!\\" I couldn't believe it was NIN! I bought the CD just to check out the other compositions and enjoyed them as well. Never followed the band in their hey-day, too dark and satanic for my taste. But as a lover of fresh sounds, I'm glad to add this one to my extensive (and yes electic) library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeper.","review":"If we are looking at Trent Reznor's repertoire, The Fragile must be heard for what it is. Since Reznor only puts out one release every five years, we are looking at three full length cds to compare: Pretty Hate Machine (1989), The Downward Spiral (1994) and The Fragile (1999). Each cd has its own merits, to be sure. The Fragile is a masterpiece both musically and sonically. Two discs that take you right where Trent wants you. An excellent song cycle, The Fragile rages and weeps, and keeps the listener interested for nearly two hours. I think Trent will be around for years to come as a purveyor of industrial music that stands out and has something to offer the mainstream. This, and his other two cds are must haves for any rock collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extremely beautiful album","review":"The Fragile may not be a big step away from \\"The Downward Spiral\\" but I'm not complaining. That's like complaining that \\"The White Album\\" wasn't a huge step away from \\"Sgt. Pepper\\"...they're still great albums! You can't get too much of a good thing.The main difference may not be extremely different musically, but the message is a complete 180. Whereas \\"The Downward Spiral\\" was an album full of hatred, suicide, depression, and revenge, \\"The Fragile\\" is exactly the opposite - love, redemption, lost hope, and peace. 95% of the songs are great. \\"Starf**kers, Inc\\" is an embarassment, but I think he intended it that way because it SOUNDS like a Marilyn Manson song and it's most likely about him. \\"The Day The Whole World Went Away\\" is just annoying after a few listens. Other than that, the album is classic material, although not as good as \\"The Downward Spiral\\" or \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fragile....

Nope.","review":"I like NIN to a point, but the truth is Reznor isn't a visionary, and he doesn't tread any new musical ground. Big Black(though not exactly an \\"industrial\\" band) put out records in the 80s that not only laid the groundwork for what later became \\"industrial rock\\", but also blow bands like NIN completely out of the water.... all recorded on a DIY budget that's probably equivalent to what it cost Trent to record and produce ONE of the tracks on The Fragile. The Big Black song \\"Kerosene\\" alone contains more genius and intensity than this entire 2-disc set combined."},{"rating":"1","title":"They could be so much better","review":"I bought this cd hoping for something as good or even better than their first album \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" but what I got was an album like the \\"Downward Spiral\\" with a slow beat and sick lyrics.

The comes along The Great Below. Just fantastic.No other musician can express such a wide range of emotion, without turning the music into schlock. As with every other NiN release, Trent proves that he is one of the few musicians that is worthy of the title artist.

But, you gotta give it at least 2 stars just because of the high quality of production done on these discs. I was also rather surprised at how much maturing the reznor sound has undergone in 5 years, its much more playful. Some of the tracks are absolutely beautiful, Just like you imagined, and La Mer are awesome. Stop singing, and this album is 4 stars (is anyone just a little tired of the the whole angst/personal issues thing?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"miserable","review":"Here we go again. More of the same from Trent Reznor. Two discs chock full of his angst, depression, unhappiness, etc., etc. Despite all the praise heaped on Mr. Reznor, I think he is an extremely overrated artist. Come on, Trent. Try something other than the \\"I'm miserable\\" routine for your next disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let the anti-socials of the world rejoice--New NIN","review":"Nine Inch Nails and it's leader Trent Reznor are some of the most overrated musical figures that are around today. This is a band that had one good CD, Pretty Hate Machine and a few good songs off its' successor The Downward Spiral. The latter being a perfect description of this band since their initial outing. Trent Reznor is a psychopath and listening to him ramble throughout this disc is nausiating. People say how deep and meaningful his lyrics are. What kind of childhood did these people have? Didn't anybody ever give you a hug? If life is so bad Trent, take yourself out and stop burying us with your misery. This disc continues the decline for NIN. I can't believe that they put this out in 2 discs. There isn't enough material for one disc. But if you are into anger and drum machines, enjoy!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Life Really Isn't So Bad, I Promise!","review":"It is hard to believe that music such as this was ever relevant, but apparently it was. Mr. Reznor and his cohorts continue to amaze the youth of America who have \\"no one that understands them\\" and bore and embarass the old coots like me who grew out of this moody brooding back in the first half of the last decade. Don't get me wrong, I would rather see a child of mine listen to NIN than be a swing kid...no wait, I wouldn't, and that's saying a great deal considering my deep DEEP dislike of that whole swing deal. Rather than let his bad vibes spoil everyone else's day, Trent should wipe off the spiffing blue eyeshadow (oooh...disturbed, man), take the money he makes off this two-disc set, buy a nice house in the tropics, and retire to a life of leisure."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Those About To Rock I Salute You","review":"I have never known an artist to change their sound as much as Trent Reznor. On the Downward Spiral, he had some great songs but this is where he really pulls the talent together to make an album, not a collection of songs. This is a CD for the patient type, don't rush it and it sound perfect. The only other CD I can compare this to is Pink Floyd's the Wall. Those who like that will love this and vice versa."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of NIN's Best......Trent, your absolutely amazing !","review":"NIN has definitely come back. Just when I thought I've heard Trent's best, he shocks me! This CD is purely addicting. The lyrics are deeply heartwrenching and the entire CD will take you on an emotional roller-coaster. I definitely recommend this CD, especially to pure NIN fans and if your not, you will be. You WILL be satisfied! Once you get it, turn it up LOUD and sit back and LISTEN. The entire CD will touch you in ways you CAN'T even imagine. Keep em' comin NIN!........We're in this together Trent !"},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit too boring","review":"I was really looking forward to the \\"maybe best album\\" by NIN. After listening to it I have to say that I was disappointed and find it rather boring. There m��y be two songs I like okay, but the others seem too slow and of not much variety to me.Maybe I have to listen to it more to really appreciate it, but up to this point I am just disappointed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rush that leaves you exhausted and wanting more!!!!","review":"Trent has again done it with his hard driving assults, and his quiet moments of reflection. The wait between the fragile and tds were well worth the wait, it gave Trent some time to gain a new outlook, however dark that may be. LONG LIVE NIN!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Like I Imagined.....","review":"Well this IS better than TDS in my opinion- offering a much more mature approach to expressing the dark, painful, yet completely human feelings riddled throughout NIN music.My favourite track is without doubt the humble 3 minute instrumental, \\"Just Like I Imagined\\"... there's something going on in that song which is numbing to the mind when listened to LOUD. (like a discman cranked)I suggest that techno freaks (such as me), heavy music fans (rammstein et. al) should both find this a VERY worthwhile addition to the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible depth...","review":"Pounding drums, hypnotic guitar riffs, pulsating grooves, melodic intermissions. This is one incredibly layered musical release. Trent continues to display his mastery of a wide variety of musical instruments and talented production techniques that coalesce many obscure sounds into a coherent body of work. The Fragile displays more maturity than the previous \\"halos\\" combined. Folks, like Billy Corgan, need to stick to their own genre because they cannot compete with this. No wonder the Smashing Pumpkins pushed back their release date for the new album, I would too. Marilyn Manson can only dream to be this talented."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS CD!!!","review":"This is by far the best Nine Inch Nails CD to date... Its well writen and but together... A must have for music lovers..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You","review":"I really have only one thing that comes to mind when I listen to this: Thank You. Thank you Trent for uping the anty once again. Thank you Trent for showing us how beautiful music can be and what it is capable of. Thank you Trent for showing us that patience is a virtue. Thank you Trent for being you. Rock on NIN."},{"rating":"2","title":"First listen earned my top10, 20 listens later its #1","review":"I waited 5 damn years for Reznor to quit remixing and hanging out w/ Bowie. Ask anyone, I was PISSED! But you know, its really worth it. This is definitely the best NIN album, all Reznors range is on this album. Take La Mer, he goes from a classical bent, to a muzak/jazzy space, to an industrial mass of noise, in the same song! Hot tracks are The Fragile, WITT, somewhat damaged, La Mer, The Great Below (current fav.), I'm looking forward.. (now THAT sounds like Tom Waits, and the Eels, oddly enough). But really though, all the songs are good to excellent. Worst is Starf*, which is actually pretty good. Buy it, buy 2, give them as Christmas presents, whatever, it's an excellent album that appeals to just about everyone, regardless of what you think of NIN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius, Five Years In The Making...","review":"Put down your copy of that Limp 'Significant Other' nonsense already and put in some real music..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strikingly original music, but sometimes cliche lyrics","review":"It seems like a bad CD by Trent Reznor is better than a good CD by anyone else, so how do you rate this? I think some of the layered melodies border on genius. Some of the lyrics border on cliche and self pity. Overall brilliant, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all","review":"I had to be critical when I put The Fragile on. I've been a NIN listener for several years and sincerely doubted that this album was worth the wait and that it definitely wasn't worth the hype. However, I can't help but come back to The Fragile. Its irresistible quality makes it an essential pop record for 99, confirming that something can be catchy and still maintain a degree of sophistication and intelligence. The highlights are the tracks which stray the most from the formula: \\"La Mer,\\" \\"The Great Below,\\" \\"The Frail,\\" \\"The Big Comedown\\" (the only track which really conveys the Tom Waits influence that Reznor continually mentioned)... There are plenty of filler tracks that make the album more palettable to past fans and those concerned with rock licks as well. Not necessarily the masterpiece some claim it to be, but the Fragile is an interesting development in pop music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reznor Matures Musically - He does it again","review":"Well, he's done it again - on his own terms. A marked progression, consistent on all NIN albumns, has shown through again. Refined to almost unbelievable extents, this albumn should be considered a modern masterpiece. Eclectic at times, illustrated best perhaps in the tracks \\"even deeper\\" and \\"pligramage\\", it shows an iceberg of musical exploration that we only get to see the tip of - yet at the same time following tried and true NIN themes. Take my advice; listen to it all the way through right away, it will all become very clear..."},{"rating":"2","title":"NIN ROCK!!!!!","review":"This is another great album by NIN!!!!! Proably not as good as The downward spiral but still good. Trent's vocals don't feature that much on this 1, as it is more instrumental, but never the less this is still a great NIN album. With its dark and funky beats on this 1 it makes it all and all a very well put together album. Trent is a God!!! NIN ROCK!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"mixture","review":"I was at first immediately turned off from this CD because it's not what I was expecting from Trent Reznor (NIN). I was expecting something that sounded a little more like \\"The Downward Spiral\\" and/or \\"Broken\\". However, after listening to it, I began to appreciate it alot for what it is and it has become my favorite NIN record of all time. It is not the same NIN as the Downward Spiral. Think of this album as a mix of old TDS Era NIN, Radiohead, VAST, etc. This is Trent's masterpiece and is the best double CD release ever (yes, better than Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\"). It's a beautiful album. I can't wait for their new album due out this year called \\"With Teeth.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my top 5 albums.","review":"No other main release NIN album has stuck me the way this one has. I won't speak for the mix albums. >,> It feels like listening to this album that every song on both CD's save the transition pieces are worthy of topping the charts. This isn't exactly made for radio either though. It breaks typical forms in favor of the progressive. Add to that Reznor sings with incredible energy. His latest radio play just seems simple in comparison without the climax found here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concept Album Genius","review":"As a hardcore industrial/metal fan for many years, loving many obscure bands and more mainstream ones like NIN, I have been waiting for something original for ages. One problem with Trent is - he NEVER brings out new songs. Until now.Not only is the album filled with some of the best atmospheric-industrial music ever created but he has exploited emo-metal to its full potential. The structure of the album is amazing. You can play either CD first, and it still makes sense....try it.This is probably the best non classical album I own, and the recording quality, and producing on the first track blew me away.Certainly the best NIN album to date - I am expecting big things in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat Damaged","review":"I am a big NIN fan, there isn't anything that they have made that I didn't like. The Fragile by far outshines their earlier works, it follows \\"The Downward Spiral.\\" Trent Reznor put all he had into this album, you can see his evolution in music with every song. I highly reccommend it even for those who aren't NIN fans because this album will change your outlook totally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Admitted to child sexual abuse","review":"November 17, 2005 - A settlement has been reached in connection with a Roman Catholic priest accused of sexual abuse.

I have met the author and she is a very intelligent woman. However despite her intelligence and writing ability, this book was terrible. The entire book is a soap opera, the characters sleeping with one another and then blaming their actions on someone else's black magic. Would I recommend it to anyone? no."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Spectacular Novel","review":"This novel is an unbelievable first offering from an author. A first read of this novel can be confusing, but a second reading reveals the true depth of the work. All of the characters are interelated and show true talent. The book may be difficult for some, due in part to its non-linear plot line. This book is a must read for any true lover of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talented writing and intriguing story","review":"I found this book interesting because of the amazing ways in which Powers is able to weave together several different people, stories, and time periods with beauty and intrigue....

It's practically lyrical, the sentences are so pretty. The dust jacket is more than a little off on the plot, so don't read that. It's a collection of self contained stories about a messed up family living on a reservation in North Dakota.Each story is narrated by a different person and takes place a random number of years before the last one. The effect is that each new chapter gives you a different understanding of the events in the previous chapters, until you get back to the \\"present\\" time from the first chapter, where you have a completely new take on everyone involved.It's unusual to find a short story collection this good from such a new author. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a book of unforgettable images","review":"Susan Power's GD is a novel that is full of unforgettable and striking images, introducing a world that has never been fully exposed to mainstream readers. I read the book in a college class and was very touched by its portrayal of family, love, and magic. Although the novel does digress somewhat in its later sections, the ending does leave one satisfied and enriched with a new cultural perspective. This is a novel that would be of particualr interest to anyone who loved Toni Morrison's Beloved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another world","review":"Loved this although its taken me 10 years of ownership to read. Glad I kept it. A connected collection of short stories about modern Sioux life that makes up a single narrative. It was such a great look into another view of the world, one that makes the familiar seem exotic and different. I felt like I've journeyed to another world. The Grass Dancer left me with the sense of wonder that you usually have after a fantasy novel. But this is lit fic and very well written. Great characters: Pumpkin the grass dancer, Charlene Thunder, her teenage crush Harley Wind Soldier, grandmother Mercury Thunder the witch, Red Dress, woman warrior from the past. Lots of insights into the Sioux spiritual world and into the modern life of American indians Jane RoutleyMage Heart (The Dion Chronicles)"},{"rating":"2","title":"No more heating up the house!","review":"I read many of the reviews, both positive and negative, before I decided to buy the Nordic Ware microwave pressure cooker. I own an old pressure cooker that belonged to a friend's grandmother, but since I live in Southern California, it never got a lot of use. It just made the house too hot, leaving something to cook for 2 1/2 - 3 hours. For this same reason, I don't do a lot of baking. I paid very close attention to the negative comments and made certain that I didn't over do it on the liquid. I cooked 3 large chicken breasts in about 3/4 cup of chicken stock for 10 minutes. I then left it out on my counter to let the steam release. I had tender, juicy chicken that was so good! I am so glad I bought this. It's going to make my life so much nicer (and COOLER!). All I can say is a hearty thank you to the person who sold it as used, but looked brand new."},{"rating":"1","title":"NICE THE SHORT TIME IT LASTED","review":"Bought this cooker approximately one year ago.

I've used it primarily for cooking rice and the results are outstanding. Simply add 1 cup of rinsed white rice and 2 cups of water, place in microwave for 10 mins. and the rice is perfect.

I was exicted about the idea of it and used it today to cook some turnip greens with a little ham to see how tender they would get in 30 minutes. They came out great, but the metal ring attached to the top of the cooker came off and the glue they use to hold it appears to be little more than the glue that you use hold stickers or labels on. It was very soft and came right off my hand as well. I contacted Nordic Ware and they said I could go a buy some silicone adhesive at any hardware store to reattach the part and that this was not uncommon. They of course do not carry the adhesive. I did line up everything up and used it again and the item is functional, but now I am totally concerned about long term use. Since I can use the product, I will not go to the inconveniece of returning it, but Amazon should do something with Nordic Ware in regard to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for ADD cooking","review":"My mother-in-law got me one of these many years ago, and I've found it to be the best artichoke cooker ever.

My mother-in-law didn't understand, since she's never had an artichoke, but we just love them so it's been used a lot here.

Im not sure if I still have it, but I want to get another one. It is really designed for cooking for 1-2 maybe 3 people, but I really liked it. I never had any problems with the seal or anything coming apart. Some people may have a hard time with smaller (dorm like) microwaves with clearance.

The authors refer you to page 117 for more on this image but alas, no technique there either.I bought the book to generate some ideas as I'm new to portrait post processing.

Of course, we have the requisite pedaphile subplot in several scenes, as one of the main characters finds himself gathering the attentions of the head priest. Does anybody else find this situation a little contrived? I mean, can we have a Catholic priest in a film sometime who isn't a pedaphile?

Unlike other Victorinox products, the knives quality parallels the price. The blade is flimsy and provides little confidence that it would not break. The knives arrive reasonably sharp, but not nearly as sharp as other Victorinox knives. They dull easily and unlike other Victorinox knives, sharpening does not help all that much. My guess is that the steel used is too think and possibly different from what Victorinox uses for other knives.

The handle was cheaper than usually found, little bits of it extended from it like leftovers not removed and was not comfortable to hold. It was not smooth as other knife handles are but grainy somehow. Worse, it was not sharp as it should have been, rather, dull as an old knife in a drawer might be. It did not do the job intended very well: cutting fruits & veggies. It was not able to cut through an apple very well or the peel, tore rather than cut. It is no where near as great as the Wusthof Silverpoint II 3-Inch Spear Point Paring Knife which is reasonably priced (although on Amazon, price went up directly after I bought it), good to hold and cuts like a dream, it even went through the thick stem of cauliflower with ease.

Not as sharp as I expected but you can sharpen it with a stone like another reviewer mentioned and because of the composition of the blade make it as sharp as you want.

They go to school full-time and work jobs also, so a good night's sleep is vital for them. My youngest said he slept like a baby and it's like having a whole new mattress. My oldest said he loved it!

She asked us if we could read, and of course we can, so she said we would have no problems. Our baby is 7 months and we also have a 3 yr. old and the gate works perfect for us.

It was the only swinging gate I could find to fit our wide doorway. It took us hours of cursing and screaming to install, and then went downhill from there. My 13 month old son has now figured out how to move the gate in order for him to open it, however, houseguests can't even figure out the latch.What sent me over the top was when the \\"stationary\\" wall mount came unglued and my son pinched his fingers in between the pieces of wood. I bought this hoping it would be a wonderful step to take in keeping my son safe, three months later we are flushing [item price] down the toilet because it has started to be more of a home hazard than a safety precaution.

It takes two hands and you have to lift up on the gate to get it to latch. Everytime you open the gate you have to readjust so it will close again. This was a complete waste of money and time!

This was a nice idea, but does not work very well. I went and bought a Kidco configure gate... and what a difference.

The stair case has a more narrow bottom than the top (b/c of a ledge on the bottom), so it was near impossible to find any gate that would work right at the top of the stairs (since the top & bottom usually need to be the same width). We had to get creative and find a gate that would enclose a larger area around the top of the staircase. This is the only gate we could find that would work.The gate took some time to put together, but it seems very sturdy and is NOT easy to open. I cannot imagine how my son could ever open the gate, as it usually requires both hands for me to do it.I was skeptical about buying this gate after seeing all the bad reviews here, but I've been very happy with it. We were in desperate need of a gate and as I said, this is the only one we could find that worked.

The first 13 pages of the instruction book is smartly used to describe the construction of this gate with parts that aren't even included in the box. And after you do enjoy the hunt for the description on how to put the thing together, get ready to embark on a fascinating journey of incomprehensible instructions anyway. And of course, who could forget about designing the gate with an actual lever or handle, and instead focus on the unique design of compressing molded plastic as a locking device. Which is probably not needed anyway, since any little weight on the gate will open it. But that's fine, the last thing you want is for your child to whine and complain when they want to fall down the stairs and have to get you to open the gate for them. Pure genius!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS GATE!","review":"I purchased this gate because we needed one that opened and also would work for wide spaces. Not only can my son open it (he was 7 months old when we purchased it) by leaning on it but to make matters worse the gate fell apart this time and fell on him. I had already called Evenflo and they said that was the first time they had heard that a child could lean on it and it popped open. They said they would send us a new one. After another week or so with the old gate it when it completely fell part and fell on top of my little boy. I called Evenflo again because I had not received the new gate and told them that under no circumstances did I want the same gate again.

We did this before we read reviews of gates and now I'm wishing we had read them before buying a gate. ...I was so disappointed with this product that I feel I need to say something too. It is truly challenging to install. I did not find it too difficult, but I am in the construction industry, so I'm used to 1/8\\" precision. I feel that the average person is not, making it difficult to install for most people. The worst part is the locking mechanism. It's VERY hard to open. My hands were raw from trying to opening it. I even called Evenflo because I thought mine was defective. (the manual says \\"easy\\") It wasn't. It's just a horrible product. If you have the full size 60\\" opening, the swinging part of the gate is large and awkward. I'm looking for an accordian style gate now. And the gate is unstable. Just don't buy this gate.

I am afraid that my 8-month old daughter will either break one of the slats, or push this gate so hard that the screws will come out the wall, because there is so much \\"give\\". I would definately NOT trust it at the top of stairs! Now, after 2 hours of frustration putting it together, we are considering taking it apart and looking for another gate!! AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!

It started out easy to install, until you get to the point where you have to measure the length of the gate. I ended up less than 1/8\\" off in my measurement, and the gate would not close! I had to do that entire part over. Once assembled, the locking mechanism is still quite difficult to use, especially if the gate and the wall are not at a perfect 90 degree angle.One important note: There is NO WAY I would use this at the top of the stairs without fastening the the \\"foot\\" to the floor.

Big safety hazard. It is so flimsy even after installed properly and securely. My husband is an engineer and everything possible was tried. It also can be opened by just leaning on it. Tell me this is not a big safety problem. Also, if you have nails (what woman doesn't) you cannot open this gate due to the latch design but this doesn't matter because once again, just lean on it and it opens. I did read the reviews before I bought this but this gate was the only one wide enough even with two add on panels to fit the space between our kitchen and family room because we have a big step down. Should have listened because now I have to patch up all the holes in my wall and the banister.

Fortunately, the people who will using it, have a strong enough grip to get it to work.Despite these flaws, however, this gate does serve its purpose, in my case. I bought this gate to keep my dogs confined to a room --- which it does. They don't go near the gate, so fortunately, I don't have to worry about them leaning on, or jumping on, it.

If the baby leans on the gate it opens and forget trying to get it open. It's impossible. It's too difficult to squeeze and open with one hand. Probably because you don need too, it opens by pushing on it instead (it shouldn't). Do your self a favor and try another wide space gate on the market.

First of all, some parts (screws, nails etc) are either wrong or missing, and we saw some pre-screwed holes on the gate, meaning it must be used and returned be someone else (which I wouldn't blame them). My husband spent like 4 hrs to put this together, following the lousy written instructions - they expect you to be extremely precise when putting them together but their parts are made nothing close to precise. The first inspection by our major user - our 9 month-old boy, was failed instantly. It took only a slight pull from his little hands to make it collapse, thanks to the \\"careful\\" design of the supports of the gate. We returned everything and bought another remote controlled gate from evenflo. That one works out quite well so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promised refund becomes ONLY PARTIAL REFUND!!","review":"I wrote a review regarding this awful gate, but had high praise for Evenflo's handling of my complaint. (See my full review: \\"Gate should be recalled by company!, December 7, 2003\\") Well, I spoke too soon. Not only did it take multiple emails, calls, etc. for then to finally get everything set up for returning the gate... I bought the gate in October, the item was picked up via UPS in December. Then when the check finally arrives it wasn't even for the full amount promised. I returned a gate and an add-on panel to the company and they only refunded the gate - despite promises to the contrary. And now after attempting to contact then multiple times regarding the additional money, I GIVE UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS WAS THE WORST CONSUMER EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This gate is absolutely worthless. If I could give it zero stars, I would. It was difficult to install and is very flimsy. I have it at the top of the stairs and I don't trust that it will hold at all. I hate that I spent so much on the gate and now I have to purchase another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this gate","review":"This is the flimsiest gate ever. To boot it is not cheap. I couldn't even use the screws that came with the gate. I had to use nails and duck tape. The instructions were wrong about sizing it up to fit your area and it took me over 1 hour to put it together. Unfortunately when I bought this gate, there were only 2 reviews posted - one was good and one was not so good. So I was a little confused but I needed a swing gate. So needless to say - I wanted to make sure that I put my comments on so that no one else will get swindled. This gate isn't even worth $1.00"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good gate, lousy latch","review":"This is a well-built gate, but the latch can be defeated by pulling the gate straight out from the wall. So if gate set-up has any curve in it any toddler can pop the latch free with a vigorous shaking. A hook and eye can hold it closed but it can still be twisted enough to make an opening.I kept the extension panels and replaced the gate with an Evenflo Swing Gate (the one for stairs). This has a good latch that's holding up nicely. But I wound up tossing out most of the $40 Swing-wide kit."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Wanna Dance. . .Call On Mr Palmieri","review":"I was a teenager when I first heard Senor Palmieri and his brother Charlie and I've been hooked ever since. Growing up in New York City exposed me to Latino music at an early age and the Palmieri brothers are legendary for me. It's good to know that Amazon makes this music available. This has brought back many pleasant memories for me and my husband. Thank you Amazon and thank you Mr. Palmieri. God bless you always!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still sounds great decades later","review":"With Ismael Quintana doing lead vocals, Palmieri created another fabulous album. \\"El Azucar\\", \\"El Tema del Apollo\\" and the drum ripping \\"Los Cueros Me Llaman\\" are all great tracks. Palmieri has a knack for making successful albums and for good reason. My favorite has to be \\"Oye Lo Que Te Conviene\\" which would later be redone in his album \\"Unfinished Masterpieces\\" with Lalo Rodriguez (which is a better version in my opinion.) Still this album is a great one to have. Released in 1964, still sounds great after all these years. Highly recommend as most other Palmieri releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"A REAL SALSA CLASSIC","review":"Perhaps one of the best Salsa solo piano, the one Eddie performs in \\"Azucar pa' ti\\".

Overholtze, is a clearly written guide that teaches how to build a classical guitar. The author's careful descriptions will instill confidence in the beginning guitar builder, and plentiful shop talk will interest luthiers. The author's humble anecdotes entertain and warn one of the construction mistakes he has made. The chapters walk the reader step-by-step through every phase of guitar construction, from the choice of wood to the finished guitar. \\"Classic Guitar Making\\" is a wonderful book by a wonderful teacher."},{"rating":"2","title":"These guys rock!","review":"I first heard this band in the movie 'Desperado'. I have a couple of their CD's and really enjoy the grooves while driving. If you're a big top 40 fan, (Britney Spears, etc.) You may not like it. The songs are not cranked out of the radio play tune machine and have bizzare subject matter. Keep it up Tito!P.S.I have tried with poor success to get my friends into this band, but I stand by my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"What-Happened?","review":"This album is nothing like thier first one. The mexican style is gone from them it seems, also they changed thier singer from Tito on most of the songs. They sound like Los Lobos now. Not Tito & Tarantula."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as they were","review":"I previously owned a pair of these scissors and thought they were the best scissors made. With that in mind i ordered a few more pair and found that the new version is substantially inferior to the old pair. The were not created to cut against each other but rather to cut beside each other which allows thicker material to open the blades and be trapped between rather than being cut. They are also quite a bit lighter in weight and therefore making it easier for material to spread them apart and avoid being cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very pleasant jazz-rock album","review":"This is Lucifer's Friend's best album. It will probably not appeal to fans of their first album, though; whereas that album was pure metal in the Zeppelin vein, _Banquet_ is an excursion into jazz fusion. The two best tracks here are conceptual pieces that feature a 30-piece backup jazz band and are both over 10 minutes in length: \\"Sorrow\\" and \\"Spanish Galleon\\". These tracks are surrounded by shorter pieces, the best of which is probably the radio-friendly \\"High Flying Lady - Goodbye\\", which has the feel of rockabilly with horns. Easily their most progressive album, and the one example of where this band's output actually matched their artistic intentions."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not New York City Ballet.","review":"This \\"film\\" is a bootleg. Don't buy it. As of this day, there are no living DVD archives of New York City Ballet. \\"Choreography by Balanchine\\" is also not New York City Ballet. You are looking at \\"war ballet.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"For Trivia Lovers Only","review":"I'm not a worshiper of Balanchine. Sometimes his work is magnificent, sometimes his work is uninspired, often he is the Busby Berkeley of Ballet. I bought this DVD hoping to learn more about ballet, more about Balanchine. I learned two things -- one, letting people go along with traveling ballet companies with video recorders should be outlawed; two, if you put your mind to it you can make any subject boring and irrevalent. New York City Ballet and Peter Martens, one of my favorite dancers, should never have allowed this travesty to see the light of day. Both ballet and Balanchine deserve better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I expected","review":"I didn't really like this DVD. It is great if you are looking for a very true documentary that chronicles the life and work of Balanchine. I was hoping for more behind the scenes look of the ballet dancers practicing Balanchine's ballets. Maybe more interviews and following the ballet dancers with their daily routines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another guy who doesn't mike Mike Ovitz!","review":"After reading The Operator, this story was much more positive. Mr. Brillstein has obviously had an exciting career in the entertainment business and apparently didn't need to crushing and destroy all his contemporaries along the way. Great perspectives on Saturday Night Live, John Belushi, Jim Henson and other legends. Bernie sounds like an great guy who has looked out for his clients and prospered and enjoyed his roll in the entertainment business. A neat story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"I bought this book after hearing Mr. Brillstein on National Public Radio--and I loved it. I don't understand how the reviewer below could call it poorly edited. It zings right along. It's tough to put down. Brillstein's voice is the centerpiece of this captivating tale of a life in show business. There's so much to learn not only about Hollywood but about life. Also, Brillstein NEVER takes credit for the Sopranos or much of anything without always crediting the \\"talent\\" first; if he had, as the reviewer who misspelled Brad GREY's name wrote, then Brillstein wouldn't have surived five years, much less forty-five years in a town where the talent wants credit for everything. Wonderful stories, true emotions. I dug Where Did I Go Right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad Brillstein is not the man he portrays himself as.","review":"Brillstein portrays himself as a one man show, taking credit most recently for \\"The Sopranos.\\" Where was his partner Brad Gray? Taking a cat nap?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly edited book","review":"Great stories from a showbiz legend, but where was the editor? I found myself frustrated by the author's wonderful voice struggling to rise to the surface of this disorganized, lazy mess. The book feels a little like a first draft to this reader (though I'm not in the film business, so maybe this is just the way they write out there). This is a great shame because I have a feeling Mr. Brillstein would be tremendously entertaining around a dinner table (if he just left his dimwitted editor at home!)For an ultimately more satisfying read,I would suggest the William Goldman memoir or the recent John Irving book about film adaptations. With these books, somebody else has already separated the wheat from the chaff, so you don't have to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the last great talent \\"Managers\\"...","review":"The best advice from this book is \\"Answer and return every phone call, and always say thank you\\".

Poor materials and bad manufacturing come together to make a frustratingly awful tool. I have attempted to use the various attachments on different parts and it has never worked. Pieces bend, bits of metal chip off. I finally threw it away in frustration without having successfully pulled anything. Do not waste your time, money or sanity on this piece of junk. This should be re-branded as hot air balloon ballast, paper weights or a prop for a short table leg. It would be more useful for anything else than a bearing puller.

The best story to date I have read. I am on the second book and I cannot put it down. I was introduced to the storyline by first watching Legend of the Seeker TV series. All episodes can be viewed on [...] free of charge. Just watch the first episode and it will give you a good idea of the story line. Since I watched the whole season I was leery about the books because I was afraid I've all ready seen what has happened. Not true! The books are much different and much better! Same characters and storyline but differently played out. Very well written. And the first season was only based on the first book. It is nice to have watched the show first because now I have faces to put to the names. I highly recommend these books to anyone except children as there are many gory parts. I recommend buying the larger books also because these are dinky. FYI 12 books total in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entirely awful.","review":"I bought this set on the piles of praise and good reviews, only to be sorely disappointed and unable to get through half of the first book.Goodkind writes like a bad teenage poet, and in such ridiculous absolutes which betray a very limited perspective of people and life in general. The dialogue is drivel. None of the characters are remotely original or even slightly interesting. The plot is meaningless and arbitrary. The characters do things which constantly force one to ask \\"why?\\", and leave him with no good answer.If you're looking for a great read, steer clear of Goodkind and look rather to George R. R. Martin, Gene Wolfe, and Robin Hobb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wizard's First Rule, Stone of Tears, and Blood of the Fold","review":"This epic traps you into a world of magic and conflict. When you finally think that nothing else worse could happen to the main characters, something does. Being hopelessly lost in the struggle, Richard Cypher (or later Richard Rahl), Kahlan Amnell, and his freinds amazingly find answers to solutions and become the true hope for all when an even greater threat emerges.

But this series? I don't think I've ever had as negative a visceral reaction to fantasy, and literature in general, than I had when reading these books. I stuck with Goodkind and read every novel in this series. I wish I had the last six months of my life back. Yes, they were that bad. Obviously, I'm a completist (OCD will do that to you), as well as a glutton for punishment.Before you click \\"add to cart,\\" do yourself a favor and check out anything and everything written by Robin Hobb. She is simply the best fantasist writing today. Period. There is a depth and complexity to her characters and world building that Goodkind never quite gets his pen around. George R.R. Martin is also stellar, and his \\"Ice and Fire\\" saga is captivating.Taste is subjective, and I know the positive reviews are heartfelt. I simply cannot recommend this series to anyone. Ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"Considering how highly these books rate on Amazon my take is very much deviant. I purchased the set based on the aforementioned rating to occupy the downtime on a European vacation. I couldn't get further than 200 pages of the first book and ended up ditching the series in a time-share in Switzerland. You may say that I didn't really give the story a chance - that I was looking for any excuse to make room for souvenirs - but a volume such as this should have the space to develop the story and characters without forcing them along with a rapid-fire series of unbelievable coincidences and character attributes.

Just finishing up college and have not been able to relate to fantasy novels for a a couple of years tell i read these books.What makes it different?Well the world he creates is brilliant in its originality, the characters have a beautiful development (sound cheesy but extremely true), plot is phenomenal in each book, and i can keep going.The greatest feature of the series is Goodkind's philosophy. Its beautiful in how real it is. I think the best way to describe it without giving anything away away is polarity between Wizards Rule's/ stupidity of man and the message of Faith of the Fallen/ beauty of man. For those who have not read the book, the characters act like people would in normal life- the good,the bad, the ugly, and the beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series!","review":"I love this series of books.

The text runs to within 3 millimeters from the binding in the crease, which makes it irritating to read the book.

Vanilla, almost cheesy, main characters that you build no attachment to. Main hero emotionally is a female and the bad guy is a sorcerer disguised as the Pope (with Siths as henchmen). There are hundreds of pages that are a boring romp through unfamiliar, read boring, lands and then the book turns into some disgusting SNM fetish where the main character is sexually and emotionally abused. The author does not have the descriptive gift of a Salvatore or the political grace of a R.R. Martin. The only reason I tried to push through was because I bought all three books at once, what a complete waste.

I thought it would be another fluff of a book. I was wrong beyond my expectations. This was the best book I had ever read. The first book got me hooked, made me want to read every book in the series. I have just finished reading the third book. Blood of The Fold was a real satisfying sequel to Stone Of Tears. There was a lot of depth to the book, as always in the previous book in the series. There was plenty of action, lots of intelligence to as how the story was to unfold. A seemless adventure involving magic and fantastic creatures and people. A must read for anyonw who is enthusiastic towards the fantasy genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible flammable/hairspray smell!","review":"There are other products out there that don't make your lungs lock up like this one does. I don't know how well it works because the smell is too much like hairspray or some type of flammable liquid--not the type of smell you want in your house, and not one you'd associate with plants of any material whatsoever!One of the cans in my seller's mandatory 4-pack was missing the spray nozzle as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"good-time music that makes me smile","review":"When I was in college back in the 1960s, I knew a guy from Panama who had this album. The cheerful lyrics and sound and Latin percussion always boosted my spirits, and I often thought about this album, never imagining that I would ever hear it again. What a pleasant surprise to see it in compact disc form! I listen to it every few weeks while I am getting ready for work in the morning, and it always makes me smile. The musicians and backup singers were obviously having a very good time when they recorded the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"House Party Music!","review":"Conga player Jose Gilberto Calderon (Joe's real name)gets an asterisk in popular music history for being the first salsa bandleader to record songs in English. Persons of a certain age will recall \\"Bang Bang,\\" which was a huge radio hit in 1962-63. \\"Oh Yeah\\" and \\"Push, Push, Push\\" are my favorite cuts from this recording. Like \\"Bang Bang,\\" they are simple, infectious singalongs, meant for loud parties with lots of dancing. The band also played ballads, swing in the Cuban \\"descargo\\" style, and showed off their considerable instrumental skills on the long closing tune, \\"Cocinando.\\" If you're looking for a happy, loose, party vibe, slap this one on the changer, crank it up, and break out the rum and coke. You'll have a house party soon enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bate and Switch","review":"I purchased this book which is advertised with the cassette and stated that the cassette would be sent along with the book.

I will never buy anything from them in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a phrasebook -- won't teach the language","review":"This consists of two phrasebooks: \\"Chinese at a Glance\\" (Seligan, Chen) and a very similar credit-card sized version. The tape does nothing but read from the smaller phrasebook. The larger book makes a small attempt to explain pronunciation. But neither makes any attempt to explain the grammar or anything about the language except by giving whole-sentence examples. The larger book has a small C-E E-C dictionary in the back.The two phrasebooks cover the same material, but with the phrases in a different order, making it impossible to follow the tape in the larger book. The type in the smaller book is very small, making the intonation marks almost illegible sometimes.Either book is very portable on a trip. The smaller one is really tiny, so if you're looking for a highly portable phrasebook, this isn't a bad choice. But this is a poor choice for learning the language."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a reason it wasn't released sooner:","review":"\\"Imps*\\" was filmed in the 1980s but was never released until now. After seeing the movie I can see why it wasn't released sooner: It just isn't very funny. It's not a conventional movie with a story but a sketch comedy likeKentucky Fried Movie. Unfortunately, most of the sketches just aren't funny at all. As a comedy, it's not recommended. So what about its other asset, the cast? The movie has lots of famous actors in it, from then-unknown Jennifer Tilly to veterans like John Carradine and Keenan Wynn, but most of them only appear for a couple of seconds, delivering a line or two. So it's also not worth watching for the cast alone. In conclusion, not a movie worth wasting money on."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for a romantic evening","review":"Another compilation from Quincy Jones; this time a single disc that focusses exclusively on his softer side. It's smooth and seductive, without being saccharine sweet, and it features some of the best r'n'b vocalists from the last 30 years. And it doesn't seem to matter from what decade Q's music comes, it still sounds fresh and hasn't dated. Unfortunately, there is no new music here but it's still great to have such a beautiful collection of songs all on the one disc. For me the real highlight is Patti Austin's fabulous vocal on Love Me By Name but there is not a weak track here."},{"rating":"1","title":"mastey hc+B5 intensive hair mender","review":"Mastey Shampoo is very good however this well recommended product is a disaster.

Judge Snyder has quite a few things to say; however, Lionel Hutz only has one line, which seems odd since he is the most popular attorney on the show. Plus it is very difficult to attach the figures to 2 of the 3 ports because the guardrail makes it too small of an area. Some of the compatible figures, like Plow King Barney and Ranier Wolfcastle, are too large and fit better in unnatural poses (turn body 180 degrees at waist) if you can get them to fit at all.

Out of the entire series, this book has the strongest ties to the original series and yet, lays the groundwork for what was to come. There are mentions of nudity and sexual behavior, though none is actually committed in this first volume, a definite no-no in the Doctor Who universe. The story is classic Who though, dealing with an ancient power mistaken as a god by Gilgamesh. The doctor and Ace must try to save the entire world from falling under the goddess/alien Ishtar's control. A fun read and a good start to the series.

Plenty of books have been written on Asimov's contributions and science, but few offer the personal and witty insights of NOTES FOR A MEMOIR, which details the life they had together. There's plenty of new information you won't find elsewhere, along with excerpts from his letters to her and family photos, making it a 'must' for any Asimov fan. A selection of Janet's short stories concludes a very personal, fine memoir.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting background","review":"This is not a biography of Isaac Asimov, though it is of course mostly about him. It is a grab-bag of chapters about various aspects of their lives together, and of her background. The latter can be of interest to those who read Isaac's works, and want some knowledge of his wife.Some sections complement what Isaac already wrote. For example, in Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction magazine, he reported on his experiences in going to dinner with Mikhail Gorbachev at the White House. But Janet fills in some missing details. Like how he was severely ill at the time. (It was shortly before his death.) And how she could not attend the actual dinner, but wangled her way into the White House, since she was a doctor and Isaac needed his medications.The book also gives more details about Isaac's trenchant atheism, and his lifelong campaign against religious obscurantism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I am a huge Asimov fan, so I wanted to like this book. But the truth is, Jeppson doesn't write like Isaac Asimov, and her prose isn't nearly as engaging. Also, the parts about Asimov are recycled in large part from other bios of him I have read, and the parts about Jeppson and her philosophies, life, and feelings simply held no interest for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much of a Memoir","review":"This book is not a memoir, but rather a collection of musings on various subjects that sprang from the mind of Isaac Asimov to whom the author was married. While there is some interesting material here, it really is not worth the hefty price tag. You are better off reading Isaac Asimov's autobiographies.

It is a fun way for little kids to learn.My least favorite parts are when you see the snake in the clock, and when the cat screams at Spot. The illustrations are set to the right manor, and the colors and music is calm. Kids will not notice the plain white space in the distance.I recommend this to kids the ages of 1 to 4.

Yes, this story and this character is more complex than Mercedes Lackey's earlier books (Arrows of the Queen), but I think that is only right as she has written a great deal more since those first books and has perfected her craft. I never felt lost or bored in this book, even though the issues are more complex. In fact, I think I enjoyed it more because of the depth Lackey gives this book. I will absolutely read this book again and would recommend to any fantasy lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick read","review":"Good book if you want further background on such characters as Alberich, Jadus, several others from the Talia books (and subsequent novels of Valdemar) and why Rolan never truly bonded with Talamir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lackey returns in her old form","review":"As with a couple of other reviewers, I had just about given up on Lackey, niether \\"take a thief\\" or \\"brightly burning\\" were worthy of the work we know she can put out or of Valdemar. And other series/works by her were also suffering. Here we see Lackey regaining her focas and style. Although not equal to the \\"last herald mage\\" trio this effort is equal many of the other earlier novels. Clean writing, empathy for the character, moral questions, a nice backstory, a plot that goes somewhere and doesn't rush at the end of the novel to give some action for the sake of _something_ happening. Lackey has returned as an author worthy of the title of a grand dame of fantasyWorth reading, worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book had potential","review":"Unfortunately the author has a tendency to breeze over some of the more interesting aspects of the story. For people that like a light read, it might be ok, but the story is not very exciting, I put this book down alot. The climax comes after 300+ pages and is a letdown, followed by an utterly boring couple of chapters which had me screaming for the story to end. Lackey writes about emotions the protagonist feels alot but doesn't spend enough time on the characters overall, possibly introduces too many new characters, and lets the reader down by foreshadowing plot possibilities that never materialize. What does happen instead is utterly boring, fluffy fantasy writing. Additionally, the emotional bond and telepathic/empathic abilities between the human \\"Heralds\\" and the horse-like \\"Companions\\", is more likely to appeal to young girls that like horses than to seasoned fantasy readers. Yawn...."},{"rating":"1","title":"a lightweight Valdemar novel","review":"I feel that Mercedes Lackey's recent writings have been divided into two categories: light-weight feel-good fantasy and gritty, gripping immersive worlds. The latter characterizes Lackey's original works and is what largely drew me to her writing.The former I recommend largely for Lackey fans or fantasy fans in need of \\"mind-candy\\", the latter to everybody.\\"Exile's Honor\\" falls into the former, light-weight category. While it fills in some back-story holes nicely for Valdemar fans, the plot is lackluster (although it does pick up nicely in the last 20% of the book), with the \\"good guys have little trouble\\" sort of simplicity that has characterized recent Lackey writing with some notable exceptions such as \\"Take a Thief\\" or \\"The Shadow of the Lion\\" which fall solidly into my second category.As such, I only recommend this volume to hardcore Valdemar fans. Hopefully its recently published sequel, Exile's Valor, is more substantive."},{"rating":"1","title":"i couldn't even finish it.","review":"In a word, BORING.I've never read one of Mercedes Lackey's books before and I hesitate to reserve any amount of time to do so again.First of all, the protagonist was so flat I was hoping he would get killed off just to make him interesting. The only entertaining part of the book was Kantor, his companion, and that didn't make it worth my time. I feel like Myste was an incredible let down in evolving. Why did we get to know her when nothing substantial happens?Don't waste time/money/effort. Find a better writer, one with more imagination and better character development. I don't get why people like her books. It's like something a teenager wrote and that might be insulting teenagers.And what is up w/ the italics!!!!!????? Every word does NOT deserve emphasis"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mercedes phoned this in","review":"Before anyone gets mad at me, just know that I've been a fan for a very long time and reread many of her books over and over again.This book was poorly written, with bad character development, and just plain awful. Even having familiar beloved characters didn't help the story.Don't buy it and don't read it. I bought Joust at the same time, and was pleasantly surprised by it, so if you need a new series by Mercedes Lackey, go to Joust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weaponmaster's story","review":"So, now we know how Alberich arrived at his place in Valdemar. Overall, it is a pretty good story, I enjoyed it more than To Take a Thief. However, it is not nearly as good as Lackey at her best (the Vanyel / Magic trilogy, the Oath series, and the Storm series). But Lackey is a master of just telling a good old-fashion, fun, uncomplicated tales. And that is what this is. Alberich comes across as a grimy hero out of an old western. He adheres strictly to his own code of honor. This and his intelligence along with his friends help him to overcome all obstacles and save the day. It is, interestingly enough, a coming of age story of someone who is older than the usual age at which such stories are set."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea bad concept","review":"The binocular is pretty good excellent optics.The digital camera part is the problem.REALLY low quality and that's on the high setting.The image is fuzzy and not only because of shake.Is even worse in low light conditions.

One drawback is if you wanted to take a walk you'd have to drag the whole book with you. It really needs tear out pages. Part of our problem was the weather - cold and rainy, not a big surprise for London in April - didn't really make walking all that attractive. The other problem was our 13 daughter wasn't all that into any of the walks listed. It would probably we useful for adults and a trip when you can expect nicer weather."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVDs, please","review":"The difference between even standard-def DVD quality and download/stream is obvious.

Not the same price for lesser quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny episodes","review":"Some funny episodes of the seasons. I wish they would put up all the treehouse episodes in one package.

The problem with this episode is that is completely fails to do so. It refers back to past that completely fails to fit in with the rest of the Simpsons story. It was still funny in some respects, but not one of the greats, and definitely not one of my favorite episodes. It just felt too forced instead of effortlessly fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be better","review":"a good book for someone who knows nothing or very little about chinchillas but would like to learn. i wouldnt advice getting this as a book to help you raise a chin of your own since it doesnt cover alot of info (what not to feed, what number to keep) and its out of date as it was written in 1987. it does have good colored pictures and cute cartoon pictures but not alot of good info."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"this movie came a little bit slower than i thought it would, but it was good quality and a good movie. it's kind of cheesy--but i like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"local color","review":"I think the \\"Local Color\\" reviewers have been too generous with their praises.

The acting was good. This movie needs a beter script by someone with a deeper understanding of art and artists. This movie isn't terrible, but it isn't great either. Too predictble.

There is surprisingly little about accounting. There are no examples of how to create any of the three basic accounting reports, the balance sheet, income statement, and the cash flow statement. Double-entry accounting, the foundation of modern accounting, is only given three short pages with, again, no examples. It is not written for those who want to know how to do accounting or how to assist their accountant with their own company's books, but for those who want to have a functional understanding of a small set of reports. This makes it wholly inadequate for someone who wants to learn about accounting. On the other hand, this could make it a good resource for the middle-level manager who needs to know a little about how to read a small group of reports."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for people who want to learn how to crunch some numbers.","review":"If you are looking for a book that actually gives you good examples that will teach you to crunch some numbers on your own and prepare accounting statements and such, then this is NOT the book for you.

As a matter of fact, Kate would prefer the company of the dark witch of the forest that has just kidnapped her than the prince who left here there.Quindlen tackles the fairytale world in a new way with a heroine who refuses to sit back and let the prince take all the credit for what she can do herself, even if that means slaying a dragon and escaping a witch and a troll, which was really not trouble at all.This comical read is all about female empowerment, and it is done quite cleverly.

The force is indeed with this disk as it traces the various events that will shatter a galaxy, kill the Jedi and create an Empire. Battle of the heroes is a chilling track that rises and falls and tells of dark deeds to come. It is the type of music that gets under your skin and causes you to shiver. The other tracks as Anakin's dream and Palpatine's Dark teachings are filled with foreboding and give an overall atmosphere of what the film is all about. This is a must for Star Wars fans and lovers of classical music. It is hard to believe that this will be the last SW soundtrack. The force must go on in some way. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Williams strikes again!","review":"Even though John Williams is getting older he is still the same genious of music he has always been.

The new theme played in songs like Anakin VS. Obi-Wan is yet again another memorable theme by John Williams. Every movie he does he never fails to come up with an awesome main theme!

BUT.... that music is nowhere in the album! EXCUSE me?!? But there are still some really good themes in here. \\"Padme's Ruminations\\" is particularly good; the first 1:20 or so conveys sadness, dread, danger, and fear all in one.

The person who edited this cd should be fired immediately!! I had the cd before I saw the movie so at first I thought the opening was odd but shrugged it off.

The brilliant war drum beginning was dissected out and we cut to the scene where the clones come flying down to save Obiwan's bacon..3/4 of the way through the film!! What the heck happened here?In general the cd is quite enjoyable. If similar cuts occur elsewhere I have not noticed them (yet). But it is obvious that they are going to have to do a second release similar to what was done for EP1.The bright side is the DVD.

The music is overcomplicated and even a bit confusing, especially in the tracks that correspond to action sequences in the movie. His overuse of choral tracks and vocals is too bombastic and irritating to be listened to without the explosions and laser blasts of the soundtrack to soften them. (Yes, this music is actually softened by the sounds of warfare.) Worst of all, much of the music has simply been lifted from earlier scores. At times his self-imitation was so blatant that I actually wondered whether the editor who had complied this score had made a mistake and I was listening to The Empire Strikes Back or A New Hope. Also suffers from not including the entire score, in some cases cutting out musical segues in obvious and awkward ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad, not the best","review":"This soundtrack had the least chance of being succesful and memorable but it still does a decent job. Right off the bat it has to include the star wars theme song so there's one gone. It has to include themes from the original trilogy to tie the two trilogies together so we're looking at a reduced amount of new input allowable over all. Williams does come through, however, on many of the new themes. I especially enjoy the battle of heroes theme. The DVD is also really cool. It's like sitting down for story time with Ian McDiarmid (emperor Palpatine) as he tells you the entire star wars saga put to music from all six movies with various clips of all the movies woven together. Some people didn't like it but I thought it was a nice effect - one not even asked for and you can still buy the cd/DVD at Best Buy for only $12! Great deal! It just can't have 5 stars because it's not the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Star Wars score (and movie?) since Star Wars Episode V","review":"WOW!! I just finished listening to the CD, courtesy of AOL's listening party. It is the best prequel score, and the best Star Wars score since Star Wars Episode V. It must be heard to be believed. We all know that the score for Star Wars Episode II was lacking. Williams makes up for it this time. My only complaint is that there isn't enough classic stuff: not enough Imperial March and I was hoping that the male choir piece that plays for Darth Sidious in Star Wars Episode VI would make an appearance. However, THIS CD alone is one of Williams' best work. The new theme, 'Battle of the Heroes' that plays throughout is awesome. One fianl note: at Celebration III it was said that next year, there might be a prequel bxed set of the complete score. So, 2 CDs for each film (Episodes I-III) makes a six disc set. I hope so, because while the prequel trilogy music is awesome, give us the complete score!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars Episode 3 Revenge of the Sith","review":"I love John Williams music. Especially his movie music. I enjoy this CD. The music on this CD isn't as familiar as the original sound track but it's classic John Williams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soundtrack with bonus DVD!","review":"The music is great, as you'd expect from Star Wars. However, what really sets this appart is the bonus DVD that has music-videos of around 6 star wars songs. The DVD includes intros and comments from Anthony Daniels (C3PO). I purchased this for the DVD alone, it's a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Williams' finest work","review":"There is little more I can say that hasn't already been said about the soundtrack to Episode 3, especially what Amazon contributor Dan Mohr wrote in his review of the soundtrack on 2/2/2006. His review captured almost all the thoughts, feelings, and emotions I had when I first listened to the soundtrack, and was, IMO, the best review of John Williams' greatest masterpiece.Having said that, I will say that few soundtracks have ever so perfectly captured the underlying emotional currents of their respective movie; in the case of ROTS, the contemporaneous tragedies of Anakin's fall to the Dark Side, the extermination of the Jedi, and the rise of the oppressive Empire. The listener is confronted with the depth and totality of the evil that has beset the entire galaxy to a degree that the film could not reach in only 2 hours.Bravo, Dan Mohr, and BRAVO John Williams!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great!.. that is, what's included","review":"Overall i love the CD. I am a huge fan of all the film scores of John williams. My biggest, and only, gripe with this CD is what it leaves out! So much good music, like the rest of the obi-wan/Anakin and yoda/emperor fight, is gone! The opening sequence is sadly edited as well. However, despite charges of cutting and pasting themes from the other prequels Williams does a superb job creating emotional and deep undertones. Perhaps the best of the prequel soundtracks. A must have addition for every Star Wars or John Williams fan though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most inspiring music ever","review":"I always felt John Williams was the greatest composer in history,and this great heart welming CD proves my hypothesis.\\"Anakin's dream\\" is my personal favorite, but there all great songs that touch your heart every time you here them."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"this soundtrack is amazing, it is so much darker than the other too, which i was hoping very much for. this soundtrack shows the amazing dementions of John Williams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rise, Lord Vader....","review":"The final chapter in the Star Wars saga has drawn to a close. And without John Williams' fine score, it wouldn't have come out as well as it did. The score contains trace elements of the familiar themes we've known since Episode 4, such as the Force, Princess Leia's, Luke's, and the legendary 'Imperial March', Darth Vader's motif. Even the Emperor's motif appears here - the sinister, low brass & bassoon cue. Williams has an amazing talent for scoring to suit the events in the films he has written for, from 'Jaws' & 'Jaws 2' to 'Superman: The Movie', to this one. 'The Immolation' is quite chilling as it shows Anakin's horrifying defeat at the hands of Obi-Wan, and his wounds that will necessitate his transformation - which appears in track 14. Here, the operating room is viewed as Anakin ceases to exist & becomes the black-suited, heavy-breathing Darth Vader we have known since Episode 4. The only reason this score gets 4 stars is that some of the cues are missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of All!","review":"Being a die hard John Williams/Star Wars fan, I bought this CD the day it came out. ANd I am glad to say that I was not disappointed.As in the story, most of the music has a very dark or sad tone to it. After all, Anakin has forsaken the light side of the force and turned evil.The song \\"Battle of the Heros\\", is the new theme for this particular album (following after Duel of the Fates and Across the Stars). This particular song is perfect for the apocolyptic duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan.My favorite songs were mostly the very sad pieces \\"Anakin's Betrayal\\", \\"Padme's Destiny\\", and \\"The Immolation SCene\\" (Ever since I saw the movie this one always brings me to tears!)JOhn Williams ability to set the mood and pace for a scene or even a whole movie is only augmented in this awesome album and some times, the music moves the story along better than some of the actors!All three soundtracks for episodes 1-3 are great, But this one has to be the best of them all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best sound track I've ever heard (I secrectly am 13)","review":"It is a peice of art.

I have all the other Star Wars soundtracks, so I had to get this one. Like all the others, this one doesn't contain all the music from the film, but what you do get is great. All the major themes are offered here in an excellent recording. I think the track for the ending credits sounded a lot different than I remember from the film, but it's still good.The bonus DVD makes this soundtrack really worth buying! I had not expected a DVD as part of the package, but I was thrilled to have it. It offers most of the saga's musical themes with accompanying scenes from all six movies. It's only about an hour long, but it's dazzling. If you love John Williams' work, then you'll find the DVD to be a real treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parenting in the Twenty-First Century","review":"I have taken several parenting classes and expected there would be some of that valuable information I learned in those classes in this book, however this book does not detail any parenting techniques. Instead it speaks of the many different situations you might find yourself in, details the categories families fall into, but offers little real training for how to handle the situations or prevent them in the first place. I expected to see some detailed practical techniques that would help me deal with behaviour problems. Why is that kind of material missing in a book with this title? Also, I think this book suggested not less than 25 times that you should seek professional counseling, perhaps that is the main aim of this book, to get more people into counceling? Basically a whole lot of fluff, and not enough meat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too happy","review":"I never expected the book to be in mint condition, but I never expected the pages to start falling out! The condition listed was 'used' or something to that effect, but I think there should have been a little more consideration put into the condition of the book. I think that about half of the book has fallen out now because the binding was shot on it.

A few years having passed, I thought the newer version would be more up to date and informative, as advertised. I was disappointed to find the book was basically not much more than a reprint of the 2nd edition and in my opinion, not worth the money. It contains only a very small amount of new information, in fact most chapters are verbatim or very close to verbatim repeats of the second edition. Less than impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed....","review":"Overall I am not impressed with this book. topics are way to wordy and don't get to the point. ultimately it feels like author justification for new editions by simply adding to the word count and no to the total value the work provided.

The failing characteristic of this series IS dejeiko.

One innacuracy in the book deals with women on board. The author states that women are more likely to sail on freighters these days because there is little if any hard physical labor. While many women would be more than capable of working shipboard, I can assure you there is PLENTY of physically demanding jobs to do on board. Also note that the industry is constantly evolving so many of the fleets have gotten smaller in the years since the book was penned.

Menzel's presentation is more selective and classical.Very clear, succint, enjoyable, logically organized. Intense at places, but the subject itself is complex. Topics are what you'd expect from a book of that era (Part IV on relativity is amazingly well-presented).

Moreover, I usually take a couple of weeks to read a book because I have very little time to read. However, from page 1 of this book I was hooked. Wihtin one day I had read half the book. I couldn't put it down. In one word the beginning of this book is HOT!!!!!!!!!Yes, somewhat playful at the beginning, I kept laughing at how hard Jude was trying to get May's attention. The harder he tried the more she seemed uncomfortable and turned on. Let me just say that even I found it hard not to fall for Jude right away.

However, after about 3 chapters of Jude's Law I had to flip to the front to check out the copyright -- I thought maybe it was a reprint of one of her very, very early books. The dialogue was ridiculous and reminded me of an unknown author's attempt at a Harlequin Romance book. It was also unbelievable that May's family would treat her as badly as they did and she just bravely smiled and stood by them because they're family, blah-blah-blah. Towards the end when one of the \\"bad guys\\" escapes and her idiot brother is as usual hysterical, it had to be explained to him what an APB (all points bulletin) was.

Foster somehow manages to combine the different perspectives without it seeming choppy or confusing. You want to know what makes all of the characters tick not just the main characters. Every perspective and every character adds another facet to the story making the story more 3-dimensional and a better read.

Wrong! The writing is certainly 'dumbed down' and dialogue is absolutely ridiculous. And don't get me started on the plot. A supposedly gorgeous actor practically has to beg the mousey heroine to have sex with him? Yeah right! The love scenes are awkwardly written as well. The brother is a complete idiot. The best friend is the only one I cared about. She was interesting, but her romantic story line was left hanging -obviously setting up a sequel. ARGH! I maybe tempted to get that one out of sheer curiosity. This one just left me blank."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big let down","review":"I usually enjoy Lori Foster novels, but this book was such a disappointment. The plot was not well developed at all. I expected so much more at the end of the story, but the supposed \\"main event\\" went by in the blink of an eye and then the book was over. I was not impressed by the story of the two main characters, it was too rushed. I was more interested in the story line involving the best friend of the main female character. From the book it is obvious that she will soon have a story of her own. Hopefully, it will be better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This was my first Lori Foster book and I'm hooked! 100% romance with intense emotional and sexual content, this book has caused me to start searching for all of her books. Having read every Linda Howard novel, I have been searching for new authors to read. Karen Robards fulfills the suspense/romance side, but Lori Foster fulfills the sexy hero side that has always drawn me to Linda Howard. I would highly recommend any of Lori Fosters books."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time","review":"What a piece of garbage. Stupid plot, innane charachters,and poor writing style.

Just not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't connect with this one","review":"I feel like I read a different book than everyone else. I have read many, many Lori Foster books and have enjoyed most of them. I just didn't care for this one. It reminded me of an earlier book she wrote with an overweight heroine and overbearing hero, but I remember enjoying that one much more. With this one, I got tired of the weight comments. Either the heroine was OK or not OK with her weight--which one is it? She would say she was fine with her weight, but then compared herself (unfavorably) to Uma Thurman. I was also thoroughly sick of the hero by the middle of the book. He was too controlling for me! He treated this heroine like a baby--not a grown woman--ugh! Finally, the storyline was just too farfetched to be believed. Sorry too be so negative--I'll stop now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live and Kickin' Kicks!","review":"I love this CD! It's just plain old fun for adults and children alike. I had never heard of David Holt before I listened to this CD and I'm now a confirmed fan. For me, coming from a rural background, the folk instruments (spoons, bones and washboard), banjo and harmonica are like coming home, comfort food and your favorite dog. This is \\"down home\\" music, stories, and humor all woven together is a brilliant live performance. It just doesn't get any better--unless Mr. Holt were to appear in person! Very highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless and full of psycho-babble garbage","review":"It's not just that this book is written horribly (it's nothing but extreme excerpts from people who've obviously made therapy their personal hobby). It's not just that this book fails to offer actual constructive ideas about dealing with trust issues (although it does explain, ad nauseum, all the ways you might see trust issues). The real problem is that it sounds like the most old-school, formulaic psycho-babble you could possible imagine.In a nutshell, here's what this book will tell you: 1. it's all because of your parents and 2. it's all because of your gender. Helpful? NO!I really have no idea where all the good reviews on this book are coming from. Seriously, if I didn't have such extreme trust issues, I'd wonder if the author didn't pay a couple of his friends to drop Amazon a note..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prompt service...","review":"I received this book in the condition stated, and with fast shipping, I received the book much sooner than I had anticipated. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over simplified and bland","review":"The book description says simplified for western kitchens, this is very true, too true in fact.I have made many recipes in this book yet they all seem to taste fairly bland and same. Everything seems like a different combination of onion, garlic, ginger, chilli, shrimp paste, coconut milk and a few spices. Throughout the book it also refers to ground galangal, lemongrass and tumeric but never says if its fresh or dried, just a tad of an oversight!!!It is a simple to follow book, but none of the recipes taste particularly authentic or anything like other indonesian cookbooks. However for an easy rijstaffel it would be good as many recipes can be made very quickly as most recipes have so many similar ingredients. I recommend 'the best of indonesian cooking' by Yasa Boga or culinaria south east asia for some great indonesian cooking, both may be a bit more involved but the results are so much better than this book has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"This fit like GLOVE WITH SIX FINGERS","review":"I ordered this product for a 2006 Dodge Magnum, \\"remember custom fit\\".

I called the manufacturer for more information about their product, they informed me it was the wrong liner and gave me the correct number for my car.

Each CD Within Temptation releasese gets better and better. I discovered this group with their 2nd album The Silent Force and really loved it. This CD even exceeded my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh My GOD!!! There is hope for music after all...","review":"This album gives me chills, You end the record with a full stomach. This is what melodic metal is. Silent Force was a wonderful album, and yet again they have pushed beyond Nightwish, Sirenia, Tristania, and Leaves Eyes. The orchestra is punchy in this album and has meat to it. From a musician's perspective, this is a masterpiece. Wonder when America will ever learn?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This is yet another great album from Within Temptation! Even though I don't like this album as much as the Silent Force, I still give it a five star review.The music is heavier than both The Silent Force and Mother Earth, but it is still melodic, and that is what I like the most about Within Temptation.My favorite songs are the following: Our Solemn Hour, The Truth Beneath The Rose, Frozen, and The Howling. If you are thinking about buying this album, do it, you will be happy you did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks Amazon for the recommendation!","review":"I had never heard of Within Temptation before Amazon sent me a \\"recommendation\\". On a complete impulse buy, I purchased their latest CD, and I was absolutely blown away! The orchestra, the music, her voice, the lyrics... it was haunting and beautiful. Reminded me a great deal of some of the early Evanescence songs. It hasn't left my CD player yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good album","review":"I personally liked the album a lot. Some people say its to much like Evanescence but I believe that its the opposite and Evanescence is trying to mimic this group. I would definitely rate it equal with or better than Evanescence album Open Door. If your a fan of Evanescence or NightWish I strongly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"At the Pinnacle: Within Temptation","review":"This is truly the breakout album for Within Temptation. It's smart. It's clever. It has fantastic melodies and fabulous lyrics. In a nutshell, THIS is what alternative/symphonic metal is all about. If you like thier early work, this will blow you away!Some of my special favs are:What Have You Done Now, the duet with Keith Caputo: Holy Cow - this song is not only an album best, but a genre best.Frozen: Great melody and lyrics. The support music lends to a flawless mix of storytelling and emotion.Our Solemn Hour: My favorite on the disc for it's heavy use of choir, symphony and chord changes. I sometimes get stuck on this song for an hour - YES, it's that good.Hand of Sorrow: Brilliant piano opening, heavy use of choir and lyrically strong.I haven't written a review in over a year, but this album was worth the write. Trust me, you won't go wrong!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockin' Excellent Stuff","review":"For some time, friends have mentioned WT as a band I was liable to like, and I sure am glad I came across a copy of this. I had thought I was tapped into the best symphonic metal bands out there, but WT has immediately become my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best album","review":"I am a big WT fan, and this album is in my opinion their best. This Symphonic Metal music is very well composed, and Sharon Den Adel's golden voice is without comparison. This album impresses from start to finish, and no sign of a hastily made song, or any \\"filler tracks.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I've always loved Within Temptation and have wanted this CD for such a long time, I just haven't been able to get it until now. I was hoping I could purchase it at my local stores, but none of them have it. Thankfully amazon has it and I was able to download the CD instead of waiting a few days for it to arrive. I don't think there's a song on this CD that I don't like listening to. There's the more rock inspired songs such as The Howling and What Have You Done, which is one of my favorite songs on the CD. I love the fac that this also has two versions of What Have You Done on this CD as well. Along with the heavier sounding songs, there's also a couple of slower songs as well including All I Need and Forgiven, both of which are beauitful. Basically, I love this CD and anyone who is a fan of Within Temptation or music in general needs to purchase this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"All we are is fading away when we start killing\\"","review":"I thought that most of the songs in this album were great. Some catchy ones included What Have You Done and The Howling. All I Need and Forgiven were beautiful songs with mostly classical music in the background and Sharon's singing shines the most in those two. Overall, the singing was good and the lyrics were meaningful. However, I thought that some of the lyrics could have been better, especially What Have You Done, which had lyrics that were a bit too \\"mainstream.\\" I also didn't like Sharon's singing in The Heart of Everything (the song), because it sounded horrible, like she had something stuck in her throat. But overall, I would give most of the songs a 4/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive pop music","review":"Unfortunately, like Lacuna Coil, Within Temptation has given in to the ... temptation (sorry, I had to) of making pop music that the masses will swarm to and just as quickly leave for the next thing. The songs I heard were completely forgettable. Lots of smash, crash, boom. No music. Granted, Sharon's vocals are more spectacular than ever. Not even a hint of the imperfection of the prior albums.I saw them with Lacuna Coil a few weeks ago, and the songs they played off this album simply slid right through my head, and left me even more eager to get to their absolutely wonderful finale, the Mother Earth/Ice Queen combination. It was great to hear these songs played by a tighter, more mature band, with Sharon's voice at the level it has reached now. Stunning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How this band has fallen!","review":"Its hard to believe this is the same group that created the amazing album \\"Mother Earth\\". I had to keep checking the liner notes to make sure I had the right band. WTF happened? After the slightly disappointing \\"Silent Force\\" album I hoped they would get back on track. I now appreciate how good Silent Force was. Oh well, I'm off to the used record store to get rid of this mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album of WT","review":"It's the best album of Within Temptation, certainly better than The Silent Force and the others.If you like WT music, this CD is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do yourself a favor...","review":"If you know of Blue October and don't yet own it.Buy this DVD.If you have never HEARD of them.Then by ALL MEANS.Buy this DVD.I first heard these guys on the radio...And, proceded to purchase their CD \\"History for sale.\\" I then saw them in concert.All that needs said is:\\"Blue October LIVE is a force unto itself!\\"This DVD captures the energy that is Justin Furstinfeld and, the rest of the crew.

Great for all Blue October fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding","review":"I absolutely love this DVD. Blue October is an amazing group, but you get a much better feel for them when you can see them live. There is so much heart and feeling in it that gets lost on CD's some times. If you don't have the chance to see them in concert pick up this DVD. Hey, get it anyway! You'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to fall in love with your stalker","review":"This book really irked me. I hate that so many romance novels use the dumb-naive-bimbo-meets-stronger-older-man thing as their premise. Please! The so called hero of this book is a stalker and the woman at the heart of the story is a brainless twit. Not saying much considering she is supposed to be an early childhood educator.I wanted like this book as there are many Sandra Brown titles that are worth reading. Maybe it was because this was a reprint from the 80's. I don't know, but this book just never made it onto my radar. I couldn't find the book entertaining as it was just to silly to get into on any serious level. There are far better romances out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"just OK","review":"This book seemed very familiar to me, perhaps beause I read it when it was first released 20 years ago, or more likely because this storyline has been told before in countless other romance novels. I found it to be dated, with a domineering and chauvanistic leading man who is a master at manipulating the woman he wants. She's not as strong as she tries to come across, and lots of annoying verbal sparring passes between them, making the book kind of stressful to read. I usually savor treasured early novels written by current mainstream authors, and I generally love to read Sandra Brown's books, but this one really didn't capture my interest or my heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Words of silk","review":"So happy she doesn't write like this any longer terrible read. Couldn't wait to finish. I'll be more selective next time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Obviously of another era","review":"The story was the typical boy meets girl.

No surprises, just lovely romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated Romance Book","review":"Today I finished the audio version of \\"Words of Silk,\\" which was my first Sandra Brown book. I don't know what I was expecting, but I hadn't expected this book to have so much sex and so little plot. I realized shortly after starting this book, that it was written in the 80's and I did find it to be very dated. I didn't care much for the leading characters, Deke and Laney -- Deke was so controlling, almost to the point of being annoying.. and Laney was weak, almost to the point of being pathetic. I was hoping the plot would take a twist or something to find purpose in this story, but it never happened. I guess if you are into romance novels, maybe this is for you. But, I think I will try one of Sandra Brown's thrillers next."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst book ever written","review":"Words of Silk is, hand's down, the worst book ever written. Generally, I usually enjoy Sandra Brown's work, but this was just awful. I downloaded a sample onto my Kindle, and the sample seemed good so I purchased it.

They spend one magical night together (where she looses her virginity and he finds love), that will change both of their lives forever. Laney who had been told when she was young that she was barren, finds herself pregnant from a one night stand. The rest of the story resembles the typical Sandra Brown love story in that Deke tracks her down, showers her with love and attention, something she is starving for, and sets out to exercise the demons that her mother has instilled in her. Apparently Laney's mother \\"resented her and couldn't love her\\" because she blames Laney for her husband's departure. Deke's desire to be apart of Laney's life and his unborn child spins a cute story that is easy to read and not too heavy. I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly & Simple- Don't Read","review":"That's all I can really say about this novel. SIMPLE! It doesn't deserves to get any stars. ZERO, NADA, NONE! Plot is weak, and very unrealistic, not to mention dated (I'm 26, but I can't imagine any woman falling for this caveman-stalker-bully even in the 80's) No way. If you're looking for a fast read, try The Rana Look or 22 Indigo Place. They have a little more depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh....Started out good......but.........","review":"I like Sandra Brown. This book starts out with a great plot idea but for me fizzled out in the end. Deke was too silly to be believeable. Some may like this book. For me...Eh, I would not recommend it to my friends. There are too many other good Sandra Brown books out there to waste your time with this one. (in my humble opinion that is)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"The beginning of this book is what got my attention the most. Two strangers meeting in elevator during a blackout-typical for most people. When they head back to Deke's, they make love. Sandra Brown is a very good writer when it comes to love scenes. She gets the reader \\"in the mood\\" also. Through the course of the book Deke tries to get Laney back when he finds her with child. Most of the book covers the getting back together--it dragged some. But in the end, I wont give it away, all is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother, seriously","review":"If you're taking time to read reviews, you obviously want the truth. Here it is; Don't waste your time with this book.The plot and the characters were completely underdeveloped and unrealistic.

Most likely you'll skip ahead peeking to see if it gets better and it doesn't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ankle brace","review":"This brace has inflated pads to make it more comfortable. Unfortunately, they are glued to the hard plastic sides with a flexible adhesive, so they shift after you apply them. This can result in an uncomfortable fit. After I taped the pads in place with adhesive tape, the braces worked better and were more comfortable.

It tackles a very narrow subcollecting area of homefront collecting and consequently there are not a lot of items to show. The good news is its inexpensive and does show some really uncommon if not rare pieces albeit mostly in B&W. The insert paper priceguide is a joke and I'd scrap that. The collectors who contributed the photos were asked to price their own items hence the prices are inaccurate secondary to bias.

The story of Hallie and Chance is wonderful. The passion between the two of them smolders and explodes!! And who says a cowboy has to be the aloof type? Chance is caring, giving, generous, and selfless. Not to mention the dream lover. I now know the answer to the question \\"Where have all the cowboys gone?\\". They are in Primrose Creek, and Chance is the standard by which they should be judged!!The modern people of Primrose Creek still possess that timeless quality that helped to build the fictional town during the pioneer days from Women of Primrose Creek. They embrace Hallie and her two precocious twins Kiley and Kiera, even though Hallie possesses a dangerous secret that could bring turmoil and heartache to the close knit community.The story of Chance and Hallie has romance, adventure, humor, intrigue, and mystery.

It is written like a cookbook from 1950...just the facts ma'am, and sugar coat it, please. Yuck! There was a potential here to have a gritty, real-life, scary situation in this book, and it was turned into the silliest piece of feel good fluff I have ever read.The chemistry between the main characters is non-existent, suddenly they are in bed and I'm like, \\"What?\\". Not to mention that the heroine is a spineless ninny who allows every man who comes along to control her, save her, please!

The main characters were likeable, the romance was good but the tension failed to build and the plot needed to be fleshed out. How and why did Hallie's stepfather start investigating her ex-husband? You never know. You also never know what the final outcome of the investigation was. Who went to jail? How many of the local cops were involved? The basic premise was quite good but the story seemed to stall and wind up too quickly. Even the fight scene and Chance's hospitalization lacked punch.

I was online and on the phone with technical support from Samsung, as well as Rhapsody, but could never get the device to be detected with either of the music services. I did find in Samsung's knowledgebase that they don't test this device with any music services to see if it works, but that it 'should' - and they market it with free trials of these services! Maybe they should try testing it, since that what most people would use it for.It was cool-looking, small and sleek, but if you're looking for using it with Rhapsody or Yahoo Music, I would try something else. I subsequently purchased the SanDisk Sansa e260R, and I love it. Also small and sleek, it installed seamlessly and worked right off the bat."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK MP3 Playe, will not play any video at all","review":"I bought this item thinking that it was easy to use.

Either way, the software did not work or after spending hours and trying other converters, I gave up and am returning it.Also, the sound quality is not too hot either. My daughter's SanDisk (256 MB) sounds much better.Battery life, as far as I could tell was good.Also, do not be fooled. Even though it is a Samsung, it is made in China.Also, do not be fooled.

I have a theory: lobsters cannot fly. And so, even live ones don't taste like 'lobster' out here. I spotted these pot pies at Costco, for about $35 for a box of four cute pot pies with puff pastry lobster outlines on top. I figured, these lobsters did not have to fly before they were 'prepared', and maybe they would be good. No luck. I am not saying they are bad, but certainly not worth around $9 per 5.2 ounce serving. Much of it was claw meat, while preferred by some, it did not have the right flavor for me. There were a few bits of non-claw meat that came close... but still no cigar. Overall a nice try... the presentation and puffed pastry was good. However these will barely if not at all satify your craving for that sweet and special flavor of lobster. Save your money for the next time you can go to a real fresh seafood restaurant where the lobsters have no frequent flyer miles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Bad it's their only album","review":"Too bad no producer or manager took these guys under their wings. If you've heard the Introducing the Beatles album (with Taste of Honey), this album compares for young talent and potential, given the differences in genre and time period. Good songwriting ability. Good production. Good harmonization. Not the expected chord changes: inventive. Very worth having. 4 stars, yes, but I wouldn't say it's their fault for missing 5 stars, really. Their lyrics are smart and well-crafted, but they reflect a theology that's a bit superficial and their persuasiveness doesn't follow the Biblical pattern (say, the book of Acts sermons). Again, what group DOES adhere to this standard, I wonder?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you for Having This One!!!!","review":"When I was a small kid, I remember my parents and other relatives sneaking around playing Moms Mabley and other \\"X Rated\\" comics, because of the subject content and language.

The jazz content of this CD is incredibly high. This is essential 20's hot dance music. All of the musicians get to solo and they are all spectacular, this is classic jazz at it's best.

I loved Cosby's comic routines and the Cosby Show, but I guess I was expecting some deeper insights on fathering more than all the cynical humor about all the trouble kids cause their parents. I also wondered why the book needed a lengthy introduction and afterward by a Harvard psychiatrist. Dr. Poussaint seemed to be trying to salvage Cosby's content with some expert professional advice on raising kids. Not that this advice was any more helpful, but I would rather have had it from from Cosby himself, in his own words and experience, than from an academic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read...","review":"I read this book to my wife a chapter at a time before our first child was born.

The book takes a humorous look at the nature of fatherhood in this world. A lot has changed for dads over the last few decades. At one time, a father had little interactions with his kids, but today a father is expected to be a \\"good dad.\\" Cosby highlights this difficult journey. The sections in this book are wonderful. They are funny and true to life. One of the best aspects of this work are the illustrations that you will gain. You will have a ton of material for some sermons on parenting and fatherhood. He throws in a lot of Biblical references which makes the material even better. For a light read, and for some inspiration, and maybe a little understanding, this is a great book. Cosby is a genius, and his mark is throughout these pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everybody's Dad","review":"I watched and loved the Bill Cosby Show when I was younger.

Other fictional characters are drawn from thepeople of the times and are convincing as such.Finally, this story shows how a demagogue President could embroil the country in a war that had no foundation in rightness or defense; simplywar as a political device for one particular philosophical viewpoint.This is both very entertaining and educational.

I returned the swing and lock after that was a disaster! Our house was built in 1920, so nothing is straight. These go up securely with no problem. Our son cannot knock it down (yet - he is 11 months) and it does the job. We take them down and put them back up several times a day with no problem. We just remember what number we put the bar into.The wood is a bit rough and they are a little on the short side, but again, I do not use it in a very risky area (steps). I wouldn't have considered something so short for that area. For what I paid for two gates, I am happy with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE THIS GATE","review":"It's not good. It's just not. It won't fit my doorway without falling over. I have to shut the door and then tip it so it's leaning on the wall, and that keeps the cats out of the room, which is its new use. It would never hold my baby in."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gate","review":"I have one and it works great for my 1 year old daughter.. I am even purchasing another one.. It is not for the top or bottom of stairs. I have no complaints about it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Don't waste any money on this type of gate. Spend a 'little' more and get a plastic pressure-resistant gate or one that affixes to the wall. They are too hard to get locked into position and if your walls are not even, then forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never drink cheap wine!","review":"I had bought and returned this. I wanted to keep my 8 mo old out of the kitchen which has a pretty standard size doorway, and not 5 minutes after I put it up it fell on him. I agree with another saying that they don't make this like they use to. I was also trying to save a few $$ and like I said \\"never drink cheap wine\\" (you get what you pay for)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"We bought these gates despite having read the negative reviews. I figured they were cheap and we were placing them in doorways that we wouldn't need to remove them that often. My inner voice was telling me not to, but they were the only gates we could find that were pressure mounted, at the time. We rent and can't drill holes in the walls. Unfortunately, we couldn't get the gates to stay up. Our house is a little older, so our doors may not be perfectly straight. I also found that the little notches were either two close or far apart to make the gate fit. We will be returning them as soon as we can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you want to protect those little fingers? Not with this.","review":"At first thought you automatically think it's great, keep the little ones safe, confined to a safe space. But not with this gate. The plactic which is used to make the diamond shaped mesh holes is so sharp that it can cut your little ones fingers as they pull themselves up using it and/or grab onto it as they fall, ouch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product at a good price","review":"I usually don't write reviews for products, but we have been using this one with our 16 month old boy for months and are very happy with it. Sure, it does have a metal part or two, and if your baby gets fixated on those...well, what are you going to do? And as for instructions...gee, I don't know what to say about that...they couldn't be any easier to set up (with no instruction). BTW, our home is from the 1920s, with nary a straight line in it, but it works well most anywhere. We actually have 3 of them and use them to open and close different areas of the house, giving our toddler lots of different rooms to play in...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Value Pack - Schmalue Pack!","review":"You get what you pay for. This bargain gate is not very well made. If you don't set it with enough pressure, an active toddler could push it right out. If you try to set it with too much pressure - SNAP! - the flimsy wooden cross bar will break (I can say this with experience), rendering the gate even more useless than it was before. Depending on your needs, choose either a wall-mounted gate, or a hard plastic pressure-mounted gate instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these gates","review":"I have used these gates through two children, and they have been terrific. They have also gotten me through a couple of puppies. When my toddlers got so big they could climb over them (or my dog could jump over them), they are lightweight and easy enough to just use two, one above the other. The price is unbeatable, the quality is there, and the brand \\"Evenflo\\" has proven itself on countless products over the years. We have a new baby on the way, and since we gave our others away a couple years ago, we are requesting more of these gates on our registry. I just can't imagine having a crawler or toddler without several of these on hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it ZERO stars if I could!","review":"These were a total nightmare. The gates were not built straight, so they didn't fit into our walls. Everytime we set it up it spun around diagonally, no matter what doorway we tried. And because the tension has to be the same top and bottom, you can't use it on entryways that have baseboards, it simply won't fit.I bought these in a rush preparing for our friends kids to come visit. I should have realized that you get what you pay for! The product is made so poorly! I got a splinter from it! Thank goodness my own child was too young to crawl at the time. I wouldn't want her touching it. Needless to say we ended up exchanging it for a more expensive one that actually works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless and a safety hazard","review":"They are hard to put up and not secure enough once they are up. My one year old put some weight on in and she fell flat on her face on top of this silly gate. It's a very frustrating exercise just putting the gate up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous...","review":"I had two of these for my first son, a large one and a medium sized one. It could be quite dangerous. I've gotten my fingers caught in them a few times as I snapped it to position the gate. Also, as soon as my baby started crawling he would try and climb to the top, where he would fall if the rubber stopping wasn't well-place on the wall. It served it's purpose for awhile...but as my kids got a little older, it was time to find alternate barriers."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT EVEN WORTHY OF 1 STAR!","review":"TRYING TO BE COST RESPECTFUL TO THOSE WHO WHERE BUYING FROM MY REGISTRY I CHOSE THESE GATES.

I HOPE THIS HELPS YOU!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have known better","review":"We were so excited when we found these gates because they were so inexpensive compared to other ones, but I guess we should have known better. We've learned that you get what you pay for.These gates are very short so it's only a matter of time before our daughter can climb over them. However, since they don't fit very snugly, she can just push them over for now. One of the adjuster bars cracked the first time we used it.It is nice to be able to just grab it and move it around to which ever room we are going to be in. But, we've decided to get gates that mount to the walls because they are much safer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety Hazzard","review":"My 8 month old tried to climb up this gate. The whole thing fell down on him and his foot got stuck between the wires. It was hard to let his foot go while he cried and tried to squirm away from it. He almost sprain his ankle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous and doesn't work.","review":"Do NOT buy this product. It's flimsy and hard to use. There are set notches, you can't just adjust it to whatever size you need. While all our hallways and doors are standard sizes, this fits in none of them. The rubber ends aren't even, so you can't get it to hold firmly at all. My twin girls got the gate down in a matter of seconds. I had it in as tight as I could get it. Another time, I tried tightening it again and it came down and scraped my ankle when all I did was walk past. Imagine having a baby or toddler pulling up on it. What kind of harm can it do them? NEVER use this product. Ours is going back asap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I purchased this 2 pack of gates prior to the birth of my son. They are HORRIBLE. They are extremely difficult to use, and they just don't seem safe enough. It seems like my son can pull them down because they aren't very sturdy and they come off track constantly when I take them down and try to put them back up. My advise is to invest in the $50 hands free gates, even if it's not a high traffic area. I just don't see how these gates are safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surely, you jest....","review":"My son is now 13 months old and my mother-in-law purchased this \\"value-pack\\" gate and tried to keep him out of the hallway at her home. Ha! Even at 11 months, he was pushing them over. Granted, he is a big boy at 25 pounds and pretty strong, but he shouldn't be able to push them over. We even doubled them with one right behind the other and he still managed to push them down. She is now afraid to have him at her house. We were blocking the hallway due to stairs. We didn't use it as a stair gate, rather preventing him from getting to the stairs. Please reconsider using these gates to keep a child safe from an area where he/she could get hurt. It's just not worth it. Keep it for the dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"only for low traffic","review":"I bought this, and it only stayed up for 10 minuets. It is a very sturdy and stable gate, but I do not recomend it for high traffic areas, because you have to undo and reposition it any time you want to go through (I am not gracful enough to climb over it with a laundry basket or baby on my hip)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Product","review":"This gate is terrible - it seems so simple, but it doesn't install properly and is dangerous. We tried for a few hours to get it properly installed in our standard doorframe and it was flimsy enough for our 8-month old to easily pull down.I'd give it 0 stars if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gate cuts baby's finger","review":"Although this is at it claims a \\"value pack\\" (I found it on sale...), it is also dangerous for little baby's delicate fingers. I was a little concerned that the plastic material might be too sharp, but decided to try it anyway after rubbing my own fingers across the plastic and realizing that it didn't hurt me. However, after installing the fence, my 8 mos old daughter immediately crawled to it and pulled up. When she attempted to lower herself back down, she cut her finger while letting go. The very first time! I plan to return the gates asap and would never recommend them to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not get this Gate!!!","review":"This gate is not a good gate to get because it dose not always stay in the door way like it should. I bought this gate for a big door way and yes it did fit but it is a very high gate so it's either take it down to get over it or climb over it. So when you have somthing in your hands what would most people do? Climb over it. Well after doing that for a couple of month the gate finally gave in and the little rubber pieces fell off. So just think if your child is like most they will be pushing on it and maybe even climbing on it and what if though pieces fell off when they were doing that. They would probally get hurt and as I know from being a mom that is the last thing that we want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap product, cheap quality","review":"I bought this product for my 8 month old son, I took it back the same day! No instructions on how to install it...I would never, ever buy it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TWO WEEKS AND IT BROKE!!!","review":"This is the worst gate I have ever seen! We bought it 2 weeks ago to help our dog learn that the baby's room was off limits. Well, I lifted the lever to release the gate today and it broke! The notch that we set it at broke out and shot across the room. Plus it was hard to use from the beginning! The directions are vague at best and the arm that locks it was almost impossible for me to get locked into place. It kept shifting the gate off center or bowing to where it wouldn't lock. My husband had to set it up most of the time. Once it was up, it was flimsy at best. It would fall under the smallest amount of pressure...like the pressure exerted when a child pulls up on something. I know it is one of the cheaper gates marketed, but come on! There is no way that I would depend on this thing when it can to the saftey of my child!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"This gate is impossible to use and it doesn't come with any instructions. It doesn't fit in our doorway, no matter which latch I set it on. Don't buy this gate! Spend the extra few dollars on something of a better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe & cheaply made","review":"We baught this gate a few months ago to keep my dog from going on the new carpet down the hallway. When the dog was outside we would take the gate down so we did not have to continue stepping over it. Well, this continued putting up and taking down has bent the bar that holds the pressure to the walls. No my 4 year old can touch it and it will just fall over. Do not buy this gate if you will be taking it up and down often. Also it is not very sturdy and will not support a child weight from pulling on it. We are expecting another baby in August and I will be getting a different gate."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!!!

Many photos of structures were snow covered making it impossible to actually see the building. Many photos so small it was impossible to see what was there. Many photos so dark and shadowy it was impossible to see what was there. Even though this is a paperback in a smaller format,it is still a Kylloe book and should be the same quality as his other books, but it isn't--not by a long shot.

The product itself is a piece of junk.The Rec and Play buttons won't stay down to do their job. Or, they stay down for 5 seconds then pop back up so it is completely unusable. I plugged it into a phone jack and now because it didn't work right, I have to call the phone company and get them to check my line for new line noise that really disturbs conversations. I'm going to just throw it in the trash and NEVER buy this manufacturer's products again. The vendor did their job very well but the product itself not only can't be used but disturbs your phone line and also I had to replace an electrical outlet. Do Not Waste your Money and do not even get this if it was free; it is not worth damaging your phone and electric circuit.

They both shut off when in the record mode without coming to the end of the tape because the \\"end of tape\\" auto shut off operates. I have had them for over a year and during the year the manufacturer gave me several tips on how to get them to operate properly but none of them helped. I used to be a electronic designer and an electronic repair technician for consumer electronic equipment and I feel that for both of these units they must have design defects. The manufacturer refuses to repair them since the short warranty period is over. I feel they should have in my case since I have two units in hand both have the exact same problems from day one and they are not related to any \\"wear and tear\\" on the product.

He loves \\"his Bible,\\" and I can't tell you what joy it brings to me to see him flipping through the pages on his own during the day.I also very much appreciate the \\"What Jesus Said\\" application section after each story. The author ties each story (even the Old Testament stories) to something Jesus said in the New Testament. It brings great depth to the book. And even though our son is only 20 months old, he has been enthralled with the book for months, and listens intently each night.One other \\"plus\\" to this Bible, compared to other children's Bibles: it covers a broad selection of stories.

Don't bother with Survival Kit - read Frank Waters. \\"The Book of the Hopi\\" and \\"Pumpkinseed Point\\" are amazing expressions of the Hopi legends and world view, at once spiritual and scholarly. Frank was nominated several times for the Nobel, but never won (judges said he was \\"too regional\\" - politics in action).When you're ready for the full dose of Native American spirituality, married masterfully with the teachings of the likes of Jung and Evans-Wentz, get \\"Mexico Mystique: The Coming Sixth World of Consciousness.\\" It's a challenging read, but if you're not a dilettante, and want to look past the surface of NA spirituality, it's huge. For those reviewers who want something to live their lives by, it has a serious message, with prediction attached."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hopi Survival Kit","review":"This is one of the worst written books I have ever tried to read. I am very interested in the subject matter and tried really hard to complete the book (I especially tried to read it cover to cover as the author kept emphasing to do). I finally resorted to skipping ahead to different sections to try and find the meat of it. I guess there is some info in the book, but it is drug down so hard with a whole, lot of empty impressions of the author. I felt as if the real substance of the book could easily have been condensed down to a mere handfull of pages. The author kept making references about how important the msg in the book was, but just couldn't bring himself to sharing it with the reader!!!. Well, there is info in the book, but it sure is hard to try and extract it out of the endless ramblings of the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take it off the shelves","review":"This book was a waste of time and money. I found myself asking how a well respected publisher like Penguin could have possibly published this book. Did they read it first? Mails comes across as profoundly unintelligent and completely incapable as a writer. Page after page I begged for a point to be made. It almost read like a rambling, never ending diary. There are plenty of other books that touch on the similar aspects of Hopi religion. Don't make the mistake of choosing this one. on behalf of the white people with a conscience, I apologize to the Hopi for this book having been published."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I was very excited to read this book when I first found it. Native American religion and culture is something that interests me and I enjoy reading about it. However, this book is not very interesting and definately not exciting. The text seems to jump around frequently and the author never seems to come to any conclusions. The author must feel that the reader has no common sense when he points out obvious similarities between Hopi beliefs and Chrisianity. Also, this book appears to continuely repeat the same information. In summary this books simply drones on and is a chore to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother...","review":"I started reading Book of the Hopi by Frank Waters then found this book - published in 1997. I thought I would skip the Frank Waters book as certainly the information in this book would be more current. I struggled up to page 50 then came here to check what others had to say. I am glad to know that others are as disappointed as I am. I can't read another sentence of \\"I\\", \\"I\\", \\"I\\"! I found this... I did this... And I was very surprised how not just once, but a few times he pointed out how this book was better than books by other authors, he even listed them by name!

Thoman E. Mails, the author, acts as a mouth piece for Dan Evehema, a 102 year old Hopi elder. The two relate a brief but through understanding of the Hopi including a current and ongoing conflict within the tribe, a conflict with \\"global\\" significance. Dan Evehema has a story to tell, one that will really grab you, that will sound familiar, and true, one that you may even feel a part of. A story that may oneday save your life as well as give you spiritual strength. Contains: Christian/Biblical similar stories from Genisis to the book of Revelation.

His Mystic Warriors of The Plains, Dancing in The Paths of The Ancestors and both Fools Crow books were all masterful. But this book is by far his worst. I really had to force myself to read this book to the end. If I had to use one word to describe it: vague. All information about the Hopi and their prophecy's take up the space of about 30 pages. The remaining space is filled with the author's vague ramblings.I was amazed that a man of Mails' intelligence could believe that the end of times is near and that only the Hopi and like-minded individuals will \\"board the ark\\". A good book about the Hopi and their prophecies would be more than welcome, but instead of treating the subject critically he lets the Hopi prophecies cloud his common sense. This book is a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs an Editor","review":"While I give five stars to Fools Crow: Wisdom and Power by Mails because of its moving and enjoyable content and very readable style, The Hopi Survival Kit is hard to survive and might dissuade readers from getting to know Fools Crow through Mails's two books on the great man. One can browse through the Kit and pick up the esssential message, or one can look up brief and readable accounts of Hopi prophecy by Thomas Benyacya and Dan Katchongva."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hopi Survival Kit","review":"This is one of the most disappointing books I have ever tried to read. It some ways, it reminds me of the anticipatory tension device used in the TV series 'Lost'- a constant tease pregnant with possibilities followed by another tease with no resolution in sight. In the end, anything resembling a result turns out to be mediocre, at best. The Author too often inserts his Christian bias as well as deducing clearly unsubstantiated information as possible fact. I can empathize with the Author's respect for the Hopi people and their mistreatment by the US Gov and assorted greed-focused corporations; however, this book does this honorable people more harm than good.I hoped for so much more when I read the title.Read 'Neither Wolf Nor Dog' by Kent Nerburn for real insight into Native Americans written by a white man from direct experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hopi Survival Kit","review":"Very good book.

Even her policeman boyfriend, Kyle, can't resolve the mystery or fully protect her. At the same time, past disappointments threaten to sabbotage Kyle and Jane's relationship and they must both learn to trust in God's will for their lives. Get this book.

I was not disappointed! It is a lovely piece of design and woodwork, heavy but not massive, with a gorgeous finish, the drawer pulls smoothly and the top fits snugly. It feels like a very solid piece of work, nothing loose or shabby about it. I cleaned all my silver flatware and installed it in its new home and I don't even mind that I have to go to the dining room to get a spoon instead of pulling it out of the drawer in the kitchen!

I go dumpster diving so none of the information was really all that new to me, save for the info he gives on food (especially bloated & dented cans). I really enjoyed reading his childhood stories & diving experiences. I paid roughly $15 for the book after shipping costs over Amazon. I had a gift certificate so for me it wasn't that big of a deal. For people who are really tight on money, it would probably be better for you to just go out and DIVE! If you lack commonsense & any safety precautions at all, than the $15 could definitely prevent any injuries.

It doesn't sound like the more familiar musicals he later wrote with longtime partner Fred Ebb. Nevertheless, it is full of unusual character songs and \\"special material\\" that should find their way into many a Cabaret act. I for one, was surprised that Shelley Berman could sing as well as he does, and that Eileen Heckart could sing at all. It won't be an album I play all the time, but will certainly be one I listen to when I want to smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Interesting Song, One Excellent Song , Fourteen Bad Songs","review":"John Kander is a great composer. However, before he met up with the equally great lyricist, Fred Ebb, he composed this trite, forgettable score. It isn't entirely Mr. Kander's fault that the score is bad. No, his melodies are sometimes lovely, sometimes exiting and show promise. That doesn't mean their especially memorable though. However, the lyrics really are insipid and awkward in this show. William and James Goldman (the latter to write the book to Sondheim's brilliant Follies) are not great lyricists unfourtunately.However, there are two songs on this album that make it worth purchasing. The first is an odd little song called \\"My Son the Lawyer\\" which is quite inventive. However, the greatest song of the score is \\"Harmony\\", a very tuneful, musically inventive song. Even the lyrics aren't too bad here.So if you like buying albums for a few songs, go ahead.

His obsessive nature was off-putting, and it was difficult to muster up any positive emotion for him whatsoever.

It focuses first on the Late Antique period (primarily in Egypt), and then goes on to provide worthwhile overviews of artistic developments in Constantinople, Byzantine Italy and the Balkans. And, although he provides little more than a cursory explanation of the complex causes of change in the Byzantine aesthetic, the author's enthusiasm for his subject is evident in his clear, jargon-free descriptions of individual works.

The smaller segments describing Townsend's visits to Hawaii, Tahiti and Chile are also enjoyable.Since this is a diary, it does have some flat spots (not every day can be an adventure), but mostly Townsend fills his descriptions with details and color that bring his encounters alive. You can sense Townsend maturing as the journey goes on. One suggestion to the editors: If a new edition is produced, it would be nice to include a map of Townsend's travels, because in some places it's hard to tell where he is.A tip to the reader: Skip the introduction, since it's mostly just a summary of what you'll be reading.

I tend to vacuum with the crevice tool as it works even better. Having said that, my only issue with this is the crevice tool. Not sure how long it lasted before it broke off but it was a disappointment. HOWEVER, I am still able to slide the crevice tool on the vacuum as an attachment and it stays on while I vacuum. I rarely vacuum without it. I have never used this to clean up bigger messes. I use a regular vacuum for those. Lately I have been using it several times a day to clean up ant invasions.

It has plenty of power and I thought the on board crevace tool would be hady for its intended uses. Wrong, the snout itself is only a little over an inch wide to accomdate the mating of the crevace tool and the tools power seemed to make up for it. The problem is with the crevace tool itself and how it swings down and inward held by 2 tiny pins that have to rotate and slide. It is pretty flimsy to say the least and when the slide fills with dirt it will jam and break off the prong rendering the crevace tool useless and unable to be repaired. This tool will not tolerate even a slight side load bumping into an object. I broke mine trying to push it back ito the slot (jammed with dirt on one side)and I am not \\"ham handed\\".

That's my only complaint, a minor one, considering the price of the pot.My Calphalon pots are nicer, of course, but they cost a lot more. For the price, this pot is good, and I love the size. Not too big, not too small. I was convinced that it wasn't actually four quarts because next to my 3-quart Calphalon pot it looked smaller, but I was wrong.I have mixed feelings about the plastic handles--I mean they're plastic, which I don't really prefer, but I do like the ergonomic design--very comfortable and rather attractive for plastic.I recommend this as a good quality pot for the price, maybe one of the better deals around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Buy !!!","review":"The Farberware saucepot is easy to clean, light to hold and heats up quickly and evenly.

Material is thin and very restrictive. They seem to be sized for a very petite foot with long skeleton toes. The toes are tight, way too tight, and I bought both my \\"correct\\" size and a pair a size larger. I don't have fat feet, webs, or extra toes ;-), but I do have a wide footprint with short toes. The stiching doesn't \\"give\\" at all, there are seams at the toes, and they actually cut off circulation to the toes. Beware if you don't have \\"perfect\\" model's feet, or if foot care for a health issue like diabetes is a priority for you.

I've been wearing toe socks for workouts for more than a year now and love the toe articulation for dance, Pilates and Yoga moves. The non-slip dots on these make them perfect for moves (e.g. downward dog, lunges, ballwork) where a firm grip on the floor or mat is essential. These look good, fit me very well and stay up through the whole workout without sliding off my toes.

ToeSox puts the most fabric into their socks which causes them to keep their shape and to buffer the soles of my feet from the little grippy nubbles. The Gaiam sock looks pretty, but has a fabric that is too thin and therefore causes the little grippy nubbles to press too hard on the soles of my feet. In contrast, the TOESOX stays comfortable even if I wear them all day. They wash well even in hot water and the dryer. I find the support band useful for my one flattish foot. I recommend them not only for Yoga, but just to wear around the house on my hardwood floors. They are awesomely comfortable for daily wear.

Right from the elementary definitions of pitch/frequency/period, Sir James Jeans covers the theory of vibrations, the characteristics of strings & pipes, harmony & discord (including Helmholtz's theory of dissonance) - with a quick tour of [intonational] temperaments, and other miscellaneous topics.The serious reader is probably better off digesting Helmholtz's detailed classic which could, however, prove to be a tedious read for the more casual reader. \\"Science and Music\\" instead presents a 'high-school' overview of the physics behind music.

Eventually, it just stopped working. For a few more dollars, you can get one that actually works all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it!","review":"I had a Black and Decker which failed after about 6 months so I decided to try the Scorpion. The suction is pretty good, I guess, but the opening is so small that it gets clogged up immediately - a couple of cheerios get in there and you are sunk! Also, there is this little flap designed to keep stuff from falling back out - it doesn't work half the time. The dirt you just vacummed falls right out! The crevice tool seemed handy at first, but I have trouble snapping it into place and then unsnapping it. This vac is such a hassle, I'd rather use a dustpan and brush.

I love the siren-like turbine motor (you want quiet? use a broom), the way the thing kicks like a chainsaw when you start it, and the lovely flip-down crevice tool.

It will pick up most everything (but not everything) once you've gone over it about 5 times...and I'm talking about very light weight crumbs. The charge doesn't last long at all, and it has to stay plugged into the charger at all times in order for you to use it when you need it. It's a nice little vacuum for my 3 year old though.

Lots of action, a damaged lead character, a particularly sick villian, and a genuinely GOOD storyline. To me, a good novel will keep me up late into the night, grabs my attention (as opposed to politely ASKING for it), and elicits an emotional reaction. Sort of like watching a good movie, I guess.

Violating the Socratic rules of fiction, Fletcher kills women and children in his quest for revenge. His violence is not excused by the rather traumatizing experiences of his childhood, in fact it makes him all the more evil. In Fletcher, Miller has produced the most thouroughly evil and dangerous bad guy of the year.The low point of the novel is the rather contrived and all-too-neat ending, which lacks the depth that characterized the rest of the novel.Fans of other writers as varied as Tom Clancy and Ronald Kessler with appreciate this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great page-turner!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the John Ramsey Miller thriller, from the very first page.

The evil Martin Fletcher was a captivating character. The story was a page-turner, and except for some slightly flawed elements,the book is a fine example of this genre.Now, to the flaws. The main character, Paul Masterson, was brought out of a retirement funk (physically, mentally and emotionally) too quickly. More time could have been devoted to Paul's recuperation. Also, some of the peripheral characters were hard to believe (Tod Peoples). Finally, the security used to protect the \\"last family\\" was, at times, laughable. Ten ardent fans of any television crime series could have made better plans.Having said this, I feel as if I am being too hard on Mr. Miller.

It is not a very functional product. Every time I make the bed I have to be careful not to snag the comforter. A broken fingernail can pull the loops of the duvet. I've done this twice already, within the last month. In addition, the comforter inside the duvet slides around a lot, so it is very bulky in places. I love the colors, in the comforter, which go great with my decor, but the cost for beauty is low functionality. In addition, if you purchase the king duvet and have a king size bed, the fit may not me that great if you have deep mattresses like mine. I really could have used a Cal King. I read the previous review prior to making my purchase, but decided to take a chance, since I wanted this style so badly.

This ball helped ease the pain and stiffness that developes in my finger joints, especially the first joint, near the fingertip where I have arthritis.

Very useful and durable for normal useage."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent first book on tarot...","review":"I bought this book knowing just a little about tarot and the meanings, but very interested in a more intuitive approach to reading. The book uses the Rider-Waite deck and even requests that the reader do so as well (just to make it easier to follow along, but not required). Rather than relying on stock meanings and trying to tie them into the other cards, Carroll asks you to just go with your intuition (which makes sense if you believe that the tarot is a window into the subconscious)and \\"say what you see\\". Although one may want to eventually learn the actual meanings, this is an excellent way to get the ball rolling and start reading in two hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"I learned to read tarot with this book","review":"It was a very good choice.

So, when I went for a new one, I got what I thought was the next generation handheld with the \\"power\\" nozzle. However, with the redesign, they removed the motor, that gave the power. The brush in the new design is only driven by air being sucked in. So, the brush doesnt work right, because it will stop if any pressure is applied to it. And, air need to run the brush reduces the suction power of the vacuum. I would not buy a dirt devil again if this is how they make their product improvements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try the Eureka 71A instead......","review":"I was going to by one of these dirtdevils until I read the reviews. My parents have one of the older models of this unit with the two ELECTRIC motors. A turbo brush is useless. After reading the reviews and searching, I bought a Eureka 41A handheld. That one surpassed my expectations by far and it has a powerful brush (which can be turned off witht the flick of a switch for hard surfaces), it has excellent suction, a crevise tool, and on-board cord storage.

So I bought this updated one with high hopes. What a mistake! The biggest problem is that the agitator brush is air-powered, rather than electric or belt powered. Consequently, the brush stops turning whenever it hits anything soft (high carpet, plush upholstery) and is even less likely to turn if the filter is clogged up from cleaning. Time to find a new hand-vac manufacturer..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless - A broom is better!","review":"I owned a DD handvac 20 years ago that was wonderful. Bought this unit last year and it barely cleaned from the moment we opened the package.It has a filter core that immediately collects all the debris around it and clogs which causes the rotary brush to stop spinning and reduces the air suction power to almost nothing. Really bad engineering design. Do not buy this unit! Complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely worthless!","review":"I bought this to clean my stairs. It did a poor job the first time around and just went downhill from there. The spinner bar does not work, it's extremely loud and it vibrates so much it's uncomfortable to hold onto.

I was sure a newer DD model was what I wanted. I could not have been more disappointed. The brush doesn't spin on carpeting. Dust blows out both side vents. It has very little suction, and basically didn't do a thing.I need a good sturdy handheld to do our stairs.

After one use, it is clogged up with dog hair and does not spin anymore. Even when it does spin, it does nto spin with any amount of force, i.e. you can stop it with your finger or just by pressing it against anything, (like the carpet it should be cleaning)A better choice is the 'Ultra' model with a powered head. It is cheaper and works far better. But it needs bags."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Bought this for de-hairing my couch of pet hair. While it did so once or twice withouth much fuss, you spend an amazing amount of time trying to de-hair the filter. They say to just pound out the filter and the debris will fall out. Right.Worse is that the power nozzle section just up and quit. Try to debug the issue on their website is pointless. All you can do is try to re-align the hose back and forth....no change. So now I have this pointless little mini-vac.Save your time, money and frustration. Move along to something else. There's a reason why this thing has so many negative reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointed!","review":"I needed a handheld with a rolling brush to get the cat hair off my couch. The brush is okay as long as I VERY lightly touch it to the cusions. The problem is, if I put ANY pressure on it at all, the brush stops moving! I even put my hand against the brush and, you guessed it, it stops moving!This product does not have enough power to keep the brush rotating.Also, the filter idea is a bad one if you have asthma. The filter gets coated with dirt and hair but the instructions say NOT to \\"wipe\\" the filter so you have to vigorously tap it out in the garbage which creates a cloud that gets inhaled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Classic","review":"Buy the Classic Dirt Devil - not this one.

I was thoroughly disgusted, however, when I tried to use it on our staircase: it blows so much air out the back I could see the dust and dirt whirl far away even as I tried to vacuum it up. It really has no extra \\"reach\\" via its hose because if you turn it around to get the benefit of the length of the hose, that blast of exhaust air is aimed even more accurately at whatever you were trying to clean.

I WISH I had read the reviews PRIOR to placing it on the list. Dirt Devil is known for quality products, this fails the test.It is a good concept, but fails to deliver as the beater bar stops rotating as soon as placed on the carpet. And the motor vent kicks out enough air that it blows the items you are trying to sweep up. After 60 seconds of use, it went back in the box. As a gift, I don't have a receipt to return, so guess it will get donated.Honestly, I'm suprised this product made it out from the test labs into production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth a single dime!","review":"This is the second Dirt Devil Hand Vac that I have owned. I bought it to vaccuum my car's interior. I've used it very little, mostly because its suction ability is next to nothing and therefore, using it is a huge hassle. The hose is way too short, the head is too bulky, making it difficult to have good alignment between the brush and the surface you're trying to vaccuum. Even the hose attachments hardly suck up any dirt or dust. It's a waste of money and I've been so dissatisfied with it that I will NEVER buy another Dirt Devil product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do they sell junk like this?","review":"I share the same frustrations as everyone else. For Christmas, I asked my dear MIL for \\"A Dirt Devil\\" thinking of the classic, plad-bagged, rip-the-skin-off-the-back-of-your-hand-if-you-got-it-in-there vacuum that my mom has. I have Berber carpeting on my split-entry home's steps and it was an awful choice to begin with for stairs that act as an \\"entry rug\\" for the home (even though there is one), but this vacuum's excuse for a \\"power\\" beater bar is terrible. It won't even vacuum the easiest stuff off the steps. It is certainly not helped by the tight-looped varied level carpeting - it can't get any good suction on it, or comb the fibers. If i wanted a junky dust-buster, I would have asked for one. This \\"vacuum\\" has tainted my opinion of the hand-held \\"dirt devil\\" vaccuums being the best as far as little vacuums go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirt Devil Doesn't Suck...and that is the Problem","review":"After years of good performance our old hand held vacum with a rotating brush finally died. We looked all over for a new model with a rotating brush and we found few models available. We purchased the Dirt Devil Power Reach.We have had this vacum a year and use it rarely.... usually on stairs. Well, the brushes now stop rotating the minute we set the vacum down on ANY surface.. carpet, linoleum, etc... It still sucks, but without the rotating brushes it is almost not worth using. Avoid this model and buy a handheld vacum that really sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotating brush broke/stopped for 2nd time","review":"This Dirt Devil Power Reach is a lousy product. This is the 2nd time the rotating brush quit on me. First time it was string wrapped around it to hold it from moving. I took it all apart to remove the string. Now this 2nd time it must be the bearings are shot, as there are no obvious materials holding it from spinning. Even though it was a gift for which I was grateful, I'm getting rid of this thing & finding a better vac, because good luck in finding a local authorized repair shop. Dirt Devil gives them so little money for fixing them they want to charge more than the product was originally."},{"rating":"1","title":"One more NO vote","review":"I bought this unit several years ago for spot vacuuming. Right out of the box, the primary vacuum head didn't work, but the hose/crevice tool configuration worked fine. I should have returned it! WallyWorld stopped carrying the filters and didn't restock this unit within a year of purchase - a bad sign. While looking for replacement filters - that are spendy if you can't find them locally - I discovered the motherlode of negative reviews here and realized that the units probably should have been recalled as defective. I was remiss in not checking for consumer feedback before purchase. Also agree that the unit isn't very effective at picking up dirt/dust/lint either, despite company claims."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd say it sucks...","review":"But that'd be a compliment. I got one of these as a gift to use on stairs, couches, and corners my upright doesn't reach. The body of the machine is bulky and difficult to handle. The beather head rarely spins freely or at an effective speed, regardless of how clean the head is and whether it's touching something. The hose that allows you to remove the beater head and attach a crevice tool to is too short. The vents on the body of the vacuum blow dirt away from the hose when you try to use it. The vacuum also spins around and doesn't sit upright if you attempt to let go of the handle while using the hose attachments. The hose is clogged about 95% of the time, even if I'm trying to suck up sand or something fine.This is really one of the most impressively designed machines I've ever used. It's terrible. The long cord is great, but what good is that if you can't use the vacuum??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for certain things","review":"This vacuum works great for things like cleaning the dirt out of your keyboards, picking up random dirt and dust, and generally acting like a great little hand vac, as long as you realize the spinning brush at the front is not going to do much except disturb dirt. I personally don't use it for carpets, I tend to treat it like a small shop vacuum. I like the power it has for suction, I use it literally all the time, however I just use the hose and the included attachment.The upshot is, it's a great little hepa filtered vacuum, it should NOT replace a regular vacuum, especially if you have carpets or are trying to clean up pet hair.It's perfect for what I am after, and I like it a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"No suction and the brush does not work","review":"This is the worst dirt devil product I have owned. Their descriptions lead me to believe that it would work fantastic. It has little to no suction especially when the filter has the least amount of dirt. The brush does not work. This is the feature I was counting on to pick up cat fur. The power reach with the brush attachment is very awkward to use. The only redeeming feature is when the crevice tool is attached without the brush attachment. I would not recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Piece of Crap I ever bought","review":"A vacuum cleaner needs two things .. suction and firm brushing. The suction isn't great but workable, however the brushing is horrible. The air driven brush hardly has enough power to spin itself, and when touched to anything at all, the brush stops. Can't believe Dirt Devil actually sells this product. I will never buy another one of their products again -- they make terrible decisions about what works and what does not. This does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of money","review":"I bought this vacuum to clean my staircase and our cars. I selected this item because of the detachable head with the spinning brush.Well, to make a short story shorter, it broke after 5 minutes. The brush head just stopped spinning and wouldn't spin again. The belt didn't break, not exactly sure what happened. This occured under light use.For about 4.5 minutes, I was impressed by the unit, because the filter seems good and the motor/suction powerful. BUT, there is a major design flaw with the detachable head to have broken so easily.I am really disappointed. I never bought a Dirt Devil product before this one.

This one is a real dud, however.I would strongly recommend that you consider another hand-held vacuum, to save you the time and trouble of having to return this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Hand Held Ever Owned","review":"I bought this because I needed to replace my corded vacuum Dirt Devil after many years. This is a heavy, awkward Dirt Devil which blows so much hot air out of the side that it just blows the dirt around and picks up nothing. Everything is awkwardly located and it's very difficult to remove the power nozzle from the base. I'm writing this off as a $40 loss and looking for another brand.

While the product is easy to clean of dust and debris, the roller assembly if worthless. The brush stops in contact with any surface and does not perform at all.

Wrong.I can see why someone got rid of it. I took the unit apart, and the belt is fine. This product's brush roller mechanism has a non-functional, pathetically inadequate design.

I think we're all pretty sure.)To paraphrase the author, he came from Michigan to the Ozarks with a jar full of seeds and a head full of ideas. Fifteen years later he'd been to prison, lost a wife, a brother and an uncle, got his father arrested, owned a ranch, lost a farm, and in the end he had nothing but memories to show. Oh, and this book, which probably makes that whole journey worthwhile.The author has a good sense of humor, even in some bad situations, and he never views himself as a victim. Everyone knows what he's doing, everyone knows the sheriff is in on it, and no one cares.

He was the first in the water once the body had been located.The book is written in a highly entertaining manner.

Proceed with the magical transport to that distant land: here, that comes from Tibetan secrets of meditation that free the soul for astral travel. Then, on to the adventure proper. That includes the usual mighty thews, imperilled princess, swordfights, giant spiders, and general manliness and bravery.OK, it's been done, as Carter freely admits. But writers keep doing it because it can still be done well, and because it still thrills readers. So, go ahead, enjoy, and don't even think of this as a guilty pleasure.

The recent \\"Passion of Ayn Rand\\" is just a cheap ad hominum attack. This film breathes life into her work. The actors are physically perfect, passionate instead of talky. Alida Valli is gorgeous in the lead role. The smokey black and white is perfect for 1917 Russia, and the production quality rivals Hollywood's best for that era. It's hard to believe this film was essentially a bootleg, made witout the authorization or cooperation of the book's author.

The only problem with the film is that the quality is not what we expect. It was not digitally remastered. In some place the subtitles were hard to read against the background. However, the acting is outstanding. I read the book years ago and I can say that the casting was very well done and the book was followed well. The sets were well done and believable. The use of Russians immigrant to Italy as extra (who had actually lived under communism) gave the scenes authenticity. Adding the scenes that Rand cut out as an extra feature made the film a better experience. I didn't agree with Rand about changing the ending but I'm glad original film did not and showed it in the special features."},{"rating":"2","title":"No way to live.","review":"Don't be discouraged if you buy this movie and at first see poor quality video.

Sometimes the words are quite hard to see.The only disappointment came when the movie finished without the ending from the novel. If the original film was lost then it is forgivable. If not, I don't understand the deletion.Beware! The film is intended to be a true depiction of life in a slave state where no one can be trusted. Ayn Rand saw it and lived it herself. She knew the importance of sharing the experience with those who never lived with these conditions.

The author's choice to format her book like pulp fiction--complete with a list of \\"The Main Characters\\" and her sensational fictionalized presentation--falls flat. This book reads less like fact and more like an account of one person's abnormal fascination with death. And why the abrupt, impossible-to-believe ending?

The instructions are a bit wanting, leaving gaps in the process, ex. the making of the teacup-based lamp where the actually steps and pictures for the fitting of the hardware is abscent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"Now when looking at this book, do not be fooled by the cover!!! I sure was. This book is suppose to be the art of drawing manga, but to tell you the truth, this book looks more like crappy manga characters. This illustrations on how to draw the heads are very mis-shapen and poorly drawn. Do not buy this book! It is not very helpful to beginners, the only thing that is helpful in this book would be the eyes, mouth, and hands. If you need a book to show you how to draw correctly, I would recommend \\"Manga techniques character design for beginners vol 1 &4, and more how to draw manga vol 1 the basics of character drawing. I highly recommend those three books. They can help you with character expressions, eyes, and examples of hair styles. The books that I recommended does not have any nudity at all, so it is perfect for those who are offended by nudity. So all in all, do not buy the art of drawing manga!! It is a waste of money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ever!","review":"Thought I would save a few dollars and bought this piece of junk for our lake cabin. If anything could go wrong, it did.

It's not perfect, but in the face of everything this game is, everything it achieves, to make anything of them just seems petty. This series is the Watchmen of gaming, and Hideo Kojima is its Alan Moore. I finished the game in two 16+ hour sessions and it was one of the greatest weekends of my life. I'm still at a loss for words. The gameplay, the graphics and sound, the story - my God the story. If I could compare it to anything, playing MGS4 for the first time was akin to going from the Genesis era to Final Fantasy VII. Although many, many games have come and gone that are far superior to FFVII on all fronts, nothing had come close to the visceral and emotion experience of playing that game for the first time. Nothing until this past weekend, that is."},{"rating":"2","title":"MGS4! Is one word... Epic!","review":"This game has everything! It's so fun and intense!

I have played an MGS game before and I did enjoy it. But this one I played for about 30 minutes and really couldnt get into it. It seemed cheesy to me. Yeah the graphics are outstanding, sound good as far as I can tell. The story at the beginning seemed a little corn ball. I dont know this game just couldnt get my atttention so to speak.

It's just not fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible story line - Graphics great! Gameplay Mediocre","review":"This game turned out to be mediocre. Not too much fun at all. The story line and especially the ending is completely stupid. The whole snake story has been silly in 1-3, but this one is worse. Mostly due to the boredom it creates for the player when the action stops. Cut scenes are long and many times do not add anything to the game. The bosses are ridiculously annoying more than scary. I am happy I got mine used and will probably be able to sell it still.

After doing plenty of research, and even pestering the worker at the game store, I decided to buy MGS 4 because everything said you can run-and-gun. Not so much... I mean, if you consider slowly jogging and trying to not get shot (because about 6-8 bullets kill you) run-and-gun, then by all means, I guess it's a run-and-gun game. I was hoping it would be more along the lines of Halo or even BioShock, but Snake just moves way too slow. The graphics are great and the story line seems like it could be engrossing, so if you don't mind your soldier moving at a snail's pace, give this game a shot. If you like to really run-and-gun (and I mean run!!), then skip this game because you'll probably get aggravated during the first act."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth all the hype!","review":"First off I've never played a Metal Gear game before this one, so I'm not a long time fan.

The production value is bar none; best of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal Gear Solid 4 review.","review":"I really enjoyed this game but I don't think many will. This game was more or less created for the fans who have played the previous installments and want a true closing to the series. The game has a lot of cut-scenes to flesh out the story and not much game-play. It's enjoyable to the fans who understand the storyline and want to see what happens next but to many others, this may be a boring game. The game also has really great visuals that to this day still looks amazing despite the aging on the backgrounds and scenery. The character models still look great even by today's standards. I would recommend this game for those who love the series rather than a newcomer who wouldn't understand the Easter eggs, humor, storyline and concept of Metal Gear Solid series as this is the conclusion to the storyline. Overall I really enjoyed the game and wish it was longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"game of the year","review":"this is the best game i ever played since ocarina of time. superb graphics, really nice gameplay... some people complain about the cutscenes being too long, but i think that's really important for the gamer who wants to get all the answers that was left hunging from previous metal gear games. if you don't like the cutscenes just press start and skip them, stop complaining or just don't play the game.p.s. i'm having lots of fun playing mgo"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore the 5 star reviews, if you are sane person","review":"This is not a game. This is a torture on a disk. I paid $9 for this game, used. I could have a nice lunch instead.First time you put the disk in, make sure to have much time, as there is about 25 minutes worth of installation and cutscenes that are boring, over the top and plain silly. After that, you will spend couple of hours learning the ridiculous control system, that is, if you have enough patience. But you will not play, no. You will watch further cutscenes.This is a well produced game, directed by insane person made for insane people that enjoy mental torture and have way too much free time.

I mean graphics, gaming and story are really top of the line but...nothing in this world is perfect.After completing majority of the game I got to the conclusion that you must be willing to be involved into the storyline, first of all (better if you played the other chapters) and enjoy what seems more like a movie than a game. Now, for all the MGS fan nerds out there, this will be what you asked for all your life, but for the average gamer this is really too much to take sometimes. Overwhelmed by the realism used and the attention to every detail i can tell it is enjoyable, but i think the creators let themselves go a little too much. There are really long, boring cut scenes between missions, sometimes one which leads to the other. NO, this was paced in the wrong way. Said so, I would say, if you are sure you want to be FULLY taken into the game, then accept the rules; otherwise, it's better just to rent it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Game EVER Created; MGS4","review":"It's awesome graphics and cutscenes pull you into a story and gameplay setup that makes you play non-stop.

The story is attractive, but how the hell you expect me to remember something almost 10 year ago from MGS1. How the hell Snake have a big butt like this. It is just way off scale.

I missed my MGS 3..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh......","review":"I got this game when it first came out, I played it for two weeks.

Yes, there is a CQC mechanic. However, the level design is such that you aren't forced to use it. I ended up running and gunning the entire way through as that was simply the quickest way to make it. the shooter portions are pretty bad. Aiming is difficult and movement is choppy.The cutscenes take way too long, and not only that, waste a lot of time on stupid angsty japanese anime cliches about darkness. Also, strip out the cutscenes and the game portion is very short. About 5 hours or so.Boss fights are similarly annoying, as they rely mostly on the bad shooter aspects of the game.I literally fell asleep playing this game. I cannot believe the number of 10's that this game received from review sites. MGS 3 was a much better game all around, it is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Not A Game by all conventionality. Beware","review":"well, i have been a big metal gear fan playing all of them that are canon. I was at least expecting new game enviroments to explore... what i played was utterly ridiculous... a very brief point a to b mini game sometimes with a boss sometimes not with hours of cgi movies loaded with so many technobabbles you will lose interest in finishing the rest of it. The irresponsible story telling of previous games has led to a very uninteresting conclusion... There really should be a DISCLAIMER on the box calling it what it really is... a blu ray movie. All in all i would say there is 2 and a half hours gameplay to the 12 hours of cutscenes... but I can honestly say I am not a fan anymore and care not to pick up the next metal gear. this is easily the worst in the series yet because there is no game here to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best game I have ever played!","review":"Absolutely the best game I have ever played! that being said I have been a fan of Metal Gear Solid since the PS1 release.

The controls are flawless, the graphics are gorgeous and the story is as indepth and entertaining as you would expect from a MG game. Everyone is complaining baout the long cut scenes but I think they add well to the game. They flow perfectly with you missions and I love the references to MG3. If you dont like long cut scenes you have the option to skip them. But whatever you do dont skip the cut scene of Raiden battling the 2-legged robots and Vamp! Wow! That was easily the best action cut scene ever on a videogame! This game is perfect! I bought the PS3 just for this game and I am not dissapointed!

I wouldn't advise someone to just buy a ps3 for it, but I'd certainly advise people to make friends with someone who owns one and play through it.It's not very playable if you aren't already a big fan of the series and the constant cutscenes get a little tiring. You CAN pause them in this game though, which is nice. It's just frustrating to have a ten minute movie every five minutes of walking.Either way, the story line is epic, fantastic, and it's a stunning 'conclusion' to the MGS series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snake is tired","review":"I'm 23 and I have been playing MG since I was 13 with MGS. Some of the magic is gone, do in part by the fact that everything is more wonderful when you are really young and in part because the game has become a movie. I'm giving this game something like 4.5 stars but I don't feel like I'm giving a MG game a rating. It's something else. It's become something else. If you play through the game, you realize that that is the point. Everything has changed. Snake is old. Snake is tired. And so is MGS... and it's really sad.I love this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The controls yank you out of the fantasy, but the story is worthwhile","review":"Yes, it was my first MGS experience.The controls are awkward. Why can't snake jump? Why is it so hard for him to turn around when crawling?These flaws constantly reminded me I was playing a video game.That said, the many hours of cutscenes told an interesting and thought-provoking antiwar, anti-military-industrial-complex, pro-individualism story.

I really dug the first play through, but hated the ending. Then I immediately played through it again, and the second time was nothing but disappointed in the lack of actual substance the game had. I didn't like most of the changes it made to the formula, because they took the game away from the entire style that made it metal gear solid in the first place. Not that I am against innovation, but the game is not innovative in its own sense either, it just takes ideas from other genres and implements them clumsily into places they don't fit. On top of that, I recently tried booting it up again, and the cinematics are just awkward, stiff and long winded. If you want a cinematic experience on the ps3, go for the Uncharted franchise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best game so far for the PS3","review":"As simple as that,- A presentation with no equal.

Also it requires serious time to get the most of it, casual gamers should be better playing a single soccer match of PES or a race or two with gran turismo 5. Don\`t even waste your time trying this game out if you don\`t own it or you ain\`t planning to get it cause the cut scenes are very very long.

I gave up after a half hour due to about 28 minutes of the half hour being cut scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst.Online.Game.Ever","review":"Seriously. I loved MGS 1-3. Story mode in MGS4 is not horrible. However, I really expected more from Metal Gear Online. Graphics are amazing, but gameplay is sluggish and extremely difficult to master. Absolutely hate it. Granted, this is a \\"stealth\\" game, but online play is pure combat simulator, and should be much more responsive. Do yourself a favor and play Call of Duty 4 instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Felt like I was being paid to play","review":"The game was begged by my friends as a must have, I never got into it and felt like it was based around extremely linear and directed GamePlay with no real freedom and too much 'cinema'. It's main focus was for solid to be a hero and be badass, it did it in a good fashion and I reward for the efforts into character design and voice acting was above par.The game could have shined, maybe, but I was left waiting to play more than actually playing, action scenes are short non existent most of the game as you'll be mostly undetected. Each time you are allowed to play it's only for 15 minutes tops then back to cinematic performance's which just go on forever and if the gameplay was at least interesting then I surely wouldn't have an issue with the game at all. But it wasn't and quite possibly more boring than anything I've ever played before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Graphics are weak. Gameplay is anciently stiff.

WTF! It took 30 minutes of cut scenes that did even make sense just to die over and over again. What's up with the \\"talk show\\" video scene? The \\"fried egg\\" scene? A video of someone cracking eggs over a pan. Yes, this is what you will see in the first 15 minutes of playing, and it goes on and on. The developers must be on crack!The game itself is boring. Sneaking around and getting killed if you get caught. Sloppy game controls, tap X to crouch, hold X to lie down. Hold X again to stand up. You will find that in a confrontation you are end up crawling on the ground when you're trying to run.The animation of solid snake is terrible. Who wants to run around looking at a hunch back from behind?Buy \\"Gears of War\\" for Xbox 360, or buy a PC and play real games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Game I Have Ever Played.","review":"I bought this game being a huge fan of the MGS series. The second I put this in I was disapointed. 2 hours later when I actually get to play a video game instead of watch a movie. I was disgusted at how awful the controls were how boring the game play was. All in all a terrible game. I would not recommend it to anyone. The only way you could love this game is if you put in a different game thinking it was this piece of trash.Buy Uncharted 2 if you wanna play a real game."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't believe the hype!","review":"This game sucks! In what way is it fun? You'd better like watching poorly animated cut scenes that go on forever if you buy this game. Your character walks around knock-kneed in high heels, when he is not dry humping the ground.(WTF) The object of the game is to hide from the bad guys, which is very difficult. You are constantly being spotted by enemies you don't even see. There is no indicator to let you know if someone is about to spot you.(like the one in Splinter Cell) The main \\"scary\\" bad guys are square-shaped robots with long sexy humanoid legs and no arms, but with the ever present Japanese tentacles that emerge from no where. If this sounds good to you, then by all means buy this game. I think it is an overated turd. The problem is the creator, Kojima is an egomaniac, who is more interested in his own image, than making a fun game. I really liked Metal Gear Solid for the ol' Playstation, or even Metal Gear Solid Snake Eater, but this game is crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story mode is great but MGO its terrible!","review":"Since Im more into multiplayer than story mode, I was expecting metal gear online to be great.. but is the most terrible mutiplayer shooter game i had every play!.. its just terrible.. its to complex, they cant make it simple as COD4 or others... you need to shoot the guy like 30 to kill..etc, etc.. its just terrible game.."},{"rating":"1","title":"TL;DW","review":"This game is one of the worst ever! For one, you play as an old man and you have to sneak around enemies and stuff, which is boring and lame. And the storyline is completely lame, as the cutscenes are way TL;DW.

However if you into online gaming, this game sucks"},{"rating":"1","title":"This game sucks...","review":"Hello Folks,I am shocked to see the high scores.This game truly sucks. Lousy single player, and even lousier multiplayer.Linear game flow, silly and boring story, loose controls, and very boring play make this game a one star. I am glad I sold it and the game guide. Oh, and no co-op either.The MP was boring, slow-moving, not inspiring...not fun.If you want fun MP action, with destructable environment, fantastic sound dynamics/realism, and the best looking visuals in a game, head over to Battlefield Bad Company. That has no co-op in SP either, but the MP is great fun.John"},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST GAME I'VE EVER HAD.","review":"Someone else has written an in depth one star review, worth reading for sure, but save yourself the trouble.Video games are 1st and foremost about control, and \\" feeling like you are there\\".

If you're looking for a video game, look somewhere else. Graphics are nice but that's it. After 15-30 Minutes you will be so bored you just want it to be over.Overall game play is very repetitive, the story dumb and the cut-scenes are just neverending. Don't get me wrong, I loved most of the other MGS titles but this time it's not much playing but a lot of watching. If this is the kind of video game experience you enjoy, you might want to consider. If you like to use the controller at all, stay away.Funny enough, the guys at the local store of a big video game store franchise praised it all over. At least I was able to get some trade value after 5 days and I learned this lesson: Don't ever listen to the guys at the large chains.Biggest PS3 disappointment so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay for Octo-Camo","review":"This game is HARD.

The number of video stories got boring after awhile. While the game was installing it subjects you to one long smoking ad. Throughout the game it makes you watch him smoke several times and even rewards you for smoking. At first the balance between videos and game play was about right. As the game progresses it gets unbalanced, the videos get longer and the game play gets shorter. I really enjoyed the game while I was able to play, but after awhile I found that I spent almost as much time skipping story videos as I did getting to play. In the end I gave up playing because it became tedious and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best game yet!!!","review":"This is a great game. all the reviews don't lie.

I've been a fan of MGS since the original PS version. This is by far my least favorite. Although the graphics are stunning and there may be some pretty cool weapons, gameplay is not that good in my opinion.If you buy a video game to watch a story, then you'll love this version. If you actually want to play a game, stick with any number of titles other reviewers mentioned.I really wanted to like this game since I consider MGS and Gran Turismo to be the flagship PS titles, but MGS has been a let-down to say the least. Heck GT for PS3 has been a disappointment too, but that's another story."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't care for mgs4","review":"I got it to play a video game not watch a crappy movie. I want to play a game not watch hours of stories. The bad thing is to skip the stories you have to press start 4-5 times in a row.I guess if your life is not complete without the metal gear series you will like it. The graphics are great. It seemed easier than other metalgears.If you are in your 30's living in mom's basement with nothing better to do then you will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I got so bored playing this game that after a few hours I just gave up.

I was expeting more from this boring and repetative game with very plain story and akward control functions. After spending couple of hours installing and watching the \\"story line\\" and trying to find out what's so exciting about it, I simply quit. The game is NOT worth time and effort.

This game is so complicated to play. I'm not one to spend hours on PS3 but you have to for this one just to learn how to shoot and use your suit right. I got to the point to when I said forget this and I traded it in. It took 15 minutes to start playing the game. Really 15 minutes. I timed it. Other reviews are right there are too many cut scenes and YES the game play is hard to use. I don't want to spend hours learning how to play the game correctly. Here simple, this button is shoot, this button is change weapons, this button is targeting. Why be more complicated than that? 1 and 2 controls were the best. They have lost me here completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"way overrated","review":"I think this may be the most overrated video game of all time. The action is dull. You basically just walk around and shoot people then try to hide when the alarm goes off and get to the next check point. The cutscenes are cool but way too long. I got through most of the game and got near the end that I was so disgusted with this game that I couldn't even finish it. Grand Theft Auto 4 is a much better game than this for the ps3!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...not nearly as good as COD4","review":"If you like the action and game play of games such as Call of Duty 4, this is NOT the game for you. The game play is nothing like COD4 (especially online.) However the story line is interesting, but if I wanted that I'd just rent a DVD. I guess COD4 just spoiled me too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"uhmmm... never received it......","review":"UHmmmm.... let me see.., where do i start, how about this..

The rest of the time I watched boring cinematics that had too much unnecessary information. The gameplay of this title was fairly boring, with several of the levels being less than 1 minute long before another extremely long cutscene.Cutscenes aside, this game really had nothing to offer me by way of gameplay. Sneaking is really not necessary in this game as blasting your way through the few enemies you find is far easier than trying to run around them.Ultimately, this game is geared toward extremely hard-core Metal Gear fans. If you aren't one of those, then I would suggest disregarding the hype and picking up another title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough with the cut scenes!","review":"The game is nice to look at but it is not extraordinary. It's on par with most next generation games. The problem with it is that there are far too many cut scenes and they are far too long. I found myself annoyed, waiting for them to end, and wondering if gameplay would suffer by skipping them. And when you do get to play, the gameplay and the controls are tedious. It is not very natural or intuitive. \\"Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare\\" is a better choice if you like to actually play a great combat game. I even preferred \\"Uncharted: Drake's Fortune\\" as an example of an intuitive 3rd person shooter."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS THE MOST OVER-RATED BORING WASTE OF 60.00!","review":"THIS GAME IS ALL SHOW! Graphics, more graphics, all cut scenes. I sold my copy after 4 days. I could not get into this boring crap. It's so slow and dull. After playing fun games, that are actually GAMES! Not a RENDERED FREAKING MOVIES! You will be bored with this game if you like action. I can't believe people like this game so much? It's like playing a boring RPG . WHAT A WASTE! THIS GAME IS WORTH 30.00 AT MOST. IT'S MOSTLY JUST CUT SCENES OF BORING COMPLEX STORY. WHAT A BORE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More a cheesy movie than a video game...","review":"To give you an idea of my gaming preferences, I raelly like the zelda games. This is the first Metal Gear Solid game I have played, and will be the last. If your one of the MGS followers, you'll probably love the game.You spend about 3/4 of your time watching cinematics scenes between gameplay. The general storyline of the game is good, but the gameplay isn't really that interesting, and the cenamatics are somewhat hoaky. I only have time to play games about an hour or two at a time, and the long cinematics make that impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!","review":"I must be missing something! This game takes forever (which I usually like) but for every 5 minutes you actually play, you are put through 30 minutes of drawn out long winded boring cinematics! At one point I forgot to save so I had to re-play about an hour of the game, skipping the cinematics that hour took less than five minutes!!! And the names? Big Boss? Big Momma? Zero? And about six different Snake characters... D- for effort on naming...I have finished the game since posting this first review, total time of gameplay was 24 hours... So I played it again, this time skipping 95% of the cinematics, total time of gameplay.... 8 HOURS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mgs4-amazing!","review":"I dont understand why alot of people complain about the cut scenes, its is the last installment so they have to tie up loose endings[ which were alot] MGS4 is and was one of the best games that i have played in my life.

This is by far the new king of the PS3. It is a must own. Awesome gameplay, great story, excellent graphics. If you are already a fan of the series, you will love it. If you have never played a Metal Gear game before, I suggest downloading the Metal Gear Solid Database for free from the Playstation network. It will help fill in the back-story, and let you enjoy the game's story even more. I have beaten this game twice, once on normal and once on big boss hard. I haven't even touched multiplayer yet, which I think can only add to this games value. I can express enough how much I enjoyed this adventure. Buy it, and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let me make it short and sweet.","review":"This game is one of the best game made to date.

I can sit through 15-30 minute cut-scenes but 45 to 90 minute is just ridiculous. It almost took the fun out of the game. Hideo needs to keep things simple, the older games did not have such lengthy cut-scenes, it almost made me hate this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This game story telling style is awesome. I recommend it a 100%.This is a stealth action game, so it's not expected to go there and start killing everything that moves (that strategy doesn't work in this game).Look at gameplays to see what you'll get, and search in youtube the fight between Raiden and Vamp to watch what you'll see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kojima's Finale","review":"Really great game. Total fan service to any fan of the series and the controls are much better.Some long cutscenes but wraps up the story and all its loose ends.

I just wanted to add that I had never before played a Metal Gear game except the original for the NES in 87' when I was 4. If you own a PS3 or are planning on getting one, you owe it to yourself to play this masterpiece. You can do some background reading on Wikipedia to prepare you for the gripping story, though many things are explained in the Hollywood movie quality cut scenes, and the controls are easy to pick up on (especially with a virtual training ground to test your weapons and close quarter combat). This is easily one of the 5 best games I have ever played."},{"rating":"2","title":"MGS4 TRUELY EPIC","review":"I'am a huge fan of the mgs series and this one lives up to the hype.

Granted, the cutscenes are ridicoulusly long, but if you appreciate the game and the plotline then you'd find that they are much more interesting.I never write reviews for anything, but the world must know about this game. If you appreciate a great gun game that isnt just run and gun, you MUST buy this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"best game of all time....period!","review":"I've never played the MGS series so the story line was a bit confusing at first. I've read recommendations that one should play the MGS 1-3 games,--yea right. The best approach is to google search the storyline, read-it, then get to playing. This helped fill-in the blanks for an MGS newbie like myself. The graphics were terrific and gameplay was nonstop. It does take sometime to learn the special take down techniques. This is something you will need to master as you progress further into the game. It gets challenging and I found myself in some cases visiting \\"walkthroughs\\", but not so much as to spoil the experience. The story-line does include some silly comic relief and some over the top slow-motion action scenes which remind me of John Woo movies. My singular issue with the game is my nagging need to compare all other games to it since finishing it. So far, nothing equals the enjoyment I had with MGS4. I guess I can always hope for MGS5."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must play, but not a masterpiece","review":"I bought this last month for $19.99. Its definitely worth it for that. Its kinda difficult, especially the last fight with screaming mantis, it took me over an hour to figure it out and beat it. see you tube for help.cut out movie scenes, way too many of them, way too long. i always skipped through them. i dont care for the stupid movie plot, if you have played the series, you might, but if not who cares. its about 16 hours to beat the game.multiplayer is difficult to navigate and no where as fun as other multiplayers such as bc, cod, kz2, etc.... its a nice bonus, hard to master, but for replay its fine.If your unsure about it, wait till its $20 or less then buy.Graphics are very very nice, 1080i, its prob the best graphics to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall good game","review":"The game delivered what is was supposed to. I didn't mid the long cut scenes or the load times. It was a good addition to my slowly growing PS3 collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good solid game.","review":"MGS4 is a solid game. One of the only disappointing things that I could possibly think of about this game is all of the cut-scenes that there are and how they drag on and on . You can skip them but it kind of takes away from the story. This game can be quite challenging at certain points which to me makes it more fun. The graphics are good and the game play is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Game Ever?","review":"The chance to own a game that will affect how you look at video games and how you feel about them come few and far between. I am a fan of the series and please beat all the other games unless you won't get all the flashbacks in the game. It has amazing visuals and once again the story is so envolved that it seems to evolve as you reach the climatic ending to what is probably the best series ever in a video game."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE","review":"This is the most loathesome appliance I have ever owned. I hate everything about it. Some genius put the power cord at the bottom of the unit, so you have to hold the cord up all the time to keep from backing over it. This may not be such a problem if the stupid \\"self propelled\\" function weren't constantly trying to shoot backward, meaning I need both hands just to push the unit forward. It's like I'm dancing with my vacuum and we're fighting for the lead. Ridiculous. I have almost 2000 sf of carpet in my house, and I wake up sore the next day after a round with this monster.Oh--it also came with a free little red DD sweeper--the handle of which broke the first time I tried to use it. I don't know if DD came under new management or what, but I will never buy one of their products again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design, poor Customer Service","review":"While this vacuum may have adequate suction it, like most Dirt Devil uprights, is very poorly designed. The biggest issue is the design of the handheld hose; it comes out the top of the unit so the vacuum constantly falls over when you try to use it mine finally broke. Checkout the owners manual, they have some kludgey way to loop the hose down and hook it to the base, as if that is practical. The lock that holds the vacuum upright wore out twice in four years, the beater brush wore out, the attachments are cheaply made. It does not work on bare floors and cannot even pick up a small piece of gravel due to the design of the brush/pickup. I contacted Dirt Devil about my problems and they said \\"we don't deal with problems, your only recourse is where you bought it\\". You may want to check out Bissel (they are inexpensive and they can't be worse)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Product","review":"The Roller Brush on this model easily breaks in two peices and is not covered by the warrenty. I had mine only 2 months when this part broke cleanly in two parts. Service Center was extremely unhelpful and informed me that this was the first complaint they had recieved on the Roller Brush.

Belt after belt after belt you replace all with the same dreadful results. Poor suction, loud, inefficient and horrible piece of \\"engineering\\".

They ARE ALL HORRIBLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it!","review":"I can't believe I spent good money on this vacuum. I've had to open it with a screw driver countless times to try to figure out a myriad of problems: why it won't vacuum without pushing it with all my might, why it makes an awful noise that terrifies my children, why the filter won't stay in place, and why it SMELLS LIKE BURNED RUBBER every time am forced to use it. I have replaced every filter and belt. Now I am going to throw it away. I'd gladly give it to charity, but I can't in good conscience give it to an unsuspecting victim!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is self-propelled?","review":"My biggest complaint is that this vacuum cleaner does NOT feel self-propelled. There are times I have to push hard to get it to move. It's almost more difficult than my NON self-propelled cleaner! The cord is also in a bad location and is difficult to keep up with. The suction seems good, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE THIS DEVIL","review":"there...I think my title best describes how I feel about this piece of junk! Read all the reviews..I have the same complaints...from the cord up to the handle. this vacuum leaves me cussing every time I use it. And I am not that kind of person but this just brings out the worst in me. I especially love cleaning my house but ever since I got this vacuum, I dread the day I had to clean my house, knowing how painful and horrible it will be. I should have bought Hoover instead. My last Hoover lasted 11 years before I had to buy this garbage. Hoover may be a bit pricey but it sure as hell's worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst I've ever owned","review":"I bought this vaccuum 2 years ago based on the online reviews. I am sooo sorry that I did! After one year it quit standing up on it's own, soon after that it literally started coming apart - there is a gap down the side of the machine. Now it smells like a burning belt every time I use it, even though I just replaced the belt. The canister needs to be emptied about every 2 times I use it (at least it picks up dirt), but it makes a HUGE mess to knock the dirt off the filter. I have to go outside and I still get all full of dust. I contacted the manufacturer after about 6 months of ownership and they just said to call a repair shop. The repair shop wouldn't tell me what was covered under warranty, and they said I would need to leave it for 10 days or more so they can look at it. I am now going to go back to buying a Hoover with a bag. I'd rather change the bag than deal with these filters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good suction, lousy construction.","review":"We have had ours for a couple years and have never been disappointed with the cleaning power. We also have been pleased with the light weight and maneuverability, as well as the great assortment of attachments. Overall this machine is very easy to use and versatile.My only complaint, and it's a significant one, is that the physical construction seems to be substandard at best. Even with routine use and wear, our cleaner is just plain falling apart. Various parts have come loose or fallen off altogether, and the catch which holds the machine in the upright position doesn't work anymore. I cannot attribute these conditions to ill-use on our part -- we're just not that hard on our home appliances. We also have two neighbors who own one of these, and they have both experienced the same problem. Who knows, maybe you'll have better luck, but I wouldn't chance it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerously sucky","review":"I hate this vacuum. I used it for about 15 minutes today and its loud high frequency screaming made my ears ring horribly afterwards, which is absolutely frightening. Emptying it is messy and dusty. The hose comes apart during use, although it is still brand new.It seems to have adequate power and the bagless idea was good, but needs tweaking to keep it from being so messy, and no one should market a product for household use that is so loud. Next time I vacuum I will either be using a new vacuum or I'll be wearing earplugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't want to wait for the thing to be ready","review":"We have always been huge fans of Dirt Devil vacuums. 6 months ago we decided to take a leap and buy a different brand and purchased a Fantom bagless. When that kicked the bucket after only 6 months of use (a whole different review) We went back to the store for a tried and true Dirt Devil.We got this vacuum home and it was very easy to assemble. When we turned it on we found out that it was easily the loudest vacuum cleaner we've ever used.The self propel feature, although a great idea, leaves a lot to be desired. I vacuum fast, and with this cleaner was unable to because of the hesitation in the self propel motion. It takes a while to realize that you've changed direct and respond.There is a switch to turn the self propel off.

It was so loud that it actually made my ears ring for over half an hour after I was done vacuuming, it tore one of my rugs, AND when I accidentally ran over the power cord (as I had done hundreds of times with previous vacuums) it actually TORE the cord, rendering it unsafe and unusable. I will never buy another Dirt Devil product and will be writing the company asking for compensation for my torn carpeting. I am disgusted by this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Vacuum Fell Apart","review":"My wife and I received this vacuum as a wedding gift. Before we even celebrated our 2 year anniversary, the vacuum had completely fallen apart. It won't stand up on its own, 2 screws have fallen out of the base, the house smells like burnt rubber every time we use it, I have to use the attachments to suck up anything bigger than a cat hair, and the plastic guard on the front is completely detached. Furthermore, everytime we vaccum, the HEPA filter trap opens, and I have to put it back together before I can resume. After reading other reviews, I'm glad I'm not the only one whose had these problems. I didn't pay for the thing, but if you're planning on it, my suggestion is DON'T BUY THIS VACUUM. You'll be shopping for another one within 2 years just like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"I have had this vacum for about 6 months now. It has great suction but very poor design. The cord is attached to the bottom half of the sweeper and I've run it over several times even when holding the cord in one hand while sweeping. The cord was severed once. It is much too powerful to sweep heavy duty scatter rugs. I've torn several expensive rugs. The body of it is high off the ground and doesn't fit under my kitchen cabinets (between floor and cabient is about 6 inches). It is so heavy to push even with the self-propelled on that the plastic handle broke off and I have it duct-taped on now.Bottom Line - I do not recommend this sweeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Utensils!","review":"I am very pleased with these utensils.

I never heard a song remixed to sound live before till this mix. Also. the second song is Madonna's ground-breaking classic dance anthem \\"Into The Groove\\", but this CD contains the ORIGINAL UNREMIXED 1985 version!! The original Into The Groove is far and away the best version of the song. If you love Madonna, particularly her 1980's music, you'll be so glad you purchased this CD single!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Into The Groove","review":"I bought this cd for the Extended Mix of Angel.

Watts holds to a rare theory that Isaiah is a play written in its entirety by a 6th century BCE (i.e. post-exilic) anonymous writer. This is a very unconventional theory and I'm not aware of any other major commentator who shares it. It's neither the traditional Isaiah nor the Deutero-Isaiah theory.I gave it two stars instead of one because maybe Watts gets some credit for creative scholarship - which at least gets people thinking. But as a useful commentary for most people, I'd avoid it. I am disappointed that Word chose this as their Isaiah commentary. I generally like the Word Commentary series, but this one totally misses the target.

If you need to back up to reach a side area, the venting creates a gust that blows all the dirt away before it can get sucked up. As noted by other reviewers, it is *very* noisy. I actually question if the noise it produces is within allowable limits for noise exposure/hearing loss.I could tolerate the noise if the product was exceptional, but the air venting makes the vacuum mostly useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY TOO LOUD","review":"I NEVER use this vacuum because it is, simply put, way too loud.

It is so powerful, that the outbound air often hits your legs with a high velocity blast of warm air and bounces around your work area moving the dirt and dust devils around. Other than that it is great. Light, extremly powerful, and easy to maneuver into corners.

Yeah, it's loud, especially in a small room, but I only have it on for about 30 seconds at a time. The motor is so powerful it gives a little kick to the side when you first turn it on, and it's very thorough on picking up things.

I have had it for a couple of years. I use it weekly for vacuuming the hardwood floor in my kitchen. I have a Golden Retreiver that sheds a lot of hair. The power of the exhausted air that blows out the back of the vacuum, blows all the dust and hair that's on the floor all around the room before I can vacuum it up. I can see the dust and hair flying around my head. To help avoid this problem, instead of vacuuming with the stick at an angle, I have to keep the handle straight up so the exhausted air isn't pointed at the floor. It's very awkward and frustrating. The motor on it is also incredibly loud.

This vacuum picks up virtually nothing on carpets. For all intents and purposes, this vacuum is useless on carpets.

I read the on site reviews and got the jest that there were equal pros and cons but by looking at the Amazon's on-site photos and description that it was for carpets, as well as hard floors, I thought HEY it has a brush in the head of it. I was soooo wrong. This thing has nothing but a squeegee and a 9 inch slit. It has no suction for the amount of noise it makes and weight that it has. Please pass on it and complain if you bought it and you can not get your FULL REFUND!!! I STILL trying to get mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Power at All","review":"I thought this would be great for my kitchen hardwood floors but it barely picks up dust let alone anything else. Mine is going in the trash, and I'll be looking for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Powerful Motor with nowhere to go","review":"I've had my Dirt Devil Power Stick for two months now. The motor has enough power to suck like crazy but the vacuum's design leaves this an impotent appliance. With the handle positioned high the suction is diminished due to poor design inside the vacuum head's knuckle. I'm tall so this is a problem. The front of the vacuum head is really designed to suck best in the very middle making it hard to reach close to walls or corners. Consequently it does not cover much area. And larger particles stay in the head. When you turn the vacuum off they will be redeposited back onto the floor. My Dirt Devil will make it's last trip today.....to the dumpster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Powerful for its own good","review":"I just bought this and used it two times. Like others said, its very powerful. But the power works against it.First of all, when I started it up, it jumped out of my hands. The noise is deafening...seriously. It is much, much louder than my very powerful full upright. My ears actually were ringing when I was done.It also was frustrating because the \\"exhaust\\" comes out at an angle that blows around the very dirt you are about to vacuum. The smaller amped Dirt Devil stick vac works much better. I plan to return it for the smaller one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power Stick works OK, but does have some issues","review":"The power stick does have a lot of power but post about how loud it is and how it blows dust around before you can vacuum it are accurate. I would rather have purchased something else"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I bought this Power Stick yesterday at Target and attempted to use it on my laminate-wood kitchen floor last night. It literally picked up nothing but a little bit of dust, leaving crumbs untouched, yet it roared like a mini jet engine. Very deceiving because with noise like that one would expect it to be the Hercules of vacuums. Needless to say, it is already packed back in it's box and will be returned asap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT recommended","review":"I was looking for a small and efficient vacuum for our 1500 SF townhouse with hardwood floors. This vacuum, which I purchased from Target in store, sucks. Actually, it does the opposite. Instead of picking things up, it blows them around. It does pick up SOME stuff, but chasing the little pieces is fruitless, and I just end up using a broom. I paid $40 for this and am returning it 3 days after I bought it. Additionally, this is the loudest vacuum I've ever heard-including shop vacs. Put your money towards a better quality vacuum-not dirt devil. I'm buying a Hoover Flair with Power Nozzle as this vacuum's replacement, as it has very positive reviews on Amazon. It's worth an extra $20. DO NOT BUY this vacuum...unless you like your money going down the drain. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Noisy, but Nice!","review":"Perfect for bare floors; fair job on short-nap throw rugs; not recommended for high or thick-nap carpeting. Noisy - my dog runs wild-eyed when I use it! But the little shedding fur-ball is the reason for this purchase and what isn't more noisy on bare floors? It is light weight, maneuverable and easily stored. Works for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"I agree many of the other reviewers -- this product is dangerously loud! I frequently attend concerts and like my music louder than anyone I know and still find this product painfully loud -- so much that my ears ring for hours after use. Aside from this, this vacuum only sucks things up in the 2-3 inches straight down the center of its path. Sweeping along the edge of a wall is useless unless you approach the wall perpendicularly, going back and forth incrementally down the length of the wall. A piece of junk. It gets 1 star for not breaking during the 11 months that I used it."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but Awkward","review":"The reviewers that mention the noise are dead-on, this is the loudest vacuum I have used. The noise is not the reason for the low review, it is simply awkward to use. I was looking to replace an old electric broom for use on hard surfaces and stairs and the power stick is not a good choice. It picks up fairly well when the dirt is in its path but blows a lot around and is difficult to get into small spaces or against walls. I did not see any options in this class of vacuum with edge-cleaning but the lack of a swivel feature makes cleaning with this model harder than I expected. I have replaced this with a Hoover \\"Flair\\" and found it serves my purposes much better than the Power Stick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I bought this machine a few months ago and was happy....at first. The first thing I noticed was that there are vents on the sides of the machine. Turn it on and air shoots out of the sides. This is fine for carpets, but on hardwood floor/tile floors, it stirs up all the dust. By the time you get to the area where the dust was, it is now sitting someplace else. This is frustrating for me, because I have a cat. I will see an area that has collected some cat hair, go to vacuum it, and see that it is being propelled across the room by these vents. I've resorted to covering them up. It is a very powerful vacuum, but I would not recommend it for pet owners or people looking to clean their bare floors. I completely agree with the other reviewer's comment about it being VERY loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too strong an exhaust","review":"I bought the Power Stick to have something quick to get the dog hair from my kitchen floor. The dogs are shedding and I didnt want to drag out my big vac all the time. Sweeping didnt help since the hair drifted under the fridge and stove. The first time I turned on the Power Stick I was impressed at the suction and began to clean my floor. To my dismay the exhaust blew the hair and dust across the room and under my stove and fridge in a split second. You would have to be very careful which direction you began to vacuum a floor because of this. I wrote the company to bring this to their attention, NOT to ask for a refund. I got an e-mail back stating they did not give refunds and they never mentioned my complaint. I was very disappointed in their reaction and I doubt I will buy any Dirt Devil products in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY BAD PRODUCT AND HEAVY TOO","review":"Don't bother. LOUD and doesn't pick up because has no rollers to sweep up ....just some air business underneath that you can't see that does NOT work well on carpet ever.. but occasionally passable on hardwood or tile"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blows the dirt away!","review":"I needed a temporary vacuum for my hardwood floors. If I pay any money I expect a minimal amount of efficiency (and for $40 I didn't expect too much). This vacuum blows the dirt (crumbs, dust etc) away from itself making it almost impossible to get the stuff sucked in. The output of my personal energy is tremendous in order to criss-cross and maneuver all over the floor to get it all in. I would say 8 times the energy compared to just using a broom. $40 is too much for something I am going to have to pay to recycle (I live temporarily in Japan). How can a company put out something useless like that? How shameful! A very costly mistake on my part...."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible!!","review":"Bought this with the hopes of quick cleaning. It barely sucks up a fuzz on the carpet. It's insanely loud. . . I brought earplugs from work to wear when I do use this and I make my son go into a different room so he doesn't go prematurely deaf. It has an exhaust that blows dust and pet hair all over the place making it impossible to catch it with the vacuum. It feels like it should have this amazing capability but I can go over the same spot 5 times and it barely vacuums anything. A complete waste of money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oooop! Not a good deal.","review":"Still using this vacuum cleaner. Only God knows why.Engine exhaust is substantial and blows out in front of vacuum.

Having to use ear plugs was the deal breaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star because there isn't an option for ZERO!","review":"This thing is horrible. NO suction -- worked well for about 7 minutes and then all suction just died. Now, it won't even pick up simple spills and every-day dirt! I put my hand underneath the unit and there's NO suction! I've emptied the cup, cleaned the filter...I do NOT recommend this product at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I needed to get something to take care of my wood and tile floors with area rugs soon after moving into a new house so I relied on the Dirt Devil name and got this. Big mistake, big disappointment! The suction area is confined to only the center area and it does not pick anything up on the sides which is desirable in the kitchen. It is incredibly loud, but that I could live with if it worked well which it does not. I would have returned this, but waited too long and the store would not take it back. Hopefully, I'll have better luck next time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOUD Sucker!","review":"Whoa! I was really surprised how loud this thing is! Sometimes my ears hurt after clean up my studio.The motor is surprisingly powerful for such a tiny vac. My floors looked pretty clean to begin with, but this vac proved otherwise. In two sweeps of the floor, I was able to fill up the debris compartment with lint, hair, and other nasties.I really like this vac.1. I breath a lot easier now, thanks to the integrated air filter.2. It's high quality ABS construction and very intuitive to assemble/de-assemble.3. Extremely powerful motor.But it's too LOUD! If you get this vac, buy a pair of ear plugs..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"This little stick vac is very loud and has excellent suction, the problem is that is boast an 11\\" head that only has suction in the middle 3 inches, so to pick anything up you must be able to position the middle of the head over the dirt or it does not pick the dirt up.

I have a big golden retriever who sheds huge amounts of fur. I have Spanish tile and the \\"dust bunnies\\" were rampant. All this product did was blow them around faster than it sucked them up! The exhaust from it blew the fur into the air and redeposited it everywhere other than where I was vacuuming! I had to run the air cleaner all day after using this. It made a mess.

But, don't be fooled by the AMP size this little vacuum works great. I don't recommend it for thick carpets but throw rugs are no problem. It's loud but okay. I like the product so the loudness is tolerable. The fact that it's bagless and a good feature too. You have to clean it out frequently but remember it's a small vacuum. Hardwood and tile floors are a breeze with this vacuum. I have permanently retired my broom for this task."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for some. Entirely unsuitable for others.","review":"The Dirt Devil Power Stick is a small, powerful and noisy vacuum cleaner that will be perfect for some users and unsuitable for others.My experience has been positive, using it for one year in a three room apartment full of wooden flooring. It easily sucked up all the dust and dirt put in front of it, including that on my large rug. It's small form factor allows you to nip into small spaces and it's light enough to whip around with ease. If you're low on storage space, this is a lifesaver, easily fitting into a small storage cupboard.There is a downside, noise. If quietness is important to you, stay clear. If raw power over a large area is important, you'll want something larger.This is aimed at the small home or apartment, perfect for students, singles and couples living in a small space. It is not aimed at families or anyone living in a large home."},{"rating":"1","title":"instead buy van Seters' The Edited Bible","review":"Unfortunately I had read van Seters' The Edited Bible before buying this book.

In the 1850s, the Argentine navy erects a lighthouse at Isla de los Estados, in the southern tip of South America, near the Magellan Strait that connects the Atlantic and the Pacific and in the turbulent waters that had witnessed many shipwrecks throughout the centuries. Left behind in the lighthouse to guard it are three sailors, without knowing that in the island lie pirates with a plot to takeover the lighthouse in order to intentionally shipwreck the ships passing by and take over their treasures. A sailor escapes alive the seizure of the lighthouse by the pirates and a game of cat and mouse begins (if you seen Die Hard, you can imagine the plot, with the guard trying to hit back at the pirates).

I truly believe that the producers ran out of time, and were told to \\"just put it out anyway.\\" The loose ends in this film are numerous.

It would be too easy to fall into that mode, many authors do it.

I use this KB/Mouse mainly for gaming and that's where they need to make some upgrades. One of the things I would want would be able to have the ability to make macros. With Setpoint Software, you're not able to do that or at least I haven't been able to figure that out. It has alot of buttons that help you with shortcuts with email, favorites, audio - you name it.

The keyboard has to be very close to the receiver for it to work without any problems. Also, the audio presets work fine as long as you don't upgrade to the new MusicMatch they try to make you upgrade to after the initial installation. Other than that, there arn't many problems that can't be resolved. It takes a little while to configure all the keys to work with all programs...the save, print, undo, redo functions didn't work first off for me...The mouse is great but the application window button is in a very hard place to hit, its much faster to just find the program you want on the tastbar.

By itself quite a feat. However, what truly bugs me is that for the SIX WEEKS before the battery actually went dead, an annoying little icon had been blinking in my taskbar, warning me that the battery is low. It's good to know that in 6 weeks I'll have to replace the battery, but I'd really prefer it if I could switch that icon off. If that wasn't enough, at irregular intervals (sometimes only ONE MINUTE apart) a blue little window (the size of a big stamp) moves into view, ALSO telling me my battery is low.If I'd known this in advance, I wouldn't have bought this keyboard/mouse set."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this cordless desktop","review":"Today the button work, then tomorrow they decide not to, I have updated the software and I still have the same problem on 2 PCs, also the feel is not like that of a corded mouse, I spent $69 and I am not pleased, they just better send me my rebate back or else, if any one knows of a better unit please let me know."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point of being wireless?","review":"I bought this wireless keyboard and mouse so that I can stay out of the radiation from the monitor.

I have been using it for over 2 months.What I like best about this product is the Sleep Key. When I put my Dell PC to sleep by holding the Sleep Key down for 2 or 3 seconds, the PC goes into a deep sleep and doesn't accidentally wake up when I slide the keyboard tray back into my desk. This eliminates my frustration with the WinXp sleep function which very often will wake up with any noise on the keyboard, mouse or power line. You need to do a very positive action with the keyboard or mouse to wake the PC up from the sleep state initiated by this keyboard's Sleep Key.-- If you are using a KVM switch --You will not be able to program this keyboard through a KVM switch. The workaround is to plug the keyboard directly into the PC when you are programming it. After that you can reconnect the keyboard to the KVM switch and use the programmed keys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Near Perfect","review":"I've been very pleased with my Logitech Cordless LX700 keyboard and mouse combo.

It's so simple to use. I've yet to have the mouse's rechargable battery to wear down, though I've only gone a few days without recharging the mouse. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because I have had a couple conflict messages from my Zonealarm security suite concerning the mouse/keyboard.

Conair recommends using it for at least 10 times to see results and I was originally willing to do this. After the third use, the skin on my legs was very irritated and I decided to stop using it. I do not have sensitive skin so it was surprising to see the effect this product had. It also took areas on my legs almost two weeks to get back to normal. The HB1 comes with four exfoliating pads, but I could tell they would not last for long, so you'd be putting out more money for the replacement pads. All in all this was a very disappointing product.

I never have gotten everything off. Under arms? Don't even think about it. They'll be irritated for a couple of days. Do yourself a favor and buy and epilator.

I'll try it.\\" The woman who bought the gift for me also has one and told me NOT TO APPLY ANY PRESSURE when using the device. As a redhead, I have extremely sensitive, thin skin so I followed her advice very carefully. I did not apply any pressure what-so-ever, and didn't keep the device in one area for too long. The result..... worse than any sunburn I've ever had! My legs are burned in various areas, as the product sanded off the first layer of my skin! The skin hardened and has begun to crack in the burned areas. I'm a little concerned and think I should call my physician, as the condition is extremely painful. Worst of all, the hair grew back immediately the next day and I had to shave the areas that were not burned. This is a terrible, dangerous product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"It did remove hair on most of the surfaces, but I could not make it work in concave areas.

I realize it says to use it 2 weeks before you see optimal results but life is to short. I have thick dark hair and maybe that is part of the reason it wouldn't remove all of my stubble, Nair never worked for me either. So to you other women out there with hair like mine and who have used other hair removal products that didn't cut it, don't think that this product is going to be any different.

First, it does say you have to use this 10-12 times in order for your hair to get use to this. I admit--I have only used it twice. However, I bought this hoping to eliminate the need for a razor and this product does not do that. There are many places where you cannot use this hair remover including the bikini area, around the knees and ankles, under the arm, etc. I gave myself a \\"rug\\" burn trying to remover hair on the back of my leg--behind my knee. In addition, I have a feeling that the pads that were included will be used up quickly and I will have a hard time finding replacements. Even if I can find replacements now, eventually this product will be history and then I will have a product that is worth nothing but I paid $50 for.A good razor does a better job--I recommend Venus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"scaly, scaly legs!!!","review":"I saw this on tv, and thought it would be perfect. I'm a big fan of the \\"Hair Mitten\\" and I thought this would be a bigger, better, faster version -- no way! Yes, my legs were smooth the first few hours, but it's been 2 weeks now, and the hair grew back just the same and I've shaved my legs a few times. Not to mention this machine tore my legs to shreds, making them the scaliest things you'd ever wish to see and/or feel. Did I mention the stinging when trying to apply some moisturizer, even DAYS later? Awful! very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"I bought this product b/c I can't stand the feeling of hair/stubble on my legs. I got sick of taking 20 minutes every other day to shave. This product indicated I could remove hair in about the same amount of time, but that it would last much longer than shaving. I purchased it and waited a week to receive it. Once I received it, I spent 40 minutes using it. In this time, I could have shaved both legs, both underarms, and my bikini line twice. Using this product, I was not even done with one leg. I went over the leg numerous times over that 40 minute period, and it did not remove a single hair. I pressed lightly, I pressed hard, I did everything but stand on my head and twirl my feet while rubbing my stomach, and nothing made this product work as indicated. Others may have had luck with it, but I did not. I was not impressed and I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exfoliate yes, remove hair no.","review":"I thought I was going to finally stop shaving when I purchased this machine.

I wish the rating system allowed me to give this item no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope you ladies are right...but alas, you weren't","review":"I just purchased this \\"leg sander\\" based upon what was said in the reviews. The catch is that I'm a male competitive bodybuilder/fitness model and shaving just takes too damn long! Since I have tougher skin than most women, I'm expecting pretty good results after the initial period it takes the body to get used to something new. I'll edit my post after I try it out.OK, I've used it very infrequently because it really doesn't do much as far as hair removal goes, but talk about smooth legs! This thing exfoliates incredibly well. I'll stick to shaving every few days and exfoliate weekly with the sander."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks ideal but isn't","review":"I thought this would be the answer to my shaving woes. It wasn't. I have course hair and this unit is not intended for that. If you have fine hair, it will probably work great.

And this cutting off process is not close to the skin surface so I feel bumps of hair all the time.As suggested in the instructions, I tried to go over the same area for a second round, and it damaged my skin so bad.. I still have the scar of that damage after 2 months. It basically scrapped a thin layer off of my skin in that area and two days later, my skin made a hard red layer in that place to heal the damage.This is the case with the larger areas like thighs.. This product does not come for any use over the knees or any area smaller than the diameter of the disk.And finally.. usage of this product does not have any impact on regrowth of the hair at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subpar at best","review":"This product is great at exfoliating, not so great at hair removal.

Chalk this one up with the \\"I'm With the Band\\" groupie crowd and read the liner notes of Rush albums. If you want information on the band, that's one of the best places to go.

It was the ONLY book one could find on the band RUSH in the late 80s, other than sheet music & tourbooks! There was NO internet, and only a tiny little fan club that was not well-known at all. Considering how big Rush was in 1981-1982, and not much written support for the millions of fans other than the music, the book sold well enough for a couple of printings!In 1988 it was a gold mine of information in the then-secret world of how Rush records were made! It is full of English errors, but at the time, this fan overlooked those, in order to finally read something positive about his favorite band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Honest Perspective From A True Rush Fan","review":"One of the books I couldn't put down, I felt I was living my life long dream through Bill's words.

The information is clouded in writing that resembles that of a lucky fan more than a journalistic effort. The author is also known to write inflammatory comments to and about anyone who disagrees with his views, making it impossible for me to recommend this book.

It's good to see you again, and what can we play for you today?\\" I began to look around to see who Geddy was talking to, but there was nobody else in the amphitheatre. Then suddenly the band wheeled into 'Cygnus X-1'. The air was swallowed by the music's fearsome force. The sound and fury of 'Cygnus' live drowned my heart.The impromptu version ended as the road crew began covering Neil with large curtains while he was still playing.He uses the song's lyrics [Cygnus X-1] to describe the event of the band playing the song. Is that not the typical sleaze we have come to expect from Americans?While I am not a fan of book-burning, I do believe that this book might bring back the practise."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rush Book Report","review":"The poor written quality of this work does no justice to the rare musical talents of the band members. The terms sophomoric and sychophantic characterize Banasiewitz' irrelevant ride on the groupie train.

Of course, tossing 'Visions' into an empty trash can will accomplish the same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, I'm happy!","review":"After reading some not too good reviews and complaints, I was more happy to have bought this. It's a Christmas gift, so I haven't read it. But it came in excellent condition!, though the site only said \\"very good\\". I've read that the grammar is horrible, and that it should have been editd before submission to publish. BUT, this IS RUSH! They are to be admired.

However, in final analysis, I find that this book is more in the vein of the author's gloating about the level of his dedication to the Canadian rock group Rush. As a fan of that band as well, frankly, I was quite embarrassed to find that the \\"best\\" biography of the band was this story. At times it's quite interesting, with many vignettes; however, after a while it becomes tiring, along with the constant sly references to the band's lyrics. My only recommendation is that you buy it only if you have to, because I have read some of the author's other work, and it lacks a lot of discipline and loses the reader rather quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Book, Terrible Writer","review":"I can give B-man credit for one thing: he did his homework when it came to Rush. Other than that, it's a typical biography of a great band. Nothing amazingly revealing. In the end it amounts to junk. B-Man is an odd little sod in his own right. Bottom line: sublimely lame book filled with nothing of any major interest, unless your only knowlidge of Rush was listening to \\"Tom Sawyer\\" on the radio wondering \\"who the hell is that chick that's singing?\\" And by the way, Cary Hall made my other point.

Finally, I would be able to learn something of her and her life! I learned that she was a Lesbian and died in 1927 and not as a destitute alcoholic as written in some rather sketchy histories of her. but that is all I learned. The book is actually more about the author and her trying to make peace with her past and her mother than anything else. If you want to learn about Victorine, you must find another book. If you want to know about Eunice Lipton, this is the book for you. Also very few facts in the book; the author puts Victorine in some situations and conversations, but these are all imaginary. Definitely would not recommend. Author was self-indulgent and apparently not very concerned with her subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Lipton seems reluctant to deal with the facts she can recover. Instead, she prefers to create a fiction which is more of a projection of her own neurosis than anything which is supported by her sources. All the primary sources agree that Victorine Meurent was a destitute alcoholic for some time before she dies, but Lipton prefers to imagine her as a proto-feminist heroine. She seems so blinded by her own prejudice that she can only lash out at anyone who presents her with information which paints Victorine in less than favorable colors. For a more balanced view of the same material, find a copy of Otto Freiderich's Olympia: Manet and the Paris of his Times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this supposed to be scholarship?","review":"'Well, I'm a redhead now, and people are saying, \\"You know, you look like Victorine.\\"'Perhaps I do.'Oh please.

At once convincing and yet on reflection leaves gaping holes (How did they climb such a high mountain and return down in one night including injuries?) the storyline certainly leaves you wanting to belive the tale is entirely true! Since I won't be going to Saudi Arabia anytime soon, it's a good bet this story will be my reference point to the landscape and country.

So this new theory was of great interest to me.Unfortunately, the data presented is not corroborated by a single source. It is presented in a most unplausable and bizarre tale purported to be true.If there was truth here, why has no one sought to follow-up? Why has nothing appeared in the literature to sustain and further evaluate the claims made in this book? I don't know the answer but it must call into question the hypothises presented and the details surrounding the adventure that uncovered it.By the way, no one ever mentions that a translation of Jabal al Lawz could be \\"Mountain of-Laws.\\" Do you really think that this cast of characters was the first to discover that this mountain could really be the true Mt.

In any event, as a Muslim, I would be delighted to discover that the true Mount Sinai is in Arabia.

Gigi D'Agostino has not released a new album since his \\"L'Amour Toujours\\" CD which mainly relied on the hit \\"L'Amour Toujours (I'll Fly With You)\\". That album was released in 2001. From 2001 to 2003, Gigi switched roles and produced two compilation CDs, \\"Il Grande Viaggio\\" in 2002 and \\"Il Programmino\\" in 2003. Both this CDs featured Gigi songs but something was gone. Now, finally, \\"Silence\\" brings back the real Gigi, better than ever.I must say that this is one of the best electronica albums I've heard in a long time. Each song is amazing in it's own way, never sounding similar to another or getting boring. Although \\"Silence\\", \\"Complex\\", \\"Sonata\\", and \\"Apache\\" are my favorites, the entire CD is a masterpiece.It's great to hear Gigi back in action and I hope to hear more in the future. I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy songs, puts you in a reflective mood","review":"The first three songs on this EP, Silence, Complex, and Sonata are good enough to buy this cd alone. They are 6 - 9 minutes long and build into incredibly beautiful songs. Apache is a good remix, if you liked the original, Pop Corn is also a fun remix, but the title track and track 8 which should be labeled Silence (vision 3) builds off the beginning track's melody effortlessly. Half the EP is superb, and judging by the standards based on music that has been released these days, that is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was a great reference, but getting outdated","review":"While this book was the \\"breeder's Bible\\" when it was first published 25 years ago, the fact is that genetics, especially equine genetics, has progressed by leaps and bounds since then.

However, if you're looking to answer specific genetic questions (For example, \\"How do I get an Overo?\\"), then you may end up with wrong information.

After Gypsy dies, Kevin Bacon tries to catch his breath looking down over the edge of the garage and then looks shocked. Then, there's are two weird cutaway shots first to the lead bicycle chick sporting an enigmatic smile, and then to Kevin without his shirt. Where are they in the cutaways? In his loft? Do those few seconds take place right after the chase scene? Does anyone remember those cutaways being longer in the original film?

Ms. Gertz, by contrast, turns an abundance of personality to good account through her career. I just don't know what \\"untalented\\" means in the context of this silly movie, but it was twenty years ago. Is the insult intended to be forthe movie or for her whole career since? kBad form and fuzzy thinking.I think the movie is an attempt to imitate features of Flashdance: upbeat background music, meaningless but interesting visuals, skill display, romance, people with aspirations surviving at a humble level.

The metal cup at the bottom vibrates so much when the machine is on, that it wants to walk out of the cup-slot while I'm juicing. I have to prop it with a dish towel to keep it in place.

Of course, I have no experience with the one on TV, but this one is just not that great. First problem is that this juicer leaves a very wet pulp. We made apple juice and it took a lot of apples at 99c a pound to get a very little juice and a lot of wet pulp.

Killer Commute is a compelling, dynamic, page-turner of a mystery from first to last!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Commute in Overdrive","review":"This really is a pretty long, boring commute. The traffic doesn't move much, and the road takes the reader through a whole lot of over-complicated and over-decorated scenery. Not to overdo the metaphor (but why not? Marlys Millhiser certainly does) I felt as though I were stuck in traffic, looking out my car window while a group of strangers hurried past me. I didn't care about them, and they didn't stop long enough to include me in the events. Add to that a gimmicky prose style, a virtually unintelligible dialogue, and a synthetic and twisted plot--and you have this novel: a perfectly awful journey that couldn't end fast enough. Avoid the drive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Dry to Work With","review":"While I like the wood and am using it the blanks were very dry and tend to splinter when turned."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreliable company","review":"I wanted a somewhat larger piece of wood.

Most of the cards (36) are \\"normal\\" with no photos on them at all. The aces, court cards and two jokers have images on them. That's 16 Bettie Page images plus the one on the backs of all of the cards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Least favorite of the B. Page card sets.","review":"I purchased these along with Olivia's lucky ladies playing cards and the Bettie Page playing cards. Right away, the packaging for the playing cards fell apart, came unglued. As for the cards themselves, only the royals are given pictures of Bettie, the rest are just numbered cards. Some people may enjoy this, but personally I find it less than stellar. I must also add that I've come to determine I fell for the Olivia version of Bettie Page, and the actual images of her do not have the same appeal to me as the fantastical renderings that Olivia brings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bettie Page playing cards are where it's at.","review":"High-quality cards - I had purchased them as a gift for a pin-up loving friend, and she absolutely adores them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical knitting book","review":"I was really surprised how much I liked this book. This isn't a pattern book, but a book about the craft of knitting with inspiration from women of myth and history. In fact it's three books in one: a very nicely written book on mythical and biblical women, a book on how to knit creatively, and a book with some practical garment diagrams like shrugs and turtleneck pullovers.There are no pictures of the projects, but you can visit a website created by the author to view some of the knitted examples from the book.I think this book would especially be good for handspinners of \\"designer\\" yarns, and also for those of us who collect odd balls of interesting yarns and fibers but aren't quite sure what to do with them. I didn't expect to like this book, but I really am impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice stories, but book lacks depth","review":"I will admit that, as someone who has been knitting consistently for over a decade and who learned to knit about thirty years ago from my Mother, I probably have a deep prejudice against \\"neophytes\\" writing books about knitting. This woman admits to only have knitted for two years when she wrote this book! While the stories are nice, I feel that this book lacks depth. For about the same money, you can get both of Mary Thomas's books -- Mary Thomas's Knitting Book and Mary Thomas's Book of Knitting Patterns -- books written by a real Knitting Goddess, which open up a truly vast knitting universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A knitting book to curl up with","review":"This book is not just a knitting book--it is one to curl up with and read--the myth adaptations are so much fun. Personally, I love the purple ink, too--this is a fun, informative book. I think, as another reviewer mentioned, this was \\"the book that started it all\\"--the Knitting Goddess was one of the \\"forefront\\" books when the current knitting craze began.Deborah, will we ever have another book from you--maybe a companion/sequel to The Knitting Goddess? Though it's been many years now since the Goddess was published, you have many fans and I wonder when we'll hear from you again. I enjoy this writer's work so much that I also bought her Inner Voyager personal journal/workbook--another gem. I hope Deborah is happily knitting, wherever she is--and I hope she graces the knitting world with another lovely book one day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, a Delightful Book","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book as much for the stories as for the patterns. I enjoy reading books that celebrate the work that women have done for centuries and, though the author adapts some of the story details, I think this book celebrates women's work. I also enjoyed her general description of different types of fiber and some practical advice on adding metallic yarn and other trendier yarns to a project to make it a bit flashier. The only drawback to the book is that most of the women in the stories were spinners and weavers, not knitters. This does not in any way take away from a very fun book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not if you want a serious pattern book","review":"As a serious knitter, I was quickly disappointed with this book. All of the printing is done in purple ink, which I found very irritating while reading. Far too much of the book was taken up by strange interpretations of classic stories involving women, mixed with large doses of unnecessary autobiography and new-age philosophy. Some might find the stories interesting or inspiring; I found myself flipping past them in annoyance to find the patterns... which were poorly illustrated with sketches in purple. I truly love knitting and am always happy when someone else shares that love, but this book was neither helpful nor useful to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great disc!","review":"Another great disc from Glory. There is no filler on this disc. Do yourself a favor and pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleaser","review":"An excellent album... not derivative at all, yet manages to become a favorite of all types of people. Nine Hours Back is my favorite track, but they are just as good pared down to a guitar/voice as they are in full band mode. Big talent, I play it constantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"WMFW - MUSIC FOR THE MIND & SOUL","review":"Solivan & Bernardo, a pair of cowboy junkies, are able to capture the twang of Beggars Banquent & Rubber Soul with the kooky, glistening sounds of Beck, Ween, & Wilco. In a world apparently dividing its attention between 50 Cent & The Dixie Chicks, \\"LAST YEAR'S JUNK\\" musically and lyrically is surely some of the most obtuse pop music to have graced the New York streets.This is an album powered by melody & by Solivan's amazingly expressive voice. A carefully crafted, inventive mix that defies easy classification. Part rock, part folk, part country, & part blues. There's no one word that encompasses their sound.WHITE MUD FREE WAY reflects a state of life that calls for another way of living. Like kicking stones on the side of the road & trying to figure out how a good love can hurt so bad. Like having no direction home & telling yourself \\"I'll never come back this way again!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"It was recommended...","review":"I couldn't get into the book. It is slow.

I mean, what is this?? \\"In the land of make-believe...\\" It's totally gross. What what Madonna thinking? This song is a joke. It's random. It doesn't fit with anything Madonna's every done. It's dumb. Don't waste your money. I wish I could give it 0 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"yay! it's back in stock :)","review":"get this Madonna cd single because it's geting more and more scarce. \\"Dear Jessie\\" was only released as a single in Europe and Australia.

The CD back cover promises Radio London jingles, but they are not on THIS CD.

If you like White Zombie, this album is a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More exceptional work from Rob Zombie","review":"Start to finish, this CD was amazing. If nothing else, the way that the songs differ. Some have hard, driving, banger-music written all over it, while others are just as great a song but is presented in a completely different way. I was also struck by how unsimilar this was to La Sexorcisto, not to put it down but i enjoyed this just as much if not more than La Sexorcisto. Overall this is just quality music that will bring hours upon hours of listening pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Is this art?\\"","review":"Rob Zombie's vision of art is little more the repulsive visuals with a minimum of talent to back it up. 'Astro-Creep 2000' is more of a portfolio then it is anything else. The band is at its worst on songs like \\"I Zombie\\" and \\"Blood Milk and Sky\\". I guess if you looked at this CD as a teeny bopper horror movie then it might have more appeal. The only songs that show what Zombie and the crew could do are \\"More Human Than Human\\" and \\"Real Solution #9\\". These are both great songs and have an intesting sound. But thats as far as it goes. Rob Zombie's best bet is to let his band join in more on the song writing. He seems to think that his style is the only style, and that his style is good. Well, he is wrong on both accounts. But until we hear more of the band, White Zombie should just be called Rob Zombie's Tour Band!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It gets two b/c the music is okay","review":"I got this cd and Rob's cd. Both of them have some songs with good guitars, drums, etc.(More Human than Human,Electric Head Pt. 2), but I dont like any of the lyrics. This is b/c I am a Christian. Sometimes the stuff is just too weird and seems too much like \\" Devil music\\"(especially Super-Charger Heaven, all the pics in the book, all the lyrics). Because of this it is difficult to listen to it, especially if you can understand some of the lyrics.I like heavy music but some of the contents in this album offend me. It seems blatantly satanic sometimes, and that is not a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW can you even BEAR to...nevermind.","review":"I was visiting a friend's house who had long talked about his favorite band, \\"White Zombie\\", when I heard this CD. After a couple of minutes of this garbage I couldn't take it anymore and had to leave the room. It has a certain fingernails-screeching-across-a-blackboard sound to it coupled with somebody, (I'm assuming it's Rob Zombie), emitting some sort of guttaral, gravelly sound which nobody could argue is even close to singing. I suppose if you like the ear-wrenching, stomach-churning feeling you get from the experience of listening to this stuff, that's your own choice. But this can never, in any way, be considered music."},{"rating":"1","title":"O.K., but not as good as the first one","review":"What happeded to these guys? La Sexorcisto was good, straight forward, metal, coming out at a time when all this alterna-garbage was on the rise. On this one they went along the trendy industrial route. The few good songs are \\"Supercharger Heaven\\" and \\"Electric Head, Pt.2\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"censored version!!!","review":"I downloaded this album from amazon and recieved the cencored version.

Yeah, you should all buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't realise this was censored.","review":"I got this album in hopes that I was getting the original but it turned out to be the censored version. Apparently, the original version is marked as [Explicit]. I think the censored version should have [Censored] on it. In any case, be careful with your buy. If you want the original make sure it has [Explicit] in the title. The censoring makes it sound like a CD skipping and disrupts the songs entirely.Please note that the album itself is awesome. I just needed to replace the one that I lost. White Zombie rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blood, Milk and Sky","review":"Can never get enough Blood, Milk and Sky best song on a great CD what the hell They are all great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of those perfect records","review":"I just listened to this in my car for the first time in a while and I was reminded of what a perfect record this is. The word that always comes to mind to describe AC2K is \\"shattering\\". Bludgeoning guitar work, slamming drum work and RZ's voice and lyrics - often deliberately incomprehensible and somehow better for it. The recorded introductions and the dark voodoo atmosphere of the songs make it almost a concept album. All the tracks are great, but I have to call out my favorite: Blood, Milk and Sky. I have no idea what its about, but the searing guitar work, bottle-rattling percussion and eerie wordless choruses never get tired."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER GOOD ONE","review":"ANOTHER GOOD ONE.

This CD is great - Rob's 3rd best cd! Awesome AWesome Aweomse. the best songs are Electric Head Series, Super Charger Heaven, Real Solution #9 and more human than human. Go get this, it absolutley kicks."},{"rating":"2","title":"eclectic mix of styles and myriad of genres","review":"this is a superlative mixture and represents mr zombie's influences, from leonard cohen to liberace. Mr Rob (or Rod to his friends) comes out of his shell with this opus, and fires both barrels of chocolate covered poo directly at the audience. no mere contemporary of al jorgenson's, he appropriates the whole show and runs with it way beyond what Ozzy started. from his rad tats, to his way with a woman, Hot Rod herman really delivers the goods judas priest style with this one. One can only wonder what is ahead with mr Z driving the dragula mobile. if this superlative work is any indication, it is sure to be ham handed sandwiches, cherry charlie chans, and a big ole doss of american pie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zombie Revisited","review":"It had been a while (like 4 years or so...) since I'd listened to this album, and I don't know what was wrong with me. This is a great, timeless, completely heavy album. The whole thing is better than what came before (La Sexorcisto) and better than what came after (Rob's first solo album). Overall, that would put this at the pinnacle of the Zombie legacy. Every song is great in its own way, and on this disc White Zombie stradles that very fine line of giving each song its own sound without making the listener wonder if they're listening to a compilation; that is to say, every song has its own unique nuances but the whole thing is signature White Zombie. \\"More Human Than Human\\" was the monster (haha!) hit, but any of these songs deserves repeat listens. Go out and get this one if you have a hankerin' for some heavy, dirty, vicious-sounding metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"white zombie,s awesome astro creep 2000!","review":"white zombie released astro creep 2000 in 1995.astro creep 2000 was the follow up to la sexocisto devil music vol 1.in my opinion this album is every bit as good and strong as la sexocisto.there are quite a few songs rob zombie still plays with his band in concert to this day from this classic album such as ;super charger heaven, more human than human and creature of the wheel to name a few.unfortuneately astro creep 2000 was white zombie,s last album of new material as a band after the astro creep 2000 tour the band broke up.by 1998 rob zombie came out with his first solo album; [the excellent hellbilly deluxe!]however in my opinionthe great cuts on this album are;electrichead,supercharger heaven,more human than human,blood, milk and sky grease paint and monkey brainselectric head part 2 and creature of the wheel.if you are a rob zombie fan you know this album is an essential for the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorite albums","review":"I still listen to this regularly even though I got it six years ago. White Zombie's \\"Astro Creep 2000\\" was a brand of industrial metal that turned the heavy metal world on its ear. Before Rob Zombie became the self-indulged egotistical (but still cool somewhat) solo artist he is today, he led the great White Zombie with his trademark growling and funky lyrics (along with his always great album artwork). \\"Astro Creep 2000\\" is an album with catchy heavy metal songs you can't help but bang your head to. \\"Supercharger Heaven\\", \\"I Zombie\\", \\"More Human Than Human\\", and \\"El Phantasmo & The Chicken Run Blast 'O Rama\\" remain fan favorites and White Zombie classics, and this is one of the albums that you have no excuse not to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"more than more human then human (?)","review":"this cd was so much more than the hit song, more human than human, this was truely the greatest shock cd in its times. EVERY song on this is perfect, never missing a beat and never gets old. i really love this cd. it is an unrecognized classic, i dont think white zombie got as much credit as they deserve, they are, after all, responsible for some of the newer metal bands (static-X, even his bro powerman 5000 took on the zombie sound.) i swear, if i ever have kids, they will be forced to own this album. its the great way to start an education."},{"rating":"2","title":"White Zombie RULEZ!!!","review":"If your a new comer to white zombie then get this cd FIRST.Rob vocals will tear your brains out and then stick'em back in.The most best song on ther is..( and this is my opinion )\\"Blur the Technocolor\\" it blends electronic with trash, and the other songs you just have to find out for your self!"},{"rating":"2","title":"kicks arse","review":"It's a shame that such a unreal band bloody brokeup.

A lot of the songs are an adrenaline rush and will have up and doing something energenic. One thing about white zombie that I like but don't like about other bands is the use of soundbytes because it adds to the music and doesn't distract from it. So if you like Rob Zombie or metal then buy this cd you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best....Better than all the rest...!!!","review":"White Zombie was a great band.....probobly the best band the world has ever known besides Rob Zombie.

There are several accessory pieces available. If installed correctly in studs, this closet in VERY sturdy and will be able to hold all your clothes without any malfunction.I installed one kit in my closet, the wifes closet, wifes spare room closets, and also bought just the vertical pieces and shelves for the closet.

Installation of the hang bar and vertical uprights took less than 30 minutes with 2 people, after all measurements were marked off on the closet walls.

Why don't they revamp this product so you can make 6-10 hot dogs and leave out the bun warmer? I love the convenience of popping the hot dogs down and having them ready in minutes, but making only 2 at a time seems less than ideal. My other complaint is it seems it wouldn't be that big of a deal to make the opening a little bigger so larger hot dogs would not get stuck. Only the smallest hotdogs fit, and those are harder to find nowdays when everything is jumbo size. Someone should reinvent this thing. I'd gladly spend more for a bigger one, especially given the price of other hot dog makers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who needs a microwave?","review":"This was one of my Christmas gifts.

I was very disappointed with the appliance, once I tried it out. You can only use regular size hot dogs (no jumbo, bun length, etc.) in this machine and even then, the hot dog is unevenly cooked. Let's just call the bun toaster a bun warmer, since that's about all it does. The machine doesn't push the bun up against the heating plate, so only the edges of the buns touch and, therefore, get toasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire Danger?","review":"This item is an incredible POS.

She sure does cook for him but no passion in the kitchen.

The characters were very well written, and the story itself felt lush, if a bit unbelievable.I liked the idea of a woman setting out on her own, learning to live independently (even though there's another guy waiting in the wings), while solving a mystery. If the plot is a bit pat at points, and Lillian/Bailey's life seems controlled by men, well. . .it is a romance novel, after all.The only big problem I had with the book was that I found the ending far more complicated than it should have been, especially for a book that was otherwise such a perfect beach read.This is not Ms. Deveraux's best, but if you're looking for a light read with great characters, that really draws you in, this would be a fine choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"I read this book after just having read 'Forever' and I suppose after that stinker anything was good. I thought The Mulberry Tree was ok but very confusing. I had a hard time keeping track of the characters toward the end and kept having to flip back and refresh my memory. Also: how exactly did Jimmy come by the farmhouse in the First place? What was the feud between Patsy & Janice? (Never explained). Why didn't Jimmy just tell her the whole story for God's sake? And I still don't understand why he left the money to Ray & Atlanta. It just didn't make any sense to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going from Fat to Thin","review":"Like the heroine in the Mulberry Tree, Deveraux continues to go from fat to thin in her recent writings. Being a farm girl I've spent my life making preserves and canning. I really don't need a cooking education. Should I ever, I know that there are many books in the COOKING SECTION that should help me. Deveraux spent more time explaining how to can foods, (something that must have totally excited her when she researched this book), than she did developing a romance between Bailey and Matthew. Her books used to be so very good. What is happening with our girl? Please don't bother with this book, especially if you're an avid fan like me. This, as well as many recent novels, only serve to depress those of us who have followed her for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange story","review":"I didn't like this book at all. In fact I am surprised I finished it. I am not a fan of flash back stories anyway, but as I read the convoluted 'plot' twists in this book, I was frustrated and really didn't give a crap what happened in the past. I cared more about her present (becoming a person in her own right) rather than her husbands tragic past. I felt the emphasis on his strange upbringings and the entire small town he grew up in were very uninteresting, and her life and accomplishments were given short shrift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete Storyline; Unresolved Issues","review":"The book seemed a little too far fetched for me. How is it that she was expected (by a husband who had no clue that his lawyer would help her as he did) to start from the ground up and restore such a piece of trash house being all alone and having no money. My big question and someone PLEASE answer this - why did her husband leave her penniless when he couldn't stand his so-called siblings. I know he wanted questions answered and he said he would leave her \\"what she needed,\\" but how was she realistically supposed to do the job he wanted without a penny to her name? And why leave all of his money to two siblings he couldn't stand? I was hopeful these questions would be answered by the end of the book, but they never were. Someone please enlighten me. This book was the first one I have ever read by Jude Deveraux; it has put a bad taste in my mouth for her work.

She has gone from books like \\"Knight in Shining Armor\\" to this trash? It's almost hard to believe that both books were written by the same author. She used to write such good, steamy romances. I didn't even realize Baily and Matt were suppossed to be the main romantic couple until I was halfway done. Don't waste your time.

I suggest \\"The Summerhouse\\" or \\"Knight in Shining Armor\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing/Lifeless","review":"This story had so many minor characters you needed a directory to keep track of them.

But unfortunately it was never really found."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avid Alabama Reader","review":"This is not one of Ms Deveraux' better works. The story line was good and if the heroine had overcome obstacles herself instead of having all her difficulties eliminated for her, as if fairy godmother waved a wand, it would have been a better story. If Ms Deveraux' purpose was to lay a basis for future sequels, she did a good job of giving us thumbnail characterizations. The book left me wanting to know the stories of several of the other characters. My favorite Deveraux book is Knight in Shining Armor and that heroine was also showered with fortuitous circumstances. The difference between the two books is that in Knight, we have already suspended our beliefs and accepted the time travel so it isn't such a leap to accept additional beneficence. But the modern setting of Mulberry Tree requires us to leap back and forth between reality and fantasy too often. I look forward to reading more from Ms Deveraux but I suggest she decide in which venue she writes."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"I've loved (until now) everything that Jude Deveraux had written.

There was never a connection between her and the hero-oh he tastes her chutney and bam!-in love, lets move in together.

Composed of three separate but somewhat related stories, they are uneven, rushed, and perilously close to \\"bodice ripper\\" plots. After reading \\"The Forest House,\\" the events in \\"Lady of Avalon\\" become repititious and predictable, with a palpable lack of imagination and wit in the story lines. It is \\"deja vu all over again,\\" and again, and again. I was bored, and I had the distinct feeling that Ms. Bradley was bored, too.

However, I DID find the ritual stuff interesting -- in fact, to my mind, that was the best part of the book. In sum, \\"Mists\\" was best, \\"Forest House\\" was okay, and \\"Lady\\" was the worst of the three.

The pageantry, the mythology of the Goddess, the feminism! Great book no question. However in Ms. Bradley's new prequel, LADY OF AVALON, I was grievously disappointed. The cover shows a Stevie Nicks look a like in a blue smock with a slightly constipated look on her face. That's as good as it gets.Reincarnation, heavy handed New Age philosophy and very sketchy characters (the priestesses of the sacred Isle of Avalon snipe at each other like annoyed girl scouts) add up to a mishmash unworthy of Ms Bradley and her previous works. It left such a bad taste in my mouth that I had to go rent Monty Python and the Holy Grail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite as good as Mists of Avalon","review":"If you've read Mists of Avalon are looking for a sequel, you're probably going to be disappointed. First, Lady of Avalon is a prequel to Mists of Avalon, outling the creation of Avalon and the histories of the women who first brought Avalon into the mists. Second, it's written as three separate stories, each foreshadowing the Arthur story, not one continuous story.In spite of it's differences, the book by itself is quite good all in all. And if you really do want to learn about how Avalon came to be, this book may answer some questions that \\"Mists of Avalon\\" raised. I would recomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comperably difficult and shallow","review":"Compared to \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" (a marvelous book) and even \\"The Forest House\\" (which was a shade off the first but still readable) this book rings hollow. Sadly so, because it is broken into three parts with a great deal of potential to explore various segments of history between the first two novels. Somehow it comes up lacking; as if the author simply missed the characters and times, and revisited both with mediocre success. The energy of the first, and the trauma of the second, is lacking.

When I got it I thought it would deal with the Arthurian legends at least in part. Instead I found that the book dealt with basically the same tale being told again and again. This is of course accomplished by means of reincarnation so that in each story the names of the characters change but not their basic role in the plot.My Impression-I liked the stories on an individual level but when woven together the effect is not as grand as just taking the characters and stories one at a time.

The story lacked suspense and the writing style was limited. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good California Mystery","review":"If you like California PI novels, you'll like this book. The book reminds me of an updated Hammett/Chandler work. As I read it, I heard echoes of Crais, Connelly, and Grafton in the prose. I recommend The Wonderland Murders highly. I hope you enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for women","review":"I purchased this book hoping for a good mystery/thriller, but was somewhat disappointed. While there is a pretty good mystery there, I found the writing to be lacking and, at times, repetitive. Normally, I like to share my books with friends after I've completed reading them, but due to the foul language and crude remarks about female characters in this book, I will only be sharing it with the trash can. I'd be too embarrassed to share it with any females I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD READ!!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I met Mr. Braithwaite at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books where he was signing this book as well as a mystery cookbook he was featured in. Mr. Braithwaite is quite a charming man, and he is an excellent mystery writer. I'm glad I bought this book. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"This is a rather unimaginative mystery novel. It was dull and without the tension and suspense that a good mystery requires to hook the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"From TV to My Bookshelf--Great Book!","review":"I first heard of this book when I saw Kent Braithwaite (along with his daughter) being interviewed on CBS television in Anchorage. He was in town for a mystery convention, and THE WONDERLAND MURDERS sounded like an interesting book. I bought the book, and I finished reading it in two days. It tells a fast-paced and exciting story about a series of murders in a California amusement park. Having grown up in the American Southwest, I enjoyed the Latino detective and the multicultural setting. It reminded me of home, and I've shared my copy with friends who have also enjoyed it. It's a great book, and I am glad THE WONDERLAND MURDERS moved from CBS-TV to my bookshelf!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wathch out...This book has NOTHING to do with John Holmes","review":"Braithwaithe must be making a lot of money off suckers like me who bought his book, thinking it had to do with THE Wonderland murders.And I think it terribly wrong that Amazon is placing this piece of fiction in with the non-fiction of the Wonderland story. Amazon must count on people like me who'd rather just donate the book to a library, rather than go through all the damn trouble of sending the thing back.I am pissed, not at Braithwaite, but at Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"This is a dull and unimaginative novel. I'm not sure what book the other reviewers read, but Wonderland Murder is a pure bore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Debut","review":"Braithwaite has broken onto the mystery scene in a dramatic fashion with The Wonderland Murders. I heard him speak at Bouchercon, Cluefest, and Left Coast Crime. I liked his book and I hope future Jesse Ascencio novels are just as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrelentingly Dull","review":"This was a poorly plotted novel with leaden dialogue and paper-thin character development. The story line wasn't remotely plausible, and the ending was predictable. Try Ross McDonald for California-based mystery novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Suspense","review":"Kent Braithwaite's Wonderland Murders was an interesting novel. I enjoyed the story. It takes place in California and Nevada. It is a mystery with several murders. The hero is a Hispanic detective, and in the end, good triumphs over evil. I believe author Braithwaite really knows the setting he's writing about, and the suspense elements of the story were very satisfying. Overall, The Wonderland Murders easily earns my five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Binding, Cheaper content","review":"...This is a dull tawdry tale that proves that good writing does not always make for entertaining reading. In other words, yes, this guy has a writers education, but none of the writers art. Hopefully, a little more practice will help. This book may appeal to a certain sort of reader, but don't look to it for mass appeal for a broad audience.This book earns it's one star based on the fact that the main character was different from the stereotype, but even that was overdone to the point that he was not believeable.It was nice to have an hispanic hero, but he deserves to be represented with a better plot and persona.To top off the delightful experience of reading this book, the pages started falling out of the book from the start. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Blues Ever!!!!","review":"I enjoyed every song on the disc. If you love blues then you will love what Sir Charles Jones can offer you.

The primary emphasis is on the two technologies Lunar-distance and chonometer for determining longitude with a precision under 1 degree. The relative percentages are: 50% chonometer, 30% lunar distance, 10% Jupiter's moons, 10% general history pre-1600's. I gave it four stars instead of 5 because I thought the book was going to be a balanced discussion ( i.e. equal time)encompassing all methods of determining longitude irrespective of a 1 degree precision. All that said, I would still recommend the book to anyone interested in the topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD. THIS IS A PICTURE CD!!!","review":"HELLO.

It takes a lot to make me laugh and reading this book did just that! I love the way the author brings humor into the everyday struggles that we see in some people. I like her theme, \\"Watch how they praise the Lord and you do the opposite\\" This book will not only make you laugh but will also help you to examine yourself to make sure you are being a godly example to others.

Perhaps he shouldn't be. That is my opinion. Maybe Crime and Punishment was good, but Notes from the Underground is absolutely awful. To be completely honest, I haven't even gotten to Part 2 yet, but the book is like Johnny Got His Gun and Walden on speed (quoted directly from my English teacher). The main character in this book, the Underground Man, is no more than a coward who has time to write books on how he is much too intelligent to act in life. The first seventeen pages leave the reader with a migraine, and after that, it all goes downhill. By the end of the book, I'm almost positive that one will be half insane and screaming, \\"Twice two is four, but twice two equals five is charming.\\" Do not waste your time reading this so-called \\"classic.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pevear and Volokhonsky translation of this text is not as good as others.","review":"I would recommend the P&V; translation of THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV as I believe it is better than one by Garnett. Of the translations of NOTES FROM UNDERGROUND I think the P&V; version is not so good. I would go with the MacAndrew text.My mind works in much the same way as does the narrator in NOTES, and I find the word choice in the P&V; translation to be somewhat incongruous at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"A look in to the human condition","review":"Dostoyevsky begins this cornerstone work with the nameless antihero saying, \\"I\\", slowly, throughout the work, Dostoyevsky lures the reader into the mind of an antihero, till the last pages there is only talk of \\"we\\". After catching my breath after my first read, I found myself lured to rereading the last chaptern over . This book should be taken to heart by anyone interested in philosophy, politics, and psychology. Not only is this work a turning point in Dostoyevsky's life, but I feel it also leaves an seductive psychology abyss. An abyss that none one has dared to jump over, but only created cheap imitations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly. Like looking at a newly born sparrow.","review":"I could not find any redeeming reason to read this. I did not want to be near the book after trying. I tried as he was supposed to be a great author. My memory tells me that I threw this book into the trash. I did not want it on my book shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traces of Constraints to Mind, Soul and Body","review":"I consider the book a masterpiece of showing the alienation that a mean negativism attitude derived from the constraints of the social space and the society as a whole where the main character of the book lives and takes action. I write this review as an eastern european who grew up in a society in transition and the attitude of mean negativism and irony are the sole results of a toxic and full of betrayals society."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most in-depth analyses of a toothache ever written!","review":"The basis of his subsequent masterpieces, to call \\"Notes from the Underground\\" dark and disturbing is like calling King Kong \\"ape-like.\\" It is often considered a cornerstone of existential thought, which is apt, because Dostoevsky was nearly as important to existentialism as Kierkegaard or Sartre. His characters, particularly the \\"anti-hero\\" character prevalent in his works, were perhaps the most original and unique to be created since the time of Shakespeare and Cervantes. Modern literature is almost unthinkable without Dostoevksy's contributions, most of which originated in this novella."},{"rating":"2","title":"The volition to reform","review":"The man from the underground struggles with his inner demons and the consciousness of his own depravity and his unwillingness to make concessions due to reason. He believes one's own free will, or volition, must supercede reason, which should be relegated to the conformist proletariat masses.Dostoyevsky leaves an indelible impression in such a short masterpiece. Read it in one sitting and come away impressed and pondering the validity of Dostoyevsky and his singular, dark theme of determinism."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I am a sick man....\\"","review":"With these opening lines, the ultimate outsider novel was born almost 140 years ago. Despite the number of years since its publication, it has lost none of its meaning, insight, or social value as a work of art. If anything, it has gained popularity and standing due to the many divergent and contentious worldviews of so many outsiders from all walks of life today. Few people realize that Ralph Ellison's classic 'Invisible Man' owes more than just passing gratitude for inspiration. Dostoevsky, similar to Goethe, was a true genius of his age that will continue to move and inspire generations of readers for centuries to come. While this is his shortest novel, many would argue that it is also his best.

Perhaps, the reviewer has spent too much time in front of the TV where everything is picture perfect. These are real people in the field capturing their discoveries with the equipment they have available. Some footage was taken by Stealth Game Cameras which have no sound, and at night, some cameras do not video due to darkness, but only sound is available. The reviewer has no concept of what happens when an animal is cornered. Press the issue, and either it or you will have to die. Either case is unacceptable.

This means the snow has to rise above a 1/2 to 3/4 inch surface in order to get up onto the Snowscoop. Unfortunately this causes any snow less than an inch deep to simply be pushed forward (rather than coming up onto the Snowscoop) and it eventually just gets pushed off to the sides of the Snowscoop.I love the very sturdy wheel, and I like the ability to replace the metal protector edge. I think a differently designed protector blade could improve on the design even more, providing a gradual ramp up onto the Snowscoop, and perhaps even adding side walls that force more snow onto the Snowscoop rather than escaping off to the side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat helpful/No replacement for a Snowblower","review":"Its great on flat surfaces, so order wisely. If you have an older driveway or uneven sidewalks, i would think differently. But...it has been somewhat helpful, i think it also needs more than one wheel.

The opening version of Cole Porter's \\"You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To\\" places the exquisite melody front and center and floats by like the gentlest of breezes.Other tracks on the CD are also strong. \\"The Very Thought of You\\" is so dreamily romantic that it casts a lovely spell. Hoagy Carmichael's \\"Everything Happens to Me\\" is one of those good-to-be-blue tunes we'd like to hear with last call on which Lewis Nash's cymbals and David \\"Fathead\\" Newman's elegant sax blend exquisitely.

I like it to be as bright as possible when its dark out so I bought them for that reason instead of the fog. I did as others did and removed the black cover from the bulb which I think makes them fog lights instead of driving lights. I am glad I did that because as in some reviews the gasket in one of them was incorrectly assembled. They are very sturdy lights. I did not use the switch or the relay that was included instead I wired it into my parking lights wiring so they would be on with both high and low beams and because my headlights are so bright I can turn off my lights if I am pulling into a parking lot or up to someone on the jobsite and use just my fog lights.

For its price I believe it is an excellent buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else","review":"The lights work well enough but the rest of the system really is cheap. The wiring is super small and heated up when first turned on, you think they would use something heavy with the wattage. I don't think the lights output was as good because of it. The connectors were loose fitting and had to be tightened up before installing, one had a bad crimp. The switch seemed little light duty but used it anyway.

Mostly, I'm motivated by the completely idiotic Kirkus review -- of course the author doesn't offer serious solutions. It ceases to be funny and turns into a policy paper if you offer solutions. Steinberg's take on the post office in \\"B is for bureaucracy\\" is dead on, as is \\"O is for Oprah.\\" What the Kirkus review claims is the one bright spot, the terza rima parody, is the singular unfunny chapter in this book. And as for going over familiar ground, no one that I've seen has gotten to the heart of Oprah as has Steingberg. This isn't literature, and thank God.

It sounds as if these guys got together to ridicule and disgrace one of the greatest anthems of the '90's. \\"Dive\\" and \\"Something In The Way\\" are done somewhat reasonably well, but these guys are no Kurt.

Cleopatra must have handed them a list of Nirvana songs and pointed to a crusty dump to record them in. This is a joke and not a very good one.I don't see the point of making such a joke.

If you wanna hear real good material of those bands you should buy old stuff, the first albums, Vibrators: Puremania, Vice Squad: punk singles collection, UK Subs: Another kind of blues (too much cocaine, my friend), and with Dee Dee you should buy first Ramones CDs.if you wanna hear nirvana, you better get the studio albums, the band is not bad...just a little slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it zero stars if I could.","review":"Don't buy this ....

It's rather a quiet movie, but it has a good story. It's a good message, in the end of sin and redemption. It really illustrates how we let ourselves be haunted and tortured by our own pasts. It's not really a horror movie, but a story that looks at a dark subject and its long-term effects. I like how the story unfolded, so that it left you wondering who was who and had some surprising twists and turns.It could have easily fallen into boring cliches, but managed to avoid that, while revealing more and more about the different characters in the movie. I realize the message of the movie is not for everyone, but I found it refreshing to see a movie that reflects some of my own values, and it does so in a quiet way, not banging you over the head with them.

Trouble is, my callers don't want to talk to me because the echo drives them crazy (though I hear no echo on my end).I'm considering ways to block the sound travelling between the microphone and earpiece to stop the echo (and avoid making another headset purchase)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, works fine","review":"I have had this model for a couple months and I have found it to be sufficient. I mostly use it in the car and have not had problems. There is sometimes an echo on the other person's end, but it has not interfered with conversations. For a low-end model, I think it is a good deal and would recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ECHO... Echo... echo... e...","review":"Motorola's attempt at Bluetooth failed. EVERYONE I talked to was annoyed by the echo. It is an instant echo caused by the microphone picking up the earpiece. Your voice doesn't echo. They hear their own voice bouncing back. Pity... A small amount of foam inside could have solved the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend Your Money on Anything but This","review":"If you like throwing away money, send it to me instead of buying this thing. You'd getter better value from a bag of warm cow pies.The HS805 must have been designed and produced by a bunch about as bright as a bag of hammers.This product is bulky and balky. It drops calls, loses its connection, and will not repair with my BlackBerry 7100 without my entering the connection settings every time I turn it on.This is my second experience with a Motorola Bluetooth headset. Both products are of the same quality, though the design and engineering of the HS810 far outstripped the quality of its manufacture.If you're looking for a quality Bluetooth headset, ABM, (anyone but Motorola)."},{"rating":"2","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"While certainly not the best headset out there, it's far from the worst, either. I got mine free with my new Motorola RAZR V3, and it seems to be very adequate. It paired with the phone immediately, and has had no connection problems so far. I has good range and good reception. The earpiece is surprisingly loud, though this does cause that annoying echo if you're not careful. Setting it to a lower volume fixed it for me. It hangs on my ear quite comfortably considering there's no padding, though it is a little loose as previously mentioned. More an annoyance than a problem, as it hasn't fallen off or anything yet. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this headset as a low-cost solution, though I probably wouldn't buy it for full price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty solid overall and fun to use!","review":"I have been using my headset for over a week now and have had no major problems as of yet.

Maybe I was lucky with both units, but i'll take it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HS805 headset mike too weak for Treo 650","review":"This headset pairs just fine with the Treo 650, and I didn't notice a lot of static (though there is a little bit). The main reason I'm going to have to return the item is that the microphone volume is too weak, and there's no way to adjust it. Bummer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this headset","review":"This headset is very convenient and comfortable. I really like the fact that it uses AAA batteries, so I don't have to mess with another charger. It's so comfortable on my ear that I sometimes forget it's there. I wear glasses and some headsets interfere with them, but this one does not. It's range is much greater than I expected. I can easily go 20-30 feet away from the phone through walls and still keep a very clear signal.One reviewer mentioned the battery cover breaking, and it does look flimsy, so I have been very careful with it. Otherwise I am very pleased with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good price - poor execution","review":"Let me first say, that I have always been a fan of motorola products.

Mr. Smith ended this by stating Gace was sentenced to life imprisonment. Any true crime student knows Gacy was sentenced death by lethal injection. He described mass murderer Richard Speck as \\"handsome\\". I venture to say the relatives of Speck's victims would find the pock-faced sadist as anything but handsome.

It may have some usefulness for the normal gun owner as well. The detail and comments provided show this book was written by someone with an extreme amount of knowledge and experience in the subject. Unfortunately the author realizes this and wrote this book to reflect it. His egotistical lectures of exactly what the reader should do go beyond what I expected to gain from this book. Then there are the contradictions that lead me to not believe in the author's knowledge as much as I did when I started.If you want a very technical guide on how to become a professional gunsmith, this is the book for you. If you want a Do-It-Yourself Gun Repair Manual (Gunsmithing at Home) look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average but useable","review":"The format is good and the style of layout and illustrations are user friendly but the author sometimes assumes advanced tools and knowledge in what should be an introductory text.Much gun repair can be done with a combination of hand and small electrical tools, very slowly it is true, but with less chance of catastrophic failure. The examples are a narrow and limited in range compared to the clssic texts which are more generic about fixing problems rather than particular models of fire arms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pie","review":"Who doesn't love pie?

It's one of the best maxi-singles Madonna ever released. The first version of \\"Justify My Love\\" is just the regular version from the Immaculate Collection, but it is followed by two great extended remixes. Then you get an incredible nine and a half minute remix of \\"Express Yourself\\". The last track is an intriguing remix of \\"Justify My Love\\" with completely different lyrics. I believe the lyrics Madonna is reciting in this version are taken from the Bible, but I can't confirm that. Here is the track listing:1. Justify My Love (Q-sound Mix)2.

To top it off, when I finally received the item, it was not strapless like they said it would be. Paying 85.00 for a swimsuit is bad enough, but to get this kind of service for it is ridiculous.

The side by side design encourages everything from racing to just plain tandem sliding. It is a little weird to have the hose running under the end 'pool' area, but that has not yet caused any problems. I reccommend this to anyone who has more than one child who would want to play. One comment: we have a well with lower water pressure than our city system counterparts. The area we have to set up this toy is a good 50ft from our faucet; this results in a declining spray from the hose connection point to the end of the slide. It does not prevent the fun, but the kids did notice that the \\"front\\" of the slide didn't have as high of a water spray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but small","review":"I bought this item for my son's 5th birthday party we celebrated outdoors.

So we bought a quality 20' tarp, didn't fill up the end barricade thing of the slip and slide, and extended the sliding length of the \\"ride\\" by three fold. The water on the tarp was the best part of the ride. It only lasted for about 3 hours and then the slip and slide tore down the center. We also had the wave runners which were not popular - sliding on knees was most popular.

Unlike, say, the Diamond Rio MP3 players, the MP2100 is not compatible with, and doesn't ship with, a parallel-port sharing connector, which means you have to disconnect your printer to use the MP2100. Do you really want to choose between using your printer and using your MP2100?2. The setup program is not compatible with Windows 2000, and the company that makes the MP2100 doesn't even have any plans to release a Windows 2000 setup program. That means if your PC uses Windows 2000--soon to be standard at almost any large or medium-sized American business--you're going to be SOL with your MP2100.Both of these problems indicate a fatal lack of customer focus by Sensory Science Corporation, the MP2100's manufacturer.

What it lacks is connectivity. You cannot use it with Windows NT. You can use it only with Windows 95/98 (probably works with MS Bob too). It uses the parallel port (disconnect your printer here comes the MP3 player)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"Amazon recently sent me a raveMP player... It was defective, so I returned it. The next MP player didn't even have a mp3 player in the box when I got it... The customer service at Rave (Sensory Science) was terrible, plus it was long distance and they put me on hold, which made me none too happy. I'd recommned to someone willing to spend this kind of money, something with higher quality like the Rio player or the RCA player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good thing I got if free (buy a minidisc recorder)","review":"I received this free from e-music. Mine did everything it said it would...not very impressive. They are essentially mini hard drives. It requires connection to a parallel port? Doesn't work with Windows 2000 or NT? This company is not thinking of what the customer wants, but rather what they can deliver at the cheapest price. I have a portable minidisc recorder which makes much more sense for recording. All the minidisc folks have to do is figure out how to interface it with the USB port so that you can download songs rather than record them. (it takes 74 minutes to record 74 minutes of MP3's rather than 20 seconds per song)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money","review":"Because of the editoral reviews of this product, I thought that this MP3 plaayer would be easy to use. Not so, at least for me. As it turned out, no one in my family could get this thing to work at all. It got so bad that we gave the thing to a friend who got me into MP3's in the first place and who knows a ton about computers and electronic gadgets, and he couldn't get it to work either. Bottom line at least for me is that this thing is a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Customer Service","review":"I can't say whether this is a good product or not...I can't get it to work. Turns out its software won't work on Windows NT. They don't talk much about this up front; they only bury it in the fine print. While this might not matter to Win 95/98 users, the real concern here is customer service. When I contacted their CS, they first promised me NT compatability by \\"the end of November.\\" No deal. Now they make no promises whatsoever, and don't seem to care if or when they ever will have NT software. Messages from their CS dept. come back terse, uninformative and not remotely helpful. And worst of all, in this day and age, there seems to be no activity on their website...no updates, no refreshments... just static. This company is not ready for prime time."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"The only thing I have to say about this product is don't get it! I received for free from a promotion and that is all the money you should spend on it. The sound quality is awful. All you hear is static.

I also cleaned the contacts with a pencil erase and then with contact cleaner-with no improvement. I purchased another LG OEM battery from the Verizon store in town (which actually is 1100mAh not 1000mAh as AccessoryOne sells) and it worked perfectly-so I have to draw a conclussion that AccessoryOne sold me a bad battery-also the battery has a mfg. date of 2006, so it's been sitting around for over a year in the package before I purchased it or they were defective batteries. i'd be cautious about buying another battery from AccessoryOne-especially if the battery price is too low to believe (under $10.00)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Performance- You Get What You Pay For!","review":"Batteries wouldn't hold a charge for more than an hour!

Algebra had always been like a foreign language to me, and due to the fact that it has been 10 years since I took high school Algebra, I figured I'd better do some quick brushing-up. This book makes Algebra so accessible...so do-able even. It's divided into 51 practice lessons (the answers are in the back), starting with the basics and gradually moving up in complication. The author clearly breaks the problems down and explains how to work them. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because although I realize mistakes happen in publishing, I found it pretty inexcusable for a book of this sort to have incorrect symbols in the few places where typos did exist.

It starts off reasonably promising - when the Doctor and Ace arrive in a Nazi-controlled Britain of 1951, it's a reasonably familiar Star-Trek-adventure-story what-if scenario. But as they go back to genuine, 1930s Nazi Germany, the grim reality shows the story for what it really is: trite, undermining pap. Terrance Dicks seems to take an almost perverse glee in the details, far too glib to respect what actually, horrifically occurred. It doesn't help that the Doctor's characterization, more stuffy Pertwee than scheming McCoy, is insufferably arrogant; you almost want Himmler to shoot the miserable sod. All this, with the Timewyrm arc poorly integrated into the plot, go a long way toward skuppering Dicks' authorial reputation.

These are the candles you want as a centerpiece of a small table. When lit, the hues are like any other candle. When lit, the room brightens exquisitely. When lit, what needs dimming is dimmed, but what needs lighting is alit. The scent will enrapture your senses while calming the air. Mostly, this candle set is not for lighting. You will not depend on this when a storm has extinguished your lamps. These are decorative, and through the long burning life, they will also be beautiful unlit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Namaste","review":"I bought the set as a gift for a friend who is into yoga and meditation.

I have to say I am very disappointed with this item. It is much smaller than I had anticipated, and the scent(s) of the candles is not very pleasant. The look of the item is nice, just like the picture. This would be okay for a bathroom or a small room, but not for the place I had planned to use it. You may want to go to Target and view and smell the item before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I bought these candles in the store. When I got home, I set everything up and lit the candles. In less that 30 minutes, all 5 candles had burned to half way, and the strings the medals are on had caught on fire too. The entire thing was on fire (a big fire). I was able to blow it out, and take it outside to the trash can. I have bought Target candles before, and love them. I am not happy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Purchase!!!","review":"Do not buy this product with the intention of burning these candles.

What I got wasn't nearly as nice. The plate was not cermamic as stated in the listing. It is actually a very cheap looking metal one and looks nothing like the one is the photo. The candles don't have that nice marbled look to them. They are flat colors and the colors don't exactly match the one's in the photo. It didn't come with nearly that many rocks so it ended up looking very bare. Overall I could have made a better version of this product for less than what I paid. I was very disapointed by what I got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what expected but kinda ok","review":"I received this set as a gift from my wish list.

The set that I pulled out of the box did not match the picture on the front of the box. On the box, the set looks like the candles have a marbled texture-however, the candles that I recieved were solid colored (not marbled) and looked very cheap. Word to the wise: if you want the set to stay looking decent, don't burn them. We only had the candles lighted for 20 minutes and they already started to lose shape. Wax spilled into plate-and now we have plate full of dilapidated candles- and stones stuck in dried wax. I am very disappointed with this purchase-and will no longer buy any product from this brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to love this!","review":"I bought this at a store, and thought it was such a great deal. And it was, until I lit the candles. The candles are made of such crappy wax, that they dissolved within the first hour or so of burning.

More for decoration and with that being the case, these candles are too expensive for what your getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A chilling, effective horror","review":"A worthwhile horror/thriller that is more complex than just a killer knocking off victims for some reason. The story is more about psychological torture than cold-blooded murder, and the victims are not just innocent lambs being led to the slaughter. The killers have a method to their madness and seem chillingly convinced of their righteousness. There was enough gore to keep me happy, but the best thing is that it wasn't over done.

You Mo fans will love the interviews with his wife Yvonne, as she explains Mo's successful battle with drinking, and how much they mean to each other, including clips from the renewal of their marriage vows. The section about Andy was also wonderful. The last section on their induction into the R & R Hall of Fame and receiving the British life time achievement award, had me grinning!

I have also had a hard time finding rechargeable AAA's compared to AA's. And while it sounds trivial, it is NOT minor that AAA batteries disappear much more easily that AA batteries at almost 3x the size. I bought 4 rechargeables shortly after getting this.

Quite possibly the best use of color I've seen come from the Gameboy Color, this game continues to excite and will keep both vets and newbies to the Metal Gear series glued to their screens until the closing credits!

Code sampleis an important part in such a topic+explaination+sample typebook. Anyway besides the code, what else is their owncontribution?I would recommend Fowler's UML Distilled to learn UML and GoF book for Design Pattern. There is not much special about implementing them in VB, especially in VB.net.A request to the author: please do not write a new editionin VB.net.

I picked up this book because I hoped to learn more about design patterns and how they relate to Visual Basic. Most of the books, so far, have been based on the C/C++ world. The first section on UML covers the basic aspects with only simple detail. The design patterns take up the rest of the book, but the same minimalist approach is used. The code samples in the book are only partial and don't really give you a good idea of how or when to use this type of pattern. The text is clear, and if you only need an overview; if you have been chosen by your project manager to give a presentation to 25 people on design patterns and Visual Basic and it will only last two hours, this book is the one to buy. If you actually want to use patterns, choose Microsoft's Visual Basic Design Pattersn by William Stamatakis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would Give Negative Stars If Possible!!!","review":"This CD is a total rip-off - real flea-market trash.These are not the original recordings and, most likely, not the original artists.I guess I should have been tipped off by the low price but I thought that no one made phony CDs like this anymore.Put me down as a sucker and don't make the same mistake I did!Save your money and time and avoid buying this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the original recordings","review":"I received this as a gift from someone who knows I like doo-wop.

That is, perhaps the Nart traditions were derived from the Arthurian stories, which were popular all over Europe, rather than the Arthurian stories having derived from the Nart cycles.

It is different from other platformers in a few noticable ways. The biggest difference is that Lara is bigger than other platformers like Mario and Rayman. This is a welcome change to the eyes. There are multiple different ways to run and roll and jump and grab and so on, but the controls are simpler than other Tomb Raider games. It is easier to see what can be held or grabbed than what can't be. And the only really easy way to die is to fall on spikes. Anyways this is a good game to buy with an easy format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Close to Flat","review":"The Norton stone is not even close to flat. Prepare yourself for hours of trying to flatten this crooked stone. Purchase many sheets of coarse wet dry sandpaper because you will need them. Once they are flat, they do a decent job, but then you have to flatten them repeatedly between steps to get a truly sharp blade. I spend more time flattening than sharpening with this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent all-around stone","review":"The 1000-grit side cuts quickly. The 8000-side polishes beautifully.You don't need the stone to be dead flat. Search for \\"Paul Sellers sharpening\\" and you'll find a few videos that discuss convex-bevel sharpening, which is easy, quick, and works really well.Make sure to soak the stone in water for a few minutes before sharpening. This will get you the good kind of slurry. Just spritzing will not give as good results.The plastic holder/box is a nice touch, but I wouldn't use it as the actual holder while sharpening. Put the wet stone on a towel and it won't slide or create a mess, either.I use the 1000 and 8000 sides for everyday honing of woodworking tools, and the 8000 side for my straight razor every now and then. Works perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sauce master does not meet claims","review":"The sauce master makes good tomato juice but not tomato puree. At least 1/4\\" of pulp is lost with the skin-way too much to waste. Went back to just canning diced and whole tomatoes the old fashioned way. Also tried the grape spiral. Too many solids and too cloudy and the spiral clogged up with skin/seeds and it did not come out the end-just sat in the spiral so became hard to turn as it compacted. Would have to add another step and strain with cheescloth to get clear juice. Going back to hot water method of making grape juice where I get perfectly clear grape juice with little effort. The pumpkin screen also takes too much pulp with the skin. Not into wasting food. Can get just as smooth pumpkin puree with a hand mixer and no waste.

The outlet shoot for the puree is only about 2-3\\" above the table and the outlet shoot for the seed and skin is at about the same hieght and right next to the outlet shoot. Only cereal sized bowls can be used with this machine which does not allow for continuous operation on more then 5-10 tomatoes.

The applesauce has small chunks in it and the machine is very efficient. No need to do anything other than stem apples and cook. This separates out all the bad stuff and keeps the good. I used a spray olive oil on the metal parts and put them in a big plastic bag before storage and had NO rusting.The only improvement I would make is to make the chute sit a bit higher so you could use a taller bowl to collect the applesauce. But that is being picky; this is great!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best way to make chile","review":"I don't make tomato juice or applesauce with the Saucemaster, I make New Mexico style red chile sauce from chile pods and this is the greatest tool for extracting the puree I've found.The traditional method is to boil your seeded pods and then mix them in the blender with water. Then you strain out the puree. Doing it this way pulverizes the skin as well as the pulp and can make for a bitter sauce.With the Saucemaster the pulp is stripped from the skin. The puree runs down the shoot and the skin comes out the end of the strainer. The secret is to add water to the skin and re-heat it and run it through a second time. You can extract about as much more puree as the first pass. You end up with a bowl full of perfectly textured chile puree and a pile of skins that can be discarded.Add a little salt, garlic, cumin and chicken broth along with a roux of oil and flour and you have some of the most delicious red chile sauce you'll find anywhere, including Santa Fe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusts","review":"Except for the main body (which is aluminum), the screen and other parts are made of plain old steel... they rust like mad even while washing.States in instructions you need to spray whole thing with oil after every use.Also, very hard to crank and plastic pieces are very flimsy.I returned mine since I don't want to give my friends and family the gift of tetanus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Assessment in Speech-Language Pathology","review":"This textbook is full of lots of information however it's a good idea to look at the table of contents to find exactly the area you are looking for.

It won out over Adobe's product only because it became available first and I had a mighty need to organize my photos and work flow. My frustrations with the initial release of the Aperture 1.x series was non-intuitive menu items, viewing problems and sluggishness when downloading photos much less while running photoshop or some other memory hog. Aperture 2.0 is a pleasant surprise by a company that seems to listen to their customers. The menu items are much easier to understand and use and the performance on my Macbook Pro is not perfect but much much faster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and Efficient","review":"This lets me review and rate RAW files SOOOO much better and faster than Photoshop or the editing tool that came with my Canon. I am very surprised how quickly I can scan through the images in the preview mode. The shortcut keys are definitely worth learning and the Loupe tool is great for checking focus quickly. Overall a great product. Wish it cost less, of course, but it is actually worth what I paid.Happy Shooting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aperture","review":"I'm happy with the product. Received it when expected. Aperture is fairly easy to learn, very easy to use once you've learned how to navigate its features, provides a logical and intuitive workflow for photo editing. It provides all the editing features one needs for post-production image refinement, with a few additional bells and whistles.My only disappointment with it is the lack of RAW reading / conversion for my current camera, a Panasonic Lumix G1. I'm hoping that will be remedied soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A-poor-ture","review":"I originally bough this product for the web-publish feature in Aperture, but to my disappointment this feature is terrible slow if you have large files it could take hours to publish them to the web and It distorts your image size.

It uploads double images of any photos taken vertically with the new duplicate image turned horizontally and I can't figure out how to delete the duplicate photos without going through and deleting each photo individually. I was just looking through the other peoples reviews and am pretty sure many of the glowing reviews are being made by people that are selling the product and/or own stock in Apple, which is understandable. If you hit the help button on Aperture it uploads a pdf of the instruction booklet which again is vague. I also don't like that the program dredges up old photos from over a year ago that I thought I had deleted when it links itself with the iphoto library which takes a while for the computer to be able to update."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, stalls out, not PhotoShop","review":"After a long time using Photo Shop on my MacBook Pro, I was persuaded to buy and try Aperture 2. After a week of using this product, I have encountered numerous problems, including: It stalls out for no apparent reason when cloning; It is incredibly slow.

Decided it was time to go cold turkey. Adobe is now in my rear view mirror and I am speeding away. I use Aperture for photo editing (no special layering effects or special effects - just organizing and touching up photos). The functions are exceedingly easy to understand and use. It also does a terrific job of organizing my photo library (I love the batch edit and smart folders). Grouping into projects is logical and useful. Integrating distinct color profiling into web pages and printing is slick and easy. Software is very speedy and responsive and my projects average about 1,000 images each (and it feels like much larger projects would be just as easy to manage). I'm using this on a 27'iMac with the i7 intel processor.Goodbye and good riddance to Adobe !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly Pleased with Aperture 2","review":"I am an amateur at best and I took advantage of both free trial offers from Aperture 2 and LightRoom. Although LightRoom was similar, to me there was no comparison. I went into it with no experience and was totally objective in my opinion and found Aperture to be much much better.

It set on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unintuitive and slow","review":"When I can make Aperture work, it does nice things with photos.

There was no warning of a problem, it just crashed and has never worked since then. I have reinstalled it several times but with no luck. Where are all my photos? Who knows. Apple is totally unresponsive to my queries. When it crashes it gives a series of error messages in the report to Apple that it automatically sends. Each time the report is a little different. So the problem appears to be a moving target. I would now rate it as one-star, but a tiny voice in my head still holds out for a fix. FYI, besides the main photo file, I have it backed up to 2 vaults on 2 different hard drives.

The word \\"workbook\\" led me to believe that there would be examples, exercises and forms to work from. Instead, the entire book is broken down into tiny sections that only DESCRIBE how or why a particular analysis or technique should be performed.Some of the information is purely common sense, and yet you are forced to read through a dry, overanalyzed, high-level description of it. For example, under the Project Documentation section, an explanation reads: \\"Communication. With the documentation, all those who were involved with the project can be informed about the development of the project from beginning to end.\\" (Do you really need a book to tell you this?)Some good suggestions and a few good examples do exist, but you must wade through time-wasting, frustrating, non-informative text before getting to them.I think this book was nothing more than an ego booster and moneymaking scheme for a few E&Y consultants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buisness process improvment work book","review":"Provide an excellent overview of BPM and provide good examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor construction","review":"This pointer was great at first.

It is horribly muffled - I can't believe the final master wasn't checked before mass production, as it is most certainly an error. Madonna would be embarrassed if she knew how horrible this sounded, and Warner should be ashamed. I see Amazon has this listed as a UK release - I bought the German release, but it appears BOTH versions are defective and pretty much worthless.

They required two separate washings just to remove the excessive dye as well as control the pieces of towel nap that flicked off and onto your body and floor before initial use.Now my large towels are more threadbare since the repeated washings but at least are releasing as much lint, making them somewhat useable. But the thickness is gone.I'll never but this brand of towels again.

I bought these towels for use at home and gifts for family. To my complete surprise and utter disappointment by my family on the very poor quality of the towels. I am extremely embarrassed. Yesterday I decided to use one of the towels the towel did a poor job of drying my skin and added to that the material was coming off all over my skin, I had to shower again and use a different towel.

I called Martex customer service and tell them my thought. They said they need the towel to investigate. They will send me the replacement only if I pay the shipping and send the towel back.

It's a long read, but is broken down by food categories which makes it useful as a reference guide. Marion Nestle's advice has been invaluable as I've started a journey toward eating more real food and less processed food. It covers things like food labeling and how the US government is involved in our food processes, how supermarkets place foods throughout the store, and how to end up with the best quality foods in your shopping cart. Every chapter ends with Nestle's personal \\"here's what I would do\\" advice. I went organic in December 2009 partly because of the information contained in this book. The next step in my journey is to start eating more locally produced foods, and this book will help me as I go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"At 624 pages, What to Eat certainly looks appealing and authoritative. However, while Nestle's book does contain some good information, it doesn't live up to it's bold title. I was expecting more of a treatise on healthful foods, mixed with an equal part of what foods to avoid. Instead, Nestle focuses entirely on what to avoid, brushing off, for example, vegetables with a single, scant chapter. Now, I could see the value even in this approach, but the organization of the book (a meandering collection of chapters that do not flow coherently) and Nestle's odd tone of not giving a very clear opinion of what to avoid or not to avoid, mars the book's practical value significantly. A better book that fulfills her objective more thoroughly is Andrew Weil's Eating Better for Optimum Health, which covers almost entirely the same topics, while being thoughtfully organized and much more informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"This will inspire you to live the lifestyle and check out food labels","review":"I read this book months ago and am still telling everyone I know to read it. Having lived this lifestyle already, not buying meat from the store and growing our own organic vegetables, using only products that do not contain harmful chemicals...I highly recommend this book, especially for people who are uncertain about what to choose when shopping and what companies care about the health of the consumer and which don't.

The old closet rod and one shelf plus a beat up dresser worked okay when they were infants. Now they need to be able to choose their own clothes and be able to reach them. We also have a 5 foot closet with sliding doors - so we needed something that had a low hanging bar and a shelf that kids could reach along with shelves for storage on the top. We mounted the large hanging bar about two feet from the bottom and the 5' continuous shelf on the top. In the middle of the closet was the 10\\" gap between the shelving units. We bought some bins and a hanging organizer for their shoes. We have been able to store 2/3 more stuff in our closet than before and iit looks much nicer. We can also move the hanging bar up higher as the kids grow as well as adding pants racks - when their pants do not fit in bins any longer. We are planning on using this system in our HUGE walk in closet in the master bedroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like Elfa, but a WAY better value","review":"I have installed three of these now.These are actually VERY sturdy and the look is very clean and polished. Honestly, I think that you could use these in any closet. For example, for a kids / teenager closet I believe these look great and work in a high end custom house.Installation is very straightforward. You will want to have/get a magnetic stud finder and have a leveler (with the bubble in with water), a drill, and an electric screwdriver for installation. Installation will probably take you from 30 min - 1.5 hours (if you have not installed something like this and you are a perfectionist like me). Basically you are just finding studs, drawing a level line with a pencil, screwing a toop rail into the studs (this will be covered by a smooth cover that looks good), and then hanging everything from the top and using drywall anchors to anchor the side rails in place). Basically, its just like Elfa.But the price is WAY better.

Quality materials and clear instructions for install. As one who doesn't do much DIY stuff around the house, it is still a bit of a challenge. The second kit I bought went in much easier by virtue of having a bit of experience. The kit allows for a bunch of options of how you want to organize your closet. The nice thing is you can always go back and redo it if your needs or moods change. The price here goes up and down so put it in your cart and wait for it to go down to get the best deal.

I have to admit I did not install them, as my brain doesn't work well on putting things together. I had a friend install them for me. He didn't have any problems with them. They make my horrible little closets look so much better and I have room for other items besides clothing.

One closet has all shelves, one has just the standard shelf across the top with the hanging bar, and the other has a mix of all shelves on one wall and all hanging bars on the other side.

I'm a 52 year old woman who is handy with tools but I would recommend this set up for a beginner. Just read the instructions gather the tools you need and go for it. I planned my configuration and did repairs, painted walls and then installed the organizer. It took only 6 hrs for the install. repairs and paint done the day before.

Awsome for Playroom Closet!","review":"I love this product. This was the second one I installed and absolutely love it. I have the built in stuff in all of my other closets and truely wish I could afford to rip the built-in closet out and use the rubbermaid instead. I have two little ones under the age of three and organizing toys was a little challenge before I put this in. It'll be perfect also when I need to convert it back to a bedroom closet instead of a playroom closet. The first one was for a hall closet that used to be totally useless. My daughter makes comments everytime I see her taking stuff out of the closet how much she loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"still love it.","review":"I have used these in five closets in the past. I no longer live in that home and I miss my organizers. I wish I'd stripped them out of the closets when I sold the home (owners probably would've been mad).

I love the way my closet looks now!","review":"My closet looks wonderful and it was easy to put together.

The other one was cut and is somewhat locked into the current configuration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly easy to install!","review":"This is a versatile product. My husband and I installed it in under an hour and I have changed the configuration several times. It has tripled if not quadrupled the amount of storage space in my closet.

I was debating getting a nice wood one from Lowes but after seeing how this turned out and the price savings I would do this again. I like how it can be customized in so many ways. I did try to add a homefree series wood shelf system but the metal brakets in the back were too short to fit the rails. it looks good and it seems pretty sturdy.

I will be buying more for the rest of the house...and probably a few for the basement too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding value","review":"I updated two 7 foot closets this weekend using two of these kits. I'm very pleased with the ease of assembly and quality of the final product. I suggest you have all the tools on hand and take those measurements twice or even thrice. A cheap little stud finder is handy if you are like me and can't do the \\"tap, tap, tap\\" method. I'd say the most important part of the construction is getting the hanging rail firmly attached and level. If the hanging rail steps are done correctly the rest of the assembly is super easy and the whole system will be very sturdy.We're actually thinking of upgrading all our closets with these systems. We've already seen the usefulness of being able to share parts between two of these systems to customize one closet with more shelves and the other one with more hanging rods. A whole house full of these systems would give you tremendous storage configuration power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Closet System","review":"We have now converted 3 Closetmaid closets to the Rubbermaid system.

I bought three of these and redid 4 very large closets and still have lots of spare parts. I disagree with other reviews regarding the wall anchors; I thought they worked just fine.

I like the way she address each of the different points of view used in writing novels. She explains each Point of View and then shows excerpts from novels to demonstrates how they are done. I like the Tips she adds through out the chapters. The appendices are historical overviews dwelling on different types of fiction and are made interesting.As a complete book on the subject of Point of View, rather than the short chapters one reads in other self help for writer's books, it is very well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author means well, means well, means well...","review":"but is so busy endlessly repeating the few nuggets of information she has to offer that she never gets to the interesting parts. As a basic primer the book works, but all the worthwhile information could have been rendered in fifteen pages. The most frustrating part is that she doesn't seem all that well read, so instead of being able to show you how different authors make different POVs work, she repeatedly draws her examples from the same handful of books (including Ulysses--as if aspiring writers are going there). The result is a superficial treatment of something that could have been fascinating. Sorry to be so negative, Sherri, but I was excited when I saw the title and my disappointment is acute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writers beware","review":"This guide is so repetitive it reads as if she's been commissioned to write the book and is being paid by the word, caring little about boring the reader.

It instructs you to get up at 3 am and light two candles. Then stare at one of the symbols and use a spell which invokes the power of this name for whatever purpose the symbol represents. It then goes on to say that if you do hear anything or experience anything strange to just ignore it. Personally, I think this is a terrible practice. Even if you could work a spell with this little but of practice and lack of training, if something manifests itself then this is obviously some type of evocation magic. Evocation can be extremely dangerous if done by someone not trained in banishing techniques. All in all this is not a good book and promotes dangerous practices just to make a quick buck.

The Necronomicon is a mockery of Magick at it's best and a worthless heap of partiallly digested tree fiber at worst. I would not recommend the Necronomicon for a student of magick or any books based on it. The Necronomicon is NOT the Sumerian religion. Although the writer of this (H.P. Lovecraft) was a deviously clever, superiorly ingenious and quite possibly the best horror/fantasy/sci-fi writer of the 19th and 20th centuries he was no Magickian and his knowledge of such magickal systems were extremely limited.

It is defnitely very Goetic in nature, but whereas the Goetia cause actual entities to present themselves before you, the seals of Marduk are more like unnerving forces coming from under the earth.

How do these things happen? Well, you pray - for that's what is, you're not reciting spells, you're praying - to ancient Sumerian gods.

Contrary to the author claim, NT DNS can be easily configured with the GUI NT DNS adminstrator and it works well with UNIX BIND DNS. In fact, Microsoft's white paper on NT DNS provides correct and concise info on configuring and using NT DNS, and it is free for downloading on Microsoft's web site. I recommend that users of NT DNS read Microsoft's free white paper for DNS configuration. Another point is that the new edition added a lot of pages to the earlier edition, but not much more info (added a lot of personal stories, jokes, etc.). The new edition is a typical example for making a useful book less useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong!","review":"Why would you publish a book when the details are all wrong?

Maybe it's because of the way he writes, the fresh new look and the way of thinking he has on the subject. I am getting very, very irritated from all the fluffy commercialized books I keep seeing and the tacky stuff people do like teen spell kits, velour covered love spell books and whatever else they can think of to take advantage of the fact that Wicca/Paganism is a fast growing path. Anyway, enough of that. Sorry but I had to say it but to let you know his book is not like that at all.

Simplistic, pollyannish, improbably \\"let's put everything occult we've heard of together and shake\\" completist, unsubstantiated and so on.The central concept is: if you do every illogical thing the writer matter-of-factly states, you'll be magical.

From the few pages I did go through before giving up in disgust -- and with a headache -- I can only say that rarely have I read someone so ignorant of culture, so poor in intellect, and having so much pretensions to a high brow culture.

I cannot believe Norton would let this thing go to market - it is far, far, far too soft to be the least bit effective.

When I went back into Home Depot, they were not stocking it.I've had other similarly sized feeders but I especially like this design.Other feeders you fill from the top, but in this feeder the internal plastic cylinder drops out.I like the fact that the cylinder is removable. Additionally, since the cylinder has feet that mount into the cage, I can easily hang other feeders (small thistle feeder) off this feeder's plastic feet. No feeder is squirrel proof, even if they say they are. This feeder isn't bad, but I have caught the squirrels hanging upside down to eat out of the feeder.

This feeder had lasted me for 5 years and probably could have gone another 10 at least if Mr. Bear hadn't gotten to it. He broke the inside tube so now I need to replace it. This is a great cost to as I paid more for my first one. As with other review's it is not squirrel proof so that is why the 4 star instead of 5 star I had planned on giving it - the squirrels hang on it and reach in for the seed.

There is very little room for tactical play and basically it is a meatgrinder of dice throwing.

In those days Club DJs were just using samples of vocals with synthesizer to make a club dance music which sounds like Eurodance and there's goes Madonna's early performance as back-up vocal before she had a first single 'Everybody' plus other hits like Burning Up, Lucky Star,Physical Attraction and Holiday which gets her to be what she is now as the queen of pop music.Anyway get these cd only if you're a fan or collectors.Plus check out other rare collection if you can:1)Wild Dancing (quite rare,featured 4 songs samplers/picture disc of her pony-tail-vogue performance in 1991)2)Ultra Rare Tracks Vol.1 & 2 (Only DJs promo,feature covers of her \\"Like A Virgin\\" tour and \\"Who's that Girl\\" tour)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out!","review":"Madonna's voice is nowhere to be found on this cd. I'm not exactly sure who or what it is. I don't know why her picture is on it, or what involvement she even has with it. It's a collection of some rather odd dance, or so I think, songs. But, be warned, this is not Madonna singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I was hoping for","review":"Despite the picture on the package, these are not cartoons from the HBO series. They are good cartoons, but if you have any of the old Lulu cartoons, you probably already have these: Chick and Double Chick; Bargain Counterattack; A Bout With a Trout; Loose in a Caboose; Bored of Education; A Scout with the Gout; Musical Lulu and The Dog Show Off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grade A","review":"Great product super strong fairly easy 2 install, mounted straight and has a solid finish that should last years... great price and great quality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True Love, Baby!","review":"It's FABULOUS! The True Blue mix is not much of a mix, so don't worry about it being totally different from the original. The same applies to the other tracks as well. Live to Tell is AWESOME in its instrumental form! This Cd would be 5 stars, if they would've subtracted one of the \\"Everybody\\" tracks and added \\"Who's that Girl\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for collectors","review":"This is a good EP for those who like the songs True Blue, Papa, and Everybody,,,worth getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mix Up Mess","review":"Unfortunately I did not receive First Check, which is what I ordered. Instead I received Quickscreen at Home Drug Test which was not user friendly. We used it anyway to test our daughter because we could not wait to reorder the correct ones. The results did not come up as the instructions indicated they would. In other words, as far as I am concerned it was completely worthless and I would like my money back. We have been very happy with the First Check tests and I am now waiting to hear back from Amazon to see if we will be reimbursed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Risk Game Ever!","review":"I purchased this board game almost a year ago today and my friends and I still find hours of enjoyment from playing this wonderful spin-off of the classic RISK game. The setting is ancient earth with cultures from different mythos squaring off in battle not just for the control of the world but also for the underworld as well! That's right...even if your armies are wiped out you can still win as the battle for the underwold adds an extra dimension to the game which keeps you and your enemies on their toes as you wage war with the Gods of WAR, SKY, DEATH, and MAGIC.The makers of this game took their time with the mechanics and it shows. The design and layout were beautifully designed. The game can be modded for quicker play as well if you don't want the game to last 5 hours! We actually enjoy the time spent on it and welcome the long hours and good times shared while we form alliances and scheme our plans for word domination!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Risk Game","review":"Love It - Can't Wait To Play Again! This was a gift for my brother this past Christmas. We have enjoyed the game. We use to play Lord of the Rings version, but I don't think we will ever skip over the Godstorm to play the LOTR version anytime soon. (I guess it goes to the closet for dust collection.) We don't use the Epoch part of it, instead we play until no one has any armies left. It takes longer, but we enjoy dominating the board. If you are a Risk fan or you know someone that is - this game is worth the money. I wish they had an electronic version so that I could play against the computer and polish my skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the true die-hard Risk fan","review":"All the boys in my family will play Risk for hours on end - this one was contagious. The neighborhood crew was at my house day after day. This is a great next step for the die-hard Risk player"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Game","review":"Risk Godstorm is a very good variation of Risk, though personally,my favorite is still Lord of the Rings Risk. The game play is remeniscent of Risk 2210 AD, but somewhat less hectic. Miracle cards become a huge factor in gameplay and have a surprising affect on the outcome of the game. Something I found enjoyable was that the game, if you so choose, lasts only five epochs (turns) and the reinforcement rule is slightly different than standard. It is most definitely an enjoyable variation and, while not my favorite, is near the top of my list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice jar","review":"bought this to add to the creation of a candy station at my daughter's wedding.

They do look good, and \\"seemed\\" like they would be great. However, anything stored in them IS SUBJECT to getting GLASS CHIPS in it with use. DO NOT STORE FOOD IN THESE!I used these for cereals, rice, etc. Any little bump and the rims will chip glass into your food! You may not notice this until too late!This happened unnoticed and I made rice one day (stored in one of these) and my family found glass chips in their rice!It's just not worth it! I've used other ones that actually have a little rubber seal on the rim (These do not) and liked them until I saw another chip...Now I'm using 100% stainless steel containers, with the stainless steel lids (with rubber seals) that have glass tops (like some cookware has) and never have to worry about my family's safety again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for making sauerkraut","review":"I have used this crock several times for making homemade sauerkraut.

And other dry goods.","review":"I'm so glad that I found these jars here in Amazon. I first saw them at the Bed bath & beyond website selling for $10 and I've been wanting to get them but just had no time to go to their store. I bake a lot so I prefer having the flour out in the countertop. These jars can hold a 5-lb bag of flour and I keep them right in front of my rolling space so I won't need to move the jars around as they're heavy when full. The lid doesn't seal so it's not advisable to store sugar, as well as anything that goes stale really quick, in them. I do use one for cookies but my husband devours them really fast and the cookies don't even have a chance to get stale.All in all, I highly recommend this product. They're made in the USA and I support Anchor Hocking for that. I hope they keep making quality products for years to come.**TIP: This jar sells for under 7 bucks at Walmart and Target. The 2-gallon jar is available there too for 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"chipped glass in rims","review":"Nice looking canisters but 2 out of the 3 purchased canisters (bought directly from Target) had chips in the glass, on the outside edge of rim and inside edge where cardboard packaging insert is under lid. These are not noticeable until you've removed the packaging. So much for trying to buy American made products."},{"rating":"1","title":"No seal on the lid?","review":"I was going to buy this jar, until I found it in store at the Container Store, and discovered it doesn't have a seal around the lid. My hopes for the perfect flour jar were destroyed! I love this jar, and Anchor makes great quality glass canisters and bakeware, however without a seal around the lid the jar is useless for storing any kind of food item. Anchor needs to seriously consider offering either various sizes of seals for their jars that don't come with them already, or just start making this line with seals. I contacted them about this, and unfortunately they had no suggestions for me. Very disappointing. Keep this in mind when deciding to purchase this line from Anchor. The Hocking line does not come with seals!! :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Great see-through cookie jar","review":"This is the perfect cookie jar. It is big enough to hold an entire package of cookies plus some and you can see through it to tell what's in there. It also will always match the colors in my kitchen since it is clear glass. The 1-gallon size is the perfect size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glass Lids","review":"These lids do not have any kind of seal on them like others you see in the stores, thus it does not create an air-tight seal for storing food in it without getting stale. The glass is low grade quality and chips easily just taking and putting the lid on/off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"These look amazing on the kitchen counter. I think everyone should have these. I put flour and sugar in them for easy access."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great as a Beveridge Napkin Holder","review":"I had been to someone's house about a month ago that had a similar container to this with all of there leftover beveridge napkins from various parties they had. I decided to use this idea for my daughter's birthday party. We were doing a lady bug theme and I had bought black, pink and red napkins for the party so I separated them out and alternated it back and forth and it came out just darling. This was a way to keep them contained for later and also to keep them from blowing away since this was an outdoor party. I also was able to use the lid for the plates because it was windy that day. It was the perfect size to fit in the dinner sized plates that we had."},{"rating":"2","title":"as described","review":"This is a very nice looking jar and will work fine for my planned useage which is to keep soap in the bathroom. However, it would be useless for me in the kitchen as there is no seal on the lid and so it is not air tight.

If the fit were air-tight, I would rate the product 5 out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect addition to my collection","review":"Bought two of these jars to add to my candy bar collection of apothecary jars and containers. I did notice a small chip around the rim of one but with the lid on it's almost unnoticeable and on the outside so no one will get cut or scratched.Great size, good sturdy quality. good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glass Jar","review":"This does not come with a seal at the top so it is no good for flour and sugar or items that need to be kept fresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"I was a little worried about ordering such a large glass item through the mail but it arrived impeccably packaged. The jar is exactly what i wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish Storage.","review":"I had moved from the west coast to the east coast and had nothing for my new kitchen so I went shopping for kitchen essentials when I came across storage containers in a small furniture store that also sold homemade cookies, that where identical to the anchor hocking jars but I didn't know where I could purchase them and the store owner had found them at an antique store so no help there. While buying other essentials online I came across these jars and had to buy more than one. So I'm glad I found them and at a discount on Amazon there are very stylish and sleek. My only problem with them is that the jars are not airtight so anything baked stored in them run the risk of going stale, and the problem with the clipping of the jars is only if you are aggressive with the lid and use non plastic measuring spoons if you use them to store flour or sugar."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute","review":"I made mine into a cute fish bowl. You can fit a small filter in it. It will only hold one beta or two goldfish though."},{"rating":"1","title":"No inner seal","review":"I bought this to use as a sugar canister. The two glass pieces sit together without an inner silicone or rubber ring so there is no seal to insure freshness. Additionally, it rattles around when you pick it up because there is no seal to provide cushioning. The handle is pretty and is larger than some others, but there is no bevel at the base to allow one to hold it securely once lifted. Don't buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a tight lid","review":"I was initially excited to find these jars \\"MADE IN AMERICA\\" as I had previously purchased one at Ikea which had not been from a US company. The price was right and I was planning on using them to store flour, sugar, coffee, etc. I assumed, incorrectly, that the lid would be airtight, as was the one from Ikea. Instead of having a rubberized seal, the jar lid rested glass on glass, and would not have kept anything fresh or bugs out of the jars. I now only use the jars for non-foodstuffs, not my original intention. I was disappointed and will not purchase these again.I did, however, find Anchor Hocking glass jars with screw top lids at Target (made in America) and I use them for my original purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality","review":"We bought this to make our delicious homemade Kombucha. We found it a week later at Target for two thirds the price. It is good quality, attractive, and my scoby is THRIVING. Plus, you can use the glass lid instead of a dish cloth or coffee filter as it protects the scoby but still gives it enough oxygen to live."},{"rating":"1","title":"smaller than I thought","review":"It came on time and was undamaged, but was much smaller than I thought it would be. It has a nice seal on it and was very close to the one my grandma had but it was a gift for my mom.

Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly accessible, vegetarian haute cuisine for everyday","review":"If I knew I was going to be washed ashore a temperate island with a good organic farm, I'd bring this cookbook. The best part about it is Madison's \\"goes well with\\" pairings that teach you which foods taste good with which seasonings. I've finally absorbed enough of the logic to create dishes that guests request the recipe and I can say, \\"it's my own\\" (although I always recommend this book). I finally have found recipes that I can use as a jumping-off point from my own creativity. The recipes are also simple, rarely requiring something not already in my cabinets, but elegant.One caveat: start to cook like this and you'll get very short-tempered at the quality of most restaurants--prepare to eat at home more often!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good but time consuming recipes","review":"I'm a member of a food coop (in Minnesota) and eat vegetarian 3-4 days a week. Having said that I can't really recommend this book. Too many recipes with too many ingredients with too many sauces/salsas that have to be made along with the main part of the recipe in order to make the food palatable, plus too few recipes for everyday use. Maybe if I had all day to cook and lived in California where I'd have easier access to the ingredients I could recommend this book.Although not a vegetarian cookbook, I'd recommend \\"Classic Indian Cooking\\" by Julie Sahni which contains many vegetarian recipes, some simple, some complex, some vegan and some with milk and butter along with meat recipes as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vegetarian Inspiration","review":"A highly recommended book for anyone interested in adding surprise and goodness to their cooking.

One recipe called for some grain to be soaked in water; only after it didn't turn out did I realize that the word \\"hot\\" had been left out. I tried the cobbler recipe twice.

This book gives me little incentive in this respect. Especially a vegetarian cook book should follow the seasons in which vegetables are plentiful and fresh, each recipe should have a picture, and - very important - in this day and age it is ridiculous not to add nutritional information for each recipe. Furthermore, the recipe themselves are boring: especially vegetarian cooking allows the exploration of many new and exciting flavors and asks for the usage of lots of different and unusual spices, none of which are in this book.

Apparently there's one in every crowd. \\"Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone\\" is a compendium of many cooking styles, and everything I've made from it has turned out brilliantly. Delicious, with attention to healthful, seasonal preparation and ingredients. Unless you don't live near a decent market, her ingredients are quite available or easily subsituted. It's laid out simply and intelligently and her comments in the sidebars give the recipes personality. These sometimes quirky comments, combined with my experience of success, give me the feeling that she (unlike some other well-known authors) has actually used/developed the recipes in the book.

I could wish, however, that Ms. Madison's recipes were a little better organized--Julia Child's recipes are (to me) the gold standard for completeness and organization, and \\"Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone\\" doesn't quite meet that test. It is also true that Ms. Madison uses ingredients not universally available, that she does not refrain from the use of butter and cream (a health, not a philosophical issue for me), and that her tone can be precious.

If you love food you'll love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best all around vegetarian cookbook","review":"I have cooked my way through 3 copies of the book. It is my bible for creative, tasty and simple ways to cook all manner of vegetables. I am an omnivore, not a vegetarian and Madison's recipes speak to a genuine understanding of the richness of the possibilities of meatless cuisine. My very carnivorous family unfailingly praises whatever vegetable dish I have cooked based on one of Madison's recipes. People who say they loathe vegetables lap up meals I prepare from this book. Madison is the antidote to overboiled, tasteless vegetables. Madison includes much else besides recipes for vegetables such as a full section on preparing grains. My desert island choices, and in fact, my actual sailboat choices would be/are, Madison's Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone and Mark Bittman's How to Cook Everything. They are the two fundamental kitchen resources."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...","review":"I have to say I bought this book for when the author was coming to the local library. I wanted it to get signed, but I wasted my money. She is pretentious as are her recipes. Most of the ingredients are unfindable and/or are expensive. The author isn't even vegetarian and spent most of her time talking at our library complaining about publishing houses, which my father worked for a publishing house for 20 years. Awkward. There may be great recipes in this book, but the author completely turned me off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes you want to bang your head","review":"I do not understand how this book received an award.

Every recipe that I have tried is delicious. Deborah Madison has a wonderful way of explaining each recipe and it's preparation and possible accompaniments. Also alot of basic kitchen and cooking information. This book is just an all-round pleasant book to read and refer to again and again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only Vegetarian Book You Ever Need To Buy","review":"A friend gave this book to me when I became a vegetarian and I have absolutely loved having it. It is an amazing reference to have around in case you have any questions concerning the expansive world of vegetarian cooking and eating. Every recipe that I have tried out of this book has been super delicious as well. I have given Madison's book to two friends of mine who were interested in becoming vegetarian and they have enjoyed it just as much as I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect gift for a vegetarian","review":"This book is probably one of the best and most-used gifts I've ever received.If you only buy one vegetarian-specific cookbook, this should be it.

I can't add much to the above (below?) reviews because they are thoughtful, insightful, and well-written; however, what I can say is it's too bad this book isn't \\"Vegetable\\" Cooking for Everyone instead of \\"Vegetarian\\" because I'm afraid non-vegetarian cooks will avoid it. My advice to them is don't ignore it, buy this book immediately and start using it to the exclusion of everything else in your kitchen for awhile. You will be well-rewarded and so will everyone for whom you cook. I have two homes in which I cook, and although I like a lot of cookbooks, some are \\"two-copy\\" cookbooks - I have to have it in both places. This book qualifies. Enjoy it and thanks, Deborah, for such a fabulous work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good video for Richter fans","review":"I love Richter's work. I still remember how exiting it was to see a display of his abstractions at the top of the stairs as I was visiting his retrospective at the San Francisco Museum of Modern art about ten years ago. Like C��zanne's works, they seem to emit some kind of like from the inside of the work.This video is good insofar as it shows him painting and offers some sense of his career. It isn't nearly as robust as the one Corinna Belz did in the 1990s, when she interviewed him extensively. Perhaps it is unfair to look at them comparatively.I think Richter fans will like the film, but it did seem too long and at times a bit plodding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gerhard Richter Painting","review":"Well done CD .

I also found that this book had a couple of weak points to the plot, and in the pacing of the storyline, just like the first book.However, those where the only weak points. The rest of the story was very enjoyable and well crafted. The art is simply stunning.

They have reached a state of God Realization and are here today to help those who want it and ask for it. A person needs to ask for their help because like a stranger, they will not enter unless invited. However, it is possible to meet these Masters in the dream states, or in states of contemplation.

Halfway through the second track you've already heard four or five moments that have been lifted directly off of various Bowie albums. Sure, inspiration is one thing, but this album is so derivative it comes across as second-rate Pulp or Roxy Music.It's quite sad because I love British Sea Power's debut; it was nothing like this wannabe-mainstream crossover, however. Now they have added so many strings and melodramatic, overly used melodies that it sounds something like Bowie meets Meatloaf. Ugh.If you have their first album and think the highlights are the raw chords, the half-sung half-spoken vocals, and punky vibe, then you will find nothing to like on Open Season, unless you're such a Bowie fan that slavish imitations like this album are also your thing. After such a unique debut, this is a serious disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"British Sea Power - Open Season","review":"I received what I ordered, to the correct ship address, on time and in good condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"My feelings are hurt","review":"I have never waited for an album like I waited for this one. I spoke to a man at the music store to ensure what day it would be out. I drove straight there after work and purchased the cd. I planned an extra long route to my social engagment so that I could listen to the whole album whilst driving. I almost cried, I was so dissappointed. Screw all this \\"I wasn't expecting it but...\\" I, for one, don't like it. I just don't. I haven't even finished listening to the whole album. It makes me feel different than the Decline made me feel and now the good feelings associated with Decline have been destroyed by the not goodness of Open Season. I feel it is lacking in passion and that is what I enjoyed so much from the Decline album. This album is background music at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bore, simple as that","review":"British Sea Power are being lauded as an eccentric English band with songs about the North Pole ( Oh Larsen B ) and playing concerts at the Chelsea Flower Show but they are so crushingly boring it's unreal. Admittedly the album starts off nicely but within 2 or 3 songs you notice that it becomes more of the same stuff again and again. The production on this is horrible as it just gives off a horrible lumpiness to the proceedings. If it were handled with a little more care, perhaps it might have sounded less forced. To their credit though the band have admitted this and that's fine by me.Incidentally, they've been playing a freeform gig with legendary Krautrock gods Faust. Apparently the drummer was doing one of these long drum solos which pissed off the lead singer of Faust so much that the singer went over and started punching him in the face and led to a bit of a brawl. The drummer ended up with a black eye. Ouch"},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone get this man some caffeine!","review":"Geez man, live a little! The vocalist is all but rocking out on this release, which is fine, but it drags the musicians behind him to fall asleep. I was referred this by gnod.net because I really just now learned that I like My Morning Jacket and wanted to see what other bands sound like them. But this is kind of like tranquilizer rock.The jist of the album is that this band wants to recall Simple Minds and Billy Corgan's quietest, softest tracks. That's what I got from it. They really want to make pop songs about nothing but leaving life behind using breathy vocals and a weak backing band. And then to top it all off, they try getting crazy for the last song to make up for not having energy throughout any of the other tracks. A total bore album with no backbone or originality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid Vocals","review":"I made the mistake of checking this album out. If you like Indie Rock and want to know more about bands that make experimental music,then this is for you. I dread the vocals cause they are annoying,weak,indifferent. The melodies seem to playing altogether but have no direction,nor goal. If you like Indie Rock then check this out.Why did I bother to check this album out? I like to hear everything and give most things a shot. Track1 is easily the best on this disc. Track 2 starts and the forced vocals kick in.God Bless MusicSorry,this is really horrid.PS - I suggest Modest Mouse \\"Lonesome Crowded West\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Frame","review":"Frame works great and holds picture well.

The plastic was on the thin side. And I was a little surprised to learn that the magnet didn't take up the entire back side of the frame (it's an ordinary square magnet glued to the back of the frame.... which doesn't make it as strong). But it's fine. My picture sits in the frame fine, even though it seems like it could easily slip out. It looks fine. The magnet seems strong enough. But honestly, it was NOT worth $9+. It looks like I should have paid $2-3 for this thing, tops.

Why not make them soft?I should've known better but we were watching him the entire time. Didn't imagine it would bruise. It did.Definitely do not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"great toy","review":"We received this as a shower gift.

They're a bit sappy at times: son Pasquale has a helpful guardian angel and is too good to be believed. On the other hand, the artwork is excellent and some of the ideas superb. Rose, the mother, has recurring fantasies of being a biker babe, which are brought out at odd moments. Dad is a great tease, at one point getting onto his knees with his shoes under them and telling Pasquale that he got that way because he didn't eat his vegetables.

The Black Sheep, however, wants to wear his own coat and plant gardens instead of making sweaters.

No exchanges allowed, only returns.Would Amazon pay for shipping because it was not our fault? Guess what....no. And they require you to insure it so you are paying an arm and leg in returning it.I therefore ordered another one. Got the watch. What happened? Doesn't work.So my thought is this.

Somehow the translation was able to breath some freshness into this otherwise uninspired piece, but nothing can save it from its superficial characters. Amongst the contemporary novelists of Hong Kong, Lillian Lee no doubt is, and deservingly so, the most well received writer by both the critics and readers in general, but even her work suffers from the same ailment as other novels from Hong Kong: The lack of originality.

MPH states on page 28: \\"The Middle Way is the path of sincerity, in which the heart and the mind together struggle to build the character.\\" The language of this book gentles the mind so it can become part of heart's expanse, thus to absorb the spirit and truth of the teachings, not just their words. For how many words are needed to explain the basic tenets of Buddhism? But if those words are written with care, they can be as the breath breathing and that which they carry, life giving. As an example, I quote from page 26: \\"Right aspiration is the pursuit of truth above all things, of which virtue is first; of self-control above all things, of which compassion is first.\\"Pointed -- expansive -- breathing.Perhaps this is not a good book for the Buddhist scholar, but for the initiate trying to perfect himself, it can be a blessing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wife loves it","review":"When she's happy, then I'm happy.

If they did that they would have come into contact with India, China, and the Native Americans during the migration. No mention of that, nor any sign of it in their culture. Instead they're just transplanted midievals. Or do the other cultures not exist for some reason in this timeline?Supposedly the theme of the story is to study how the posession of gunpowder can change history. But Piper ruins that by having the Paratime cops give Kalvan secret aid -- which, incidently, Kalvan is too stupid to realize that he's getting. Some hero.

Echo Heron appears to read a lot of Dave Barry. Echo Heron moved to Monserrat (sp?) and has a relative named Adele.

Swinging wildly between required scenes of carnage and suspense (which are anything but) and pop-culture filled extravaganzas of hyperbole found only in Mr. Barry's writing, this novel floats in a netherworld of authorial cheekiness where Heron wants us to see how cutely she can write and yet take her novel seriously as a mystery.

The tunes are excellent. They use keyboards to make it sound like they are backed by an orchestra. There use female backing singers who sound like those used on Dark Side of the Moon. There is even lead guitar which is refreshing.

It gets you into the minds of the people who create these tests which is very useful. The problem that students have with the SAT is that it looks like a regular high school test, but a hard one.The truth is the it is not a Scholastic Math test or a Scholastic Reading test or a Scholastic English test. It is a Scholastic REASONING test. Completely unlike anything the student has ever taken.It's much more like the puzzles you used to get with the Sunday Newspaper Magazine. Once a student really gets this, the SAT becomes much less threatening.This book can get you into a frame of mind that will let you do really well on the SAT. You already know everything you need to know to do well on the test. This book can get you to understand that"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many errors","review":"My son and a friend are in the other room right now, taking the practice test.

Incidentally I only came accross Villete by getting \\"Dreamland\\" , a hyperion collection of modern choral pieces.

So, I see some progress has been made in the \\"user friendly\\" department. And that's nice. The 110.5 fits the bill. Only a complete slob would find it difficult to clean. But there's still lots of bits & pieces to work on. It's very easy to use, and that's great for me as I have no patience with appliances.

It's definitely lived up to my expectations of it. It's quick, it's not too loud, clean-up is relatively easy. As for the quality of the juice it produces: while there is clearly oxidation, I don't so much mind it. It's not too bad and I know full well, I'm getting what I paid for.

And yes, I did buy it for myself.The best part of the book is the photographs (it is mainly a picture book after all). The witches and wizards in the book are grouped into the four elements, and each shot is heavily themed. The makeup, costuming, and sets are all very complete and otherworldly. Nearly everything has some sort of glow, sheen, or sparkle to it. The only visual element I disliked was the rather heavy use of motion blur. It does add an ethereal element to the shots, but I would have preferred it been used less.The story and writing were tolerable at best, most often saccharine, and in a word, tacky. I can see the possible appeal for younger readers, but you can find better. But then you don't buy a picture book for the text.

This man is an authority on many aspects of life, both high and low and he is particularly knowegable on most sports. As I am not really a sports fan, it is a mark in his favour that he is able to hold my interest here. This book also deals with campus life, about which he knows a lot and writes extremely well. His style also reminds me a lot of the late Jerome Weidman who was my (then) favourite writer. Go Peter, go, more of the same please."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was... meh","review":"Predictable.

I just couldn't take the emotion, so I went to Amazon to seek out a JT cd that would take my mind off what I just watched. The very first cd on the list by JT was this greatest hits collection which had all the songs I grew up with starting in the early 70s. As he got older, I didn't like the content of his songs so much, so the early ones are my very favorites. And this cd had them all - so many I remember and sang along to. It doesn't mean I'll never buy another JT cd but I definitely will buy this one because it brings back to me better times in my life. This is 2009 and I've been crazy about JT since the early 70s when I was still in high school.

Not only are the 20 tracks here truly representative of the best that JT's ever done, the sound quality is brilliant as the tracks have also been very well remastered. For those of you who are sticklers for detail and order, the tracks are arranged in chronological order as well and yet the album does not sound as disjointed as you might expect. The liner notes albeit short have been written by JT himself too. JT is that special individual who has managed to carve out his own unique sound and his works are able to evoke great emotion out of his listeners with the ability to transport them to other worlds. Great remastered sound, great value for money and great songwriting make this a must have in any music-lover's collection.

It's not a deal breaker, though... we were tempted to send it back for a replacement, but decided it's not worth the time and effort.

There are very few of Maya's dances on screen and not one is shown in its entirety. I have to confess that I didn't watch the whole thing because it was making me tear my hair out after about 40 minutes. What a disappointment!

Ella Fitzgerald's \\"How High the Moon\\" was technically very accomplished but particularly bizzare, almost insulting the audience at some points. On several pieces, it's as if the musicians were doing the tune for the 10,000th time and were torturing it or turning it inside out just to be doing it differently from every other time they'd played it. Perhaps that's why the editors selected these performances. I was quite disappointed overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"EBJ chapter rocks","review":"Thanks for making such a good book avaliable.

It's not going to give you a concussion when the rod hits your head but it gets really annoying having to \\"thread\\" the curtain through again every time this happens. There are no screws to tighten at the ends. I have contacted Umbra twice already about this - once by phone where I actually got a live person, the other by email. Neither produced any response. They did not even attempt to remedy this problem...NOTHING (nice going, Umbra). I guess they want you to spend more money on their double rod drapery brackets (search \\"Umbra Double Drapery Rod Bracket\\" on amazon.com) which render the curly brackets useless - the same curly brackets whose cost have already been factored in the purchase price of the Serif Drapery Double Rod Set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice but not worth the hassle.","review":"Curtain rods pull apart whenever you open or close the drapes.

I ended up buying two sets for each window so I could butt the thicker rods up to each other without exposing the thinner rods but that doubled the cost and still did not entirely eliminate the problem of the rods pulling apart. At least now when you open the curtains they don't fall down, you just have to push the rods back together before the rings will slide over the rod easily. If I had to do it all over again.

I love the look of the curtain rods, the color selection, and even the bracket. BUT, that's as far as it goes! The curtain rods are not held in place with any screws, so every time we attempt to move the curtains open (or close), the rods slide, thus coming apart.

Big mistake..I should have returned them. Today I decided to wash my curtains and while hanging them back up, another snapped just by bending the rod down a little too far.

It's sound quality is very poor. In fact, this could possibly be the poorest sound quality I have ever heard on a CD. The four bonus tracks are titled radio remixes and do resemble a cleaner mix. However, the original 9 tracks ar very scratchy sounding and my guess is that an album was used as the source for the recording. Outlaw fans, if you are looking for the same quality of sound as the Outlaws, Lady In Waiting, and Hurry Sundown titles, forget it. This is not even close. If you plan on playng this out of a cheap boom box, then you probably won't notice the difference. Hopefully, Arista records will someday give Los Hombres Malo the proper release it deserves from the original master tapes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Las Canciones Son Malas","review":"I'm not sure what's worse: The CD sound quality or the songs themselves.

Deathwatch is far better than many horrors I have seen recently. It may not be worth quite four stars, but I rounded up because although a bit gory in parts, I never felt it was trying to be gory for the sake of gore. War is gory and so here it is appropriate. A group of WWI soldiers find the trench they took over from three Germans has more than dead bodies in it. Why did they seem to have killed each other? What does the survivor mean when he says they must get away from it?

Now, they gotta stay alive if they dont kill each other in the process. Very interesting story doesnt quite add up to the fullest extent, though there are some good and bad moments. Jamie Bell (Billy Elliott), Hugh O'Connor and Andy Serkis (The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy), who goes very nutso here, are part of the cast that get lost in the trenches. Dont find this to be the most spectacular movie you ever saw. Find this movie to be at least some what of a bore. Though the end was kind of boosted it up a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soldiers","review":"I was hoping for more from this, but didn't get it. You would have to realize that what you see isn't always what is truly happening. It altered realities. Some of it didn't make much sense, but the end brought it together. Peace and compassion were the ultimate goal, yet it did everything in opposite respect to what they wanted to achieve. That part of the story was good, but that's about all I can recommend of it. Just wasn't for a hard core horror fan, so if you like the lighter side this is perfect for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle Thriller","review":"What I thought was going to be a typical war movie turned out to be a paranormal thriller.

Take note Hollywood, there are still plenty of interesting ways to tell a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too much hype maybe","review":"Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie. It's actually fairly decent. Nothing to write home about, though. The directing, the editing, the acting, the script, all equally adequate. If any one of these individual pieces had shone a little brighter, it would have gained another star, but it just didn't really grab me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent period horror film","review":"I really loved this movie!!! It was very different than many horror films because it took place in a German bunker during war time. Probably the reason that it was soo scarey and chilling to me, is I wonder how many \\"old bunkers\\" that exist now actually are haunted. What stories could be told from them?

The bonus tracks(6), added to the original save this CD from being a zero. They're actually quite good, with the stripped down sound to only guitar and tambourine on a couple tunes.

The early Byrds stuff is beyond extrordinary, but as hard as I try I can't get into his post-Byrds stuff. My big mistake was that I bought White Light right our of the chute as my introduction to Gene's solo stuff and White Light is a fantastic listen, and his voice is so sweet and his writing so full of feeling on that one. Since then I have purchased No Other, the Gosdin stuff, and Dillard stuff. It just all seems disjointed and like their was never any real direction to any of the compositions. This Gosdin Brothers outing is simply no better than any of the other stuff. I have never understood the hoopla over No Other, so maybe it is just me. It is also the fact that much of what is here is dated sounding and that hurts the effect of it all. I will always think that Clark could have been so much more, but simply fell prey to his own demons and it is a shame that he couldn't have kept pumping out the type of stuff that he did on White Light."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for die hard Ed McBain fans","review":"Anybody who is a diehard 87th precinct fan will surely find this book useful.

I had hoped this book would elaborate on class material.The rest of the +100 pages seem irrelevant to the title: a mix of derision against other beliefs, and explanations for basic wicca (magick etc), visualization, and chakra info which can be found in hundreds of other books. The hundreds of other books, however, will also likely give better foundations for these concepts, and without having to wade through Cooper's ranting and railing. Out of the thousands of books I've read or owned, this is 1 of only 3 books which I will throw out.I wish I had known of Cooper's other titles before I considered this book -- unfortunately, I relied too heavily on the misleading number of explanatory drawings to make this purchase.

When I read this book I was highly disappointed with how the author basically says that anyone who believes in Karma or some other type of fate is just wrong. The author never gives a logical reason as to why he thinks the philosophy of Karma is wrong, but rather just says it\`s wrong. The author also has a tendency to ramble on and on about how magick is created from the subconscious rather than mentioning at all the other idea of sending out energy to the universe to cause change in your life. I give this book 2 stars because if you have no knowledge of sigils at all you may find some useful information here. However, if you do have knowledge of sigils or if you are part of a religion that believes in Karma I wouldn\`t waste my money on this book.

Prior to that, he tells you how to think and what to believe to make sigils work, while interjecting at regular intervals how stupid the belief in karma, reincarnation, and other things he does not ascribe to, are.This book told me a little about magic in general, and in that regard it was slightly helpfull, if only for giving me other topics to research.

However, this book isn't crap, it's just not good. Like many books, it starts off good but ends with dross. Honestly the basics of sigil enchantment (as I like to call it) could be presented on one 8 x 14 1/2 piece of paper. A book of this magnitude fails because it falls into a few traps such as a new approach to power and how everything previously presented and different ain't the way yet it includes such formulas albeit altered to bring acceptance by a synthesis and thus the contradictions commence.The book can serve as a launch pad to a few key things by honestly, I feel that there are better books on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Petra - Sweet Nudes","review":"It is difficult to determine which chapter you are selecting from the menu.

It does not give even a hint of the tensions that surfaced between the three major creative artists involved. The Rodgers music and Sondheim lyrics are perfect, and the performances (particularly Franchi) could not be better. The whole thing is charm distilled to its essence.The new Fynsworth Alley recording is also quite good, although in different ways. Some performance are stronger (Carol Lawrence is a delight and Alyson Reed adds welcome depth to her role), but some are weaker (Anthony Crivello, though good, just doesn't have Franchi's pipes).I'd start with this one.
