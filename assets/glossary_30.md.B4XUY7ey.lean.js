This is probably why I have not seen it since. I do love Bill Murray and think he is a great comedic actor. I actually enjoyed the movie until it went back to when he first wakes up in the morning. I did tolerate that once but when it kept repeating that, the movie went from a possible 5 all the way to 0. I rate it a 1 here because there is no lower number to choose. If you have never seen this movie, don't waste your time and money. If you have seen it and like it, please tell me why.

When I saw it in the theater, I actually got up and left the movie because I was tired of waiting to see the end. I never did find out, and I never will.

The darn film is a total repeat and therefore is totally annoying and pointless, I am still angry with myself for watching this peice of trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could've been Murray's best.","review":"This is very close to being Bill Murray's best film. You have to look to \\"Scrooged\\" for that. But lets face it, Bill was handicapped a bit here.First, he had to play opposite Andie McDowell. Unfortunately, Ms McDowell is just this side of a lump of clay as acting ability goes.Second, the final act of the film. Murray has to be a nice guy. Not his forte by any means. And the rest of the cast has to pick up the \\"funny\\" for the remainder of the movie. Fortunately, by that time you've had such fun that you barely notice that flaw.All in all, a very good movie that could've been great."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite films.","review":"This is a sweet, fun, & surprisingly good film. It explores the idea of time repeating itself better than some stories from Asimov's. However it's a romantic comedy technically. It is rare that a movie can e touching & laugh out loud funny, but this manages it without seeming manic depressive. (Unlike that casper movie which is one of the most manic depressive films I've ever seen. I mention that to show it's not so easy to get the right balance.) This definitely gets my \\"Best holiday movie for stupidest holiday award\\" in fact it has little competition on that score. This movie is so good it actually makes me look forward to Groundhog day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie worth seeing twice ... or more","review":"A sweet and funny movie about a newscaster stuck reliving Groundhog Day. The repetition of the day could be annoying, but Murry's character's personal growth throughout the process keeps it from being too much of a mindless comedy. It's a great party movie - I don't know anyone who celebrates Groundhog Day, but now we have a reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply my favorite movie","review":"Of the thousands of movies I've seen in my life, this is my favorite. It works on the level of fanatasy, humor, and most importantly, spirituality. The cleverness of the plot and Bill Murray's comic acting hold your interest throughout, and it isn't until the very end that the profound spiritual message of the movie becomes apparent: true happiness comes from selflessness, not selfishness.Of course, the nearest religious analogy of living the same day over and over and over until you get it right, is to Buddhism and other eastern religions that believe in reincarnation. We Christians believe that we have only this one life to get it right, and then face the judgment. But the message that selflessness and service to others provides true fulfillment and happiness is equally applicable to Christianity. In fact, service to others is the very heart of the redeemed Christian life, the Christian's response to salvation in Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Movie","review":"This movie is great for the whole family.

Here's the cure; in an unassuming comedy about Murray's Phil Conners, the Weatherman, who solves those problems when he relives the same day over and over.

Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliot and twice Murrays are shining with every extra.If you had a day to live ; would you be very good or very bad? Phil tries it all; for worse and better.

I think we all have been at one point or another. Two key lines from the movie: \\"What would you do if you were stuck in the same place, and every day was the same, and nothing that you did mattered?\\" Phil speaks this line to two drunks in a bowling alley, and the response he gets is, \\"That about sums it up for me.\\" Haven't we all been there? Near the end of the movie, as Phil has finally completed the day done right, he says, \\"No matter what happens tomorrow, I'm happy now.\\" That line breaks the spell, and Phil is free to move on to February 3rd and beyond. In between he struggles with every possible way to try to find happiness, and the despair of not being able to find it. In the end, it is the realization that happiness does not depend on our circumstances, it depends on our attitude, and the choices we make."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Film You'll Want to Watch Again & Again!","review":"Have you ever had one of those days, where you wake up and you have a strong sense of deja vu -- as if you've lived through this moment before? Overbearing TV weatherman Phil Connors (played Bill Murray) gets a whole series of such days, in which he literally re-lives the same day (Groundhog Day) again and again.This comedy blossoms under Murray's radiant comic genius, as we are gifted with a whole series of his outrageous attempts to get through the day as fast as possible, as selfishly as possible, or with as much self-importance as possible. Eventually, Connors comes to discover that the most joy comes from helping others, as he finds himself falling head-over-heels in love with his lovely (and not easily impressed) TV producer, played by Andie MacDowell.Supporting actor Chris Elliott is extremely funny, and this film is so good that you'll find yourself wanting to watch it again... and again... and again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Groundhog Day!","review":"This is one the funniest movies that I have ever seen. Without giving away too much of the plot, I will tell you why. Pessimistic Phil Connors, weatherman on Channel 9 Pittsburgh finds himself once again in the tiny town of Punxsatawney, PA for-what else- Groundhog Day. On Groundhog Day, an unpredicted blizzard keeps Phil (like the groundhog), the funny cameraman Larry, and the new producer, Rita, in Punxsatawney. The next day he wakes up in his hotel room and finds out that it'sGROUNDHOG DAY!It is amazingly funny to see Phil reapeat Groundhog Day over and over and over again, and for him there seems to be no way out of it, whether he tries to save an old man's life, drives off of a cliff, or tries-unsuccesfully, I might add- to make Rita love him.GET THE MOVIE, NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill Murray shines in this heartwarming film","review":"Bill Murray reestablishes himself as a genuine character in this simple, yet cathartic story. As in his role in the umpteenth rendition of Ebeneezer Scrooge in the dark and somewhat twisted \\"Scrooged\\", Bill Murray again seethes as an unlikeable fellow early on, only to meet his match in a series of unexpected and unexplainable circumstances. Faced with endlessly repeating days, his character slowly learns to appreciate and care for people (besides himself). Armed with his newly developed people skills, honed day after day in sleepy Punxsatawny, he yearns for tomorrow to finally come. And it does, finally, but only after true awareness and the ability to love another become the guideposts in his life.

We tend to go through a batch of Master Mix a week in our home, so I needed another functional pastry blender. The only one I could find in the local stores was this Good Cook wire pastry blender. It functions, barely. It does ok on room temperature shortening, but bends all over the place when I try to use it on cold butter. The way the wires bend, I keep thinking they're going to break, but they haven't yet. After a year though, it's reached the point where I have to slice the butter a bit with a knife before taking the mangled wires to it in my mix. Also, the little tabs on the handle have started popping out at random times when I'm mixing. They pop right back in without a problem, but it is a minor annoyance. Basically, the pastry blender is faster than working with just a couple knives, but it's time to replace it with a better model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made","review":"Broke after a half of dozen uses.

I attempted to rig something up, but just did not feel it was safe, so that was my main reason for returning it. Also, in the process of screwing the attachment to the crib, it easily scratched the wood.In addition, this motor on the mobile was EXTREMELY loud. I had to turn the music volume as high as it would go just to hear it over the motor. Like other reviewers, the rotation stopped several times and made grinding noises and I would have to push it to get it going again.I was disappointed in the design of this product because it does not fit all crib types and was very disappointed in the noise of the motor - not sure how this would be soothing to a baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonder mobile","review":"I purchased as a gift to my niece.

If the canopy opening is not perfectly circular then it will rub against the main assembly causing it to get stuck and make a terrible grinding noise.

The motor buzzes loudly when the canopy rotates, to the point that it's really annoying, not soothing.Now I am out $60 and still don't have a product I can use. I am very, very disappointed and feel like I've had rotten luck. This leaves a bad taste in my mouth toward this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish it worked for more than two weeks!

Unfortunately, one day it just stopped working. I figured the batteries had run out so I changed them. It worked fine for a day and then stopped working again. I tried a third time (with a different brand of batteries) and again it only worked for a day or so. Very frustrating.

When you remove the mobile, you could use it as a music only, but it looks strange with our the arm and canopy.The canopy on our mobile was really hard to snap in place especially the last piece.My baby does like it, but its so noisy that I can't use it to lull her back to sleep, it only works when she is awake otherwise it keeps her up.I am on the look out for a better option."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT LOOKS REALLY OLD, AND WAS BROKE","review":"SINCE THE FIRST MOMENT THAT I TAKE IT OUT OF BOX I WAS WONDERING IF IT WAS USED OR NEW, MAKE A TERRIBLE NOISE WHEN IT START AND, THE CONTROL REMOTE WAS BROKE BUT WAS NOT A BIG DEAL BECAUSE EVERY TIME THAT I TURN ON THE TV, THE MOBILE START, AND ALSO IT DOESN\`T LOOK LIKE IN THE PICTURES"},{"rating":"2","title":"~*:._.:*~*:._.:Transcendant .:*~*:._.:*~*","review":"Sada Sat has held down the vibes for the conscious music scene for years, sharing her gift of music and devotion.

The humming was so loud I could hear it down the hallway and from adjoining rooms. I let it run for about 48 hours hoping the noise would tone down after it was broken in which did not happen. The good news is that Amazon is crediting my account after I sent them an email. This is the first of many things I have ordered from Amazon and the only one where I had a problem and had to request a refund. I don't know if I just got a defective pump or what.

Almost immediately after I began using it, the thing went from reasonably quiet to obnoxiously loud. I opened it up and found that the magnet used inside to create the pumping motion was poorly attached to its metal arm. I used some aquarium silicone to better fasten it and dampen vibration. That helped, but I've found since then that it's gotten noisy again and I haven't been able to fix it, this time. So, the pump does move air, but not quietly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for several months, then slowly died.","review":"This pump was pretty weak to begin with, and slowly died after several months (completely stopped pumping any air at all).Also, it moves a little due to vibration, and when it touches something by its side, it starts making a vibrating noise.

Unscrew the 4 Philips head screws under the unit and separate the bottom and the top. You will find a stack of \\"L\\" shaped magnets. Move the stack a bit to the right and tighten the nut that holds the \\"L\\" shaped magnets in place. Put it back together and ta-da no more noise! The Problem is that the little arm that holds the square shaped magnet is hitting the \\"L\\" shaped magnets with every pump. All you have to do is give it some space so it doesn't hit the other stack of magnets. The nut might not have be tight enough when they built it or it rattled loose during normal use allowing the stack of magnets to slip a bit.All in all this is a pretty good pump.

He loved it immediately, climbing into it and naming each of the animals on the chair. Since his room is done in the Malawi theme, this chair was a delightful addition. Sadly, he got just a smudge of dirt on it. When I tried to clean it by dabbing it with water (just dabbing...not rubbing, as I had read others' advice against rubbing), the green color fabic faded badly right away. This was just with a dab of water! So we returned the chair (amazon was great about this!) and got a second one. The second one had a small rip in the arm upon delivery. So we have returned it and are awaiting a third chair. Hopefully the third time will be the charm, because this chair really is CUTE! But if there's something wrong with #3, then we will give up on the Malawi chair and buy something else. So sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Unfortunate","review":"This chair is cute and is the perfect size. Unfortunately the fabric is very thin.

Typical for Microsoft -- mile wide and an inch deep.Also, note that if you have to reboot your computer because of a windows crash, the keyboard and mouse are useless because they require that bluetooth is running.

She gives not only great scenarios and ideas for seducing the object of your desire, but also delves into the emotional side, giving warnings on when seduction is \\"good\\" and when it is ill-intended. I highly recommend this wonderful, innovative book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down","review":"The book promises a lot but does not get into too much detail. It repeats itself often with the same mantras and generalizations. I expected more practical and detailed hints.

I personally love this band, but most of my friends have never understood my taste in music. Every time I listen to this album, I want to go out and buy a cheap electric guitar; a couple of cases of beer and then sit in my garage with three other dimwits like myself and crank out Milkshake tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheers to Yer Ole Granddaddies of Garage Punk Beatdom","review":"First off, anything these blokes recorded is worth checking out. (NOTE: Most of their back catalog is rare and extremely hard to find.) I have all of their back catalog except for their 4th release and every records SMOKES, baby! Talk about underrated! Sheesh! These gents could have snuffed out most of what is called GARAGE ROCK (The White Stripes, The Strokes, etc.) these days. Here's my advise, if you are into good GARGAGE/BEAT rock n' roll, you cannot lose by buying this here CD. In fact, buy all of the CD's listed on this website and PLEASE SUPPORT REAL AUTHENTIC GARAGE ROCK N' BEAT. Well...what are you waiting for...........start your MILKSHAKES collection today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psycho-Cybernetics 2000","review":"I read the original Psycho-Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz in the early 70's. I read it again last month and then read Bobbe Sommer's version. I think the original is better. Maltz keeps it simple and focuses on the subconscious as the primary goal seeking mechanism. I thought Sommer's book diluted the message with cross messages from other self help techniques. Maltz's method works great. It's simple and effective. It's not a self help book, it's a book about reprogramming yourself. Sommer seems to turn the science into a self affirmation exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Original !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This book is a complete spin-off of the original PSYCHO CYBERNETICS By Maxwell Maltz, which was a classic. Don't buy this book as it's just a get-rich-quick scheme by the author Bobbe Sommer as she adds nothing substantial to the original material, just her own boring stories. I have the original book by Maxwell Maltzand it is one of the best self help book I have ever read. Bobbe Sommer has just ruined the PSYCHO CYBERNETICS philosophy by adding her own crap in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Try To Improve On Perfection!!","review":"Having been a fan of Dr. Maxwell Maltz's landmark book, \\"Pyscho-Cybernetics\\", I was anxious to see what this \\"new\\" one was like. I found out quickly that you can't improve on something that is so wonderful and that if you are going to write a book, at least try to do something original. Ms. Sommer's book leaves one flat and uninspired much like the text. Buy the original, it's still the best!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the right version!","review":"The more original a copy of Psycho-Cybernetics you can get your hands on the better! His foundation is now in the hands of other people (some competent, some sell-outs) who have used it mostly for their personal gain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Book","review":"I love this book! It's very simple to understand, easy and enjoyable to read. It has information that I've been looking for - a Science of Mind type approach to thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something about this book doesn't sit well with me","review":"I have had this book(2000 version) for years and every time I try and read it I can never complete it. I don't know if it is because of how closely it is typed together or the checklist to dos or what. This book just doesn't resonate with me. It is hard to change your life if you can't even get through the book. Save your money and buy the original version."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little better than the original","review":"I enjoyed the original Psych-Cybernetics when it came out. This version is moreup to date in connecting psych-cybernetics to moderndiscoveries about how the brain works. The political correctness is a little overdone, emphasizing thatthe technique can be used by women who have careers, minorities, etc., but I guess one expects that sort of thing in the ninetees. I study the book a little every day, although I have already read it once through. Excellentfor people interested in the brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"I like bluegrass and Billy Currington, so I THOUGHT this CD could be a nice listen. WRONG!'Off My Rocker' is my favorite song by Currington and I've listened to it many times, yet can't even tell that this bluegrass take on it is even remotely based on the same tune. The same holds true for pretty much every other track on here.On a positive note, this recording is fine if you want to listen to just random bluegrass music and/or you can get the disc for free, otherwise this is just a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Billy Currington is far too talented to have his name on this album. Pick something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not advertised clearly","review":"Recieved this item and found out that it is not the songs by Billy Currington, it is a tribute album by other artists with no words to any of the music.

This book is useless for information on American Company's glass, manufacturer, value, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for American glass","review":"This is a truly beautiful book, but is only helpful if you are looking for information on English vaseline glass or vaseline glass in general. Only about 5% of the book covers American vaseline, which is where my interest lies, so the book was a total disappointment to me, and pretty much useless for my needs. But if you like pretty pictures, go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mouse & The Traps - 'Fraternity Years' (Big Beat) 4 1/2 stars","review":"Until now, I have vaguely even heard of this psychedelic / garage band from Tyler, Texas. Apparently, the band put out plenty of good singles between 1965-69. But, no albums. No problem, this twenty-five track compilation says it all. Tunes I found myself playing over many times are \\"Public Execution\\" (sounds SO much like Bob Dylan, it's almost scary), \\"Maid Of Sugar,Maid of Spice\\", \\"I've Got Her Love\\", \\"I Am The One\\", the Monkees-like \\"Promises,Promises\\" and \\"I Satisfy\\". Line-up: Ronnie 'Mouse' Weiss-vocals, Doug Rhone-guitar&vocals, David Stanley-bass, Randy Fouts-keyboards and Don Garrett-drums. Should appeal to most fans of the Standells, Chocolate Watchband, Gentrys, Kingsmen and the Outcasts. Essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS !!!","review":"Good book with a great story line, very real characters. Keeps you turning the pages with its intriguing characters.

Good reading for a book club or the individual reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Jazz CD","review":"I purchased this CD on the recommendation of Amazon and you the reviewers of smooth jazz. I am very pleased. This CD is hot. Smooth Jazz at its best. Steve Cole has outdone himself on this one. If you listen to this CD you will buy it. Guaranteed. Some of my favorites are: \\"Between Us\\"-track 8; \\"From the Start\\"-track 2; \\"Interlude\\"-track 6; and \\"Take Me Home to You\\"-track 3. He also performs instrumental versions of \\"Waterfalls\\" and \\"Together Again\\" that will make you stop and listen. The sax is perfect, with the following \\"unknowns\\" either performing or providing support to Steve, how could this work not be successful: Brian Culbertson, Kirk Whalum, Peter White, Dave Koz, Boney James, Marc Antoine and many more. Don't pass this one up to add to your collection. You will be the talk of crowd when you put this one on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm and funky","review":"Looking for a CD to liven up a dinner party or just to cheer you up, while sitting in front of the computer, or curling with your favourite book? You will love Steve Cole and his jazzy and groovy CD. The CD has a perfect start with \\"I Got It Goin' On\\" - so warm and inviting. As the CD progresses, you would also find some gems, like track #5, \\"For Your Love\\" - lush and sensual; or TLC's classic \\"Waterfalls\\". For those who love jazz and saxophone, and looking for some warm and sensual music that is not too hard to 'comprehend', Steve Cole's \\"Between Us\\" is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome! Definitely a 5 star!","review":"Just about every single track is a real winner! Great sound and style plus exciting, upbeat tunes. I don't think any smooth jazz lover could be disappointed by purchasing this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve Cole is the best!","review":"I bought Steve's first CD two years ago after hearing him on the radio and loved it. Ever since, I have been waiting for his next release - and Steve has exceeded my expectations!

Thanks, Steve!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow","review":"Wow...I don't know what to say. My friends rented this one night hoping for something good. We didn't know what we were getting ourselves into.

I don't know what the hell they were thinking, but all the life was drained from the vivacious rhythms and lyrics of the first album. This sounds like normal stale classic rock nonsense from the 1970s.In honesty I would be far easier on this album if it were not made by Comus. In fact, I am pretty sure that it is incorrect to even call the musicians on this album Comus, because they sound completely different and have none of the violent character of the first album.I mean I was listening to the first song or so and I thought that it was just a weak first track, but then it kept on going in much the same vein. I think that the band quit doing acid or something after recording First Utterance because this is stale and tired rubbish in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"to bad you can't steer this scooter","review":"Purchased for a 5 year old who was already riding a scooter but thought he might like a skateboard.

After paying an inflated overprice of $32.95 one expects Jakes to deliver. He didn't. The book is nonsensical, immature and does not in any sense of the word deliver anything to the Reader in the way of entertainment. Being a lifelong fan of Jakes I am astounded to find he has allowed his name on the book. Yes...it IS that bad. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile","review":"The only other work of Jakes that I have read was Charleston. Savannah is a completely different type of book. The main character is a young girl, which makes the book feel like it is geared toward the teenage crowd. Descriptions are not very detailed and all of the action that takes place is void of any feeling of excitement. I was expecting something similar to Charleston with its complex families and detailed descriptions of places and events. My main purpose for reading this book was the hope that I would learn a little more about a city I enjoy visiting. Obviously, I was unable to get a better view of the city of Savannah and I got little worth out of the book in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"contrived and un-enjoyable read","review":"This is the first John Jakes book I have read entirely and after hearing about his much acclaimed writing - I must state that I am sorely disappointed. His writing (at least in this his most recent work) is flabby and full of useless and cumbersome clichés. He takes so much liberty with historical fact that it renders the book un-enjoyable. But that did not seem to deter professional critics and book reviewers. They laud \\"Savannah.\\" But why? Perhaps at this point in his life, Mr. Jakes is riding his own coattails. Too bad, I am an avid reader of history and author of a book on a Civil War regiment from Georgia and the author of a book on Savannah history - Mr. Jakes did both topics as well as the craft of fiction a disservice in this recent work."},{"rating":"1","title":"My favorite author writes a dud....","review":"What is going on here, I read this because John Jakes is one of the best authors I have ever read.....Virtually everything else has been great, I could not get into this......Oh, well, he is still great...."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect condition","review":"The book was in perfect condition, my father will be so happy when I give it to him for his 75th birthday"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING!","review":"If you are a fan of the 1976 bicentennial series by Jakes you will think he has become mentally feeble and lost all writing ability. If you are a history buff you will abhor this book. If you are a first time reader of the Civil War and think darkies sang zippidy doo dah through their slavery you will LOVE this book. I believe Mr. Jakes has lost his perspective on history and is just tired of writing but writes because he has a \\"name\\". Sometimes it is just best to stop until you have an epiphany or just stop because the well is dry. I would advise Civil War readers to pass this one by. I am donating my copy to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Young Adults???","review":"What a disappointment. Savannah reads as if it were written for ages 12-14. Charleston was superbly done. Savannah doesn't have the depth, the character development of Jakes' other works. It's almost childish....as a history scholar, I can assure you that Cump Sherman had no heartwarming \\"cute\\" encounters with children. He was a cold hard man, a professional soldier, doing a bitter job. He spared little in the way of warmth to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as some say.","review":"Sure its not perfect but this book is a heck of a lot better then what passes for historical fiction nowadays. While the characters and the resolutions are a little convenient there is still a satisfying conclusion and I can't understand what everyone is complaining about"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I wait with anticipation for John Jakes to complete a new book. I enjoyed \\"Charleston\\" but \\"Savannah\\" is a disappointment. I usually can't put Jakes' books down, this one was hard to pick up. When I retired from teaching in 2001, my first \\"fun thing\\" to do was to re-read the Kent Family Chronicles. I accomplished it within a month. It took me almost a month to read \\"Savannah\\". It lacked character development and suspense. I will be waiting for his next book though, as I am a life long fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Effort","review":"Very disapointed. For an author I would follow (buy) anywhere, this book seems like a kids version of what could have been a much more developed and detailed novel along the lines of Jakes other masterpieces. Even paying a discounted ~$15.00, I feel I was ripped off. Hope it is not a portent of things to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"MORE THAN A HOLOCAUST HORROR STORY","review":"At first, I found the title and subject matter off-putting, then I couldn't PUT this book down! Don't let the title fool you. More than just a story of a Jewish girl's plight, this story tugs at your heartstrings while creating a voyeuristic atmosphere compelling you to read on and find out what becomes of the title character. It's a riveting story about one woman who's real life was stranger than fiction. I was amazed at how fast I finished this book simply because I could not wait to find out what this \\"Jewgirl's\\" fate was to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dangerous Mother","review":"This extraordinary mother,so disfunctional and disturbed, makes the Nazis seem almost benign.

This is the first one I have had that felt, looked, and tasted like real food. The flavor I got was cran-lemon twister, and from the first bite my body said \\"Yes!\\". I must confess I'm going through them quickly. These folks obviously want you to like your bars, because the ingredients look nice -- not all smushed up -- are varied and plentiful -- not just mushed cashews with dates -- and give you the satisfying chew that just might be important to you. (It is to me.) There are sesame, peanut, and other potential allergens, but it's funny -- I usually have a problem with sesame, but not here. Maybe the tangy fruits give my body a way to deal with the seeds? Anyway, I'm a new convert. Keep 'em coming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy and guilt free!","review":"I have tried the whole line of Probars and, at first, I was put off by the amount of fat. Then I looked at the source of the fat - nuts, peanut butter, etc. and everything else they offer - all organic and unprocessed ingredients, 6g of fiber, Omega 3s and 6s, 3oz of good, filling and healthy stuff and instantly got over the \\"fat issue\\". This flavor, in particular, is more zingy and fruity. YUM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Nutrition Bar","review":"Been buying this brand and particular flavor for over 18 months now and still like it. It's very tasty and more lemon-y than cranberry-y! Slightly tart with whole fruits, nuts, and seeds in it.Unfortunately, it's one of few nutrition bars that does not have chocolate in it. I like chocolate but cannot tolerate too much of it.

This book explains why.The man had a very honorable career before his eventual fall from grace. In six chapters, the former Vice President gave a detailed résumé of the most interesting twelve years of his life. From the Hiss case, to the Election of 1960, Nixon seems to list his accomplishments in hopes of earning the respect of the reader. From all I have read about him, he believed he worked twice as hard as Kennedy, while earning only half of the accolades.I consider Six Crises to be act one of a three part tragedy. For those who know the ending of the main character's journey, put aside any aspersions, and enjoy this narrative of an interesting man living in a fascinating era of American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets Better With Time","review":"When i first bought this album in the early 90s,i thought it was crap.I found this the other day in a box of old cds.Wow! was i wrong.This album gets better with time.Now i cant stop listening to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"1.5 Stars","review":"Another disappointment. The only good thing on the CD is \\"Too Many Walls\\"... besides that, the CD is pretty much not good for much."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm still \\"moving to this\\" now!","review":"I love the cd. Miss Dennis likes to make people move with songs like \\"Move to this\\", \\"c'mon & get my love\\", \\"All night long(touch me)\\" and \\"Just another dream\\". These songs have remained my favorite 4.When I bought it, I was crazy to pay[the price]for 10 songs, but I really wanted the disc. Only 2 days ago, did I record her music onto a mini-disc. It brings back good memories to hear her dance club hits. I'll never tire of her energy packed music and her cute British accent. \\"Move to this\\" is better than her follow up cd, \\"Into the skyline\\". Cathy Dennis won my heart then and she still wins it now.The reason why I rated the cd only 4 stars, is because I was disappointed in the sound-alike quality of the first 3 tracks. Cathy should have changed the tone of the background music, to differ the songs altogether. But then again, artists usually take a sound and stay with it for an album or two.I'll say it again. I love the cd. I think you'll appreciate it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"just real nutty","review":"This one was really weird.

Those who would like to refresh lyrics will find it very useful. But the performance/voice for me personally were rather disappointing. Those who expect anything like Shulzhenko ili Zykina style can skip this disk. The performance is on the level of a friend singing in a small company in the second part of the evening. For a singing friend the voice is beautiful and interpretation is very interesting. But for a wider audience ... I couldn't help thinking that this is not an appropriate level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous","review":"I loved this book. The heroine was intelligent and competent; and solved her problems herself, thus earning the hero's admiration. She also had a perfectly nice but boring suitor that was actually a reasonable alternative to the hero. I really liked the heroine a lot, the hero was rather bland. A nice change from the feather-headed idiots who insist on falling for the wrong man and/or get themselves into trouble they require rescuing from."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Purchase","review":"I am really having fun with my new CD! Withing Temptation wouldn't have been my first choice, but I was introduced to a particular song and I just had to have it.

That's pretty good, if you ask me...The songs are so emotional and they inspire me when I write my stories(just short stories on fanfiction). I'd have to say my favorite one is Memories.

I figured, for free, I'll give it a shot. I can honestly say, it's one of my favorite cheese metal albums. I don't really know anything about his band, their history, or anything else, but they are (or, I think I can safely assume, were) good at what they do/did. If you have the opportunity to pick up this disc, go for it. If you are fan of hair metal, I don't think you'll be disappointed. If you need comparison, they seem to be a long the lines of \\"Def Leppard crosses Skid Row\\".

I guess that would explain why the Union and Confederate uniforms are backwards. Yes, you read correctly, backwards! If the Russkies couldn't figure out who wore blue and who wore gray, you can pretty well figure they didn't get much else right either. So much for the historical accuracy the game claims. This game is a total rip-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves much to be desired","review":"This game was obviously programmed by people who had little to no historical knowledge of the Civil War. The only battle out of the four with even a semblance of the historical military balance is Gettysburg. The other three, the \\"Seven Days Battle,\\" Chattanooga, and Chancellorsville, bear no resemblance to the actual battles in either landscape or units involved. And as other reviewers have pointed out, the \\"Confederation\\" wears blue uniforms and the Union grey. In addition, artillery units are so deadly in this game that no other unit can get near them. They can virtually win a battle by themselves, which was certainly not the case in the Civil War.The game also crashes quite a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree that is awful","review":"This game is incomprehensible. It has no help section so I can't run it. I have gotten far enough to see the uniforms are backwards, but I don't how to run it or what to do next. Total ripoff. Not worth a penny.

Who ever desgned this game knows very little about the civil war. The battle fields are hopelessly exagerated, it looks like the the civil war was fought in the swiss alps according to this game. I've been to the real battlefields and they bare no resemblance to anything in this game! The union side is in gray uniforms (HuH?, The confederates are in blue (Say what?) Artillery is useless and doesn't move! The computer pretty much decides when a unit will attack so you have no control past a certain point, makes it a little hard to spring an ambush.

Another hackneyed addition to this plot: wrong- side-of-the-tracks boyfriend \\"proves\\" his worthiness to girl's snobby parents by rescuing the girl. So was the plot with Sandy and Manuel. I might have switched it around so the boy was the one stuck with snobby, wealthy parents. Add variety to overused plots. That's what Ann Martin did in her BSC series. In the BSC, with Logan and Mary Anne, Logan's parents are the wealthier ones and his father looks down his nose at Mary Anne, who comes from a poorer family. AND, Mary Anne doesn't wait around for Logan to rescue her.

While the 'A side' material (the hits) were great, the 'B side' stuff kept to the same high level of perfection.Even now, years later, \\"Lazy Day\\" still runs through my head.The band changes tone and seems to mellow out in the later stages; while still goo, they lack the intensity of the early recordings.A great treat for the ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dancing the Test of Time...","review":"39 years later, the hauntingly bittersweet orchestration of \\"Pretty Ballerina\\" still sends shivers through me taking me to the place inside myself that was first engaged by this music so many years ago; \\"Walk Away Renee\\" is on par with the caliber of \\"Pretty Ballerina\\" which is why it has ended up on Rolling Stone's Top 500 List.Oddly, the remaining tracks do not live up to the 'cutting edge' of the mid-'60's; they remain relatively obscure, blending in with so much of the light rock and roll of the early '60's.This album remains one that bridged the gap between the late '50's/early '60's pop scene and the late '60's psychedelic/acid rock explosion; an album well worth owning with \\"Walk Away Renee\\" and \\"Pretty Ballerina\\" being its cornerstones...dancing the test of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left Banke - 'There's Gonna Be A Storm: The Complete Recordings 1966-69'' (Mercury)","review":"Review no. 55. More or less, I had totally forgotten about this highly talented AM psychedelic late '60's band. A must-have twenty-six track compilation / collection of (presumably) everything the Left Banke had ever recorded. Best described as baroque pop. Many of these songs show true beauty that is so rarely found in music - especially in this day and age. Tunes like their two most familiar cuts \\"Walk Away Renee\\" and \\"Pretty Ballerina\\" as well as the stunning \\"Barterers And Their Wives\\", the toe-tapping \\"What Do You Know?\\", the well-played \\"Dark Is The Bark\\", \\"In The Morning Light\\" and the sort of familiar-sounding \\"Pedestal\\". Recommended for fans of the Zombies, The Nazz, Hollies, Sundowners and Buckinghams."},{"rating":"2","title":"check into this","review":"I really don't have a whole lot to say about the Left Banke's There's Gonna Be a Storm, which collects two Left Banke albums and puts them onto a single disc.The music is insanely melodic, but I personally prefer the more orchestrated selections such as *that* song (you know which one I'm referring to) and the extremely beautiful and underrated \\"Pretty Ballerina\\". I absolutely LOVE these two songs. Talk about vocal melodies that must have dropped straight down from heaven. The rest of the material is more standard, though still impressively melodic in every direction.A great album for anyone who appreciates the late 60's pop scene and especially an important addition for those who appreciate the early Who, Beatles and Rolling Stones."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU WON'T NEED A PLAYLIST JUST LISTEN TO ALL OF IT","review":"I only discovered this band in November 2010.

How about a drizzle","review":"I searched for the single \`Walk Away Renee\\" for 25-years. Finally, There's Gonna Be A Storm ended my long quest. \`Walk Away Renee' is the most majestic example of 60's Renaissance Pop. Beautiful, melodic and unforgettable. Unfortunately, the remainder There's Gonna Be A Storm doesn't hold a candle to 'Walk Away.' The other 15 songs are pathetic attempts to merge Mersey Beat Pop with Classical music. The tinny harpsichord lines, pseudo-string arrangements and whispering vocals are about as exciting as warm milk. Now I understand why the Left Banke was a one hit wonder: there is only one tolerable song in their entire catalog. Storm? How about a drizzle. This CD hurts my ears (not to mention my pocketbook)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A group worth checking out","review":"This group was recommended to me by a friend who turned me on to a lot of obscure or semi-obscure 60's groups. He thought I was going to like them and he was right. Left Banke is in a similar vein to the Zombies in their mellower songs, only more baroque-oriented. This compilation is very generous and has several songs worth hearing. I especially like \\"Walk Away Renee\\", \\"Pretty Ballerina\\", \\"Barterers and Their Wives\\", \\"Desiree\\" and \\"Goodbye Holly\\". If you like 60's soft rock groups, like the Zombies and Association, you should definitely check Left Banke out."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful...","review":"I bought this album solely to have someway to hear Pretty Ballerina when I wanted. The song stunned and mesmerized me when I heard it in the 60s;then it seemed like I heard it every 5 yrs when some golden oldie dj played it.

But I had no idea the other music on the album would be as good as it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best compilation of an excellent band.","review":"There have been several compilations of TLB but this one is by far the best. Some try to get into later projects such as the Stories who sound nothing like TLB. This band along with very few others came very close to the brilliance of the Fab Four without trying to sound like them. Very unique and well written songs and one of the first to explore classical music tied in with Rock. Just the right amount of Baroque with out going overboard. Strongly recommended for one's Sixties catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"I'm amazed that no one has mentioned \\"Sing Little Bird Sing\\", one of the most beautiful unknown songs of the 60s.

Had I not remembered the advertising for the film when it was in theaters, and had the case not described it as a comedy, I might have actually enjoyed it as a standard gangster film which is really what it is.On a bright note, Brendan Gleeson gives a really stand-out performance and I'm going to make a point of looking for other movies he's been in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comedy or Drama?","review":"This movie is hilarious and also really sad which is a really strange combination.

Easily my favorite Colin Farrell role by a long shot - funny and tragic, extremely entertaining. Certainly by now you've heard Bruges is the classic \\"other character\\" in the film and - no doubt - it is truly stunning.

It's funny, strange, beautiful, and violent all in one. Best of all, it's utterly unique. Colin Farrell is at his best in this movie. He and Brendan Gleason are SO good together - they play off of each other really well. Ralph Fiennes does psycho great and clearly enjoys the role. And the city of Bruges is truly gorgeous. The other characters are interesting and as odd as the movie. Be patient, though - the Irish accents are tough to follow at first but you'll fall right in. Assuming this kind of movie is your thing.

These ways will be repeated ad nauseum throughout the movie. The actors were good at convincingly portraying mentally highly-unstable characters: an aging hitman whose prostitute wife was killed in a brothel, a young hitman who botched his first hit and can't get over it, an easy drug-dealing girl, and a bigoted druggie actor dwarf.

I think the only reason some liked it is that Americans are the usual target of abuse which is the only thing that consistently pleases film critics. Europeans can be homophobic, bigoted, sexist, etc. but as long as they bash Americans in the process as well it is a \\"progressive\\" film and critics will automatically approve. But European \\"progressivism\\" is just a resurgent European nationalism with a thin progressive veneer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid, gory, not funny, but lovely town","review":"Read all the other one star reviews and I will just say \\" ditto\\" I wanted to like this movie after reading all the great reviews in various newspapers. The movie started with some clever off the wall banter between the 2 hit men sent to Bruges, but instead of remaining so, it quickly turned into a blatantly violent scattershot mess. The murder scenes were just too graphic to be considered dark humor. I agree with someone here who said it was completely unnecessary to show the killing of the child. This was really a bad and offensive movie, that veered screeching from strange dark humor to realistic bloodbaths. One star because despite it all, the actors and actresses were good and the DVD had some extras with interviews of the cast which were 100% better than the actual movie itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I watched this film On Demand because I had read good reviews. Not a Colin fan, but once I started watching it I couldn't stop laughing. Farrell, Gleeson and Donavan were hysterical. And, it was incredibly witty.

The ending drags on a little long for me, but for most of the movie the leisurely pace matches the beauty of the town, and there's some terrific acting, especially from Brendan Gleeson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever dialoque, fun romp with a little violence.","review":"Colin Farrell is so much fun in this clever story and Ralph Fiennes makes a surprisingly great Bad Guy.If you like Snatch, this will appeal to you and you already know to listen closely to the clever lines delivered with Irish brogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, with dark moments","review":"Two Irish gangsters on the lam in a small hotel in Bruges -- one gleefully sightseeing and the other glumly complaining about the medieval hellishness of the town in winter. Colin Farrell is excellent, looking as if his eyebrows are about to jump off his face, just great acting, not the least bit vanity.

Not too much really happens through most of the film except for the 2 hitmen touring around Bruges and getting into some minor situations and then their boss goes their to kill one of them for accidentaly shooting a kid. There is almost no action except for a little chase scene on foot towards the end which would've been okay if the dialoge would have been better. There are a few funny lines here and there through the movie but not that many and I mostly chuckled and only laughed outloud once or maybe twice also they talk pretty low so I had to turn it up loud.

It made me a bit uneasy that Colin Farrell was in it, because I have never enjoyed his work in anything ever, but I figured I would give it a shot.Please do not purchase this film. Not only did I not laugh one single time, I didn't even crack a smile. I honestly had no idea what I was supposed to find funny in this picture. Is it that a child gets shot in the head or the endless amount of midget jokes or maybe it's that Colin Farrell's acting talent is equal to that of a burlap sack filled with rusty doorknobs.I have never written a review for anything before here on Amazon, but this movie was so terrible that I feel obligated to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story Threads Immaculate","review":"I had often heard of the movie \\"In Bruges,\\" but happened upon it one day on a satellite movie channel. I do not frequently re-watch movies - much less also go on to purchase them. \\"In Bruges\\" contains fantastical insight into the \\"conscience of hitmen.\\" Additionally, it is set in the spectacular location of Bruges, Belgium. The plot twists continue to the very end, when every story thread is neatly tied into a secure knot. Purchase this film. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruges, a fairytale-like place?","review":"I caught the trailer for this film probably somewhere around a year ago at the theater and thought that the movie looked interesting but it didn't hit me as a must-see film at the time. After watching the movie I can tell the potential viewer that the trailer to this movie is misleading. I went into this movie very much expecting a comedy. But I would certainly say the dramatic elements of this film are more prevelant than the comedic ones.This film is more a character piece than anything else. When you watch this movie you will find a movie that analyzes psyches of men one of which is just entering the hitman business and another who is a veteran hitman.Watch this movie for the strong performances from all the actors and not for the action."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"You're an inanimate object!!!\\"","review":"What can I say? I loved this movie. I'm not a Colin Farrell fan but this dark comedy was bloody brilliant. The dialogue was so witty and full of offbeat and politically incorrect humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Contrived","review":"There are some very good things about this film. The acting, for one. The setting, for another. The cinematography, for a third. Maybe the music. But that's it. In all other respects, the movie fails. What, exactly, is it? A comedy? A tragedy? A spoof of gangster films? The jokes about \\"in Bruges\\" become stale. Fast. The \\"midget\\" jokes likewise. And, what is most disappointing, is that the plot is soooooooo contrived! Nothing happens as it would: it happens in a way that is convenient for the plot. Characters speak after they should by all accounts be dead (and this happens more than once). Somebody who is running for his life makes his body as large a target as possible for the killer chasing him. Everybody conveniently knows everybody else. Contrived. Unsatisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Been Better","review":"One of my favorite crime drama is Michael Caine's \\"Get Carter\\".This film is a good contender for that film.It is brutal, funny (Get Carter losing out), greatly written, directed and acted.I would recommend to anyone, except those who may not like it.Whoever they are, may God bless you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Rock-n-Roll","review":"Quality rock n roll from the late 80's,early 90's.'Crucify' is the best song.Check it out if you can get a copy of the cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hose Melted When Doing Sealer Job","review":"Worked for 30 minutes and then the hose melted throwing water proofing sealer every which way.

I would suggest you go to your favorite department store and be measured for a bra, most places will do this for free.

It's going back.The bra is thin with old fashioned pointed nipples. The material fails to stretch to adapt to breast dimensions, causing some areas to be too tight and others too loose. It felt uncomfortable (not too tight - just too rough) as soon as I put it on.Because it's a Bali, it's probably durable and would hold up over time better than cheaper bras but I just can't get over the positive reviews so I'm giving it only one star.For a better fitting and much more comfortable bra, try a Victoria's Secrets wireless cotton bra.

Most bras are challenged when it comes to supporting us, except this one. It is also very comfortable. You know it's on, but it never hurts.

More specifically, he has taken a number of liturgically important psalms, often only the liturgical selection of verses, and created psalm prayers in contemporary language and style. What is most impressive about this work is he has usually retained Biblical images, making these psalm prayers a school for the eventual praying of the psalms themselves.This is not to say that Haas' renderings are great poetry, but they are singable/chantable in the structure of the Liturgy of the Hours (i.e. they have antiphons, can be sung in unison or antiphonally ...).An example from Psalm 55: \\"If I had the winds of a dove, / I would fly away to safety. / I would fly far, / far away, / I would hide in the wilderness.\\"I recommend it as one of the best collections I have seen attempting to fulfil the \\"praying the psalms but not understanding the psalms as prayer\\" need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a rare paragon..","review":"What is that thing that makes you think you're in love? is it the touch that makes you quiver? is it the kiss? the look that gets through? the words untold? or are they the haunting memories which deepen with each secret encounter? maybe it is the journey of the heart that Groult sets off between the lines. the changing colors of the world. the feeling, the mood & the aura that sparkle on the skin, yet set the heart on fire. in order to discover the true -or your own- answer, you have to let the story unfold within you, open atop your own experiences. beware: the story may captivate you and can change your preconceptions for it's a blue breeze of love. a breeze that moves & rings new bells everytime you read.."},{"rating":"2","title":"read 5 years ago, still among one of my favorite books","review":"If you want to read about love, lust and passion expressed in beautiful writing don't waste your time, go ahead and buy this book.

Overall I thought the actors were pretty good and the \\"lake Monster\\" appropriately cheesy. I loved Shaggy singing By the Light of the Silvery Moon. My kids enjoyed it and so did I.

Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scooby Doo: Curse of the Lake Monster","review":"We love Scooby-Doo...But this was horrible. The acting was really bad.

(Not to mention, he was the only one who didn't come across like he was acting in a low-budget, made-for-Nickelodeon TV series.) (They were also not WRITTEN properly.) My sons, who ADORE Scooby Doo, kept asking, \\"Who are those people with Shaggy and Scooby?\\" And, when someone would say the names, they'd be like, \\"Nu-uh, that's not Daphne!\\" or \\"That's not Fred!\\" And, why bother hooking Fred and Daphne up and Shaggy/Velma up just to break them up? That's... that's just MEAN to the fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly done","review":"The movie is a failure! Actors are the same like from the previous movie and I don't like them. They don't fit with their fake looks and their acting. The CGI(animated) dog is bad, and humor is low. If I was in the movie, I'd never show my face in the public and never would go by the same name as in the credits. That was 1 hour and 22 minutes of a true waste of time. I doubt the money they earned from the previous movie was actually spend on the making of this movie. But the good part is that frog mutants at least looked O.K. and much better than the dog. I had no idea the movie would be so bad. It is not interesting and I consider it as a fail, because it delivers none of the good things from the cartoons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This Scooby-Doo was very bad.

Breath taking!!","review":"When I first heard Plus One, I was driving in my car w/my cousin and mother, and it just blew me away! Their music is just awsome!

I met them just a few days ago and they treated everybody just so incredibly SWEET! They are in it for God and just want to serve Him! They were just in a magizine, and they are just incredible guys! I really respect them! All the songs on the Promise are WONDERFUL! The songs just have great beats and wonderful lyrics about how God Loves you and will be right by you in hard and good times!

They like the sounds of Britney Spears, N'Sync, Christina Aguilera, and such. I was not pleased with the lyrics of these people's music. When my Christian bookstore suggested Plus One, I bought their CD immediately. I love Plus One. Their music is wonderful and uplifting; the lyrics are heartfelt, clean, and honorable to Jesus. I'm sure God is going to use these Christian men to bring their music to other parts of the music world. Watch out world! Plus One is coming your way and God is certainly with them. They will be around for a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally something I can listen to with my kids!","review":"I love there sound and content. It is so refreshing to hear 5 young boys not singing about sex,violence,drugs ect. I can listen with my four year old, and my pre-teen nieces.

Picking it up spontaneously for \\"Written on My Heart\\", I've marveled at tight vocal harmonies, exceptional ranges, peppy, motivating songs and lyrics that speak to worlds to me. I'm not one to go for the whole \\"boy band\\" thing, but this group of guys have garnered my respect. I would suggest slipping this in your teenager's CD player, and see if they don't love it more than 'NSync or the Backstreet Boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Promise plus one","review":"I like the songs but, I felt I was waiting for a love song I guess they sound too much as a rock group that kids listen to now. I guess that is the selling catch. But the songs were GREAT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plus One, A Minus!!","review":"Plus One's first CD, The Promise, is a good CD. It's not exactly the best one ever made by a boy band by my standards, but it's pretty well-done. Their smooth harmony and positive lyrics definitely make it a plus (haha!). While not all the songs you could classify as \\"religious\\" or \\"Christian\\", none have explicit lyrics or bad meanings.I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys listening to the Backstreet Boys, True Vibe, O-Town, 'N Sync, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plus One is the hottest shooting star in Christian music","review":"The CD is a must have for all Christian teens and young adults.The talent of these guys is astounding, purely God given.The group wants to change lives for the glory of God and not so much for themselves. Making money is not where it's at for them. The guys truly have the best interest of society in their hearts and this is inspiring rather than selling sex and dead end lyrics. Definitely buy this for CHRISTMAS presents for all the teens on your list."},{"rating":"1","title":"+1isokay","review":"Plus one is pretty good the first time you listen to it but after a while the beat and stuff gets to repetitave and it gets annoying to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptionally good looks and bang for buck.","review":"I love the style of this lamp, and it is surprisingly affordable (to me). I was one of those people who had some issue with assembling the product (even being forwarned by feedback here at Amazon); I did finally get a pair assembled. I'd gladly pay $10-$20 more (which is a significant percent of actual product cost) for: a) Even clearer instructions b) Slightly better pre-build assembly to verify the positions/interference of all tubes c) Slightly better/less-course threads for the tubes.The main thing though: These lamps are a very good bargain for their style and function."},{"rating":"2","title":"love the lights","review":"Great lamp. It is a bit tricky to set up, but with a tad of patience you will get it and it works very nicely. There is a built in reostat on the plug that will allow you to dim the lights to any range of light you want in the bulbs spectrum. The frosted glass gives the bulbs a nice look that is not blinding and the metal is of good quality, meaning that it is not thin or it does not have defects in the metal anywhere I could see. I will buy another one for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"It is the perfect height for what I needed and it is so beautiful. Not sure why people are having trouble putting it together, I didn't have any trouble at all. I don't know about the instructions because I didn't use them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disintegrated when I was assembling it","review":"I have returned this lamp because one of the electrical connections fell apart as I was assembling it. Specifically, the plastic covering of one of the connections of the electrical wires in one of the poles (which has to be screwed onto the base) simply fell off leaving a bare wire. Needless to say, I was not impressed with the quality of the product and will not be ordering another."},{"rating":"2","title":"lamp","review":"Nice lamp. Easy to assemble (5 minutes). The lamp also arrived with an extra globe and bulb...nice touch. The switch is a rheostat on the cord. The dimmer is nice, but would have been more useful if it were on the lamp base. Good quality. Quick ship and good packaging. Arrived undamaged. Very modern looking and with high intensity bulbs if the dimmer is all the way up, very bright, lots of light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"This lamp is awesome looking--very visually attractive!However, like other buyers, I found the assembly instructions to be less than helpful. And when I did put it together, I found that the bulbs only work when they want to which I find super inconvenient. If I'm reading in bed, and the bulbs decide to go out, I'm left with nothing. There's a slight buzzing sound coming from my lamp, too.Overall, I would probably not recommend this lamp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but not usable","review":"Although this lamp is very pretty, I had to return it because it was impossible to assemble correctly. The glass shades leaned on one another to the point that the shades were actually bowing. It would have been only a matter of time before the glass shades shattered from the pressure or exploded from the heat generated by the shades touching one another. Don't buy this lamp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic Main Street American Eats","review":"The book covers one or two sandwiches from each state with interesting period, black-and-white photos of street scenes, which are mostly from the 1920s - 1950s.

Given all the hoopla about Ms. Stewart's previous book, I picked this up with a tingle of anticipation. Boy, did that fade quickly!Her writing isn't that good, and the FBI -- including the unbelievably mixed-up hero and heroine -- came off looking like a bunch of stupid amateurs. The last third of the book would've never happened, since the investigators would've homed in on the location of the abducted women right away. I got the sense that the contrived ending was just so the heroine could be placed in jeopardy One More Time.I've read a lot of great romantic suspense, BLIND FAITH by Christianne Heggan leaps to mind, and this falls far short of \\"good.\\" I may look for her previous title in a used book store, but I won't pay money for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 Read from a 5 Star Author","review":"On the heels of THE BROWNED EYED GIRL, this new book by Ms Stewart was much anticipated and she didn't disappoint. The suspense was richly developed and believable. The story at times was alarmingly evil but then Ms Stewart is a master of evil suspense. The only draw back was a bit too much time was spent on back story for our couple, bogging the story down at times and it really wasn't needed ( hence no five star rating).It is hoped Ms Stewart will continue to develop stories rich with strong heroines and supportive heroes: be they contemporary love stories or her current trend toward evil suspense. Having been a fan of her earlier work, it is hoped she will continue to help set the standard in Romantic Suspense: few have her touch in developing heart stopping evil intent. You can't go wrong with any books by Ms Stewart. She deserves her growing body of fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous easy Jazz","review":"Excellent effort by the Harper Brothers, and what I believe was their sophomore album.

The new songs add depth and create a pleasant listening experence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice album, but not the original","review":"I used to own the original LP of Armenian Festival years ago, and I was very happy to see it available on Amazon; however, the album offered here is not the original, it's a combination of several LPs. There is a track missing from the original album and I don't know why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty standard","review":"I bought this disc after hearing one track that I liked and the samples seemed alright but after a few listens it's just sat on the shelf. Whereas after buying Leading Vision at the same time at Amazon's persistent recommendation with nothing to go on but the samples, I wound up enjoying and listening to my blind purchase much more. This CD has a few stand out guitar and drum solos but much less than many metal bands. Certainly more thrash than death metal. And as another reviewer stated, most tracks are almost indistinguishable from the others. I would not buy this again if I knew then..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please enter a title for your review","review":"half of odious mortem's stuff is the same rudimentary muted powerchord/single non-muted note back and forth all the lame metalcore bands do. the \\"technical\\" aspect is just a juvenile rejection of compositional flow. starting a new half-riff every 5 seconds is the opposite of complex. it's called jamming or messing around, it's what songwriters do before they commit to a particular riff and then build more stuff onto it. i'd call them a metal jam-band but they're anything but tight. the drummer and guitarist are both more interested in personal showboating than in complimenting what each other are playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must-have album","review":"I finally bought my own copy of this after the friend I kept buying it from said, \\"Enough.\\" The sound is classic alt-country (think Wilco, Jayhawks, Golden Smog, Son Volt, Uncle Tupelo et al), but I think these guys were doing it first. The lyrics are brilliant. Stupid Boy is without a doubt one of the best breakup songs ever written. (Well I'm sick and low-down, tired of love/And Lord, I can't believe it's true/You think after five years I would know you, but I don't/And after all this time, I've come to find/You're just another stupid boy.)

This set of books is a brilliant examination of American history through the understanding of those elements. Critical thinking skills are very important and this book combines them with a knowledge of events and the outcomes that shaped our country. I was given these books when I started home-schooling my daughter. Family events made it impossible for me to continue and I placed her back in public shcool. After 3 months I was so disappointed in the mediocrity of her social studies book, I found and bought these on my own. This summer I'm going to teach both my children from these books.

Illustrations are of poor quality.For instance, the author describes \\"what pulls search engine rankings down\\" in Chapter 6.

However, the author fails to provide the readers with any suggestions here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book for Newbies....","review":"I ordered this book without having read the excerpts that are now posted on Amazon. I was pretty disappointed. I should note that I work on search engine performance issues as a part of my job. Passages of the book are totally out of date and useless - example being the pay-for-click section dealing with goto.com (which is now out of business).

Many other techniques (like yahoo shopping) were also not mentioned in other books.I was not a dummy for internet marketing after reading couple of other books on the same subject. But this is the first book that has helped me to be a pro with getting higher rank in search engines.Worth the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is thin in all respects","review":"I was amazed when this book arrived. Not only does it look like someone printed it on a 'third world' printing press but it wasn't even spell checked. This book has some basic overviews of what search engines desire but doesn't reference any websites that have been successful following this advice. Each topic receives a cursory overview with marginal examples. This book is a simple overview with no in depth information.For example, maybe 50% of websites out there are developed using MS FrontPage and not one word in this book describes how to use this development environment to promote FrontPage created websites. There is a strong bias that one should focus on Yahoo as the major website promotion forum but fails to mention that this is a 'pay as you play' listing directory that defeats the intended 'Do It Yourself' audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very basic","review":"This book is so basic as to be unbelievable. It is also incredibly badly written ... if I was offered the option to publish it through my publishing company ... I would have rejected it without even reading more than the first 10 pages.Although not certain, the book looks and feels as though it is self-published ... the diagrams are all poor quality and unclear and the whole book is printed on A4 paper.If it was possible to give minus stars this would get -5 ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth the price, but not much information","review":"This appears to be a good little reference for getting vendor links as to where to purchase inexpensive promotion-related-web services for the do-it-yourself-er. My reading is that the author has tried many of these services, and offers some tips on which ones are qualified.It is not much of a book though, as its 100 pages can easily be compacted to 50, since the publisher uses double and triple line spacing. It's not an introduction for the beginner because it's too skimpy. A beginner is probably best served by first reading other books about promotions and then gathering tips from this book on how to cut costs. The techniques presented are accurate and elementary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"I can't go lower than one star or I would. Clearly English is not the author's first language. While this is ok, it makes the book awkward to read. It also seems that proof reading and editing were not his strong point either.

They are known for low cost and, surprise!, low quality.)The DVD recorder was supposed to let you burn video source materials onto DVD blanks, but as much as I tried I couldn't get it to work. About 30 seconds after I pressed Record it would give this vibrating noise and then eventually I had to unplug it. The exterior of the recorder also does not inspire confidence at all: one of the buttons on the front didn't quite work.Seriously, save yourself the money and buy something that works, like the popular Panasonic DMR-E55S or DMR-E55K.

It's more comprehensive in my opinion, expanding across both early and late Tull, than any other best of collection.If you want to get a taste of a great band you've never heard before, or if you've heard Tull, but only his early stuff, as I've heard many people claim, this is the way to go.Although the first disk is a lot of Tull's earlier and more familiar songs, it isn't in any way better than the second one. Both cover different styles of Tull, and give a great all around effect. The music is crisp and clear.Also of note, the Songs from the Woods on this cd is longer than the title track on the original album. They added about an extra minute and a half of Barre and Anderson soloing, and it sounds great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jethro Tull's Career in a box set","review":"This box set covers everything and the sound is excellent with remastered versions of the classics.

It broke after one year anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFECTIVE, DISSAPOINTING PRODUCT","review":"The thought of having a so called quality \\"Hansgrohe\\" product that is defective after less than a month is truly a surprising and irritating experience. I would recommend to steer away clear off this product. It looks good, Yes, but far from being durable. Paying almost $40 for something that does not even last more than a month is a complete dissappointment - I feel cheated. The rubber end hose connecting to the handshower broke or was peeled off. It appeared the glue/adhesive wore off. By any means, this product should have not pass the QA at Hansgrohe. I'm quite surprised that manufacturer released this defective product to the market. QUITE SHAMEFUL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not fit my needs","review":"Originally, my bathroom did not have a hand shower. The shower head was sticking out above my head on an angled chrome pipe. I used an adapter to hook up this hose and a hand shower - a very common arrangement. In this arrangement, both ends of the hose are close together above one's head, and the hose makes a loop that hangs along the bathroom wall. I prefer the loop of the hose to be flexible enough to hang freely and and not to curve inside the bathtub.This is not the case with this hose. It curves into the bathtub a little, and when I take a shower, I can sometimes touch it. I do not like touching the hose. I bought Whedon \\"Metal-Stretch Shower Hose\\" instead - and I am happy with it so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not big-box store junk","review":"This hose will last you a lifetime.

Davie is one of the most unusual and inspiring books you're ever likely to come across.Unusual because the book combines most aspects of a business book with a coffee table book that's heavy on both pictures and text.Inspiring because much of the content concerns the life stories of highly successful people who pulled themselves up by their bootstraps to become rich and influential.Of particular interest is the story of Michael G. DeGroote who immigrated to Canada as a child, barely spoke any English, dropped out of school at age 14 and landed his first job - hauling manure to Southern Ontario tobacco farms. From these humble beginnings, DeGroote went on to acquire and build Laidlaw into a multi-billion-dollar giant, then sold his shares to move to Bermuda and begin a new empire in the sun. All in all, a very inspiring, thought-provoking book. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that scary to be a evil spirit","review":"In the begginig it keeps you in suspense when a security guard knows about something evil is trapped behind a wall which noises comes out.People come to this building that's abandoned and one of them release this evil spirit and starts killing.Some scenes with some special effects are not that bad.The problem with this movie when the evil spirit gets in a form of a person,he's not scary at all.I really didn't enjoy it that much,doesn't mean it's that bad,i seen worst.Probally it's a movie you want to see one time and never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very bad movie.","review":"This movie was showing on my cable company's video on demand and the plot summary enticed me and my friends into paying $3.95 to rent it.

Because chemicals weren't an option, we opted for the most humane option: fly ribbons.Overall, it's a simple, effective product. The only difficult part was extracting the ribbon.The fly infestation was localized to one bedroom, so we quarantined the area with a single full-spectrum light source. You'll notice (in the video) that a lamp was placed under the tape; this was done to exploit the fly's attraction to light.TIPS:1) Perhaps the type of light bulb used made a difference in attracting more flies to the product.2) If the ribbon detaches from either its container or the plastic tip, use a thumbtack to pin it to a wall (as seen in the video).3) Place the ribbons in areas prone to swarms.As of today, our home is fly free!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for strong willed children!","review":"Found this book years ago.

If anything, they have pushed forward even more. After the Decline, which bridged the gap between So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes and this release, was a punk masterpiece. I think that Pump up the Valuum just adds to this greatness. The entire album is a joy to listen to, front to back. From \\"Take Two Placebos and Call Me Lame\\" to the polka tune, \\"Theme From a NOFX Album,\\" the CD keeps you listening the whole time. People complain that some of the tunes are too slow.

I honestly dont think I have ever heard a worse album in my life. I love NOFX and I have all of there CD's. Valium is so different. I felt like it was childish and foolish. They must be getting too old or something. I honestly want to cry now that I have heard this CD. I would not recomend this CD to any one.

Thankfully there are reviewers out there like beardedwindbreaker who see modern punk music for what it is-a complete joke and waste of time. I am sick of how many people my age worship NOFX like they are the second coming of Christ. If anything, they represented the moment when punk rock truly died and became a boring parody of itself. They have inspired so many worthless punk bands that couldn't make punk music with substance to save their lives. Punk rock has been dead since the '80s.

Grass' creativity is astounding, with the she-rat and the space ship, but portions of the plot with Grimm fairytale characters are somewhat annoying. Oskar turns up, along with others. It's difficult to imagine someone staying with this book long enough to meet him if they hadn't already read Tin Drum. Here, Grass has taken the post-modernist position of the teller and chats away. The books in which he shined weren't chatty at all. The sections of the \\"plot\\" don't meld together as they do in, say, the Flounder. Some books bring tears when finished. One simply doesn't want it to end. I managed to finish the Rat, but just put it back on the shelf.

I had read a different translation in high school, and I was expecting pretty much the same thing. However, I found that Mason goes into much more detail and focuses mainly on the hero of the story, Gilgamesh: his transformation into a more mortal man, his struggle with his own humanity, what inspired him to begin his journey, and the beauty of his coping mechanisms as he learns and realizes the difficulties of love and friendship. Mason's version of Gilgamesh is ultimately a story of the journey of realizing, accepting, and growing in one's humanity. It is a timeless tale of both the difficulties and the beauty of the human condition. I recommend this book, but give the warning to do your best not to read too literally and just take things at face value, but attempt to understand the meaning behind the words. Happy reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not At All What I Expected","review":"This CD was not at all what I expected. I actually misread the fact that this was a Bluegrass Tribute to Little Big Town, and thought that it was a Greatest hits album for the band. I still gave it a chance and started listening. Within a song and a half on the CD, I had thrown it in the floorboard! Not only is this pretty much a note for note copy of their songs on the banjo, and with no lyrics, but there is virtually no variation on the music as you would expect from a tribute CD.

A friend of mine who's big into stuff like Uncle Tupelo and its offspring gave this CD a listen and was instantly converted into a Yoakam fan. I think the stripped down versions on here are as good if not better than a lot of the other versions of the same songs. The acoustic Readin', Rightin', Rt 23. on here is heads and shoulders better than the other versions I've heard. The acoustic treatments also gave me more of an appreciation of the fact that Yoakam has his roots in the likes of Ralph Stanley and old mountain acoustic music as well as Bakersfield and Buck Owens.

It's beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Dwight CD","review":"This entire cd was great; it actually was the initial cd that turned me on to Dwight. Since then I have purchased or obtained every Dwight cd that I could get my hands on - most of them containing a song from this cd. The last track, Guitars, Cadillacs, was really good; it was just his voice, no guitar or anything. I thought that was a great addition to the many times he's performed and recorded that song, and it was a great final song for this awesome cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"No words are apt enough to describe this cd.","review":"After watching \\"Walk The Line,\\" I became very interested and passionate about country music and I was led,(thankyou God), to the music of Mr.Yoakam.This CD is blissfully heartbreaking in the true Irish sense of the word.I love the sincerity in his sad, sad beautiful voice.

Only one of the 25 songs is not original. Little Sister is borrowed from Elvis, good company. dwightyoakamacoustic.net showcases Yoakam's gift for writing songs of love-loss and abandonment that retain the dignity and confidence of a man.

My only wish is for a dvd of the recording sessions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"A fellow loaned this to me this summer and I instantly loved it.

I've seen quite a few artists perform songs acoustic in concert and it is always moving and intamate.

Raw talent. BUY THIS ALBUM!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dwight Unplugged!","review":"This is NOT a greatest hits album.... I got my copy today and it is terrific. Especially with headphones. It's just Dwight and his acoustic guitar... similar to the \\"American Recordings\\" that Johnny Cash recorded in Rick Rubin's living room.

C'mon, Dwight, give us some new stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back porch music","review":"My only complaint about Dwight Yoakam's CDs through the years is what I feel to be over-producing of some songs. The instrument tracks are laid on top of each other, sometimes thicker than peanut butter.This CD, a must-have for any Dwight Yoakam fan, goes the opposite direction. It is just Dwight and his guitar, and the result is very pleasing. This is pure hillbilly music. My only request would have been to add a stand-up bass and a snare for some tracks, but maybe next time.If Dwight Yoakam came to your house for a BBQ and brought his guitar, this is what is would sound like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best","review":"I don't know where Dwight will go from here as this is without doubt his best work to date. With over 70 minutes of his old hits Dwight has made them all sound even better with just an acoustic guitar.

This is Dwight pared down to just him and his six string. The songs are the same, but the sound is pure and honest. The blues of Fast As You and It Only Hurts Me when I Cry are straight from a front porch in Mississippi, Buenas Noches from a Lonely Room brings mariachis to mind, and Lonesome Roads is so mournful it hurts. Pete Anderson's California Tele work is missing here, but not missed. I for one will enjoy this until Dwight writes (and Pete produces) some more new, original stuff. Which reminds me -- new, original stuff is just as rare in Nashville as solo acoustic guitar albums are.

It will not shut off, either, when \\"stop scan\\" is clicked. To do a full sweep it takes several hours, over 6 and still sweeping, and in the meantime the computer is locked up, and you can't do anything else.

Backgrounds are age-yellowed; the drafting, composition, and coloration are impressive for unknown amateurs (again, ladies were considered charming dabblers).The cover (printed same as the shiny DJ, with a bit of an incongruous linen-texture finish that will nevertheless wear well) is done in fancy marbled paper/leather-tipping simulation -- a great \\"old time\\" look for the country decorated sunroom table, etc. Nice peek into a bygone era!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Xymox Gets Trendy","review":"This is certainly a departure for gothic rock band Xymox, formerly Clan of Xymox. The band trades in their usual gothic sound for something a lot more commercial and trendy. Released in the early 1990's, the album reflects the dance music popular in clubs and on MTV at the time. I almost expect Downtown Julie Brown from Club MTV to come barging in. I enjoy that kind of music but Xymox comes off sounding like the second-rate dance artists of that time. There is not a single memorable song on the album. None of the songs are really that bad. They just don't stand out. For that I give them 3 stars and took away a star for trying to cash in on the trend of that time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very poor showing","review":"Ah yes the nightmare Ronny Moorings doesn't want to see or hear of again. I can understand - this is dreadful stuff. Well OK I'm being a bit cruel. But the songs sound so tuneless that it's horrible to believe that this is the same band who would make A Day and Your Vice - then again I suppose technically it's not since the band has changed many times. I think this must be the point where Anka moved out and Mojca came in on the next album. But there tends to be a total lack of depth in the music ( I was going to say originality but even at their greatest Xymox were never the most original in terms of music but were enjoyable ).You probably have to be an utter diehard to enjoy this at all. But then maybe all Xymox fans are a little diehard"},{"rating":"2","title":"A seminal and informative primary source","review":"With Workin' On The Railroad: Reminiscences From The Age Of Steam, Richard Reinhardt presents a compendium of firsthand accounts and stories of engineers, brakemen, porters, conductors, section men, round house workers, and many more of the oft-overlooked contributors to the construction of American railroads in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

There was no blantant \\"Jesus is Lord\\", rather there was a simple statement (much like in life) that you can easily find the Lord--and you don't have to look hard.From the start of this album--the simple Psalm 1, to the wonderfully clear \\"Testimony\\", to the last track of a troubled marriage \\"Unspoken Love\\" this album flows with a crispness that marks Kim's early works.This album is a wonderful addition to any collection. I really enjoyed it.My wife has been on a few women's retreats where Kim's powerful rendition of Proverbs 31:30 \\"Charm is Deceitful\\" sets the mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"While the photo album is adorable - there is much confusion about how many you are actually ordering and what color.

With the exception of \\"Super Password,\\" I enjoyed every televised version of the show. The \\"Password\\" episode of \\"The Odd Couple\\" is one of my all time TV favorites. You may have guessed, I like the game.This DVD version is, for all intent and purpose, just an over-produced variation on the standard home version. Instead of the cards and holders, you get a pair of 3-D looking glasses. Unfortunately, you can easily read the secret password on the screen without the glasses. And, the computer generated host (Charmin' Chuck Harmin) is just about as annoying a host as they could come up with.Endless Games has produced many good home games. DVD games, at least going by this one, do not fit into their business model quite as well. Save yourself some money and get their standard edition \\"Password\\" game. It's not as high-tech. But it's a lot more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"When we opened the box (which is a normal game-sized box), we were a little surprised to see that there was nothing in it but a DVD and a couple of cheap pairs of 3D glasses. We were even more surprised when, after putting in the DVD to check it out, we discovered that you didn't even need the 3D glasses to make out the word on the TV screen. It is easily readable without the glasses.

The dialogues are treatises on various interesting questions, such as what is love, virtue, etc.... The style of the texts are based on the Socratic method of asking questions and use of analogy to test an hypothesis. This gives the texts the style of mysteries as you follow the twists and turns of the arguments to get to the conclusion. Socrates is often the protagonist guiding the reader so it also gives the texts a sense of biography.This collection contains probably the best works, and Rouse's translation is clear and easy to read. Enjoyable, entertaining, mind-opening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick","review":"Beautiful translation, the timeless texts of Plato -but delivered in tiny print without many notes.

I recommend doing business with this member."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great translation and annotations","review":"There is little to say about this publication that has already been stated. However, I would like to point out that the inclusion of 'Ion' is a bit baffling. I would not classify it a 'great' dialogue in the vein of even other early works by Plato, e.g. the 'Protagoras', 'Phaedrus' or 'Euthyphro', and certainly does not match up to the 'Timaeus', 'Parmenides', or 'Theaetetus', all of which could have just as well earned a place in this compilation. Its inclusion is perhaps justifiable to provide new readers with a quick 'introductory' dialogue to acquaint themselves with the Socratic process, but one would ask why the publishers would try to grab readers this way: shouldn't the dialogues speak for themselves?Regardless, the translation and annotation is excellent for the beginning and intermediate reader of Plato, and Signet books are typically of high material quality to begin with, so this may be the best paperback Plato on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"Smith rehashes plot themes of her A Place to Call Home, a much sweeter, more believable romance, in this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Favorite by Deborah Smith","review":"Years ago I read Blue Willow.

When I saw this one, I thought why not? I am glad I did download this Kindle freebie. I was pleased with it, and although it took a bit of reading to get into it, I couldn't put it down and really enjoyed it. I would have liked to see Darl have more happier moments in her life as an adult. She was always so sad and bitter about the past, reasonably so. I loved the sense of family and tradition in all the branches of family. It doesn't have too much cussing, and just a handful of mild sex scenes. I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading - and thoroughly enjoying - several books by Deborah Smith (most notably \\"A Place to Call Home\\"), I would tell anyone interested in this ofering from Ms. Smith not to bother. In fact, had this been the first book I had ever read by her, I would have struck her off my \\"Authors to look for\\" list entirely. The book is predictable, banal and I struggled to get through to the last page. And that's not mentioning the lapses in time-sequence, the jumbled and flawed heirarchy of characters, and the typos that are part of this frustrating story to boot.Bottom line - if you're looking for a good read, don't go looking in The Stone Flower Garden."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four Stars","review":"The Stone Flower Garden: A Novel is a wonderful book by Deborah Smith. The plot of the book is typical Smith: girl and boy meet at a young age...boy and girl get seperated at a young age...and meet again when they are adults and reconnect emotionally and romantically. Sounds simplistic but Smith is, as with TSFG, always able to make you see beyond the prediction by creating appealing characters through impressive writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"I read this because it was a free Kindle book, but I wouldn't bother again.

Really all this is a mario game. Even die hard mario fans (like my brother) will be dissapointed. All you do is go into doors and kill enimeis then go into more doors, it gets boring after awhile. Another thing, you can only have ONE save which means if you have siblings and they wanna play you'll have to share a file. this game also gets old VERY fast too!Some + sides are:good musicsound effects from many of the mario gamesgoomba's!All in all i wouldn't really buy this game i'd personaly just rent it or even download it.there's some good emulator sites out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Esy and Fun Game To Play","review":"My 10 year old daughter plays this game and really likes it.

It has good graphics and over thirty boards of gameplay. You play through a level until you beat the boss(you have to get stars to open doors by killing all the enemies in the room.) after you beat the boss a cannon appears where you can choose your next level. You get used to the unorthodox hitting system. A lot of this game relies on precise hitting which i don't like.Not much to say really about this game, but you should probably get it if you like pinball games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Mario Game???","review":"I remember seeing a preview for this game and thinking that this game was going to be like the pokemon pinball games but with better graphics but when i put this game into my gameboy advance i was shocked by how bad it was. The real problem with the game is that the level desigen is very un inspired and its so easy for you to die because of the level lay out. Also its just not that fun of a pinball game. Hopefully Nintendo will learn from there mistakes and actually a good pinball game next time*PS* If you are looking for a good pinball game check out Kirby's Pinball for the original gameboy. While it might not look better than this game its the best pinball game EVER!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The controls aren't tight enough.","review":"For the upside, it's one of the better handheld pinball games out there. It ain't bad... but the controls could be A LOT better. If you've played Metroid Prime Pinball, and then tried to go back to this one, you're going to be sadly disappointed. Using the flippers and attempting to move Mario to certain places on the screen can be irritating. This is truly one of those games I'd rather just cheat on from the beginning instead of being frustrated with the wobbly controls in trying to do what I need to do.Not particularly recommended unless you just love Mario or pinball games in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Game","review":"This game is not a good game at all. First of all there is a horilble storyline. The ball is hard to manuver and fall out quickly. And finally when you turn it off it automatically deletes the file.

Not once did I have to help him figure something out (which is wonderful since it's hard for me to figure these things out). THere is nothing violent or objectional with this game. it's just fun.I can't be critical about the graphics or music or any of that stuff...none of that is important to us at this stage of our lives. It's just a fun game that is very easy for a young child to play. And it's a game that a mom can feel good about her kid playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mario Pinball Land","review":"First of all, Horace Doyal's review is completely untruthful. He said that he couldn't load his game if he just shut it off, and if you had half a brain, you'd read the instruction manual, which clearly states that you must save the game before you turn it off if you want to load that game again. Also, saying that Nintendo should be ashamed of this game is very ignorant and rude, because when Nintendo came out with the NES and the first game ever(Mario Bros.) it pretty much started the evolution of video games. Plus, it's a PINBALL GAME, so how could you say that the rules of pinball don't apply? Sure, the levels are short, but how fun can you make pinball? I think Nintendo has done a nice job with the game, making pinball as exciting as it's going to get. I think it was brilliant to take a twist from the usual Mario game to turn it into pinball. I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes pinball and likes Mario."},{"rating":"1","title":"As the others said it's true will not stay up on your knee!!!","review":"Very disappointing but true it would not stay up on my knee I would put it as tight as possible and it would be down around my ankle after a minute or two so I returned it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"satisfied","review":"I am a very large person with knee problems, I purchased this item for it's size which I am very satisfied with overall.

It took me about 1/2 an hour to figure out how to add them, and I am usually pretty good with item assembly. I recommend buying two or three extender panel kits if you have a small child because they will need room in which to move around.

It talks about women performing different sex acts-WOW! These women don't perform anything that most married women perform, only difference is, they are performing these sex acts with total strangers! It doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out that erotic labor can be complex, downgraded by society or considered by some people as prostitution, but in this day and age, everything is pretty much acceptable. The book contains about 50 interviews with men and women in the sex industry, all which give basically the same story, the same experiences, the same gains and the same regrets. I read this book hoping to get some useful insight into the adult industry, but I didn't. The book talks about sex acts that, we are not only familiar with, but as adult people we too perform these sexual acts, just not in front of a screen.

This is shabby treatment for a piece of classic literature. Very disappointing. Will have to look elsewhere now that I've returned my copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun Saturday","review":"I can easily understand why this book was banned for a long time. It is...explicit. But because it was written 2 centuries ago, the descriptions are far from crass and you have to read some sections twice to make sure that what you thought just happened really did happen.That having been said, I think this book is a classic, and not just a literary \\"curiosity\\" for one simple reason: it portrays sex as something good despite the fact that Fanny is clearly repentant of her past ways. I went into this book expecting a tale of woe, but that aspect of it was only weakly attempted. In short: promiscuity is undesirable, but the sexual act itself is not some kind of horrible sin. This is surprising for a book written in that time, and thus breaks certain boundaries which make it worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first and still the best","review":"This is perhaps the most elegantly written erotic novel of all time.

I usually don't even give up on books, but this one was an exception. Ellen was one of those classic tomboys who just wants to like her daddy and grandpa. How original is that. She just happens to also live on a ranch where she just acts like the real cowboy. Wow. I'm not saying that Ellen couldn't be that way, but she could of been less one-dimensional (just like many of the other characters in SURVIVAL! and American Diaries, the latter not as much). Her Grandpa gets hurt so she has to think up some crazy plan using all these ranch equipment pieces that people from the nineties could really care less about. The description where she was trying to move her grandpa (about five million chapters long) drove me so crazy I just had to stop. Try reading one of the first American Diaries books, they have more on the character of the person and less historical mumbo jumbo (and don't get me wrong, I love history!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less useful than I thought it would be.","review":"Was told to buy this by advisor when starting grad school.

Is that the best of your collective efforts?So, with that grabber of an opener, the reader is treated to an oddly reverent discussion on APA style. As the other reviewers stated, it isn't a reference in any form. I suppose, if one were really, really committed to the APA style they could wade through this book and learn the in's and out's of the style. Outside of a class specifically on that topic, I can't imagine anyone spending the time to complete the lessons.So, I will purchase a reference book and learn an important lesson on reading the book description carefully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time.","review":"I do not recommend this book unless you have no clue about APA. If, you are somewhat familiar with using APA style in your research papers, do not bother to purchase it. You can glean the same information from the actual 5th ed. of the APA manual. Check with your reference librarian at you college or university. They may be able to provide you with handouts that may actually be more useful. Therefore, I did not find this book user friendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mastering APA Style: Students Workbook and Training Guide","review":"While this appears to be an excellent textbook, it was not a helpful resource to those looking for information on citing various references and sources.

Hardly","review":"Some people like this live Rach 3 performance from 1978, because it is so 'full of profound feeling'. For me, though, Horowitz exaggerates everything so much that it becomes almost unbearable. The deluge of wrong notes, a piano that sounds like nail-scratching-blackboard, much unnecessary banging and an uninspired support from Ormandy's NYPhO make for a performance that will not whet everyone's appetite. Also included: a sonata that sounds more like a Horowitz encore than Rachmaninov. Try Ashkenazy/Fistoulari, Andsnes/Berglund or just about anything else for a better 3rd concerto."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horowitz ...","review":"For those missing a Rachmaninoff 3rd Piano Concerto in their collection, start with Reiner/Horowitz or this one, Ormandy/Horowitz. Horowitz was perhaps _the_ interpreter of this particular concerto, and at least the two above mentioned recordings are must-haves.The Rach 3rd belongs in the canon of best Piano Concertos, and Horowitz gives it the warmth and weight it deserves. Really, if you are a piano enthusiast, you just can't go wrong here. The sound quality of this CD may be less than optimal for people demanding absolute crispness, but I'm not fussy when it comes down to such technicalities.The eight or so other reviews here are splendid, so I'm not going to repeat things to the point where they become numbing. I recommend this CD without reservations."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Best Test Preparation for the GRE Psychology Test","review":"After taking the GRE, I realize that this book did not help me in my preparations.

Also, to my chagrine, the book did not have any review outlines in it - an essential part of test preparation."},{"rating":"1","title":"THUMBS DOWN!","review":"All that this book contains are practice tests, which although helpful, are not sufficient review material. There is no review section, and answers to questions are not well explained, despite what the author's might think.

As well, the test questions are not broken down into subtests, even for scoring purposes, so they are of little diagnostic help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Total waste of money. Here's why:1. This book provides no review material whatsoever. It consists of a couple tests and a CD-Rom which has the SAME tests.2. The answers to the test questions are not thorough. Reading over 200 answers will not help you learn the material well, as the questions and information are in random order. This is a very inefficient way to study and difficult for consolidating new information.3. The GRE Psychology test is paper written. I wish I knew before I bought this so-called review book with its CD-rom. It is important to practice taking the test in the format it will be given in.4. Buy a Kaplan Guide--they're cheaper anyway.

Unfortunately it is only the first 12 episodes. my own mistake. However, when I opened the package I noticed that the back of all the DVD cases were gouged into, which as a DVD collector is extremely upsetting to me. In addition to this, when I removed the plastic wrapping from the DVD's I found that one of the corners on disc one was busted and plastic pieces had fallen into the case.

Yes all the remote controllers work and it has music, ect. but it doesn't have a lot of give in the fabric so when you place your baby in the bouncer you have to keep your eyes locked on them the entire time they're in the bouncer. Our baby doesn't sink down in the bouncer enough for me to feel safe leaving her in it. In fact the two times I tried putting her in it she leaned to one side and I felt she may fall out of it (at 3 weeks old this should not happen). I have another bouncer that isn't nearly as fancy but the fabric is sewn in a way so that she does sink down in the bouncer more therefore she's more comfortable and so am I knowing she's much safer. We got this bouncer on sale but I wish we wouldn't have spent our money on it in the first place as it's going to be donated to goodwill the next time I take a trip there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Bouncer Please Read Before you Buy","review":"I purchased this bouncer for my baby girl.

Honestly, I don't know why this movie works. For sure its not because of the unoriginal plot. Hollywood can do stylized over-the-top action sequences, but they just aren't the same as this movie. I don't know what it is, but somehow it works. The chemistry between Vincent Cassel and Monica Bellucci (gorgeous by the way) is awesome. Along with Tcheky Karyo, this movie has an all-star cast.

If any symphonic work was meant to give the term \\"derivative\\" a good name, this g-minor Symphony might do the trick.

The only saving grace comes from Liberty, which has a slightly more interesting backbeat, and Beyond the Fray, which is faster and more interesting than the rest of the CD. The vocals on this CD make for great mixing potential and would sound great laid on top of drum 'n' bass (a la THC).Conclusion: Check out Morcheeba or Kruder & Dorfmeister instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead End Move","review":"Trickle retains little feel of the original emotion in the lyrics from Extra Virgin. Definetely an album engineered for a different audience than its predecesor. Fans of Extra Virgin should expect dissapointment.

But I had a good feeling about \\"Trickle.\\" I'm glad I bought it, because it's just as good as the first album. I love the sultry sounds they brought into the album, like \\"Indulge Me\\" and \\"Smile.\\" It's a really enjoyable album that varies with its pulsing beats and sweet sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat, Colorless Sophmore Effort","review":"I was compelled to buy this album after hearing the sensational Acid & Skribble remix of \\"I'm Not in Love\\" at a dance club, plus I liked a couple of the tracks on the first Olive album. Boy, was I disappointed. Not a single song here is worthy of radio play. Nothing's catchy, nothing's beautiful (except the singing). I hate to be so harsh, but I really think it was a waste of studio time and plastic, easily the weakest album I've bought all year."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRICKLED DOWN TO A MERE DRIP.","review":"Olive last cd \\"Extra Virgin\\" was a 4 star electronic dance wizardry.....Now we have \\"Trickle\\" which is definitely that, a mere trickle of average electronic beats, and disco flash.Their first single \\"I'm Not In Love\\" is at the top of the club play scene, however this is a remake of a classic, which shows no comparison to the original.When a group comes out with a new album and their first single is a remake classic i.e. Ace of Base \\"Cruel Summer\\", you know you have a poor compilation on your hands if the first single cannot be original music.The rest of the songs continue with the same mundane sound through the whole entire album with \\"Trickle\\", \\"Love Affair\\", etc. Unfortunately the dismal remake of the classic \\"I'm Not In Love\\" is the really only high point on this album.I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it is not absolute trash.A fair CD at best, I say pick up \\"Extra Virgin\\" and skip this electronic bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing 'everything but the girl' rip-off","review":"Despite being praised widely in the media, Olive are very dull! This CD limps along at a very slow pace with cliched songs and generic beats. Only their classic cover of 'I'm not in love' shows any shine. I rarely write bad music reviews, but this CD was a disappointment. Buy everything but the girl's 'Walking wounded' instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely disappointed","review":"After lovingly and repeatedly listening to \\"Extra Virgin,\\" I was completely taken aback by their vapid and styleless follow-up record \\"Trickle.\\" And also very surprised to log on here and find such generous reviews from other listeners. Did no-one see the difference in quality here? Perhaps it's due to a different producer (which they must have had with the switch of record labels), but where are all the little drum and bass details from Extra Virgin that are lost here? This is what separated Olive from the the host of other electronica groups with pop crossover written all over their debut albums. The only thing that saves this record is Ruth Ann's vocals, which are, for the most part, submerged beneath an unaccentuated wash of keyboards with no distinguishable melody. And for a great version of \\"I'm Not In Love,\\" check out the Pretender's version, which has a terrific vocal, and a subtle backing track that isn't lost in post-production."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best songs of 2001: SMILE","review":"The whole album is mesmerizing and without a fault.

If they let this one stand, I'll just say that my wife and I were utterly outraged that the seemingly adoption-friendly description on the DVD cover turning into anti-religious faith bigotry. Anyone who has any sense of traditional morality, especially that rooted in the wisdom centuries of religious faith, should avoid this movie.

But it was quite the opposite and I was quite wrong - instead, I found a wonderful work of art that was so genuine and full of the realistic subtleties of life. It was totally captivating and had such heart! I cared about the characters and their often flawed, yet deeply felt emotional responses to the great challenges in their lives. I can't believe I knew nothing of this film until a few months ago. I don't remember its theatrical release at all! It just makes me wonder how so many terrible films can make their way into theatres, while little gems like LOGGERHEADS disappear into oblivion. Go figure....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately disappointing","review":"This film had a lot of potential--interesting premise, compelling characters and a strong cast--but something keeps it from gelling into a satisfying story. There's a flatness to the film that is probably the fault of the director. The above-average cast, that includes the wonderful Bonnie Hunt, Michael Learned and several other very likable young actors, seems squandered somehow by a lackluster dialogue and unrelenting low key tone. The redemption that this viewer wanted to see emerge from the script at the conclusion didn't quite make it. A pity as, despite the film's continuing weaknesses, I wanted more than melancholy for its lead characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"This deserved a happy ending.","review":"I like happy endings, but when it comes to have a sad one, I do like a good reason for the non-happy ending.

There's no romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Treasure Uncovered","review":"George Scarbrough is one of our narrative treasures, and with TELLICO BLUE's republication we are again reminded of how he started out as a poet over half a century ago. This poet has a strangely wonderful diction in which he twines the vernacular with the formal, the observant with the speculative. His isolation has saved him from faddishness and foppery -- he wouldn't have much use for a creative writing exercise, much less a workshop -- and he is an original from sole to crown. Imagine Paddy Kananaugh without the Dublin literary partisanship, or Robert Penn Warren without the Fugitive amalgamation! I strongly recommend starting with this book and feasting on as much Scarbrough as you can lay your eyes across."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviews","review":"I really get tired of rating all my purchases and makess me almost want to stop making purchases.

While the color and Dora picture make it a pretty looking chair, it is not stable at all. When my daughters were climbing in and out it continuously collapsed. Causing them to fall. Also the rivits that are used to attach the legs to the black plastic feet are very loose. Making me think they will break fairly easy. The cup holder is also very small. It could not fit a regular sippy cup.

There's almost no autobiographical information in it.Having read both, I would say this has been completely blown out of the water by the 4e Dungeon Master's Guide, whose wealth of sage counsel on this topic makes Gygax look like a neophyte.

This is a total non-understanding of the situation and adds to the guilt of the smaller sister in this case. Unbelievable how an author can put things the ways she did.

In fact, everyone in this production seems to be trying to avoid the obvious -- IT'S AN OPERA! They all look like they are trying to pretend that they are speaking rather than singing.

It's just your typical sorority house boob-fest with a lot of unknown actresses and actors. The only familiar actor I've seen in this film was Danny Bonaduce (from The Partridge Family).Lots of topless nudity, adding hope to all that atrocious bad acting from every character. But still, I'd never miss a cheesy, campy, ditzy girls-gone-wild eye-candy film to kill some time on my weekends while having a few beers.It's up there (well, maybe down there) with Pom Pom Girls, The Van, and the such for typical low budget politically incorrect \\"babe fests\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny as All Get-out","review":"I think most of the people who reviewed this missed the point--it's hilarious.

I am fan of those movies from the good ol' 70s with big racks, but this is garbage. The scene where Danny Bonaduche (spelling?) cant get it up is an instant classic of how not to act.

HOTS provides neither. There isn't nearly enough nudity to justify the price (it barely qualifies as soft-core porn), and, to make matters worse, there isn't a single humorous scene--excepting, perhaps, the initial spectacle of ex-Partridge family member Danny Bonaduce as the lead singer of a college band. And in any event, the DVD is very grainy--a big disappointment given the glossy cover art.If this film were a freebie, maybe it would be worth the trouble of fast-forwarding through the few topless scenes. But, really, you can't see anything in the wet t-shirt contest, and when the girls are exposed, they quickly cover themselves up again. Don't waste your time with this movie.

However, it's a good movie to watch on a Saturday afternoon when there's nothing better to do. It's a funny, sexy teen sorority college movie with playboy playmates from '79 and should be taken as it is. In the beginning, the movie doesn't make much sense, but as it goes on...it's still really bizarre.

In his journalistic way, the author took a fairly common subject (Christian worldviews)and analytically broke down misplaced arguments that we make to ourselves. But his style isn't so heady that a teen has trouble with the material. In fact, my fourteen year old daughter promptly conviscated the book and is using it in her teen accountability group.

The glories of \\"Transona Five\\", \\"Anonymous Collective\\", \\"Anamorphose\\", \\"Jenny Ondioline\\" and \\"Super-Electric\\" almost seem the music of another band.If lite cocktail jazz or bad French movie music is your thing, any post-\\"Emperor Tomato Ketchup\\" CD will be your pleasure.

But I don't have to like it, do I?"},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"I'm very tired by now of Stereolab making the same album over and over. They were so brilliant and original in their early years but since 1997 they've been making cocktail jazz for the college crowd. There is precisely one original element to this disc - a bit of acoustic guitar on the second track, which they've never used before - but apart from that it is painfully obvious what a rut they are in. Every track sounds like the one before it, and this has been going on for three years and as many albums. I have bought every one of their releases in the past but I am tired of being disappointed. Neophytes should start with the chaotic barnstormer \\"Transient Random-Noise Bursts With Announcements\\" or one of the first two \\"Switched On\\" packages which shows them in all their brilliant diversity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay, Stereolab!","review":"I wouldn't normally review the same CD twice. I'm giving it 5 stars now because I think Stereolab deserves an extra star for the pissy fans. I read an interview with Tim Gane and he said that Microbe is not supposed to be a \\"new album,\\" it's more of an addition to Cobra. Just look at the CD, it's packaged in much the same way as Cobra. One of the songs on Microbe is even a song that was intended for Cobra."},{"rating":"2","title":"A most excellent direction from Cobra and Phases!!!","review":"After the sort of \\"uninspired\\" direction from Cobra and Phases, this release takes it all back.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Lab CD to Hold Ya Over For The Next","review":"I would also have to agree with Amazon in that this shouldn't be a CD in which you first experience the 'lab with. I'm a new 'lab fan, and Emperor Tomato Ketchup is an awesome cd.Back to Microbe Hunters, the CD is a mixture of Stereolab leftovers from past albums. There will be something that you will enjoy on the CD. Outer Bongolia is reminisent of Metronomic Underground, its a poppy-jazzy tune. Household Names is also will shout \\"Emperor Tomato Katchup\\". Intravels... its a song in which I would place on Aluminum Tunes. As is it sad to say, I don't own Cobra's yet, so I could not be certain if the others would fit in there (which they most likely do).In all, First of the Microbe Hunters is an excellent Half-CD.

All the way through I kept trying to imagine the ending and how she was going to come to terms with the situation. But I was totally wrong. What a brilliant twist at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Koontz's best, the twists don't stop until the last page","review":"This was my favorite of all Dean Koontz's books. It was the 2nd one I read, and I have read ALL of his published books since that time. The House of Thunder is still my all-time favorite. This one gave me nightmares. Lock the doors and windows, turn on all the lights and enjoy and engrossing and terrifying page-turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only I could speed read... I could read more Koontz!!","review":"The House of thunder was a fabulous read! I read the book in three days - on my lunch hour, on breaks, in bed.... I couldn't put it down!! It was fantastic! It was well written but of course I find that Dean Koontz usually is! Way to go Dean! You are still # 1 with me!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Mind Was Hijacked By Russian Spies!","review":"One of Koontz's less-believable pieces, an early mind-control story that went overboard. Like most of his lesser books, this one starts out well but spirals downhill, until the shocking revelation is merely mundane - if you believe it, which you probably won't.This one comes off almost more as a soap opera spinoff than an espionage intriguer. It really just doesn't work. The characters aren't well-developed, the body of the novel is obviously padded.Anyone looking for bare-bones Koontz enjoyment after exhausting his many better titles may still enjoy House of Thunder. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but hardcore Koontz fans, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of his early ones and it shows","review":"I've read a number Koontz books, and liked a great deal of them, however... This book is poor. It trys to be shocking and suprising, but it just felt dated. Russians are just not scary anymore. If your a big Koontz fan I'd read the book just to get a taste of his early work, but I'f your new to his books get something new and much more up to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"House of Thunder","review":"Good, engaging plot. Easy read. Drew you back for more. For me, the conclusion wrapped up a little too fast. Will there be a part II? If yes, I will read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow at a 4th grade reading level","review":"I have read a Dean Koontz book I liked, actually two and so I thought I would have some entertainment as I recovered from knee surgery, laying back and reading. What a simplistic, unsatisyfing book! The dialogue is like something generated by a computer program, the romance way too convenient and the suspense - gosh, turn on the lights, I am so scared. No. I wound up not caring what happened to the main character and her simplistic inner dialogue though now I am aware that I could end up in the hospital with a gorgeous,, single doctor giving me kisses as part of my treatment. This is absolute drivel. If you find yourself enjoying this you need to reach out and challenge yourself more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now this just doesn't work","review":"Nope. This is is all glitter and very little substance. Dean Koontz tries a high-flying act here that simply falls on its face. This is all artifice and very little substance. Not at all satisfying to this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good (spoilers)","review":"Yeah, it is bad; and dated. As most have explained, the beginning is much better than the ending. The Russian angle is interesting only in that I can't believe we (Americans) we're really that paranoid, but I'll give him that one. What I really didn't like at all was all the over-explaining. It was really annoying being talked down to like that. Its like being told a story about a story when all you wanted was just the story. Ah well it is an early work, only a consummate Koontz fan should suffer it, though. Thank goodness his writing has matured. The good new is there is a new Odd Thomas book out!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I thought this book was incredible. It was full of twists and turns and had great suspense. I read it a few years ago and still recommend it to people looking for a great book to curl up with ... just don't read it in the dark. : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Horror Finds Romance","review":"First of all, I read the book because I love Koontz's horror. Most of his books keep me completely on edge. But this book was different in two ways: One: It wasn't scary, the suspense stuff was, to be nice, dumb. It didn't contain his usual grip on the horror scene. Two: I fell completely in love with the developing romance between Susan and McGee, and I mean completely. Get this: one line just says: \\"Then McGee kissed her.\\" It's so dumb and corny, but I loved it. You have to read all the beginning stuff, but it was so sweet. I liked the doctor patient thing, and I hated it when the ending ruined it with all that Russian stuff. I want more of the romance stuff, I loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick","review":"Koontz has been hit and miss throughout his carrer -- and that's true of any author this prolific -- but this miss was catastrophic. So unbelievably unbelievable it's hard to believe. What you're asked to swallow as explanation is totally absurd. It's \\"Oh my gawd!\\" bad. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's with Koontz and Endings","review":"I have only read three Koontz novels, but I can still critique his work. This Book was great, until about three fourths of the way through it, when the fear that had building had the rug pulled out from under it. You were convinced the reasons for the strange happenings at the Hospital were supernatural, until he switches to a reality ending with really took away from the novel. It was a good twist, it just kinda stopped the suspense. Who cares what it is if it's not ghosts? But maybe you'll like it. Read it and find out yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"What kind of ending is that?","review":"First of all, I cannot believe that Dean Koontz, the guy who wrote one of my favorite books -- Dragon Tears -- is the author of this truly miserable story. Sure, there is lots of suspense that pulls you in and you're asking yourself 'what could be the possible explanation', but you are only on a ride to total disappointment. The ending is unrealistic, poorly thought out, and just plain foolish. I never yelled at a book before until I read this. What a waste of time. Only if you're still living in the Cold War could you possibly obtain any satisfaction from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Don't waste your money. This book is so slow I almost gave up reading it, but since I have to finish any book I read I kept with it. The book did get somewhat interesting around page 300, mind you the book is only 360 pages long. If you really have to read this book, go the the library and borrow it. I've read many other books by Dean Koontz and this is my first disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I hardly ever give such a low rating, but I expected far more from Koontz. He spent way too long repeating over and over that the character was probably nuts. I was completely apathetic before the pace picked up. By then I couldn't have cared less what finally happened to her... he may have slipped political intrigue in, but by then it was just another crazy hallucination for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The noise of the storm promised agreat read, did not deliver","review":"Susan Thorton awakes in a hospital bed and is told she has been in a coma for a long time as a result of a car crash which she can't remember. In fact she can't remember anything about her life at all except what happened to her fiance a long long time ago in the cave system known as the House of Thunder. He was brutally murdered by four bigots who did not want him in their fraternity. Those four men are dead now, she knows this for a fact but she swears she is seeing them in the flesh as other patients and staff. She is also falling in love with her neuro-surgeon who has a few secrets of his own.This is not a fast paced thriller with most of the book set inside the hospital with Susan in the bed with the reader going into her confused mind. The House of Thunder picks up the pace at the end but the ending is too easy and not real exciting. There are a lot better Koontz novels out there than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty good","review":"This book hit some good points as far as brainwashing and fear of yourself go. It was a little predictable but overall, not bad. I would be willing to try another Koontz book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdone, overdone","review":"This is probably one of Koontz's worst books ever. The plot is cliche' and dull, the characters unrealistic, and the sentence structures simple and repeatative. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some do -- some don't","review":"By the looks of the reviews, some like Koontz no matter what he writes and that's okay. This is the 4th Koontz book I have read and I didn't care for any of them.Sorry - I guess I will go back to Stephen King."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be prepared for the jaw-dropping twist...!","review":"Hopefully you're not reading this fine DK tome on an airplane trip home...you'll want to bail out without a parachute, the spine-tingling twist toward the denouement easily makes this Koontz offering worth the price of admission!Viva el Koontz!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Susan insane or are people from the past threatening her?","review":"Susan Thorton wakes up--allegedly following a car accident--with partial amnesia, notably a big black hole of dread surrounding her work as a scientist . Susan can, however, recall the distant past such as the House of Thunder: a cave where she witnessed her boyfriend's hazing death by multiple murderers in college.The past has come back to haunt Susan Thorton. Even the now-dead murderer has made his presence known to her. Fortunately, she has a burgeoning friendship starting with her handsome doctor to help her through the confusion and hallucinations supposedly caused by a bruised brain.You'll be ripping through the pages with the energy of thunder. This novel is suspenseful to the end where all of the elements unexpectedly fall into perfect place. I had no idea how this novel would end, but I sure was loosing sleep to find out! Highly recommended for anyone who has ever doubted their sanity... or just enjoys a great mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Best Koontz Book","review":"This is the second best Koontz book I have read (Watchers being the best). I could not put it down. I wanted so badly to find out if things turned out ok, I wanted to cheat and look at the end; but I did not want to ruin the read for myself, so I didn't. The ending was a surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Author Should Put On Hiking Boots","review":"It was obvious from the first trail we picked from this book that the author had not even viewed the trailhead from inside his car let alone set foot on the trails. Simple things like finding the trailhead were confusing, and downright wrong in some instances. Descriptions of trail landmarks and crossings were confusing, wrong, or nonexistant. This book is likely a compilation of very old trail descriptions that were not truthed now or in the first place. Best check in at the visitor center befor venturing off with ths unreliable trail guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't Recommend","review":"Just returned from the Olympic Peninsula and found this guidebook to be less helpful than expected. Perhaps things have changed their since the 2002 publication so double check info on hikes before heading out. Had trouble finding trailheads for #61, specific distances would have been helpful in the \\"Getting There\\" section, wasted 1 hr and lots of gas trying to find #59 Big Flat,never found it. A confusing time trying to locate #35 Mount Angeles Saddle, trailhead signage doesn't include this name, located it nearly a mile in. Recommend a more current publication."},{"rating":"1","title":"What planet does Seabury Blair live on?","review":"Although well written and generally humorous, the hikes described in this book are often not day hikes, or barely on this side of being day hikes. It seems Mr. Blair doesn't include looking at flowers, trees, animals, views, etc. on hikes, but instead sprints as fast as possible from point to point. A hike estimated at a \\"conservative\\" 7 hours took a triathlete and a disance runner NINE HOURS to complete. One hike he describes as a day hike (High Divide) is described in EVERY OTHER book as a 2-4 day hike. Fast and light is one thing, but Seabury Blair is living in a fantasy land. Be forewarned: unless you are a VERY strong hiker who doesn't enjoy hiking for reasons other than for a good workout, this book downplays the difficulty and potential seriousness of these hikes. I strongly suggest a book such as Wood's \\"Olympic Mountains Trail Guide.\\" Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trustworthy","review":"Not sure what problem one of the previous reviewers had with getting herself lost on the way to a trailhead, but her criticisms are completely off base. A LOT of longtime Olympics trail veterans know the author personally, because he's spent the better part of his life on these trails, and is undoubtedly better equipped to decribe them than someone from say...oh, Kansas. Based on our own extensive local knowledge, we can attest that this book is a worthy survey of some of the nation's greatest day-hiking lands, by one of the region's acknowledged local experts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down in the Olympics","review":"I had high hopes for this book but, suffice to say, it's no longer in my collection. I have no question but that the author knows his topic. However, like a previous reader, I found myself confused and even lost (at $3.00+ a gallon) trying to follow directions that are too vague and in one case really led me astray.If you want someone's opinion (and don't we all have one), this book is okay. But do yourself a favor and cross reference suggestions and particularly directions. Or, better yet, just find a better resource.

I will never buy this brand of super glue again because this company is gypping me & everybody else who buys it. BAD BUY THIS WAS!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Theater Autobiography","review":"Act One is one of my favorite books. I have rearead it often since the first time I picked it up in my late teens. I love the anecdotes about the Broadway greats ans near greats and how Mr. Hart became famous, but my favorite parts of the book concern his memorable Aunt Kate, a woman whose fate in life was other than she deserved. She is very humanely portrayed, and so is the rest of Mr. Hart's family. I also enjoyed learning more about George Kaufman and his wife. This book's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard work and humility pay off","review":"Moss Hart not only overcame the poverty of which he writes so painfully, but he broke into a closed-door world (Broadway) to become an enormously successful playwright. His detailed memory, combined with his ability to capture the essence of such disparate characters as his aunt and George S. Kaufman, brings his miserable childhood and seemingly endless quest for a breakthrough to life. It's not all pretty and it certainly doesn't tie up simply. It takes more than a decade of perseverance in the face of derision and failure. An important lesson for those who look for the quick rise to the top, and an enjoyable read for anyone who cares about Broadway and the creative process."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book on Theatre I've Ever Read","review":"Moving, funny, inspirational. It is also the most informative book of theatre and what it takes to make it in theatre that I have ever read. It remarkably takes you not only into the creative mind and one man's passion for success. More importantly it takes you through the entire process of how luck and planning took him to a very specific goal. I can't recommend it enough for anybody who has ever dreamed of anything and wondered hot to achieve it. Should be required reading for everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"A delightful memoir I have been meaning to read for years. Charming, fresh, and funny. A marvelous autobiography I recommend to anyone who enjoys the theater. The description indicates Woody Allen is a co-author and this is incorrect. No intro by Allen: written by Moss Hart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless!","review":"A look back in time to understand the struggles in defining-and reaching your goals. A study in human nature. Things haven't changed. Great lessons still!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic remains enchanting","review":"Moss Hart's autobiography remains an enchanting read. He demonstrates why anyone would want to work in the heartbreaking careers of theatre and how a play is put together. He plays fast and loose with some of the facts of his life, but in the end makes a great story better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of the book Act One","review":"Not suitable . Slow and unwieldy. woulod nbot recommend it for any one'Very difficult to read and stay focused on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Read","review":"I found Mr. Riley's \\"Tell Me Why\\" a very entertinaing romp through the Beatle song catalog. Big an equally big Dylan fan, I expected the same joi de vivre to inhabit \\"Hard Rain,\\" but throughout the book I got the sense that Riley didn't have the same passion for or understanding of Dylan's music and muse as he did with the Beatles. I suspect that he wrote it because it seemed like a natural thematic sequel to the Beatle book. You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is to many","review":"This book is a waste of paper. You will find dylanoligy at it worst, hidden behind a small amount of credibility. \\"Tell Me Why\\" is a fine book (Riley's effort about the Beatles). Riley's commentary here is trite, Vision's of Johanna is not about Heroin, it's about the time I got loaded at my friends house and was thinking about my ex-girlfriend while making out with somebody else. Of course I'm not as old as the song but you should get the point. Dylan just writes 'em. You can not possible dissect Dylan's songs and pick only songs you like calling every thing after \\"Blood\\" trash ( that's not his words that's paraphrasing the last half on the book). Some things can not be defended \\"Knocked and Loaded\\" but if anybody else put out \\"Oh Mercy\\", Riley would have been singing their praises like he sings punk rocks in the last fifty pages of his book about Dylan."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST Dylan book ever!

Hey, I'm only a teenager, but I can still appreciate talented music. Clapton, Van Halen, Zeppelin, Rush, so many bands that are better than this annoying little album. I enjoy quite a few newer bands as well, such as Iced Earth and Dream Theater, but most are underground. It seems that if you have talent and don't write lyrics that are 100% swearing and bragging then the major labels hate you. Well, I say prove them wrong. Support talented musicians, and ignore the Top 40. Any \\"musician\\" who has a single made by SAMPLING a much better band is not worth your time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mucg better than DWAC","review":"Devil without a cause was a great album, but not nearly as good as this. All of his remakes are excellent and I love the appearance of Joe C. in Early Morning Stoned Pimp. Kid Rock is tight."},{"rating":"1","title":"The History of Rock [Edited]","review":"Listened to the album and guess I am in the minority. Pretty good guitar, but he ain't no Hendrix or Clapton. by comparison to rock legends it's pretty shallow. Lyrics...edgy, but not very artistic. He likes swearing, which of course appeals to the young teens. There's no message anyone needs to hear. When someone needs to put a song called \\"F**k That\\" or \\"F**k You Blind\\" into an album, I guess he isn't Einstein. Finally, the vocals...could he ever do it without an echo? He has a vocal range of 4 notes. Still like the guitar though, but it needs more variety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong But From A Young Kid Rock","review":"The beats are there and the hooks are solid and immediately appealing. Instead of more of the rock/hiphop song we saw before, there's much more strong hiphop songs and a few hard rock songs, all featuring Kid's unique rapping style. If you enjoyed Kid Rock's \\"Devil Without a Cause\\" because of Kid Rock's tight and engaging lyrics, then you might be dissapointed. He has obviously grown a lot since these old songs were origionally released because he was much better lyrically in \\"Devil\\". Overall a great album with some great songs, its just lacking Kid Rock's lyrical style we all loved in \\"Devil Without a Cause\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"From The Remains of a Nostalgic Fan:","review":"I wonder why Kid Rock never broke into the mainstream while Nirvana was still around. In about one or two years we'll be making fun of Kid Rock and his rap-metal carnival show just like we made fun of Vanilla Ice at the start of his demise."},{"rating":"1","title":"fake pimps and wack emcees unite!","review":"Kid Rock almost seems unreal to me. like a parody of everything that is ridiculous about mainstream music. unfortunately, he isn't (a parody) but his new album does nothing to dispell this notion. filled with laughable posturing, extremely repetitive lyrics, and even insanely stupid sounding gang vocals, i think this cd may be worse than paying two bucks for bottled water. the only reason to buy it would be to see how many times Kid Rock can work his own name into one of his wack flows. i'm hoping we are entering the end of his fifteen minutes of undeserved fame. of course, his die-hard fanbase of ninth grade video game addicts probably think otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ive heard better, much better.","review":"Kid rock just does not cut it, plain out. His flows get old and every song has the same \\"let me hear where your at\\"...this and that. When I first listened to this album I thought that it was simply \\"fake\\", Kid rock does not have the edge of other rappers, his jams just dont have the spark, he just raps without feel or any of the other stuff that makes rap memorable. I dont want to sound like a harsh judger but, Kid rock is just fake , he just is not a good rapper. But those who like him will like him, I just think that you all who are considreing to become a new fan(getting the album), well, I dont think it is worth it, he is not good, he is fake, I would reccomend NOT to consider him. But you will do what you like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But Not Devil","review":"My advise: if you liked \\"Black Chick, White Guy\\" on Kid Rock's \\"Devil Without A Cause\\" album, then this is right up your alley. Overall, this album is slower, less agressive than \\"Devil Without A Cause\\". No \\"Bullgod\\" or \\"Bawitdabaw\\" here, for the most part. There is, however some slower, more laid back driving raprock that is along the lines of the entire theme of \\"Devil Without A Cause\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"My re-evaluation after listening to it multiple times","review":"I take many long drives and I have had the opportunity to listen to this CD beginning to end multiple times and I am disappointed about it. The only good song on the CD is American Badass. If you are a fan of Kid Rock for his Rap type songs(like I am) than you are in for a big upset. This album is mostly rock and poor at that. He doesn't have the strong beats and powerful lyrics that we have come to expect. Don't waste your money. Be happy with his other CD, Devil without a Cause."},{"rating":"2","title":"More fun that a pool full of instant gelatin","review":"This cd isnt very mainstream, I will admit, but it is a classic, he took his old material, and some (not all) of the best material from his 2 out of print cd's polyfuse method and early mornin' stoned pimp. He has excellant songs on here, my favorites are american badass, prodigal son, paid, emsp, abortion, ya keep on, and my oedipus complex. in Abortion it i really think he wrote it to the son he and his g/f aborted, if you liked the style of history of rock i think youll like this cd also, although i have to say its not quite as good, but thats not saying much on the count of devil without a cause is in my opinion the greatest album ever made.

I think the major tracks in the album are spread all over! Theres not one track which I regret listening to except YA KEEP ON!

The intro really sets off the power and energy to the first song which happens to be my all time favorite, American Badass, which if you bought this cd just for one kick rearing song alone, would be well worth the purchase by itself... A couple of the songs like *uck you blind are a bit harsh and the lyrics are a bit repetitive, but you will find that even though, as a whole, the cd itself might not be as great as his others, I would still by this cd over ANY Metallica cd that some of these wankers try to downplay his music too...Kid Rock has a wide deversity of musical talent, that allows him to dwelve into Rap, Rock, Country, SUCCESSFULLY, which the hard core metal bands will never able to do...

I won't even dignify his band's instrumentals with a comment. He tries to party like Led Zeppelin, but he just can't. He thinks that he is bad because he had a number one album. I got news for you, Devo, Bananarama, Winger, and Spice Girls all had number one albums. Kinda put's things in perspective, Mr. Rock. And what's with that stupid midget? I can't believe that people listen to this vomitus. God bless MTV for their marketing machine that can turn any bit of trailer trash into a number one artist. I hope Amazon doesn't think that this review is too vehement to post, cause htis is just a public service announcement to save people money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"I don't particularly like rap music but absolutely loved rebel without a cause (explict lyrics and all) it was fun, well done, creative, showed a wide range of skills and inventiveness. I eagarly waited this CD, but it is a major let down, just plain borring crap, he may have physically showed up, but he left his soul at home. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a BIGGGG Kid Rock fan...BUT I was dissappointed!","review":"Being a HUGE Kid Rock I was delighted when I heard he had a new CD coming out. Like many other of his fans I waited and waited for the day it would be released. I even made sure I bought it the same day. I was saddened when I listened. The CD was totally NOT what I expected. I understood that he was going to have old songs on it but I also thought there would be a few new ones too. I was wrong. This CD is just a bunch of his old songs thrown onto a new CD except of coarse for American Bad A**. I don't know of too many women that would appreciate it either...all he sings about in most of his older songs is disrespecting women. It's pretty much a \\"guy\\" CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible!","review":"This album sucked. There's just no other way to put it. American badass is quite frankly the ONLY GOOD SONG on this whole track, and maybe Prodigal Son is OK at best. The rest is just garbage. \\"devil Without a Cause\\" was his best yet, and be satisfied with that because it's not getting any better than that. Don't be an idiot like me who actually bought this cd. Kid Rock's really let me down this time...."},{"rating":"2","title":"give it an honest try, without \\"Devil\\" in the brain","review":"I picked up this CD yesterday, and it is not that bad. In fact, I rather enjoy it. My personal favorite on the album was \\"My Oedipus Complex\\", while \\"American Badass\\" was alright. Sure, some of the songs have that goofy early-rap backbeat, but the energy level is high enough and the songs are good enough to look past it. The problem is, everyone is expecting another \\"Devil Without A Cause\\" and are adding it to their collection to be \\"cool.\\" Case in point, on this very website, it says \\"people who have ordered this item also bought: Britney Spears.\\" What the hell! That is what is wrong with the music industry today: people buying a CD simply for the trend and dropping the artist when he's not \\"cool\\" anymore. So for all those Britney fans, don't buy this. Stay in your own little bubble-gum world, and let the Rock play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as hot as Devil without a cause and Cocky","review":"I have all three of Kid's albums and The history Of Rock isn't as good as the other two I'm afraid. Some of the songs are O.K. If I had to put the three albums in order of best to worst, History of Rock would come last and its a tie between cocky and Devil without a cause for the top spot. I don't know, maybe you'll like this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Kid Rock has no talent. Does everyone know that the \\"awesome guitar riff\\" from American Badass is actually a Metallica riff from 1991. Now metallica they are a real band, not this trash which will be forgotten and laughed at within a few years. So as you all can see, all Kid rock needed to do was use one metallica riff and they became world famous. The only thing which keeps me from giving this cd 1 star is Joe C. He was the man and let him rest in peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"This ain't strait out the trailer, it strait outa oldskool","review":"This CD is hardly up to the stardard Mr. Ritchie (more fit for him with this album)has set with Devil Without a Cause. Because of that, i have become a hard Kid Rock fan, but this isnt worth any of my appreciation. All i can do is hope that this summers tour i am attending will not be a full fledged hoax of old material. The Kid needs to display some new material if he wants to keep this fan. Ill be wathin him from the skybox n all i can do is hope he can once again live up to his name.Basically, if ur looking for something like Devil, then all i can say is buy something else, anything will better fit his name then this CD. At least the title of the record fits, the history of rock, cause he is history if he keeps puttin out albums like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'M SOOOOO SICK OF THIS GUY!","review":"Well ... the song \\"American Badass\\" is basically a line or two from every song on the \\"Devil\\" album, rehashed into a song that the fans will make a hit. I gave it 2 stars because he is still managing to string some of you along. I can't understand what the fuss is all about (get over the hype people). I guess he makes you guy's feel like rebels or something. Some of you may even live vicariously through the far-fetched description he creates of himself in his songs..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont even think about buying it","review":"This is the worst cd that you could possibly think of. If you think this is devil without a cause 2, then your sadly wrong. This cd is more like vanilla ice then kid rock. There are only two new songs all the rest are off his old cds. There is only one good song on this cd and that makes it worth not buying. So whatever you do don't buy this buy the new eminem because that is so much better that the history of rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Great","review":"Kid Rock's first cd was about a million times better than this one. The cd had about only two or three new songs and all the other ones were recorded before he was famous.

I've never seen it","review":"It would be nice to tell you all about the music, but dang, I haven't seen the CD yet. It's been a month. That's a pretty long time. Had I any idea that this would be the waiting period, I would have NEVER made the purchase. I doubt I will ever get it.Is anyone listening ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOOORING!","review":"The only good song on this album is \\"American Badass\\". Don't listen to the \\"good\\" reviews about this cd because those morons don't know what they are talking about. The rest of the songs on \\"The History Of Rock\\" are recycled trash from the early '90s. This isn't NEARLY as good as \\"Devil Without A Cause\\". Barely escapes 1 star rating because I really like Kid Rock. Don't even bother with this. Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I just bought this cd over an hour ago, and i gotta say I liked it. Although the idea of putting remixed versions of his old songs was indeed a good idea, I wish that instead, he would've re-released one of his old ones this week, followed by next week, and the following. But all in all, I thought \\"Dark and grey\\", \\"ya keep on\\", and prodigal son made this album the best it could be. But kid, please put out polyfuze, and stoned pimp. I've heard them both, and I desperatley need them."},{"rating":"2","title":"great, nutin better.....but the real version","review":"ur sayin u want to buy the edited version for ur 12 year old kid, lemme tell you this, he already knows everything and probably more than you know, if he listens to this one cd it wont change him, if u raised him right nothing will happen if u give him the regular version. Buy this only to play his songs at parties and stuff. Let me tell you this, if you want your son/daughter to understand and appreciate music give him the original to show him what the artist is saying"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to his first one","review":"His first album is much better than this one. This one sounds like a collection of the rejects that weren't good enough for his real CD. The one cool song is American BadAss, with Metallica's Sad But True as the actual music. But other than that, I wish I hadn't spent my money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just No!","review":"This is probably thee worst album i own! Of all my 120+ cd's this is the worst. Kid Rock has taken some of his old songs and put them together on an album that is so bad that it hasnt gone back into my cd player since the day i bought it. \\"American Bad Ass\\" is a rip off a Metallica song from 1991, and the rest of the songs just suck. The only other good song on here is \\"F**k That\\" which was also on the Any Given Sunday movie soundtrack which was actually pretty good so if you want go buy that instead of this so atleast you'll get one Kid Rock song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful in the extreme","review":"My utter contempt for this performer is difficult to express in words.The sampling of Metallica's \\"Sad but True\\" in one of his songs( I forget the name, but all of his songs sound the same) is just ..... Sampling takes NO talent, anyone can do that. He is just a talentless guy who swears alot.What talent.Profanity doesn't offend me, but it can become boring quickly. Please avoid kid rock (his name doesn't need to be in caps) and buy \\"Master of Puppets\\" by Metallica and/or \\"Brave New World\\" by Iron Maiden instead. MUCH more talent, folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"redneck rap or hickhop, whatever you want to call it.","review":"I was never a fan of Kid Rock, but hearing him screw up Sad But True on American Badass, and seeing him screw up the kick @$$ lineup at Summer Sanitarium cemented my hatred of him. He is redneck rap, he a combination of country and rap. He crucified Sad But True, I will never be able to listen to that song without thinking of how this greaseball crucified it. His live show at Summer Sanitarium: the only redeeming part was the strippers, and when Kid Rock finally got off stage(why couldn't they leave the strippers out there the whole time?). Everyone there was booing him and throwing stuff at him. I honestly feel sorry for the securtiy guards at his shows who have to control thousands of drunk rednecks holding lighters. And I'm glad the midget is dead, it didn't serve any real purpose. We can only hope that Kid Rock's career is now ever. I'm done now, any more ripping on him would be a waste of my time and yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is this clown?","review":"I just heard that this guy's first album sold 7 million copies. 7 million people wasted their money. This guy is forgettable. He claims to be an american badass, but he's just the scrawny son of a suburban car salesman. He's a fraud. He's nothing of what he says he is. Don't give people like this money from your own pocket. Give your money to someone or something worth believing in."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad cd in my opinion","review":"The first song on this cd, \\"american bad ass\\", stole the music from metallica's song \\"sad but true\\"! Not only did the rest of the cd blow, but that was hella cheap! Now, that's just my opinion. If you REALLY like rock, get some metallica, godsmack, staind, saliva, or stuff like offspring if you like lighter stuff. Kid Rock is a poser."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album rocks? He-he-he...","review":"If this album rocks...A lot of people suppose Bud is \\"The King of Beer\\", though this drink is as similar to real beer as Kid Rock is similar to REAL rock musicians! -:)I guess his nickname is very good. \\"Kid Of Rock\\"! He reminds me of small boy that belives if he says F** before and after every word he'll seem like adult man! -:)Can you imagine this \\"rock star\\" without EXPLICIT LYRICS?Can you imagine Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Bob Dylan, etc. ( even Black Sabbath!) didn't use EXPLICIT LYRICS and were REAL rock stars ( not kids)?One of previous reviewers said \\"he can sing rap...\\".

I wrote this in hope it will lower the rating even lower. I could never stress how much i hate that loser. For this CD...he will burn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kid Rock--2000's version of RUN-DMC","review":"Used to be back in the day, if a rap group wanted to get white kids listening to their records, that they'd steal the groove from a record white kids already knew and loved, throw a rap on top of it, and voila! An instant hit, particularly if it had a lot of rock guitars in it. It worked for RUN-DMC, Tone Loc, and a host of others. Kid Rock obviously cut his teeth on this, and it's no wonder that \\"Devil Without A Cause\\" and now \\"The History of Rock\\" are megasellers. Instead of Aerosmith and Van Halen, the Kid now rips off Metallica, and the result is . . . well, like a lot of rap, a lot of cursing to a beat. But hey--like the Kid says in \\"American Bad A**,\\" \\"I went platinum seven times.\\" Be afraid. Be very afraid."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNORIGINAL THIEF!!!!!","review":"American Bad A** is the riffs and melody from Metallica's \\"Sad but True\\"!!!!! Sorry, Kid Rock, but you are no where near what Metallica is to Metal/Hard Rock. I can't respect or indorse a CD when they copy my Favoirte band. Do NOT buy this garbage! Go pick up a Metallica album and see what real music sounds like!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw it out the window of the truck.","review":"Really like the Kid, but this was just bad.

Oh well, just one of those things."},{"rating":"1","title":"AAH","review":"You know this guy did appeal to me at first, but if you have this CD youve heard American Bad Ass, right? Listen to Metallicas \\"Sad But True\\". He ripped off the guitar part completely. H e tries to be metal, hardcore rap, and country at the same time. Fails miserably. He is a talentless wigger. Wait...thats too nice. I hope he commits suicide."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked Devil, you will like this!","review":"Don't listen to all of those other, bad reviews, this is more of the same Kid Rock. It has the same style, same flavor. I don't see why Kid Rock's early albums didn't sell, they were great. Compared to Devil, I would have to say that History is About one itsy bitsy little notch, behind, but not enough for Devil fans to not love it. All of the somgs are great, especially \\"American Badas*\\" (of course!), \\"Prodigy Son\\", \\"Dark and Gray\\", \\"abortion\\" (this albums equivlent to \\"Only God Knows Why\\"), \\"F That\\", F U Blind\\" (a very Prince sounding song), \\"Born to Be a Hick\\" (extremely Funny), and \\"My Oedipus Complex\\". Just get this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The History of Rock-Kid Rock","review":"This prequel to Devil Without A Cause is a bold move for Kid Rock. Many fans who liked Devil Without A Cause will be shocked by the different genres that Kid Rock has spanned in his 10 years of MCing. I have been a diehard fan of Kid Rock for many years. I have Grits Sandwiches For Breakfast, and DWOAC. Seeing that his middle two albums are out of print, I have not been able to buy them. This album lets me hear all the hits I've missed for the past couple of years. It was well worth it for Kid Rock to release this album, and it is a \\"MUST BUY\\" for any Kid Rock fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as nearly good as Devil, but not bad","review":"I really liked his previous cd,Devil Without A Cause,and wasexspecting the same stuff here.However after listening it was clearthat that this cd sucked compared to Devil, but songs like F**k that,American Badass,Early Mornin Stoned Pimp,Prodigal Son,and Dark and Gray makes it worth listening to but I just am not really into most of the older stuff from The Polyfuze Method.All things considered, this isn't a bad cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it all!","review":"I like every tack on this album. Great work. I like the whole wild stuff but also the slower stuff. The language is clear and direct- Lik'it! Good stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kid Flop","review":"Ignore the hype, avoid the marketing, keep your money! I was constantly looking for a fast forward button, some bits and pieces were ok (like the ones used on tv promo spots) but not any one song. I've always been a heavy metal fan and was thinking this could be some kind of a junction into a new genre of music. All's it is is a new piece of junk. The only way Kid Rap has got more licks than Randy Rhoads, is from people busting his chops for saying he's a rocker. So Kid just pull out your sampler and play by yourself like the rappers you inspire to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"KID ROCK IS THE WORLD BEST RAP/ROCK ARTIST!","review":"Kid Rock's new CD \\"The History of Rock\\" simply his best that has ever been put together. If you want the full limit, you should get the one with the Parental Advisory Explicit Content. But if you want the one that goes half way, get the edited one. The edited CD has 13 songs, and the explicit content CD has 124 songs. The extra song, (#12), \\"F**k You Blind\\" is what I think one of the best. Number 4 \\"Paid\\", is what I think the best song in the whole wide world from him! It will make a great gift for someone speacil in your life or for yourself.

Kid Rock copyied a great classic tune off of Metellica's \\" Sad but True so he could be rad and cool too. I liked his first cd but since I am a heavy mertal fan, it wasn't my type, instead I got a bunch of rap songs and VERY VERY offsenive lyrics that Kid Rock thinks he is cool but he is just another imitation fake want to be. I like him as a person, don't get me wrong. I loved loved his \\" Bawitdaba \\" song, sent a very good message. I loved Devil without a cause \\" this cd is just very offsenive.

I try and stay away from lots of artificial sweetners and this does have some splenda. I always blend it in the blender with about 6-8 oz. of skim milk, ice cubes and sometimes a little coffee.

My current fave s the chocolate royale mix with a cup of soymilk, four ice cubes and a half cup of strawberries.These shakes just mixed with milk are pretty gross, but if you pop it in the blender and sneak in some fruit, it almost tastes like a smoothis from jamba juice. except less bad for you.I don't follow tho weight-loss plan, so i can't testify to the weight-loss properties, but I can say this doesn't taste like diet food and overall, s a tweakable product that is pretty darn good."},{"rating":"2","title":"great classic showpieces","review":"these are the best performances by far.the dallas symphony with conductor eduardo mata is one of the finest orchestras in the world.i would rate them with the london symphony as the top two.you will never here better perfomances than these from any orchestra.if you like these pieces then buy this disc,you will not be dissapointed.ted moniz, classical music lover for over fourty years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deliver us from evil","review":"This book looked like someone just printed it off from home.

These songs are really rhythmic and gentle, and are made in some very unusual arrangements.

And the alternation of northern lore with the author's personal story works perfectly: O'Connor's voice is so specific and true, you stay with him as he swings between eskimo legends, a natural history of the northern parts of the continent, and a wildly funny drunken bar room contretemps, easily finding meaningful connections between it all. The main story is wrenching with a beautiful payoff. Read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Father's Day!","review":"In its social contours, its family drama, and its rare, sweet honesty, this book makes an enveloping read for anyone, woman or man.

All you need is a little patience! This book does not require you to be a \\"pro\\" at folding, and people who have just taken up this hobby and are familiar with the types of bases / folds, can do it too. It shows how to make dice, lantern and rhombic assemblies along with more creative designs like floral patterns and the sea urchin.

Well. after watching this bilge, I can honestly say I truly understand Howard. He is a dorky loser who learned early on that developing a potty mouth would get him attention. He married a woman who was way too good for him (something she apparently finally realized)and dragged her through the mud till she got sick of it and dumped his sorry carcass. He persists to this day saying purile clap trap that only appeals to children in adult bodies, not to adults. The most laughable part of this whole sorry tragedy is the praise he receives for \\"having the courage to speak his mind.\\" Well, when your mind consists of half a dozen curse words and a neurotic need for attention, it doesn't take long for it to speak all it has to say.

Opinions ranged from \\"genius\\" to \\"drivel\\", but most people agreed that Stern set out to shock and most of the time succeeded. The film doesn't shock that much, but it is very funny. It is basically the story of Stern's life and career, told very much from his point of view and featuring Stern himself in the lead role. Stern makes a good job of this and is a genuinely endearing character. He retains the audience's sympathy even when he is seen to treat his wife badly, but especially when he faces the crass radio bosses who don't understand his humour. For authenticity, Stern's co-peroformers in the radio show play themselves, and Robin Quivers shows herself to be a good actress as well as a professional radio host."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of it types","review":"Howard Stern is the next Wooly Allen.

The text is well-written, albeit there is absolutely nothing new here; as in The Artist's Way Cameron continually pats herself on the back and drops names. The Sound of Paper should be renamed 'The Sound of Money' as it is definitely funding the author's less lucrative creative projects by tapping into her cash cow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Department of Redundancy Department","review":"I have liked some of Julia Cameron's earlier work, as well as one of her more recent (Walking in this World), so I looked through this one at a bookstore, but didn't buy.

Jerome Froese (son of Edgar Froese, founder and still member of the band), being new to the band, wasn't enough of a force to \\"oppose\\" to Edgar's direction, and the result is clearly Edgar being the primary contributor to this album.Due to this, \\"Rockoon\\" is a somewhat weak album, with few memorable moments - it tries (IMHO, unsuccesfully) to have a rockish feel, but doesn't quite achieve it.Compared to other albums with the same lineup (\\"Turn of the Tides\\" and \\"Tyranny of Beauty\\") this album comes somewhat behind. I'd recommend buying TotT and ToB first, THEN come back to check out Rockoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great but not great at the same time.","review":"Good movie but I didn't want to hear Mr. Coppola talk through out the movie.

She's hot, but no, I won't be buying her music...its probably crap.\\" Well, I was VERY WRONG! I went to their myspace page and was immediately sucked in. Juliette has a great, raunchy, voice and the instrumentals match it. The intrumentals are excellent too, BTW...kind of bluesy punk (heh...now isn't THAT a cool combination!)

They kill for pleasure and also to compensate their inability at robbing a bank properly or attacking a stage coach successfully. They are flunkies in the field. They run into a stagecoach station and they kill the station master, rape his wife and burn the station to the earth. Then the wife who wants vengeance runs into a bounty hunter. She will learn the trade and go through with her vengeance. The details create the suspense of the film and give it a real deep emotional value. The film also reveals how these outlaws could survive easily in some western cities because the local sheriff had an agreement with them : no trouble and he would disregard the WANTED notices, till something happens. Raquel Welch embodies her part with conviction.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Impressive Western","review":"This is one of those sadly forgotten, but should have been remembered Westerns. I don't quite understand all the bashing Miss Welch has taken over the years for being a nominal actress. She's very good here, surrounded by an excellent cast of supporting players. This film is exciting, beautifully filmed (Including Miss Welch) and the film score sets you in a truly western mood. One of my favorite Westerns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meat and potatoes revenge western","review":"Revenge western starring Raquel Welch as the title character, victim of a vicious assault by outlaws led by Ernest Borgnine. All credibilty goes out the window five minutes into the movie when it becomes clear the bad guys are comic relief villains. The \\"rape\\" sequence, meant to set up the story plays like a rejected scene from an old sitcom, thus the viewer is not given the opportunity to have any emotional involement with Hannie.For those of you who are still interested, Robert Culp mentors Welch so she can get revenge; and Christopher Lee shows up in yet another movie which wastes his talents. Pretty routine stuff, but at least its better than Welch's MYRA BRECKINRIDGE. (Is it possible for movies to get any WORSE than that?) Welch should have just shot the varmits at the start and mosied off into the sunset. Doesn't evoke fond memories of THE WILD BUNCH or Leone's DOLLARS trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caulder offers nothing new and a lot old","review":"To put it nicely, Hannie Caulder is an homage masquerading as a western. It offers nothing new and a lot old. Below its thin veneer of a plot(Raquel Welch's quest for revenge against the men who brutally raped her)you'll easily see several rip-offs of prior westerns. The Mexican soliders chasing the outlaws is obviously from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and the three-against-twenty gunfight with Hannie, Thomas, and Bailey is reminicent of that in Magnificent Seven. Throw in the mysterious, man-in-black (a.k.a., The Man With No Name from the Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns)and you have a hollow story that relies on the usual shoot'em-up plot devices. The only difference--and it's a noticable one in Raquel Welch--is that a woman wears the ten-gallon hat and six-shooter. Too bad she couldn't inject a fresh, feminine perspective on violence instead of offering the same old macho mimicry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reel Garbage","review":"These film companies are getting cheaper and cheaper. Blu-Ray and no subtitles OR sound. Very bloody, the crappy red blood that doesn't look like real blood. A goood cast wasted on a crappy predictable movie. I sure could have done without this one.

At least the second half is true. I loved Material Issue and I miss Jim Ellison. This album defined guitar pop to me. The songs are simple, but catchy and melodic. They convey the emotions of naive happiness, flirting with superficiality because of their girl-crazy lyrics. Yet they have always made me feel oddly sad, at times even desperate - even before I heard of Ellison's death. Tragedy has many faces.My favorite song is the classic Valerie Loves Me, which has an ingenious melody and a story to tell. I also love Li'l Christine and Very First Lie, and the aggressive title track. Do yourself a favor and find out how full of energy guitar pop can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Material Issue was a Chicago band who wrote some of the most killer 3 minute power pop songs! themes of love and girls are dominant (at least 6 different girl's names are sung about in the lyrics). the music is strong and full of hooks and hummable choruses that pack their weight in radio gold. this album spawned a few college hits if i remember correctly. this comes highly recommended for fans of Cheap Trick, Big Star, or Field Trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotonous and Unmemorable","review":"You'd better be sure you really, really like Material Issue's sound before you buy this CD -- because that one sound is all they've got. No song distinguishes itself from the previous or the next. They basically all sound the same. Simple melodies, simple pop guitars that sometimes are catchy but many times are just mediocre, a lead guy who can't really sing but tries hard...and that's about it.The Amazon review says it well. Somewhat likeable, but definitely NOT loveable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Chicago classic","review":"Material Issue may have been the best pure band out of the Chicago scene that spawned Smashing Pumpkins, Liz Phair, and Urge Overkill, among many others. It's great three minute, three chord rock and roll, wearing Jim Ellison's heart and influences on its sleeve. Contrary to one of the other reviews, MI did not disband. Ellison killed himself, a tragic loss for pop music. But that is not why to buy this album: buy it for the life that courses through Ellison's songs and his band's performances, not for the sad way his life ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one for the time capsule folks, a must have.","review":"Influences (Cheap Trick, etc) aside, this album is filler free, which makes it better than anything previously put out by a power pop act. Thus this is the definitive power pop album of all time. It's a shame MI never got their just due. A power pop act in the midst of the over indulged 'grunge' movement sealed their fate. I saw them in Atlanta in '94 or '95 and remember I was 1 of maybe 50 people. That's the stupid ugly side of the music biz folks, be part of the new craze or be pushed aside. Nearly every song on this disc is memorable, with Very First Lie, Valerie..., and Crazy among the many gems on this album. Sadly, Material Issue's frontman and soul left us. I thank him for leaving us a part of him and hopefully many others will find their way to this much unheralded music."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Issue, 8 years later","review":"As a freshman in college, I wrote a critique of this cd. I was working as a music critic for the campus paper and of the piles and piles of cds I sorted through each week, I truly loved this one. Yes, most of the songs sound the same.....just with different words... but come on, they really are good little songs. I can't exactly remember what I wrote 8 years ago.... but I know that when I left the paper before graduation and had to give back the cds that were \\"property of the paper\\", this one never made it's way back to the office.

A teenage couple terrorize some teachers on their way to a Dodgers' game & later two highway patrolmen at a deserted wrecking yard where they have also killed the owners. Writer-director James Laudis' script though over loaded with exposition is serviceable enough.

After all, I have just seen WILD GUITAR, (...), by Hall Jr. But he is very convincing in this role. Yes, he's still not [good], but this is a one dimensional character, and he's good in this regards. This movie reminds me of a drama on Richard Boone's dramatic series in the early 60s: WALL TO WALL WAR. How good is Arch Hall Jr. I want his victims to GET THAT [VILLAIN]!!

Not Fed Ex. This makes no sense. I paid enough for shipping that they could have simply sent the candle via the postal service and it would have been here w/in a few days. I'm VERY upset about this. Two weeks to get anything delivered by any company is completely ridiculous. I've been ordering things online for years, and have never, EVER come across something like this.

Very little movement is available vertically with the gas lift and an even smaller amount of movement is available for the arms to move up/down or slide in/out. The back of the seat is bolted directly to the bottom, with no room for adjustments. The seat is painful to sit on for more than half an hour or so, worse than the $35 filler Wal-Mart chair it was meant to replace. The fabric leaves your back feel hot within first half hour of use. The casters are unremarkable in the truest sense of the word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chair","review":"This item was for me,but, I wasn't satisfied with the way it sat so, mygranddaughter wanted it and is very satisfied with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"I checked this book out of the library, hoping, like many other people, that it would be of the same caliber as the Bridget Jones novels. I was extremely diappointed. The character of Olivia Joules is like cardboard, a cheap imitation of BJ. While there were some funny moments, I found the entire story line way too implausable, and a plot that seemed like it should have been in the movies. I felt as though Helen Fielding catered entirely too much to the Al Queda theme which has appeared lately in fiction and movies. In this, she looses her originality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scattered","review":"I usually like this type of book for summer reading, but I was disappointed in this latest book from Helen Fielding. I found the book to be scattered and hard to follow. I was skeptical at the spy-skills that Olivia suddenly possessed. The characters are not developed, and the plot was not cohesive. Not an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd still be interested in a sequel...","review":"Like other reviewers, I really wanted to like this book. I did like parts of it, but overall I was disappointed. I don't like to read about real life tragedies in my light reading. I think it is inappropriate. References to Sept. 11, 2001, do not belong in a fun reading book. Neither do real life terrorists and their organizations. As for the book's overall concept, I still think it's sound. I like the idea of a \\"female James Bond\\" and Helen Fielding is the perfect writer to bring her to life. I hope that she is able to write a few sequels, hone her idea a bit. Make Olivia a little bit tougher, a lot less ditzy, and give her some of that old Bond pizazz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Helen, Hate this Book","review":"Like the other reviewer, I really wanted to like this book. I was SO EXCITED when I heard that Helen Fielding was coming out with a new book. It turned me off right away with some reference to a dangerous terrorist being attractive or exciting. I was thinking, maybe this is a British thing I just don't get? I gave her a chance and actually read the book all the way through. It might not be the worst book I ever read, but I didn't enjoy it at all. The action and plot were so simple it was offensive, and the characters were empty and just plain stupid. Not at all what I expected from this author. Please don't hold it against her, though. Skip this book, but read Cause Celeb and Bridget Jones Diary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist and ignorant rubbish!","review":"I was actually a fan of Fielding before reading this book. Enjoyed her others! I found this book to be offensive. Either Fielding is racist and ignorant toward Muslim people or she wanted her main character to appear that way. It was clear that this book was written in hurry with little attention to character or plot details."},{"rating":"1","title":"at least I didn't pay for it","review":"I placed this book on hold at the local library after reading the 2 Bridget Jones books and enjoying them. This book is pathetic! It doesn't even read like the same author.I'm normally the first person to defend cheesy plotlines and silly characters, but this book takes the cake. The story isn't even really a story. It sounds more like a very bad rejected sitcom from the WB Network. The characters aren't even remotely funny or likeable. They're one-dimensional and lame at their best. I don't even think it would make a decent movie.I kept reading hoping that it would get better and would make sense. It doesn't. There's no romance, no mystery, no fun in this book. Don't bother with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not read this","review":"I had to put this book down because I did not like the story. I found the book annoying and did not like the subject matter. I did not find anything funny or amusing about writing a light hearted story around Osama bin Laden and terriorism. I am really disappointed in Helen Fielding's choice of subject matter for her book. I loved Bridget Jones and can not believe how disappointing this book was. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quick read","review":"I really liked this book, Olivia is a great, heroic character. It seems some are put off by the terrorist angle, and perhaps since it has been a couple years since 9/11 that I'm reading it, I am not at all bothered by it. Humor is used, but seriousness is implied. I hope Fielding uses these charactors again in another Bond like adventure. I just adore when women are allowed to be sophisticated, cool and smart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big, Big Letdown","review":"I was so excited when i found out that helen feilding the writer of Bridget Jones' Diary had a new book out. I loved Bridget Jones but I could find no reason to love Olivia Joules. The plot of this book is not very good i tries so hard to be outrageously funny that it misses. Basically Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fielding needs to stay out of the spy thriller genre","review":"This is poorly done. It is so implausible and her facts are way off. I find it ridiculous that a US Navy carrier has no combat air patrol up and is hanging out in the Red Sea close to the coast of Sudan. Plus, the Navy has Seahawks (Blackhawks are Army). You can't eject from a helo-- why would the pilot yell \\"eject, eject.\\" Also, a submarine communicating back and forth with the ship like that? I certainly hope MI6 doesn't recruit people like Olivia and if they do they don't visit their friends to provide details where the new agent is going. How could her editors not insist that she cover the terrorist attack if she witnessed it? I liked BJ's diary and I hope fielding goes back to that genre. I'm very frustrated with this and disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST book I have EVER READ!!!","review":"This was honestly the worst book I have ever read. I normally will burn though all of my \\"chick lit\\" books really quickly...I didn't even make it past the 7th chapter of this book. My husband was SHOCKED to find a book that I didn't finish. The plot was terrible, the main character I just could not get into and I was confused. This was an absolutely terrible book. I love the Bridget Jones' books and was seriously disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"I was at the library and happened to come upon this book and was excited to find that Helen Fielding had written another book - I loved the Bridget Jones books. It had reviews such as \\"Olivia Joules is the Bridget Jones of the 21st century\\". It was very witty in the beginning chapters, but lingered way too long on the time when she was in Honduras and the Sudan...couldn't wait to finish it just so I could be done and move on. Overall I wouldn't suggest reading if you expect it to be anything like Bridget Jones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at best...","review":"I had high hopes for this one, but unfortunately I found myself racing through the last half just to get the reading over with. I wasn't expecting Bridget Jones, but I WAS expecting the same insightful humor and fun that came with the Bridget novels.I found Olivia Joules to be irritating rather than endearing, and the Al-Quaeda plotline to be, in a word, ridiculous. In fact, most of the plot I found to be overly contrived, predictable, and just downright silly.We know Ms. Fielding is a talented gal and I'm still scratching my head trying to figure out how this book took such a 180 from her previous novels in storyline, style and humor.I'm still hoping for Bridget #3...can't you imagine how many things could go wrong on Bridget's wedding day? I think that particular style is where Ms. Fielding shines most, and I hope she returns to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't put it down, but wished I had","review":"I stayed up half the night to finish this book, but not because it was good. The closest approximation to reading the second half of this book would be to watch a trainwreck unfold in slow motion. You can't look away, but you know that whatever you see is going to be ugly.The main character is an ingratiating, neurotic bore. The other characters are badly-drawn cardboard cutouts. And the plot? Jerky, unbelievable, and yet somehow predictable.Why did I stay up reading it? I wanted to see how the author would extract herself from the pit that she dug. Unfortunately, she did it in a most superficial and cloying manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even make sense","review":"This book made no sense to me. I don't usually have a problem reading books but half the time reading this book I wasn't even sure what was going on or where she was. Read more like a screen play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying voices","review":"Funny at times, but references to real-life terrorists is disconcerting and in bad taste. The voices are fine for the women characters, but HORRIBLE when the reader is doing men's voices. Especially annoying when it's American men. Skip the audio version."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"If you loved Helen Fielding's wonderful Bridget Jones books, you're in for a very rude surprise if you read this supposed spy novel. What a boring, unfunny and pretentious book. Olivia Joules has to be one of the most ridiculous, truly stupid characters that I've ever read. She's not sure if she's falling in love with a dark mysterious bin Laden ripoff but she sure hopes he loves her. Reading her pathetic efforts to convince the bin Laden character that she also hates America so that he might fall in love with her made me gag. This nonsense doesn't even have the benefit of the humor that characterized the Bridget Jones books. Save your money and stay far, far, far away from this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the spunk ?!?!","review":"Compared to Bridget Jones, Olivia Joules fails to entertain and bewitch the reader on so many levels. Might not be a fair comparison, but still.... The story is highly unbelievable, to the point of SciFi movies, and that is what passes for entertainment. I believe Ms. Fielding can do much, much better. I definitely wouldn't recommend this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Convoluted","review":"The only reason I finished this book is because I paid full price for it. I've enjoyed Helen Fielding in the past, but this book made me want to gnaw off my limbs. The characters are thin and insipid. The plot ridiculous in the extreme. I read the positive reviews posted here and wondered if they read a different book. Perhaps someone changed the cover on me? If you go in for the clumsy, ridiculous and poorly written, this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to like it!","review":"I am a big Bridget Jones fan, so I had high hopes. I was so disappointed in this book. I tried, but I couldn't finish it. The characters were hard to keep straight and I didn't care what happened to any of them. Ultimately, my biggest complaint is the use of terrorism as the plot of what is supposed to be a fun beach read. This book needed to choose a genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morton C and nearly no kissing scenes","review":"I can't tell you how glad I was that the kissing scenes were limited.

That was the case with my reading Olivia Joules and yes, it really is that bad. Lots of the reviews on this forum have detailed the bad plotting and characterisation and the bad taste of the subject matter. Others have said that had she not had considerable success with BJ this would never have been published. I can only agree with everyone who gave it a 1-star rating. This is possibly the worst book I've ever read. It's hard to believe Fielding has such disdain for readers or that the publishers would cash-in on her previous work. Buy this second-hand if you must but don't let them benefit any more frlom this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing","review":"I LOVED Bridget Jones and I fell in love with this author.

The book had a horrible plot that could have only been created by too many late night of watching CNN by Ms.Fielding.

I read to get away from the real world!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite enjoyable....","review":"It sounds like the reviewers who did not care for the book may have taken it a bit too seriously.The main character does have an overactive imagination, keep that in mind...it's right in the title!Overall, I enjoyed it. Not as good as the Bridget Jones' books, but a funny main character who kept you turning pages to find out what she'd do next.I do recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She Says it like it is","review":"I really thought that the critical reviews that I read about this book were bunk. But the authors are entitled to their misguided opinions.I just loved that Ms. Fielding was brave enough to make the real life terrorists the bad guys. If only the Hollywood types that acted brave at the end could really be counted on to do so. I thought the book was funny, ironic in the use of typical Al Jazeera propoganda-and just when will some of the critics of this book wake up to the real threats in the world. Ignoring the threat is the REAL disservice to the victims of the terror. I think that everyone should \\"Stop, Breathe and Think\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"College Student","review":"At first, I found it hard to keep reading this book. Fielding's flowery writing style got on my nerves. I decided to keep on reading, however, and I'm very glad that I did.Oliva Joules is a brand new kind of heroine. The book had me laughing out loud so often that my sister had me keep her updated with the happenings in the book as I read it so that she could be in on the fun.

Yeehaw!Its readable, a bit slow in the beginning, but enjoyable all the same. Keeps your interest and is a bit sensational. (And why not?) It seems Olivia has built up all these talents and lifeskills to become an instant recruit for MI6. She chases after hunky men, the hunky men chase after her. Shipboard romances, globetrotting, money, designer clothes, scuba diving, etc. Olivia does it all in quirky little novel that would make great aquatic (bubble bath, poolside, beach) reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Spy Series for Bridget Jone's Fans??","review":"Wow! What a unique book! Who would have though that the author of Bridget Jones could write such a thrilling spy novel? I am truly impressed with Helen Fielding ability as an author. She has created the character of Olivia Joules with women in mind. She's smart, she sexy, she's fashionable and she's mysterious. What more could you ask for? She's the perfect character!

Well, then I tried listening at home . . . couldn't do it. not funny at all. no memorable chacters. no solid plot. very boring. and the moment I noticed Fielding got political (suddenly the character was mentioning osama bin laden and al qaeda and blah blah blah) I decided not to continue, and I got my money back . . . in cash.and then I pretty mush swore off Helen Fielding and picked up Sophie Kinsella (same idea - funny bimbo has funny stuff happen to her and mess with her work life/love life/family life/social life etc etc.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure ESCAPISM - Not to be taken seriously","review":"I loved this book - I seriously do not understand the reviewers who are pulling it to pieces. Look at the title - it's pure escapism - obviously taking a dig a James Bond - and when did a Bond movie ever tie up all the plot lines? Sure, the editing's bad, the characters are thin, and yes, parts could be considered racial if that sort of thing bothers you - but I don't read a book like this expecting a literary masterpiece - (for that I will anxiously await the next Harry Potter!) - it's a quick fun read and should come with a warning on the cover 'NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY' especially for those reviewers who can't tell the difference.

Whether she's poking fun at Hollywood or herself, the main character, Olivia Joules, is someone we all wouldn't mind being: Picture Meg Ryan playing a McGuyver-type character. If nothing else, Olivia's \\"List for Living\\" is something worth writing down and taping to your refrigerator, as it includes great tidbits like: No one is thinking about you.

I started using it again a few weeks ago. It froths milk fine. But as a few other reviews have alluded, it is fragile. But not only for the thin glass. I noticed this when I first got it, and have been extra careful.My issue is with the plunger. Most parts are stainless steel... except a brittle plastic disk which holds the screen and a second stainless steel disc onto the handle shaft. The brittle plastic developed small cracks and finally broke last week, rendering the whole frother useless. I wrote the company asking for a replacement part, which I told them I was happy to purchase. But all they did was send me a canned response telling me to buy a new one if it was out of its 30 day warranty. More junk for the landfill. I cannot believe folks keep buying crap that breaks easily. At least try another brand, which I am going to do. It's not like these folks have a stranglehold on the Milk frother market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, Another John Conlee CD","review":"This one should quench your thirst for a John Conlee cd that has most of his big hits. The only drawback, in my opinion, is that it is a live cd. I'm partial to original recordings. Although, John doesn't sound much different now than he did back in the 70's. As far as live albums go, it is excellent. I've heard from a reliable source that he will be coming out with a greatest hits vol. 2 and a re-release of his 20 greatest hits VERY soon. I highly recommend seeing this guy in concert...good show, music and other memorabilia for sale, and as many autographs as you'd like.

Although the characters are primarily one-dimensional \\"types,\\" they are placed in a situation fraught with comic possibilities. The brilliantly amateur church play directed by prima donna Glenn Close is a great comic touch. Julianne Moore is great as the dim sister who knows more secrets than she's telling.

But when another friend who has completely different tastes told me about it a month ago, I had to see it.This movie is so elegantly crafted via Patricia Neal, Glenn Close, and Charles S. Dutto that it is certainly worth seeing twice, as I did, and owning. The first time I didi myself and the movie a disservice by being a little drowsy while seeing it. That has the same effect of being a little drowsy while going to the museum. And yet, the treasures of writing, character play, plot etc. asre so powerful, elgant and vivid in this movie you will not miss the best parts, and love the while at the end, as you laugh from the heart.Worth seeing. Give it a chance, and youl will wenjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Your Attention","review":"If you want to speak intelligibly about literary fiction from the New South but don't want to go to the trouble of reading it (though you should), watch Cookie's Fortune. It is a quirky, entertaining comedy that explores a setting, themes and characters familiar to the contemporary southern tradition. The anachronistic emphasis on blood ties and legacy is given a funny work-out with Glenn Close leading a fine ensemble cast. Close's character has a headstrong sense of entitlement that is more than anyone can handle, including herself. There is some mystery and suspense balled up in this story that owing to its southern tradition is less frenetic than, say, an urban comedy, but is no less compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"Robert Altman really ticks me off. He makes so many great movies that are either truly innovative or impressive for what you think he was trying to do, and lately it seems like he's taking on assignments just to pay his rent. This movie is so strictly formulaic, that's the only explanation I can think of as to why he did it.The acting is mostly good, with Patricia Neal and Charles S. Dutton giving their usual fine performances. Most of the others were okay, but the parts played by Chris O'Donnell, Liv Tyler, and Julianne Moore could have been played by just about anybody with probably little difference. What bothered me the most had to have been Glenn Close. Either the experience of playing Norma Desmond on Broadway and Cruella DeVille has gone to her head or there was a reason she was cast in those roles. I'm hoping it's the former and she's not just being typecast, but you have to wonder.Generally a very disappointing movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"not altmans' usual...","review":"i have seen all of altman's other films and found them excellent..until now... there was some really good acting(glenn close playing her usual psycho!), patricia neal..who i was happily suprised to see.. and charles dutton was really good..liv tyler should take some more acting lessons and chris odonnell too... it was a hard story to get into to but i did like the ending, it was very appropriate... not a great movie, but okay...."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Quirky\\"","review":"This movie was certainly different, quirky describes it best. It was a nice surprise to see Patricia Neal. Charles S. Dutton played his role well. Julianne Moore played a character that was hard to get attached to. Live Tyler did an excellent job with her role. The storyline was a little hard to hold onto. Not as interesting as I would have liked. It was different, for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Cookie Crumbles","review":"This is defintiely not one of Altman's best. I don't think it would even make it to his so-so list either. Gone is the bite of The Player or Mash. Gone are believable emotions like in Short Cuts or Nashville. Someone allowed Glenn Close to go far too close over the top and I was very disappointment with Julianne Moore's performance. Chales Dutton was very likeable (but, then he always is). I think the only thing I did get a kick out of was seeing Patricia Neal on the screen. This is not a good film. And I am a proud Altman fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A complicated story with humor and pathos","review":"The film gets better with each viewing.

I like quirky characters, unusual plots, offbeat humor, etc., but none of the above were particularly outstanding in this film. I didn't empathize with any of the characters.

Avoid this one, it's a stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if You Are Looking For A Nap!","review":"This had to be one of the most boring films I have seen in a long time. Slow-moving is fine in a film if there is something to catch the viewer's interest. Such was not the case here. The characters other than Willis and Cookie were completely annoying, and if this film was supposed to exemplify Southern Charm, then KEEP ME AWAY FROM THE SOUTH! The first 119 minutes were slow. The credits moved along nicely, however.The soundtrack was completely annoying. Unless you are a die-hard Robert Altman fan, stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Southern stereotypes, anyone?","review":"If i were from the South, i'd be tremendously angry at yet another movie portraying Southerners as a collection of eccentric, dim-witted, or eccentric-dim-witted people. What's with the stereotype? Charles Dutton is the only character close to being real and lovable. Everyone else's performance is way over the top, especially Glenn Close, doing an encore of her role as Cruella DeVille in \\"101 Dalmatians\\". The love story between Liv Tyler and Chris O'Donnell is totally unnecesary, and Julianne Moore's character is pathetic. The funniest scene is when Donald Moffat explains the linguistic origin of the word \\"Awe\\" during a game of Scrabble, and that only lasts some 15 seconds (not enough to save the whole fiasco). The rest of the movie is a total waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Altman","review":"Intrigue surrounding the suicide of a crazy old lady in small Southern town. Rober Altman's best film since Short Cuts. Unique and mellow, full of wacky characters and down-home charm. Some wonderful performances too; especially by Patricia Neil and Charles Dutton.

Yet, his verses for children are heavily grounded in the joys of childhood, specifically one that was born into a family that is well off. He makes occasional references to children less privileged, but references to the nurse constantly in attendance make it clear that this child does not want.Other than that, the verses are suitable for reading to modern children, especially as a quick bedtime story. The combination of imagination and play is a powerful one in the lives of children and these short verses will help stimulate the mind of a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book to grow up with","review":"I grew up with this book.

I just gave this book as a baby gift to my great-niece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wordsworth edition, A Child's Garden of Verses -- Classic","review":"Robert Louis Stevenson's, A Child's Garden of Verses, is a classic because it develops your child's perceptions. It moves from close up observation: the garden, the quilt on the bed, the window and things in the room, to abstracts and distant perceptions: wind, rain, the swing, one's shadow, and lands over the seas.There is a reason children who are read to develop keen minds, literacy skills, and good relationships with parents, and this is one of the best early childhood reading resources. The Wordsworth edition with fanciful illustrations by Charles Robinson gives the child an extra imaginative leap through time and space. Memorization of Stevenson's poems is worth the pleasure and practice, to develop your mind and your child's. The verses will pop up when you least expect them and will stay with you through the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT EDITION OF A GREAT WORK.","review":"It would be interesting to find out just how many editions of this particular work have been published over the years. Needless to say, this work by Robert Louis Stevenson is one of the granddaddys of all poetry books for young (and not so young) children. If you do not have a copy in your child's library, you really should have. This particular edition is illustrated by Eric Kincaid and of the several various versions published that I own or have read, this is one of my favorite. I simply like the art work. Mr. Kincaid has used soft colors and presented his illustrations in a true Victorian style, something I like. The clothing of the children, the background, etc. are all very well done and done in fine detail. Not only do you get a book of classic writing, but you also receive a feast for the eye with this one. Very much recommend this edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Child's Garden of Verses","review":"I ordered this edition because the review said it had beautiful color illustrations - This book is in black and white - there is no color and it's very small - only around 6 inches tall _ I am sending it back - how very misleading!

That she has many complex sides to her still emerging personallity. The \\"Bedtime Story\\", although it never cracked into the top fourty, is inspiring and inchanting. Many people will say that it is weird and not written well, but if you listen to the words very well you'll a serious message. This message is about stared all over. The song gives hints that a new and improved Madonna will come. The song makes you think so you want fall asleep. Thats the real reason why the song is called \\"Bedtime Story\\". Although some songs sound like they from EROCTICA, the album a much improved and new Madonna.It's wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Comeback","review":"I am going to make this review short and sweet and to the point. \\"Bedtime Stories\\" was the album released after \\"Erotica.\\" It is a fact that Madonna lost quite a few fans and was highly criticized after her Erotica album release along with her book titled \\"Sex.\\" So you are probably wondering what this previous album has to do with this review? Well, Bedtime Stories softened Madonna's image since her previous album distorted her image and cost her quite a few fans. I feel like Bedtime Stories was a very complete album for Madonna; however as stated this album was to \\"clean Madonna's image up from her previous criticized album.\\" I feel like this album was not recognized for how good it was. Hit songs off this album include: (In order of how they were released)1.Secret 2. Take A Bow 3. Bedtime Story 4. Human Nature. My personal all-time favorite song is off this album and that is \\"Take A Bow.\\" I Hope this helped!"},{"rating":"2","title":"smooth record from madonna","review":"up until erotica, her albums were primarily dance music with a few personal ballads here and there. With this album and ever since, she's been experimenting with different styles of music, and it started with Bedtime Stories, on which she did mostly r&b/hip hop flavoured songs by working with babyface and dallas austin. Since then she's done albums that touch on electronica, guitar ballads and now she's returning to her traditional dance music roots. I was proud to have been a witness to madonna's musical evolution over the past 20 years and along the way came this great album which had some of the best work and music videos of her career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent album, a dissapointment on the whole.","review":"I don't know what I was expecting when I took this CD off the shelf. But this CD was definetly not it. What this record lacks is a really good fast song. The ballads go on and on, most of them love songs that get repitive and old. Here is where you will long for the girl power attitude of her earlier albums like Like a Prayer and True Blue. Only three songs on this album I would even think of calling them *dance songs*, Don't Stop, Survival, and Human Nature. However, these three were awesome and I found my feet tapping to the beat. But they can't compare to earlier songs like Borderline and Till Death Do Us Part. On the flip side however, the songs were well written and if your a fan of endless love ballads, I would reccomend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bedtime Stories was better than I expected","review":"When I listened to Bedtime Stories I was impressed with the music. Some of the standout tracks include Secret, Human Nature, and Take a Bow. If you are a fan of Madonna's earlier cds, I would strongly recommend that you purchase Bedtime Stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another mp3 download with NO quality control","review":"Bedtime Stories is one of my favorite Madonna albums..... but on this mp3 version, the song, \\"Secret\\", comes on in the middle of the first guitar chord (essentially mucking up the intro). WTF??? When are record companies going to do some quality control on their download releases? This is inexcusable. I'm done downloading crap quality edits, remasters, and the like. Wise up you greedy, stupid record companies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The shaky one","review":"Madonna could have been on top of her game in 1994. She should have swallowed her pride and opened her heart with Pat Leonard's help. Instead, this album sounds like trail mix tastes. A bunch of over-rated producers who were hip at the time(a real joke in retrospect!)were hired in a desperate attempt by record company execs to rescue Madge from the abyss that followed Erotica, Sex and Body of Evidence. Madonna's self-cofidence was shaken, but her vulnerability is polished and streamlined into weak,over-produced nonsense. Inside of Me is worth a listen, although it sounds similar to a couple of other ballads she has made over the years. Secret is the only real standout track, unless you thought Take A Bow was a great song! This is definitely only worth exploring after you have bought her other albums. Buy GHV2 if you just want the hits. Even Madge doesn't like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED?","review":"I have always admired Madonna's music and personality. But I have to admit that \\"Bedtime Stories\\" is her worst album since TRUE BLUE. Cheesy lyrics and boring tunes. In two words: commercial junk. Madonna betrays herself by forgetting what her music is all about. There's only one song that makes it through: Human Nature. The rest of the album should fall into oblivion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacklustre Lazy Lullabies","review":"As an album, Bedtime Stories is insipid, uninspired, boring and a tedious aural exercise. I know the intention is to do some ballads, but Madge seems to drag her feet vocally and comes across as lackadaisical.Some tracks are pretty tuneless, think Love Tried To Welcome Me and Sanctuary. The album could do with some rigorous editing to whittle down the set to the really catchy ones. And release this as an EP.Two stars for the hits - Secret and Take A Bow. The latter produced by Whats-His-Face.If you do not own this, you may just want to get Celebration which contains these songs.Looking at the brighter side, Bedtime Stories is a great cure for insomnia!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blended well with the R&B hits of that year, yet that funky!","review":"Madonna's album \\"Bedtime Stories\\" was a much needed lift from the David Letterman show controversy she faced in 1994. I think this album made me completely forget about that for good. It balanced well with the R&B and hip-hop of TLC, Notorious B.I.G., Aaliyah, R. Kelly and others that year. Survival, Secret, Inside of Me, Sanctuary, Human Nature, Don't Stop and others were that good. And how Santuary fades out and the dramatic Bedtime Stories begins just brings a stark mode to the album. This album also has the beautiful Take a Bow, of which Babyface produced and sang background on. I also liked the songs she did with the underrated Dave Hall, who also had several hits as a producer between 1994 and 1995. Madonna is so good at reinventing herself and doing something different each album. This album is one of them and one of her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"her best since debut","review":"this is the madonna cd to have from the 90's .it reminds me of her first one.she sounds at ease working with dallas austin&babyface.this disc has r-n-b all over it except for the bjork track which is unique in it's own way.this disc is far better than ray of light&erotica.human nature is a great 2nd tier mary j.bliege track.secret&take a bow hold up really well.madonna sounds alright well as best as she can.the production works rather well."},{"rating":"1","title":"rather bland...","review":"like when every madonna album comes out, i rush to the store the day it comes out and immediately buy it. in this case, it was no different. but this time i think i only listened to it a few times after purchasing it.

I originally didn't want to buy this one, but I did, because I liked 'Bedtime Story', a track that would be more suitable for 1998's 'Ray of Light' instead, but it is also the best Madonna video ever. What I liked about 'Bedtime Stories' is the R&B/sort-of-dance beat to the songs, but what I didn't really like was the fact that it was...mabye a bit too mellowed. Still it wasn't that bad at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So Album","review":"I \\"LOVE\\" all of Ms. Madonnas albums to the extreme with the exception of this one and Erotica.

I enjoyed some of the grooves, especially the later ones like \\"Sanctuary\\" and \\"Bedtime Story\\" the first few times I listened but tired quickly of the whole album. If you want synth-pop dance music, go buy something intelligent like Everything But The Girl's \\"Walking Wounded.\\" It's quantum levels better than \\"Bedtime Stories.\\" And if you're a young woman looking for a role model in a modern pop star, try Chrissie Hynde, Suzanne Vega or Joni Mitchell.

After the controversial erotica album with its steamy lyrics and the controversy around the sex book Madonna wanted to tone down the sex factor on this album. Secret is the absolut standout track on this release. Take a bow is a really good track as well. I love the lyrics to this song. Something that is quite funny is that I did not know is that Madonna actually has two tracks with the same name in her collection, i.e., forbidden love. One time on this release and another time on the confessions album. The book-let is really nice. Madonna looks quite normal and the blonde look at the time was quite flattering indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"When I was 3or4 i couldn't go to sleep with out hearing the album.10 years later now that i found this it might start again to where i fall asleep playing this.This album is my lullaby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Criminally Underrated","review":"This albu is absolutely amazing, why is it so hated. \\"Secret\\" is terrific, \\"Inside of Me\\" is lyrically her best, and \\"Take A Bow\\" left me awestruck.

She does it very well too. Bounce along with the first track Survival, where Madonna laments on her career and how she's survived, or the thumping I'd Rather Be Your Lover. The album also contains two of her biggest hits from the 90's, the lush ballad Take A Bow, and the sing a long Secret. Madonna pays homage to her critics in Human Nature, which is one of her shining moments in her entire career. My favorite track is the Bjork written Bedtime Story, Madonna's very first venture into the realm of techno music, excellent track. The only filler I could find on this album was the song Don't Stop. Love Tried To Welcome Me and Sanctuary are some of Madonna's most underrated songs. This is a pleasant album to listen to, so give it a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best","review":"I don't really like old Madonna.

I consider this Madonna's smooth album, something nice to sit back and relax to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, underrated album","review":"Any apprehension I had about buying this album disappeared the minute I put it in my CD player. I've always LOVED \\"Secret\\" and \\"Take A Bow\\", and I wondered what the rest of the album held in store. I found the title to be very appropriate. The overall feeling is very soothing, from the grooves of \\"Survival\\" to the beat of \\"Secret\\". Nearly every song on this album is cohesive and well-written. \\"Inside of Me\\" (about Madonna's mother!) is a very pretty, sad song. \\"Human Nature\\" is even well integrated. I've always thought \\"Bedtime Story\\" was weird, but it fits when paired with \\"Sanctuary\\". The album closes with \\"Take A Bow\\", a beautiful song that is timeless, and understandably Madonna's biggest hit. If you are a Madonna fan and don't own this album, buy it now! You won't be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bedtime Stories Is Beautiful!","review":"Many people have said they don't like this CD because Madonna changed her style to a more R&B type mix. Madonna is always changing her style. If you put this, Madonna, Like A Prayer and Music together you couldn't tell it was the same artist. This CD draws you in with quality songs. The first track Survival is one of my favorites. Secret is my absolute favorite on the CD. Take A Bow is a nice ballad, and Bedtime Stories is a innovative track with a unique video. So many of the songs are highlights it's hard to name them all. If you are a Madonna fan, your collection is not complete until you purchase this. It's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling 'Stories'","review":"After the lukewarm response to EROTICA, Madonna forged ahead and again chose another musical form--r&b/hip-hop--to convey her music. That said, BEDTIME STORIES remains my personal favorite Madonna album to date, if only because there is not one piece of filler to be found. From the gorgeous opening grooves of 'Survival' to the closing of 'Take A Bow', this record is all about substance. Addressing her personal life in much the same way she did with LIKE A PRAYER, she not only tributes her mother on the beautiful 'Inside of Me', but snaps back at her critics with 'Human Nature', a biting and almost tongue-in-cheek take on what she thinks about said critics, proclaiming \\"Oops I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex....Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about YOU\\". It truly remains one of her most brilliant records, and was unjustly overlooked at radio. All in all, an album that should go down as one of her masterpieces(along with LIKE A PRAYER and RAY OF LIGHT)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I love every song on this album the Queen couldn't go wrong on this cd. I totally love it and that's all I have to say. But my favorite track is track 6 Human Natural if anyone see the video they know that she wasn't playing. I love it and glad she put it out.

I decided I needed additional cradle sheets and ordered this item. The sheets were way too big! I actually wondered if I had ordered crib sheets in error but they were not that big. They were also kind of scratchy. It is weird that I ordered the same brand of sheets as the one I liked and these were of such different quality. Not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT RIGHT","review":"I, too, recieved the wrong item. When I inquired,they sent me a replacement but it too was not the item pictured.

This cd with the exception of the first song, is a snoozer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely lacking in heart and soul","review":"I love Jan Akkerman's ealier \\"Live\\" album from the '70's (recorded in Montreux). That band was so tight, the music so unexpected and passionate.This release couldn't be more staid and dull.Sure, the playing is well rehearesed and tight. But the band plays with too much restraint and with too few moments of release. Most songs are mid-tempo or slower and never build up much steam. Disc 2 is better--more rocking blues , but still leaves me frustrated and a little bit bored. Almost nowhere do I sense the invention I expected or the improvisation promised by an earlier reviewer.It's nice to have the Focus material, but while it is faithful in its reproduction, it's sadly heartless in its execution.Overall, I guess I'm glad I own this. And it is growing on me. But I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"the bonus DVD is incredible","review":"I would buy this just for the bonus DVD. It is a full length concert that is just plain awesome. It is so good that it must have been staged in Paris just for the purpose of making a drop-dead good DVD. Amy Lee's performance is just incredible. If you are even remotely a fan, this is a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the concert bonus DVD an added plus","review":"I am a huge fan of Evanescence and own all their music CD wise not singles. I loved each and every song off their first CD so of course I enjoy listening to all the songs here on their live concert of their first CD. The added benifit to me was track five when they did Korn's thoughtless. Also in my viewpoint the last track missing was very powerful music wise and lryics wise. Then for all their fans out there adding in the live concert on DVD was just an added bonus as I see it, because you really get your money worth that way. So if you want a live CD with an added DVD of the concert plus the sound quality is actually very good, then pick this CD/DVD up and savor their music by yourself or with your friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"when is a live show not a live show?","review":"When is a live show not a live show? When the editor is an ADHD sufferer who forgets to take his ritalin. After 15 minutes of watching this dvd I gave up the forlorn hope of seeing at least 3 consecutive seconds of guitar playing, singing or drumming. After 20 minutes I was in danger of having a seizure. After 25 minutes I turned off the TV, put on the cd, closed my eyes and imagined I was watching them. Hard to give a proper score because there are two products. So I'd give the cd 3 and the dvd 0."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anywhere But Home DVD","review":"Awesome DVD. If you like Evanescence, you are going to love this concert video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who mixed this?","review":"This CD was poorly produced and mixed. It sounds like a bootlegged copy -- as it if were recorded by an audience member with a recorder tucked away in their trench coat. Or perhaps the lead singer's mic wasn't working and the audio was being picked up by mics by the drummer or the guitarist. I like Evanescence and their music -- but as a real audiophile, I was absolutely appalled and disturbed by the way this cd was mixed. It is very difficult to listen to and to enjoy. Very \\"tinny\\" and tough to hear the vocals. I've purchased well over 500 CD's in my lifetime, and this is one of only a very select handful that I feel I should be able to return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake concert!","review":"First, I am an Evanescence fan. That's why it's painful to have to admit that this DVD/CD \\"live\\" set is horribly disappointing. The only part of the concert that is live is the voice of Amy Lee. Everything else is pre-recorded. No wonder some of the reviewers here state that the band sounds great. Of course they do. All they had to do was show up and pretend to play. That's why you don't see any clear shots of the musicians in the concert footage. A sour guitar note or a stray drum beat is ever heard. It's all hocus-pocus. What a shame that the fans don't get to see and hear a real live performance in this DVD. Save your money and just by a traditional Evanescence studio CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amy Lee's vocals lack power","review":"The the quality of the band's music is good and heavier than Fallen, but the footage is edited for an ADD MTV music video audience. Amy Lee's vocals don't sound as good live as her studio recordings. She sounds better on the softer songs, but during the heavy ones her vocals don't have enough presence. In addition, Amy Lee's stage posturing and dancing somewhat imitates Marilyn Manson, and is unattractive and unfeminine. I give the DVD 2 stars, but the CD, I give 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the same thing!","review":"Excited to discover this \\"new album\\", I almost bought this.

I thought that it might be rewarding considering there are a few songs that do not appear on the \\"Fallen\\" album, but the entire thing was somewhat of a disappointment. I usually enjoy watching concert footage, but this time it felt somewhat of a drag. However, this item is not going to be one I return, and all I've said may be influenced sheerly by mood. You may have a different experience than me, so I wish you the best. Happy Listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just did not work for me","review":"I have a number of Evanescence CDs...I gave this one to my brother! Alot of the songs sounded like the same song....I like her 1st album and Open Door...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duped","review":"I love Evanescence, I saw that they had a new CD, I was dumb and rushed out to buy it. No new music, just live. Why didn't they put it on the front that it was live music, anything to try to make money off some duped fans! I am dissatisfied that I was not a more informed consumer. I really don't like the whole thing, more because it was not what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible and lacking in performance","review":"this cd has been terribly recorded. Everything is on the same level and it just sounds flat. Amy needs to concentrate more on her performance and vocals rather than jumping around like an idiot. This cd lacks everything fallen has. But even over that, Origin was by far the greatest album they have come up with. Sad that they never even acknowledge it exists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Of This CD","review":"I don't usually criticize things and especially not Evanescence, but I have to say that this DVD/CD is terrible. It's just awful. Amy Lee apparently can't sing live, nor can the band play live. I love Evanscence; I own \\"Fallen\\" and \\"Origin\\", and I love those, but this was a disappointment. I think Amy and the band should be embarrassed. I have to say this is not worth $25."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD/DVD Combos","review":"I wasn't sure how many stars to give this. I do give the live performance on the CD five stars. But the DVD performance of the setlist was horrible. I couldn't even finish it. The cuts annoyed me horribly and I could only get through one song. I don't what it is, but do the people today have that short attention span. I know for myself I can watch a band for about 2 hours. I'm 21 years old and I couldn't keep up with the cuts that the director decided to use.Anyway, I suggest just getting the CD of this combo off of a friend or iTunes. Amy Lee has an excellent voice live and has energy. I love this band and I can't wait to see them on the Family Values Tour this summer. At least I don't have to deal with the horrible editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing DVD","review":"I recieved the DVD as an early Christmas gift and I must say that it is amazing. Besides having a full concert, the DVD has all the music videos Ev has done so far and behind the scene's footage that is hilarious! The only thing that kept me from giving this a perfect score is that Ben Moody is never mentioned at all...even though he is in three of the four music videos and wrote or co-wrote a majority of the songs. I know he's no longer part of the band and that they need to move forward, but maybe some interviews with the band that even slightly address Ben leaving and Terry joining the group would have added some closure to those who still miss Ben. Honestly though, the real reason I dropped this a point is because the live performance...which is really good...still isn't the best live performance I've seen from them. The second live show I saw them at (in Philly) was a better performance IMO. Still, this is a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"Yes, the video editing of the live convert could have been better. There was far too much flicking between camcera angles. However, it is still a great DVD/CD deal. Evanescence is still awesome, the bundled relase videos is a bonus. Finally in one place you can get all 4 of their videos. And if after watching this DVD, you are not a fan of Evanescence.... someone been planting the wrong flowers on your grave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anywhere But Home","review":"First off, I mainly listen to metal bands from Europe or Eurometal if you will. Evanescence is a huge breath of fresh air to come out of the states! Secondly, I believe if you're new to the band, then Anywhere But Home is a fine place to start. Evanescence prove they can serve up live as well as in the studio! They perform in front of a huge crowd in Paris, France that seems to know every word to every song. In addition, Amy Lee has won my respect as a person and as a band leader! She conducts herself with class, but still rocks out the same, while expressing her gratitude toward her fans! Lastly, Anywhere But Home won't disappoint fans of Evanescence, but most likely will build your respect for already a great band! If you like Evanescence, then I suggest trying out Nightwish and Within Temptation. Both of the following bands are available at Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Live","review":"I bought this CD because I had a gift certificate, and it well exceeded my virtually absent expectations. A lot of people said it was basically Fallen live, but I find that it's much more. My favourite tracks are Missing, Breathe No More and the cover Thoughtless, which aren't on any other Evanescence records I believe. Also, new life is brought to Bring Me to Life (a pun? excellent), which I was getting pretty sick of from constant airplay. Going Under on this album is much better than on Fallen, I find. Overall, the live performance is amazing and I would recommend buying this over Fallen because of the seamless vocals, the added tracks, and the emotion a life performance brings. Go on.. aren't you out buying it yet??"},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to watch","review":"I enjoy Evanescence; they do have some great songs. I'm interested in whether or not they can pull off another successful recording. I doubt it, but time will tell.The DVD is horrible. Quite seriously, if one is prone to seizures, you'll have one watching this performance. The editing never allows the viewer a chance to focus on the performance or the performers. I had to turn away numerous times just to prevent my brain from exploding.This DVD is more of a MTV video than a live concert. If the DVD was only the length of one song, I would have said, \\" It was neat. Overdone, but fun.\\" But for all their songs, it just hurt.There are times the sound track is completely out of sync with the video.I own many live performances and this one is one of the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money - skip this","review":"As a huge Evanescence fan, I was hoping to hear all the songs I love, Amy Lee's amazing voice, plus the energy of a live setting. This album bombs on all counts. She sounds terrible and is off key almost all the time. The instruments sound flat and are frequently inaudible. I would complain about the songs that were left off the cd, but considering how bad the ones they did play sound, maybe it's better they didn't further embarrass themselves. This cd is so bad I wish I could get a refund. Skip it and don't let the disgraceful versions of these songs cloud your memory of what the songs were meant to sound like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately not the greatest","review":"Although I have only listened to the CD, I found this set to be a waste of money. Amy Lee's voice is far from being on key during the early tracks of the CD. Also, the CD was poorly recorded with the crowd screams often drowning out the song.The only part of this CD I found worthwhile was the studio track at the end, Missing. A very good song, but hardly able to justify the entire CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE!","review":"WHAT'S WITH ALL THE BAD REVIEWS.BOTH THE CD AND DVD ARE RECORDED EXCELLENT FOR LIVE MATERIAL.THE ENERGY AND PRESENCE OF THE BAND CHARGES THE AUDIENCE BUT THE SCREAMS NEVER OVERRIDE THE MUSIC'S BLASTING GUITARS AND SEARING VOCALS.DEFINITELY THE BEST BUY FOR 2006!!! GET IT NOW!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much hype","review":"This is a good example of a trash band over hyped. Check out Nightwish, they do the same thing only better, every song on this cd has the same tempo with the same vocals. I am just giving this cd 1 star to lower the rating because the band/singer are that bad. Just like Linkin Park they will only re-release the same 1 or 2 cds for the rest of their career and try to milk them for all the money they are worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Sucks","review":"First my sister buys the recorded crap, then she gets the same crap live with a cover so bad that I lost any and all respect I had for the band. The cover, Thoughtless by Korn, should be avoided at all costs. You are supposed to do covers because you respect a band, NOT because you want to kill everyone's eardrums! Unless you want the same crap you already payed for and a horrible cover, run away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Live!","review":"UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Nothing worse then bands that suck Live!!!!! Good live bands are...Nickelback, Theory of a deadman, incubus, cypress hill, linkinpark. nickelback is a great live show!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ho wants this","review":"seriously why would anybody want the live version of CDs espeacially if its like there audio album. This was the same like there audio album but this is live with 2 more songs thats live, and the 2 more songs were not that great thats a waste of money. And they had the nerve to make this an album if you have the audio version of rock then that artist comes out with the live version with the songs that was on there audio album don't get it cause its a waste of money. So this was not a good its better in audio version."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is not good..","review":"This is not just good, this is amazing..I'm a big evanescence fan and all I can say is that this band is incredible live.you can see the passion, the love.. for all the people who say that they're fake.. and don't think.look at amy while she's playing my immortal at the piano and will understand and she's a good piano player.and please once again, don't say that amy has to lose weight..what the hell do you think? Is it so important?Is it more important than her voice?Althought there is the recorded base under some songs, the band play anyway..have you heard terry playing?he is just great..buy this cd to have great musicthe dvd is just fan watch the behind the scenes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"thought i was having a siezure","review":"i couldnt wait for this to come out, seemed like they would be great live (whatever live means these days cause there is always a backing track running) i also hope they get some new material out soon. anyway i agree with the editing, it doesnt allow you to focus on anything throughout the concert, just when you can see something every trick in the book is used to \\"edit\\" this show. too bad, quite a let down, maybe some people used to this fast paced style wont mind, but hopefully after they get a few more albums done they can try this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the songs, but...","review":"I don't know if all the copies of this CD are like this, but the one I have is messed up. The booklet is labeled all wrong (i.e., My Immortal is labeled as 'Breathe No More') and Whisper is listed as the last song. I was so confused, because it had been a while since I listened to Fallen (plus I lost it) so I didn't remember which songs were titled incorrectly.But, other than that, I love this Cd. I just had to print out a new booklet."},{"rating":"2","title":"kick-ass live","review":"man.i was a big fan of the band when i got their original CD. this one doesnd do them justice. amy lee's voice is gorgeous. but i have yet to see the dvd. its pretty good. i dont normally go out and buy cds but this one is a must have if u are a fan of evanescence. =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Same as \\"Fallen\\", but oh so different!","review":"I first bought \\"Fallen\\" and got saturated with their songs (after quite a number of times).Then got \\"Anywhere but Home\\", and the DVD-CD combo just blew me away. Hit hog heaven again!I feel these live versions are even better than those of \\"Fallen\\"; and, you got new songs as well. This is NOT like you bought the same album twice.Two more comments:- Yes, you can hear the public in the background (and foreground, mind you), but that is part of the magic of live concerts. The Beatles had same screaming when live, and nobody complained about it. C'mon, people!- \\"Missing\\" is actually the LAST track. The Jewel insert places it somewhere else as well, which is wrong. The CDDB Internet listing has the same error. I submitted corrections, but doubt they'll take it. Beware.Other than that, enjoy the fun and the goth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was strongly emotional to me","review":"While passing through some very difficult times in Life, it happened that this album came to fit into the situation so well...Amy Lee has one of the most powerful and emotionally charged voice I have ever heard and particularly in \\"My Immortal\\", she simply devastated my heart.I strongly recommend this album although there are some technical gotchas but they are all compensated by Amy Lee's strong voice and presence.It is outstanding that Amy Lee was able to make the audience sing along \\"My Immortal\\" and getting a highly emotional response from them, considering the French being a little bit \\"hostile\\" to English language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major letdown...","review":"I love this band. They are the only band I saw this year in concert. However, I've downloaded a few non-official pro-shot shows that put this cluster-[...] of a production to absolute shame. What a piece of [...]. Let's see how many cuts we can make in the least amount of time possible. I saw more of the band standing on the floor 100 feet from the damn stage using my buddy's binoculars than this absolute sham of a live video. Note to the band : The behind the scenes footage and bloopers were great and you're fun to watch..but fire the idiots who filmed/edited and/or produced this piece of [...]. Amy, you're listed as executive producer, so if that means you were involved in this...then as an executive producer, you're a great singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay for Evanescence!!! (No, I couldn't think of a better title...)","review":"To be honest, I bought Anywhere But Home for the bonus DVD. I expected the Evanescence music videos, which I had never seen, and I was not disappointed. The CD itself (and part of the DVD) is live concert footage from Paris. All the songs from Fallen are performed on live (with the sole exception of 'Hello'), and the band's songs 'Farther Away' and 'Breathe No More' are also performed live. There is a bonus studio track, 'Missing', which was cut at the last minute from Fallen. This track is beautiful and I love it to death.I can understand why some people were disappointed that this is \\"only a live album\\", but the DVD is awesome. As I mentioned before, it shows the concert in Paris, the music videos, and it also has special features which include bloopers and interviews with the band members. (And Amy Lee making Jello shots, LOL.) It's worth the money and I'm glad I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it for the CD and consider the DVD a bonus.","review":"I was really looking forward to watching this DVD. However, I have to agree with the other reviews on here. I didn't time anything but I swear that there was a cut every 5 seconds...the longer cuts were of the audience! If they did decide to grace us with a shot of Amy singing it was from the crowd with hands in the way! And the bonus \\"behind the scenes\\" material is nothing special. If you are a diehard fan you will appreciate it, but if you are a passing fan you will probably not enjoy watching Amy rollerblade, throw furniture in a bathroom and burp. These are not drunken rock and roll antics...but the antics of some high school seniors with a video camera. Anway, I love the live CD! Love the music videos! But please give us a real concert DVD....not edited by someone with their finger on the cut button."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful DVD, you will need a new pair of eyes","review":"This band is very talented and it would have been a great DVD if only who ever produced this DVD tried to watch it himself. The cuts are very short and before you can focus on one scene it is gone. If this is your favorite band you don't get to see it! Compare it to falling down from a window trying to make out the people in the windows you are passing by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Let me start off by saying I'm a huge Evanescence fan and I love Fallen. But Anywhere But Home was disappointing. It's actualy just a Live cd with only 2 new songs not on Fallen. The cd doesn't even say anywhere on it that it's a live cd with not really much new. I felt very cheated out of my money. PLus her voice isn't too great live. It's good I guess bc it's more raw ...but I much rather listen to Fallen over this anyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad Recording","review":"Evanescense is a very entertaining band live but this CD does not justify Evanescence live. Anywhere But Home has to be the worse live mainstream release I have ever heard. If anybody is a concert bootleg shopper, you could find better live shows. For this CD, there is way to much emphasis on the audience so you could barely hear Amy singing. The DVD isn't bad, its just not properly mixed. Watch evanescence at a real concert and you'll understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty much same as Fallen CD","review":"This is a great CD, just be aware that it is just a live version of the Fallen album. This is a live show they did in Paris and there are a couple new songs on this so if you are debating between the two CDs, I would get this one. It also comes with a bonus DVD of their live show so you can actually watch the concert as well which I liked. Personally, I have both this CD and the Fallen album (because this came out after Fallen) but I don't regret buying either. Like I said, if you are debating between Fallen or this, get this one. It is well worth it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"This is a great value. The included DVD of backstage on their tour and the music videos makes this a great value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only I could hear over all the screaming","review":"I was very let down by this album. I don't know who did the clean up on these songs but it stinks. You can certainly tell it's a live recording - half the time you can't even hear the band over the shrill screams of audience members. I own several other live albums and have not noticed this problem in them.For example, Sarah McLachlan's live album \\"Mirrorball\\". While there are some sounds from the audience at the beginings of the songs, you can actually HEAR the songs once they start. Not the case with this. At times you can't hear the band playing, others you can just bearly hear Amy Lee singing, and almost constantly is the shrill, annoying screams of the audience, which personally, I find very distracting.They should have done a bit more editing of this before putting it out. If you're trying to complete your Evanescence collection, this is probably something you'll want but as far as for the sheer entertainment for listening to, stick to \\"Fallen\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying Live Music CD","review":"The only reason I bought this CD is because I didn't realize that it is a concert CD. I detest concert CDs because, as another reviewer stated, all the cheering is really annoying, and I especially dislike it when lead singers stop singing so the crowd can fill in....which happens here. There was nothing on the CD jacket indicating that it was a concert recording, which is ALSO annoying, and now I have wasted my money. I love Evanescence, but not this particular recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely incredible DVD.","review":"This is one of the best music DVD's that I've ever seen, hence why I purchased it. Some of the best music videos around. Well worth adding to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Screw Brittany Spears, we've got Amy Lee!","review":"A nice refreshing break from mainstream poo. Evanescence has awoken music from the dead.Everybody's Fool-Everybody who doesn't love this song is a fool. This is my favorite song.It beats everything I've ever heard. It's deep, and thinck with rich instrumentals, not puny, simple chord structures and shallow lyrics.Must buy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, very bad.","review":"I can hardly call this a live dvd. It's more like a live performance with a lot of editing, when I say a lot, I mean it. When playing live, they keep the camera on a band member for less then a second before switching cameras! All these special effects going on really hurt your eyes. I mean, why would like to see a piece of footage in color for a second and then turned into black and white? Sadly, Amy Lee's voice live also is weak. (For all you Nightwish fans out there, you can see the comparison of Amy's voice to Tarja's...)The only good part I found on this dvd was the extra footage. A true Evanescence fan would love this part.The menu quality is pretty good as well. Something you don't normally expect coming out of a live dvd. They've even added a little easter egg into it.Not unless you are a hardcore Evanescence fan that you should buy this dvd...it will give you a headache, litterally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yea, but...","review":"I was quite eager to pick this little guy up when I first heard it had been released. I'm a huge fan of the band, as they are one of the first female fronted Goth bands to do well... ever!But the editing killed me. I can't watch it. Imagine if you will the Blare Witch done at 3000 mph with a fancier zoom lens. There has got to be about a million cuts per minute and no way to get a sense of what's going on.I truly love to watch a band play live, but this is too much like trying to see a coked out fly through a dirty water glass.I would have been okay with maybe the first song or two being like that to induce a felling of excitement. But when it doesn't end and they're playing a slower song with the camera jumping about like a speed freak toad, I just have to leave the room.Whoever made this did not have art in mind.But it does beg the question: if this is what they're churning out, what does that say about our kid's attention spans?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm so dizzy my head is spinning","review":"Dizzy, I'm so dizzy my head is spinningLike a whirlpool it never endsAnd it's You girl makin' it spinYou're making me dizzy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as 'Fallen'","review":"Fallen is an incredible album.

Unfortunately, this live CD really does not deliver. The audio is just horrific and for the first half, the songs really douns like someone put a tape player on stage and had some dudes in the background play to it. Luckily, the second half is somewhat better.If you're interested in the DVD that comes with it, though, this is much more interesting.

I have all of their albums and just recently got the Transfusion CD. Lydia sounds wonderful and maybe even better than 30 years ago! Her band still sounds great too. They still have the same sound as on those early albums. Sounds like you're listening to a release from around 1973 or earlier! If you liked the earlier Cold Blood albums then get this because it's excellent! Glenn Signal Hill, CA"},{"rating":"2","title":"toilet seat","review":"This is a very nice looking toilet seat.

Solid wood would cost moreor are stained some un-natural color..The one that was sent to me must have been made by an utter rookie in someoverseas plant. The veneers on the top lid have discoloration flaws in the wood and contact cement (or glue) stainsat almost every veneer seam.

The memory is the same as I'd upgraded the old one approx. 1 year ago. I'm still \\"playing\\" with it to see what I'm able to do but so far am VERY impressed with the Windows Photo Gallery that comes with Vista. I can edit my pictures with one program whereas before I had to use 2-3 programs. I also really like the fact that it has slots for memory cards on the front making it so much easier to import my pictures with my SD card.

I assumed that \\"natural wood\\" meant that the product was made of cherry. In fact, it was pine or fir painted to look like cherry.

I hope Amazon reads these reviews so that they can edit the advertising. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice looking, well made","review":"The seat appears to be well made, and looks quite nice. I personally think that the idea of having a dark cherry seat on a white toilet bowl is itself a bit odd, though, so you might want to think long and hard about how it will look. I put it in a small toilet-only room with dark red walls and a white door, and it seems to work.An aside: it occurs to me that if a woman has a tendency to fall into the bowl when her husband leaves the toilet seat up, this toilet seat could save their marriage. :^) When a person is half-asleep, a white toilet looks more or less the same whether the seat is up or down. Not so with this dark seat -- once a woman gets used to seeing it, it is hard to imagine that she would ever sit without first putting the seat down.Oh, and wood doesn't feel cold when you sit on it, which is nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice look","review":"Although it is a simulated finish the look is elegent and so far seems well built.

I enjoyed it thoroughly and would give it an 8 of 10 or four stars ****. I liked how the story was told in three points of view and how it went into detail. At the beginning the story was a little boring because it was over descriptive and there wasn't any action or conversation, but at the middle and the end it became more of a story than a description. Another problem was at the beginning of the story, the characters weren't introduced yet and the perspectives switched about every three paragraphs so I didn't know who was thinking and it confused me. I would recommend it to anyone in high school or older. When the boy was emotional the sentences would be run-ons, which I had mixed feelings about because they were run-ons but they conveyed his feelings better than a regular sentence ever could.

However, I believed the story was repetitive and predictable. It was mainly told from the perspective of an old man. Much of the narration is in fragmented sentences, in which the characters' emotions are poorly articulated. A big portion of the story involves the old man stating his disapproval of his wife's obstinacy. The old couple abandons their home, finds a child, makes it to a refugee camp, and comes back home. The events have no effect on their perspective of each other or life.I found the beliefs of the characters of I Am The Clay to be interesting. They believed in spirits that protect them, despite the hardships they had been through.I preferred The Chosen, the author's previous book; the characters of that book articulate more than their most superficial feelings."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Am the Clay","review":"This is a riveting, well-paced book.

The hero prosecuted the heroines father in a well-publicized trial several years ago & she hates him because her father died in prison. She went from the lap of luxury to living in poverty and working at a dead end job while finishing her college education. Read it to find out how they deal with the past, how their relationship will affect his chances for becoming appointed as a judge, and how they deal with his unpleasant ex-wife and her even more unpleasant boss. In the end, compromises are made and all obstacles are overcome as they realize that there is nothing more important than being together."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Italian in sight!","review":"A riches to rags to riches romance with a basketful of little side issues. Marketed as a revenge novel but that's all over and done with in the early chapters. The cover says it all. The heroine Tanis is a ray of giving warmth and optimism in the somewhat bleak life of Giles, a divorced QC in danger of losing access to his young children. Tanis's rather notorious past history also means that Giles must make a tough decision about his future ambitions.(Which could be interpreted as Tanis getting her revenge after all...but that's really going too deep.) Unashamedly both Giles and Tanis gain a lot from being together and it is poignant as they drift apart. Thank goodness the parameters of the genre mean that a HEA is compulsory.

It was entertaining and I didn't want to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy.... or Reality????","review":"Imagine you had no knowledge of your parents. Maybe you didn't even know your race still existed (or ever did). Put yourself in Shana's shoes (or lack of them).You are the unwitting and unwilling child of prophecy. Your mother, you never knew. Your father is still hunting you for the crime of your birth.Raised by dragons, the only \\"family\\" you've ever known, you are cast out because you do not conform. You do not belong and can never be \\"Kin.\\"Follow Shana as she learns about life, love, treachery, friendship and, above all, herself.The Elvenbane is a classic fantasy tale, with a twist. None of the races (elves, humans, dragons) are how you have ever seen them presented before.Prepare to be shocked as only Norton and Lackey can. NOTHING is as it seems, but EVERYTHING is as it SHOULD be when prophecy steps in the way of tradition.If you miss this one, you're missing out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great story. but","review":"The book grabbed you from the beguinning through almost the whole thing. I didn't like the ending though because it seemed like it was just chopped off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring and stimulating look at how-to's of drawing","review":"Drawing should be taught everywhere, says Camp, not just in art schools.As a word crafter I prefer to use words, but will admit there are times when a drawing can communicate more accurately and faster than a paragraph.Camp encourages copying, as instructors have for centuries. There's lots to copy in this book. He discusses media and technique but only touches lightly on perspective and control of 3-dimension. A rank beginner might get discouraged in a hurry but with persistance and determination s/he should be able to see it through. Someone with a little training or a natural eye would enjoy and profit from the instructions here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonacci gets the job done!","review":"I first saw this talk as a young teenager and was completely taken in. In a dynamic, spiritual and logical way Bonacci makes a great, teen relavent, argument for chastity. One of the great things about this talk is that it blends the Christian spiritual reasons for chastity with the logical and even scientific reasons for it as well. Though it is a bit dated, the talk is timeless and brilliant. In college, I watched it again with my roomate (she had never seen it) and she and I enjoyed it just as much the second time maybe even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Best but Still a Classic!","review":"Anyone who has read other books by Robert Rankin will not be surprised at the bizarre and convoluted plot that is his trade mark.Whilst this book isn't as good as dome he has written, it's still hugely funny and well worth reading. A word of caution however, read the earlier books first and you will enjoy this one more, there are all sorts of references to previous books of Rankin's which, whilst not important to the story, will improve your enjoyment just that little bit more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off the wall","review":"Hilarious. Absolutely mad. Check out his other books and read the reviews on amazon.co.uk (he's an English writer).Brentford does exist, it is near Heathrow airport on the way into London. Couldn't find the pub though.I am not into science fiction, or time travelling, but I am into inspired, slightly insane, totally off the wall, writing. There's none better than Robert Rankin.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"i absolutely luvd this book","review":"this was the first rankin book i purchased, it was recomended to me because i read a lot of Moore's stuff. well i have to say this book was unbelievably funny. Barely a page went by that i did not find myself chuckling outloud. I found the very lyrical form of writing to be an extremely fast read. the only problem with the book was that i finished it too fast. rest assured i will read more Rankin books in the months to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun!!!","review":"I got this item for my little cousins and they were so excited about it. I will admit that the whole thing is a pain to blow up, but with an electric pump it goes much faster. My biggest problem with it was getting the kids out of it long enough so that I could inflate it!Some of the previous reviews had had negative comments especially as related to the fact that it pops easily outside. I can't really comment on that, because we have been playing with it inside. If you have a basement area or a playroom, it is great (though huge) to put in there, with little worries of popping it.I think this is a fantastic product. My main struggle since has been trying to keep the adults out of it. (They want to try it out too!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken before we got it blown up.","review":"We've not gotten to use the Giga Ball. I purchased it in October and when we tried to inflate it, we found 3 different holes in it. Patches were included but not the kind of blue that is need to seal the patches. I'm very disappointed in the product. I would like to return it if I could find the exact place that I purchased it from, but we didn't discover this until right after Christmas as it was given for a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tons of FUN","review":"This is fun for kids and adults - I have purchased this in the past and we love it everytime. It is a blow up item so don't expect it to last for years. We got several months of hard abuse on the last one. This one is holding up fine. We \\"the parents have even got inside the ball while the children rolled us around\\" Lots of fun for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giga Ball Disappointed","review":"The Giga Ball is a great concept and would have been a lot of fun but it wouldn't hold air. We are returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good CD","review":"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this recording. Moeran could be classified as a pastoralist or perhaps a \\"late romantic\\". He wrote relatively little and to me his music sometimes lacks internal cohesion. I bought this mainly to hear the two concertos and have found them to be excellent. The violin concerto contains some beautiful moments but at times, particularly in its concluding movement, the line of his thinking is a bit hard to follow. The solo passages make up for it.The cello concerto is in my opinion as good as any other more well-known works (Dvorak, Elgar etc.) and contains more interesting orchestral colors. The two shorter works were less interesting. This recording has an ideal balance between soloist and orchestra and a great overall sound. Both soloists are great as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Great movie about the struggle to stay true to your beliefs versus musical success, keeping a family together and patriotism. I had seen this on tv a while back and fell in love with the movie and the final scenes which seem to be the climax of others moving on without you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviews Aren't Quite Right","review":"I got this book as a gift from a previous job I worked at and when I first moved from the southside to the northside, I really wanted to find places that I could eat, but this book wasn't really helpful to me for anything more than phone numbers and addresses. My two favorite restaurants, Soul Vegetarian East and Alice & Friends, got two star ratings. Alice & Friends food is absolutely excellent, and I go there every chance I get, and the vegan chocolate mousse pie is fantastic, and I'm not a dessert person at all. This book says the dessert is not desirable, and that blew my mind. And as for Soul Vegetarian East being so unique that it's hard to find seating, I've been there at least six times, and the only time I had trouble finding seating was on a late evening. During the day and early afternoons, I usually come in to maybe three or four tables of one or two people. I'm using this book more like a directory than for recommendations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really appreciated the NY version, but this is pretty bad. The same exact review for Burrito Brothers is repeated on nine pages, just with different addresses. This is not close to the only repetition. I have been to some of these restaurants multiple times. Reading these reviews, I think they only went once to most of them. There are a lot more vegi friendly restaurants in DC. While the book is useful, I just think the authors were not trying very hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was so excited to see this book that I grabbed it off the shelf and bought it without even opening it, but that was a big mistake. Unfortunately much of the book is repeated recommendations for the same restaurants in different locations. For instance, 9 pages are devoted to each Armand's Pizza and Burrito's Brothers...with the exact same review. While the reviews are helpful (despite a tendency to go for cheese-heavy or mock-meat dishes) the breadth of recommendations is poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WONDERFUL RESOURCE","review":"This book is an invaluable resource for anyone who knows or works with individuals on the autism spectrum.My daughter has aspergers syndrome, and I was so thrilled to find many of my questions, some of which I was too afraid to ask, answered gently and honestly in this book. I was so impressed, actually, that I immediately bought copies for the grandparents, so that they can understand our child better, as well.This book is the Asperger's Parent equivalent of \\"What to Expect when You're Expecting\\".Not only will parents find it helpful, but professionals working with children with Aspergers/Autism."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent production value","review":"As a professional audio engineer, It's rare to find material recorded in the last few years that isn't \\"over produced\\". This recording caspulizes the essence of the performer with very little studio \\"tricks\\". a must have for audio engineers, live and studio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a TREAT","review":"The Music on this CD is great. It's produced by Gary Katz, and Bonnie Raitt sings lead and backing vocals on the title song...need I say more. Well written songs and production is superb, no fillers either. Bluesy soulful Rock n Roll with some slide guitar here and there. If you like Bonnie, you will like the feel of this CD also. I picked it as a thrift store unknown for the cover art, first song has the word \\"Soul\\" in the title AND it came out before Nirvana ruined the mainstream music so it had a chance of being listenable. Now I like Paul Brady, yesterday I never heard of him. Get this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickly green complexion","review":"Very dissatisfied with the simplicity of this doll, as well as the generic green complexion they gave all the dolls in this Munsters series. Lily Munster had a lovely white pallor which is not reflected in this ersatz model. Rather disappointed. (Arrived in good time, though.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheese Lover","review":"Purchased this slicer from Amazon because my family consumes a lot of cheese and wire slicers seem to be the best. I selected this one because the discription sounded like it would hold up to heavy use. The screw holding one end of the wire fell out the first time I washed it and disappeared down the drain, the other screw was loose as well. I bought two stainless steel screws from the local hardware store with allen heads, the original screws are phillips and hard to get tight. I have no problems with the screws now but the wire has gotten very stretched with a couple of months of use. I am disappointed with this slicer overall and can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Thought I was getting a good quality, durable cheese slicer. This thing is certainly heavy enough. Problem is, within a month the wire had stretched so much that it doesn't cut properly anymore. Tried to adjust the screws on the sides, but one screw is frozen and cannot be adjusted. Item is too expensive to last such a short time. Useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"short life","review":"We have owned this slicer for for about 4 years, and had the wire suddenly break for us this week. Fortunately no one was hurt. We had liked the weight and adjustability of this slicer. Unfortunately, it seems cheaper to buy a different, more durable slicer than to find replacement wire for this one and to risk injury from future wire breaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"There are many other wire cheese slicers on the market for much less money that last much longer. The wire tightening method on this one stinks. Screws come loose too easily. Wire that comes with the slicer stretches in a short time, and you run out of ability to tighten quickly because of the screw method. NO replacement wire can be found when it breaks, and it will because the wire is too thin. Mine broke after two months of use. Not being able to find a replacement wire, I recycled a guitar string which lasted a while, but in reality, this cheese slicer is more trouble than it is worth, especially with the high price tag."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strong collection of old style group vocals...","review":"A good mix of tempos and styles. Not all of the cuts are great (they never are), but all are at least good-- no losers amongst them. Production values are up to Ace's always high standards, and the originals are all of high quality recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"RARE STUFF --- A GREAT FIND!","review":"I took a chance on this CD when I ordered it but when I heardthis CD for the first time, I felt that I had hit the jackpot.This CD contains a great collection of many very rarerecordings that won't be found elsewhere. I am a great doo wopfan and I have thoroughly enjoyed hearing this CD --- many ofthese songs for the first time when I first played the CD.I can't recommend this CD more highly for serious doo wopbuffs or for collectors of rare or hard-to-find songs ofthat genre and era.OK, so the quality of the song writing or the vocalsdoesn't match that of the great classics like\\"In The Still Of The Night\\", etc., but that's not thepoint here. This is still great doo wop music and therarity factor of the music on this CD is what makes itworth having.The 2 star rating from one reviewer is unjustified. ThisCD clearly deserves a minimum of 4 stars and I gladly giveit a 5 star rating.If you are a real doo wop buff, don't let this one slipby you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"advent rising","review":"This was one of my first online purchases.

I remember when this game came out about four years ago and it was referred to as a \\"halo copy cat\\" and I didn't really want anything to do with it, well I probably should have kept it that way. The graphics are pretty cheese-ball along with the story line and crap dialogue. Although the character you play as \\"gideon\\" jumps that of something caught between a lemur and gazelle which is about the only entertaining part of the game, otherwise advent rising is pretty weak and not worth a penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very overhyped.","review":"This game should have been good, with the brilliant Orson Scott Card as the storywriter and renowned video game musician Tommy Tallarico as the sound track creator, but it isnt. The story line is very derrivitive and dull, the graphics are seriously outdated, the flick targeting system is annoying and unresponsive, the frame rate was aweful, and there were tons of bugs and glitches littered through out the game. The only good I can say about the game is that the flick targeting system is a good idea, the power ups are pretty cool, and the sountrack to the game is amazing. If you are an Orson Scott Card fan, or in search of a good game, then stay away from Advent Rising. Just hope that the sequels will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE GEORGE W. BUSH OF VIDEO GAMES","review":"This game isn't even FINISHED yet! There are soooo many bugs and framerate issues that should have been resolved, and you'd think they'd have time to do it considering how little effort they spent on the graphics. Seriously, these graphics are simpler then the script-writer of Everybody Loves Raymond on crack. The characters' faces are unforgivably plain and void of any distinctive features, in fact, there's virtually no difference between any of the faces. The story sucks, it's basically the same as every single other sci-fi story out there. Don't buy this game, don't rent this game, simply point at it and laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"EA has no idea how to treat costomers","review":"I liked the Game very much.

It's good that the boys have gotten back together, But I would of have wanted a little more rock and guitar riff's etc.The songs are really mellow. A bit boring except for one or two of the tracks... By the way, I am a big number 1 EUROPE fan since the early days, And I'm sorry to say, That this album doesn't grab me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dignified Comeback","review":"As an avid Europe fan, i'm impressed, but not totally blown away. This is a very good release. The sound is updated to match today's music, yet accented with some subtle early Europe melodic lines. Lyrics have always been one of the strongest points of Europe, and they still are. I'd venture to say that they've had the best lyrics of any rock band i've listened to, full of clarity, content, and emotion. The CD is well balanced, with slow, mid, and fast hard hitting tempos. I think this would be a very successful commercial release that would appeal to a broad range of listeners.That said, being a Metal and Hard Rock fan, what would make this album totally great for me wouldv'e been more faster songs and more extended solos by Norum (a great guitarist). The band is true to their music, and I don't believe they're trying to be anything but themselves and that's what's important. I definitely recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the top 5 Albums of the 21 century so far","review":"Hero is awesome, stands out right away. This is not an album that jumps out at you right away, but after 4-5 times in the cd player, you're hooked. I was for sure. The album is better than 99% of all the other albums that are coming out these days- and that's b/c these guys have talent! Don't expect total 80s style, but do expect a great album. You can tell it's Europe, and I have to say it's nice that they didn't try to rehash their old songs or try to make their new songs sound totally like their old stuff.This album rocks, everybody that's heard it (even those who wrote reviews on here) said you have to listen to it a few times before you really get it. It was good the first time I heard it, but now I think it's a great album!It's not as cheesy and fluffy as most of their old stuff, which I love, but it's good stuff. Even those that hate Europe still can't deny they are great musicians!I can only recommend buying this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Start From the Dark or maybe Start \\"IN\\" the Dark!","review":"If you've loved Europe's music in the 80's than be careful buying this cd! Not much rock melody here! Almost a one listen to cd, and then to the shelf. Every song has me waiting impatiently for John Norum's guitar lead. Want to know why? Because Joey Tempest has changed his singing style? He's gone from a great rock singer with great range to a mediocre vocalist with no range, dull and flat! The songs as a whole have regressed and are aimed toward today's pitiful imitation rock! Gosh, these guys had real class once. The only reason to buy this cd is if you want to hear John Norum, not because your looking forward to a new Europe cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Europe I'd like to hear","review":"Well, I'm start saying that I'm not against bands evolute through times, but this is certainly not evolution. Playing songs with low-tuned guitars and melancholic lyrics and melodies are not for a band that once released Prisoners In Paradise, Out Of This World, The Final Cowntdown and other classic melodic rock anthems. Europe is another band, that like Metallica are victims of the horrible nu metal bands' fashion. They might have though that elements of nu would keep them updated. Well, sorry but, the band sounds outdated, tired and depressive. Very dfferent from the Europe that once I knew in the 80's and grew up listening. The worst thing is that are the same guys that recorded \\"More Than Meets The Eye\\"! Please, John Norum, Joe Tempest and the guys, let's make real rock'n'roll and stop this mess.

Those are a rarity. How fortunate for us we found not only the high-quality 8 inch calphalon pan but...it comes with a glass lid. Just perfect for cooking for one or two.The package arrived quite quickly and when we opened the outer Amazon box we were a little apprehensive about what the pan would look like since the actual pan box (inside the Amazon box) was in such awful shape.

For those who hate ironing as I do; here is a short-cut...iron only the sections visible for the flat sheet and the bottom end. The section in the middle won't be visible. I didn't I iron the fitted sheet. The sheets are soft even with the starching. But if you don't iron at all, then 100% cotton is not your best bet.

The video was excellent (hilarious as hell), and the cassettes were sraightforward and honest - you could tell Vicki Hanson really lived and experienced what she was talking about.

You'll be as surprised as I was! I never could figure out why I kept on gaining and bingeing, and this little book showed me why.Combine it with \\"The Appetite Awareness Workbook\\", and you've got a great weighltoss, non-diet approach combo. By the way, you may have to overhaul your diet, especially if you have allergies to foods you \\"love\\".It's a good thing though, so don't worry about it, just read!

Any diet can be successful if you stay on it, but what happens after you stop dieting? This book also helps you examine why you overeat in the first place. It helps you see how you can still eat in moderation and live a normal life while getting to the size you want to be! No, this is not a diet, but it may very well revolutionize the way you see yourself and your relationship with food.

It offers lots of common sense advice and gives great tools for paying attention to your eating, all of which I have found to be very helpful. It offers excercises at the end of each chapter as well.

So clear and understandable, so within the non-clinician's grasp.You will read about the puzzling behaviors of many people you know in these pages. And, you will see how as we unravel the mysteries of this \\"last frontier\\" -- the brain -- we are gaining a future that is brighter with hope and dreams fulfilled and peace for all of us.It's not about \\"pathologizing\\" everyone.

None of them are ill enough to be unable to function in daily life, and yet, they are in some way impaired or they have failed to meet their potential. This book was a wonderful exploration of the complex biological and environmental factors that interplay to make each individual's personality. It gave me great insight into understanding how, once you accept your biology, it does not have to be your destiny. It shows how people can, if they so choose, work around their limitations.

But so far ideas presented are worth continuing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthy book, but is analysis biased?","review":"This is a worthwhile book to read as an introduction to a number of fascinating personality disorders. The primary flaw: the authors assume that popular stereotypes equal scientific fact, and tailor their analysis to support the stereotypes. For example, the passage explaining that men 'act like men' because they have shadow ADHD accepts several negative stereotypes as premise. Certain comments, asides, and occasional cheap shots detract from the objectivity of this study, and hint that some of the conclusions are agenda-driven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Based on the Idea We're All Crazy","review":"A nonsensical book based on the notion that your brain makes you crazy, and there's not a darned thing you can do about it.

As so often happens with childhood-onset brain disorders, he has symptoms that are a mixture of various disorders -- major depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder. (These are hereditary disorders when appearing in one so young.) After reading this book, so many elements of our son's puzzling behavior, and the milder symptoms present in my husband and myself are more understandable. If you or your loved ones have mild forms of more serious brain disorders, this book is for you. I had an \\"aha\\" experience at every chapter.

The idea that there are \\"mild\\" forms of mental illness, which we may all have pieces of, is extraordinarily useful in understanding myself and others.The book absolutely cries out for a bibliography.

It is an absolute necessity which I trust the publishers will remedy immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric Fumbling","review":"Codrescu's work in this book is like a 13-year-old's self-conscious attempt at writing a romance diary.

I have always thought there was more to Casanova, but was not compelled to do my own research.The characters are well drawn, particularly Laura, Casanova's maid and muse, and the settings are vivid.My one \\"objection\\" is to the final section of this good book.

I am glad I read this book, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"How anyone made it through this book is beyond me","review":"This book somehow manages to combine stories of the gilded age of Venice and the sexual escapades of Casanova and come out completely boring. As the legendary lover Casanova is in his old age, he is the librarian at an isolated estate in Bohemia. He entertains himself by telling the stories of his youth, of Venice and Paris, of royals and their affairs, to his maid Laura.

Although much of the taxonomy has changed and continues to change, the book is still a valuable reference for identification and description of many of the world's ants. What I enjoyed most are chapters XVII -XXVII that deal with many of the fascinating ant relationships with other organisms (tending aphids, protecting plants, slave-making ants...). Another asset of Wheeler's book are the numerous wonderful illustrations accompanying each section. Although a bit technical for a general audience, \\"Ants\\" should remain a stimulating excursion into a fascinating group of insects."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lemon","review":"After 3 tries I am giving up on this pan.

They are simply not suited for glass top ranges. Over time, they warp and develop a rounded bottom that causes them to spin dangerously on the stove top when stirring, and they make very poor contact with the heating surface.

Thankfully Calphalon has excellent customer service, and prepaid the return shipping. They state to start the pan on low heat and very gradually bring it up to temperature. This is a real inconvenience. I would expect better from this manufacturer and especially at this price. Because of the warping the pan is of only limited use.

I've had several of this series for over six months now and the surface is holding up fine, no deterioration so far.

I think of it as four of my favorite individual cd's. Each cd plays like it was originally intended to be sequenced that way by James Brown his own damned self.Yes. Discs one and four may not be quite as solid as numbers two and three. But that's a little bit like saying that Abbey Road isn't quite as good as Revolver.

If you can play someone this set, and their toes are not tapping, you better call 911 cuz they're dead.

Rock fans will get a kick out of it too. From the early days, to his 70's peak, James Brown is in a class by himself.

Is obvious that the two last albums ( x factor and virtual XI) are not as good as dickinson albums, and it looks like he is tryng to save the band by re-selling the old great songs. I AM VERY GLAD BRUCE AND ADRIAN ARE BACK, but i believe they don't need three guitars, so they should just say goodbye to JANICK GERS. About the game, if you like games like quake, doom, diablo, starcraft, viperracing, comanche gold, Delta Force, Wing Commander Series, i mean true computer games...DO NOT BUY IT, YOU'll BE DISSAPOINTED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prety good CD set...Louzy game","review":"If you are thinking about buying this set because you are expecting to get a decent Iron Maiden Video Game to Play I have three words of advice...DONT DO IT.There are alot of Maiden Classics and a couple of Blaze Bayley songs...Paul Diallo is absent from this record...There is a very nice studio version of Wrathchild with Bruce Dickinson on vocals.That said ...you can get most of these songs if you buy Best of The Beast...and that record has some Paul Diallo songs on it.A good CD to buy if you are looking to play a louzy Game...or fill out a collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love 3D games, keep moving along...","review":"The game graphics are outdated by at least 4 years. Nastypixalations as well as inability to do anything more than point yourmouse at a predestined area to shoot baddies. I had some video issues and I contacted tech support back in December, 6 months later still no response (thank goodness I fixed it myself!)... The makers of this game, Synthetic Dimensions, took Maiden to the bloody cleaners when they pitched the band this horrible rendition of a video game. It is presumed by the cheesiness of the graphics and extrememly poor game play indicates that SD doesn't have much of a clue about the video game industry unless you still consider Pac Man the epitome of video gaming. If you are looking to buy this title, go to an online auction where you can get a great deal and still have Piece of Mind when you realize the hype was not worth the wait..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are Maiden Becoming KISS?","review":"I don't see what the point of this album was. Best Of The Beast has much better track collection and is cheaper. The video game is the only reason to get this, but all it is is a Doom-clone that goes through Maiden-ish worlds from their albums (i.e., Egyptian, Hell, Future, Seventh Son, etc.). Get Best Of The Beast if you need a Maiden collection. This just seems like a way to get more money from fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Medieval Murder","review":"Owen Archer is back in York, after a long sojourn in Wales. His apothocary wife, Lucy, has just lost a baby and is mourning its death. In York the Archbishop Wykeham has the ire of the Duke of Gaunt on his head and he fears that the powerful Lancasterian is trying to kill him. Archer finds himself in the midst of the feud and must rely on his friends to help him but make sure that no harm comes to them.It is a pleasure to have Owen back in York with Lucy by his side. The mystery is serpentine and clues are there for the careful reader. Robb brings medieval York to life with intriguing characters and multi-layered plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Medieval Mystery","review":"Owen Archer is called on by William of Wykeham, bishop of Winchester, to keep him safe. To appease the family of a man killed while being held prisoner in France, Wykeham returns the knight's heart. But a fire in Wykeham's house, a servant severly burned and a body of a dead woman, has Archer fearing for his own family's safety. While Lucie Wilton battles her own demons. Robb writes intricate plotted mysteries set in 14th century England by reading one you will become hooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Series may be doomed","review":"Having read and enjoyed the other Owen Archer books, I want to concur with the previous reviewer who found this book disappointing. I found it extremely disappointing. With the exception of the wonderful character of Magda the Riverwoman, all the main characters are too old, too sick, too depressed, or too self doubting to be credible in their problem solving ability. Lucy's whining in particular becomes very tedious. The plot is also weaker than usual. Its seems to serve mostly as backgrund for expoloring the angst of the chracters, and the ending leaves a major puzzle piece unanswered. Perhaps it's time to retire the series unless the younger characters like Jasper and Alisoun can be developed to pick up the slack and without such religious and emotional baggage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Online Courses","review":"I'm currently taking an online Macroeconomics course. Watching the lectures on these discs feels just like attending class for real lectures.

IRON FIST is solid record, better produced than its predecesors, the masterpieces ACE OF SPADES, BOMBER and OVERKILL. There are twelve songs, each of one them very good. Taylor's drumming is at peak form here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Get Tired of This","review":"Spirit of the Canyon is the kind of music you can play over and over again, never get tired of it, and hear something new. I listen to this music, alternating with David and Dianne's other albums, several times a week while riding. One of my horses is so enchanted with this album that she stops next to the CD player and nudges me to put the CD in before she will enter the arena. Why this album has not received more attention can only be that people have not yet discovered it. Once you listen to this, you will want to buy all of their albums. I started with David Arkenstone's Celtic Book of Days and have ended up with all of Dianne's and David's albums. Spirit of the Canyon is a blend of Native America flutes and earth beats with a bit of Celtic overtones. You can feel the warm canyon breeze, imagine the clouds floating buy and sense the vibrant colors of the soil as you listen to this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Prince Ombra\\": Macleish's grab at the gold ring.","review":"In this age of writers being paid by the inch, how refreshing to find a title so pure in goal and execution. \\"Prince Ombra\\" succeeds as both fiction for pleasure, and as parable. As an explanation of the myth of \\"The Hero\\" told against a backdrop of darkness and light in our world, it has no peer (save perhaps Bradbury's \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\"). A child may read this book and cry in horror, but also in sadness and, ultimately, joy. To feel at its conclusion, that there will always be hope in the world, and sometimes, the greatest hero can be the smallest child."},{"rating":"2","title":"An overstated yet haunting tale of good and evil","review":"Prince Ombra seems to based upon the concept that all stories, especially folk-tales and legends, are in fact one story with small differences. It is supposed to be a heroe myth for our time. The book was fairly interesting but overstated. It kept pounding home that all stories are one and showing small differences between them. The main difference with this heroe is he knows what heroes have come before him, what he must face, and that he is only eight years old. Still the writing has a haunting effect that can make it hard to put it down and the plot is well thought out. Even though the reader knows what is coming in a general sense, there are enough plot twists and changes to create suspense and drama"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too comtemporary to be compared to Tolkien & Star Wars","review":"Prince Ombra has appeared in the world a thousand times in the form of the greatest and most evil foes of history. And a thousand times, a special person has been born into the world to attempt his defeat. These stories are well known: David and Goliath, King Arthur, etc. However, Roderick MacLeish tells a less memorable story of one such warrior who is only 8 years old. The tale is set in modern times. The child is hunted by a lunatic with a gun. His \\"Merlin\\" is a doctor. The dangers and perils are not so grand, and the form that Prince Ombra takes isn't very fantastical. The idea behind the story was interesting, but it could have been developed better. Yes, I suppose it was entertaining, but what kept the pages turning for me was knowing I could get on to a better book when I finished this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This stuff","review":"Not to get into too much detail but lets just say this stuff works....at least for me. I never used to be an everyday guy but with this, a cup at night makes me an everyday guy in the morning. Not harsh at all and I actually really enjoy the taste. No need to add sugar or anything. I have the stuff on auto-ship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tea works","review":"I bought this tea last week and have used it for 3 nights now. I am not normally a tea drinker, and don't enjoy very hot liquids, so I used not so hot water and steeped only for a few minutes. I really enjoy the flavor. It takes around 10 - 12 hours for me, and then it kicks in and really works - a little too much; I had a small accident in my underwear twice at work! No bloating or cramping though. I am vegetarian and don't normally need a stimulant but I am trying a bit of a cleanse. I am definitely only going to use this up to a week, the recommended length; it's pretty powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This tea is wonderful.

The nurse who recommended it didn't warn me to try brewing it only five minutes or less at first try; I didn't find that out until it was too late.

I think I'll stick with magnesium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traditional Medicine","review":"The product has a great potential for people not wanting to get hooked to normal fiber intact supplements like Metamucil or Miralax, or just the consistent pressure of wanting to go to the bathroom. Senna Tea has its laxative properties imbued with a little bit of discomfort when the urge to go arrives and can be quite painful, and the continued use of it can lead to bowel cancer and other unspeakable horrors. The only reason I gave it two stars was the fact that it doesn't put your body in a state of requiring fiber supplements, for example after 1-2 sessions of the tea you can put your rests aside and look forward to gaining all your intakes from eating right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Like","review":"I really didn't like the taste of this.

This author can only \\"help\\" or more accurately share stories of how dysfunctional her relationship with her father was, and how promiscuous she was, what a bad friend she was to those around her, rather than actually tell you anything about what life is like after the death of a father that you had a healthy relationship with. If you are normal and your father is normal, and you were friends with your father, this book is not for you. If you need therapy and your Dad needs therapy, here is clearly the book for you.This book is full of sweeping generalizations to validate the author's bad decisions in the relationships in her life. It is not backed up with any research or facts of any kind. She should have bought a journal and written about the bad relationship in private rather than publish it. Please do not buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great CD to add to your collection","review":"I would say that the songs on this CD remind me of Ry Cooder and the Cowboy Junkies, except that I don't like either of them half as much as Texas.

The book traces the Church's history from the beginning and how they interacted with other sectors of American society as they grew and expanded. The author's premise was that the LDS was part of the America's growing pain during this period (1830-1846). The author maintained that Mormons remains true to the concepts of the Republic even although they were leaning toward theocracy. The book was well written, appears to be well researched and the author maintained an even approach while exploring his premise. Its a good book, quite insightful and should be read by anyone interested in Mormon history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humans show their stupidity again","review":"Something extraordinary happens - a lander we sent to Mars comes back.

As one character says, why go to outer space, if we are just going to try to kill everything we find?An OK movie for a cold winter afternoon while I was working on my computer.

Underrated comic gem!","review":"I remember seeing this in the theaters as a kid way back in 1980 (OK, now I officially feel OLD!)...anyway, this is a small, slight, yet hysterically funny and very smart comedy that somehow has fallen off the radar for most audiences - similar to Dolly, Jane, and Lily in \\"9 to 5,\\" Jane, Jessica, and Susan make a terrific trio of would-be thieves trying to steal a load of cash from the \\"money ball\\" in a Pacific Northwest Mall. With cameos from Fred Willard, Eddie Albert, Richard Benjamin, and Dabney Coleman, the entire cast, the screenplay, the direction, and the tacky details of late 70s/early 80s middle-class America are all dead-on hilarious! If they can go ahead and ruin \\"Fun with Dick and Jane\\" by doing a remake, why hasn't anyone thought of remaking this underrated comedic gem? Seriously, if you love light, frothy, yet still-topical comedies, give HOW TO BEAT a whirl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wry, neglected comedy","review":"Although the details are dated, _How To Beat The High Co$t Of Living_ is freshly topical, with the economy in a bad way again. The three heroines' problems are, IMO, partly their own fault---but one has to root for their spunky, ingenious heist.Jane Curtin improvising a striptease to cover her chums' getaway is a real highlight of the disc. She's game, sexy, and believable in her role---a really talented actress. And, for the record, the power is cut off only in _part_ of the mall, not the whole thing---I saw a review of the movie when it came out that didn't understand this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man of the World","review":"This biography was poorly written and organized, but is still one of the few sources of information and insight into the life and times of the mysterious Peter Green. While almost every book I have read blamed the Munich commune and their LSD on Peter Green's fast departure from \\"our world\\", this book does not take this easy route. This book painted Peter Green as a very complex man with a fragile and sensitive psyche and although drugs may have taken him over the edge, there were other factors that drove him to the edge.A difficult book to find and a difficult book to read, but a must read for anyone who is interested in Peter Green the man and Peter Green, one of the most creative guitarists of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A CHORE to get through","review":"Reading this book was hard work,and pretty irritating to get through. It is written by an Englishman and is strictly for English audiences. Practically every page contains slang, colloquialisms and references to people, places, and things that have no meaning to Americans at all. The writing style is also confusing, going back and forth with the subject at hand so you constantly have to go back to figure out who said what about who when etc. NOT a pleasant read. I am a great Peter Green fan so I muddled through. The author is obviously not a musician either, not very insightful commentary on music or musicians. Lots of anecdotal hero worship, which according to Peter's history and interviews is exactly what he does not want. Hard to believe this is the authorised biography."},{"rating":"2","title":"A touch across and ocean","review":"It took ages till I got the CD, and it was EXACTLY what I thought it would be after listening to the sample and reading about it.

I seriously could not believe this movie and truly wanted to stop watching, but like witnessing a train wreck, I could not pull myself away. Honestly, after the first movie that seemed to end with some redeeming qualities about marriage, I thought this one would continue in the same vein, but this was just a marriage basher. After watching this, why would anyone think marriage is a good thing? Two couples have major trust issues, another one has a wife on the verge of an affair, and the last one, the Janet Jackson marriage is beyond awful.

For one the intense comic relief along with the supercharged drama doesn't blend well for me (i.e. Madea Goes to Jail - the movie) The plot was all too predictable, ex wants the ex back, hubby and wife aren't happy, they argue and tragically one dies..meehhhh.... oh, let's not mention, one has cancer and it's not addressed at all other than when it's mentioned..It just seemed like a mash up of a bunch of recycled movie plots, all put together crudely.

Suitable for young readers (most likely boys) or adults. Knight has a straightforward but engaging plot with a couple minor sub-plot lines. Dialogue is enjoyable and he creates characters that have quite a bit of depth given the short length of the book. Never soupy or melodramatic.By way of disclosure, I knew the author many years ago when he was a music professor at a university in the Southeast. He even mentioned that he aspired to move back to Colorado, where he grew up, and become a western author. He lives in Colorado and has published several novels, so I'm glad to see he followed his dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Western fantasy for boys","review":"While I may be (as an adult) a bit beyond the intended age range for this book (I think it's considered a 'juvenile novel') I still liked it. It's the story of a young man who comes out from the East to find that his family has been the victim of foul play, and he engages a locally-known gunfighter to help him extract justice from the perpetrators. The gunfighter is a character himself, not keen on the young man or of having him around.

You might even finish the movie thinking, \\"yeah, that wasn't bad.\\" But I would say it is also the kind of movie that given a 1/2 hour to digest what you just saw, you will likely come to the conclusion that, in fact, it was pretty bad.The movie is overdone, from start to finish. I like Sean Bean but he has a tendency to overact and overact he does; but I can overlook that since, somehow, he is still interesting to watch. The visuals surrounding what it may have felt like during a plague was pretty good; but there really wasn't anything particularly good about the story and the ending, which some describe as a surprise, seemed pretty predictable to me.Overall, it's not a waste of time to watch the movie but it is definately not a movie I would ever watch again."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so movie with crappy art whore ending","review":"**REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILER***I like a good slasher movie, the more gore the better. I like suspense and drama too. This movie tried to combine them all - and actually did a fairly decent job. It could of been a solid 3 star beauty in the rough. HOWEVER, I'm getting a little miffed at movies that have an anti-hero ending simply to make it more artsy or make the director feel like there's some kind of deep meaning. Some life changing moment in film.That's fine and dandy if your owning a 5 star file (for instance Cold Mountain - kills the hero and still ends up being a fine movie). Or your solid Trauma type movies like \\"Hobo with a shotgun\\" - ending MAKES that movie a solid 3 star gore fest.If your a decent little 3 star movie and your going for that 4th star by killing your hero, just don't do it. It pisses me off. Anyway that's my rant. Thanks for reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just watch the original Wicker Man....","review":"....it's a much better, more suspenseful, and compelling tale.

The story isn't compelling (if you don't see everything coming, you haven't been watching - so keep doing what you're doing). The characters aren't compelling (the dialogue is terrible, there are no surprises, and the main character isn't actually Sean Bean).

A band of mercenary knights has been commissioned to find out why one small village is not being ravaged by the plague. They believe that an evil and powerful necromancer is protecting them. A young monk who has violated his vows of celibacy is assigned to lead them to this village where he grew up. What ensues is a bleak, violent and grim journey into the fear and religious paranoia that dominated these dark ages.BLACK DEATH is a disturbing and visceral experience, well-crafted movie but not an uplifting one. The performances are uniformly excellent especially from Sean Bean as the fiercely devoted Ulrich; Eddie Redmayne's torn monk Osment; and Carice van Houten as the beautiful but deadly necromancer.BLACK DEATH pulls no punches and its dark vision is deeply thought-provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BLAKE BUT HISTORICALLY RICH FILM","review":"A deeply dark tale of a young monk who leads some religious mercenaries to find out why a particular marsh village hasn't been affected by the Black Death. There are some fine performances and the costumes and setup give it an overall gritty yet dark view of surrounding area. Combat is vicious and especially brutal. The ending had a nice but macabre twist to it. Keep in mind this is more of a psychological study about human beings than some action packed tale. Sean Bean does a good enough job but Eddie Redmayne (the red headed kid from PILLARS OF THE EARTH) and Carice van Houten have the best performances. DIALOGUE/CHARACTERS: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus to B; MOOD/THEMES: B; OVERALL GRADE: B; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Medieval twist to the black plague","review":"Overall, I think this is a good, yet not very good, movie. The overall story or plot revolts around the black plague that killed 1/3 of Europeans but is quite original and worth watching. I especially liked the story until the final confrontation between Christian \\"delegates\\" and heretic villagers. The final 10 min of the movie after that should be cut in a subsequent Director's \\"cut\\". I have to acknowledge that some may feel the movie is not worth the nearly 20 dollars asked for in Amazon, and I would agree (12 might be more adequate); getting a \\"good used\\" or a \\"nearly new\\" copy is an option.

A Christian man murders the women he loves because he believes she is a reanimated corpse. A woman fools a tribe into believing she is a God because she knows herbalism. The pagans and the Christians proceed to try to tear each other limb from limb but meanwhile the bubonic plague burns in the background turning lymph nodes into baseball sized abcesses that rupture in massive explosions of pus. This is NOT a cheery film but it is a great illustration of fact that fear turns people into monsters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death to Black Death","review":"Quality actors in a very poor movie. Not much of a plot and the story goes nowhere. I enjoy a good sword fight, but gore for gore's sake leaves me flat. I liked the premise of \\"is she a witch or isn't she?\\" and how she plays with the mind of the monk. However, the ending of the movie just seems tacked on and is pointless. Visually, I hoped for better as well. The camera angles are pedestrian, rarely leaving eye level, and the heavy use of hand-held shots made me want to turn the movie off. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLACK DEATH","review":"A well fleshed-out rendering of medieval plague hysteria that evokes the cruel flavor of frenzied proselytizing. What emerges appears to be supernatural fiction, but one of the strengths of the film is its historical plausibility.

If you like a dark film - (literally) - that is - a film - so dark that it is difficult to see what is happening - regardless of whether-or-not what is happening is meaningful - - - this is a film for you.

I can't say anything good about it. The one reason why we saw it is because, in previews, it talked about people in this one village being brought back from the dead and we like supernatural themes. But actually there is no supernatural goings-on in this. Nothing of the sort happened. Only one person was supposedly brought back to life, but she had not died to begin with, her burial was just faked. Another reason we saw it is because Sean Bean, one of our favorite actors, is in it but of course he dies. So there's nothing in this movie but death, hacking, blood, and suffering with a depressing ending. But if that's your bag, go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are you kidding?","review":"This was likely one of the most unfocused stories, misguided tales and poorest movies it has been my displeasure to fork over dineros and shekels to watch.As they say in the Navy, \\"hard to port\\", \\"hard to port\\", avoid this movie and wasting your time on it at all cost. I will simply say it is without a storyline, dark, cynical, un-uplifting, and just plain poorly done on likely a budget of millions of Euros. Amazing what crap comes out of some folks minds.Surely, the producers and directors of this masterpiece of mediocrity must just know how bad this flick and story are in reality?Save yourselves from this movie, Jesus is tired, save yourselves, run for the exits or better yet, don't enter the dark and ridiculous world of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Christian Bias","review":"Hollywood strikes again! Let's attack Christians by making a movie where we take a sincere Christian (Monk-sincere faith with good heart) and turn him into a fanatic religious killer that tortures women. And let's use the backdrop of the plague, obvious distraction, so that we can bash the Christian faith without putting it right in front of you! You think the movie is about the plague and corresponding hardships, but the real theme becomes clear as you see the ending. It was all just a set-up to take a jab at the Christian faith. They could have just as easily had this end with the Monk finding his true path to God, which was not a \\"religious\\" path , but one based on true love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising great!","review":"I wondered, as I watched this, what the writer and director was up to when they used fairly realistic elements along with some very unrealistic elements that we know about the time period. For instance, one of the reasons it's called the dark ages is because we know so little. This is primarily because the clergy were the only ones who could write and create a written history. It's known that the clergy abandoned their posts like..well...rats...when the plague hit their villages. This is the reason why we mostly have estimates on how many people were killed. This means that the knights and clergymen of the time period were far from the \\"sterling\\" god-fearing men we see pictured in the beginning of the film.As the film progresses, it becomes obvious what the motivation is for depicting the characters in the way they are. It's a bleak morality lesson on man's inhumanity to man. It's a great watch with at least one or two twists you won't expect. 5 star recommendation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ooo!","review":"You have to watch it to know what is going on.

Sean Bean & company deliver both action and the best in horror-movie tension, as their journey takes unnerving turns and meets with a grisly crescendo.Far, far better than the recent and similar fiasco Season of the Witch. Black Death will have you on the edge of your seat as it sends chills down your spine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious Movie","review":"This movie gives an unflinching view of how brutal life was in 1348 amd of how ignorant the populace were. There are a few gory scenes but they are brief. I liked it although it isn't pleasant subject matter. During the plague was not a nice time to be alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Expected it to Be This Intense","review":"This film was a dark depiction of the middle age battle against the plague. It is intense. It is disturbing. It too believable. And it is not for the faint of heart or those easily offended. However, I would suggest the moderately offendable watch it to get a reflection of themselves. This film is critical of both sides in the story and it is hauntingly good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 'slow death' watching this","review":"This isn't the worst \\"knights killing in the name of God\\" film I've seen, but its pretty dull to watch. And with that said, what is it with poor Sean Bean? I love him but he has not made a good film in a long time. He & David Warner are the reason I watched this film in the first place but Warner has a small role and Sean Bean's talent's seem wasted. This movie seems to come to an accdeptable ending but then goes on for several more minutes with a surviving character carrying out vengence on other innocents that seems to make no sense. Not a complete waste of time for a film, but not good either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Was Expecting","review":"I was expecting the movie to live up to the name and be about the plague, but the black death only provided a backdrop to the action. The story is about religion, power, culture, and paranoid \\"justice\\" in the middle ages. But that's not exactly right either because the writer didn't do a great job of researching. Things like knowing that only a priest can give last rites (not a novice) make a big difference in believability of the plot. Lots of good actors were cast, but it was sadly a waste of talent. Add to that the shaky-cam and weird cuts and you have a disjointed film. If you are going into this with the intention of suspending reality and going along with a dark, head-slashing, blood gushing medieval fantasy ride, you will enjoy it. It just wasn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF was this movie about?","review":"I think the producer and the director made bets to see how many torture scenes they could fit into an hour-ish time frame. There is no explanation for the end of this movie. Apparently the main character turned evil can see beauty in the world after all the women he has killed. I am a huge Sean Bean fan, but this was not one of his better roles. Horrible script, horrible acting, horrible plot = horrible film.

Lots of action and very graphic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great trip to the medieval darkside!!","review":"Really enjoyed this trip to the rotten heart of England during the plague - no holding of punches (or torture implements, burnings and decapitations).

Jenna Jameson went through a rough life. I really would encourage people to read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Don't let the title fool you.

If you want to learn what really goes on behind the scenes this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book....really!","review":"At first I was skeptical about reading a book by a porn star. When I began reading, I found that it was very well written and the story is unbelievable; it is something that you will not read anywhere else. Her story is scary and amazing. She overcomes so many obstacles in her life. For example, there is one full chapter about her battle with drugs and a play by play writing technique that she uses. She grabs the reader so well and keeps them in. I read this book in a couple of sittings. And i read the last 150 pages after I finished my last final, and it was more satisfying than finishing some of the hardest finals of my life. You must read this book. It is an eye opening experience and I recommend it to everyone I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!","review":"this book pulls no punches.

Fascinating story written naturally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Dirt","review":"Neil Marcus was most at ease with the Motley Crue or Marylin Manson. The quite boring and ordinary ragz to richez story of a white trash curvacioues baby doesn't explore at all the sex magazine or movie industry or world. All the characters are quite plain and without depth. But, perhaps, most readers will be happy just with the photo of this beautiful lady."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new favorite","review":"Interesting, juicy, sexy and well written.

However, one day when I was bored and had nothing to do, I picked up the book and started to read it. I was in total SHOCK! Immediatly I was hooked....I read the entire book in 2 days! I couldnt put it down. Its a great book! I was totally shocked!

Believe me they work. this is definitely a must read. never a dull moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time.","review":"The redeeming qualities that this book DOES have, and there are not many, only owes to the fact that Neil Strauss helped pen it. I doubt Ms. Jameson can put two sentences together. If you want to read a book that consists of a lowly porn star whining about her life and how other people did her wrong, then this is the book for you. She doesn't ever fess up that the life she leads now happened by her own doing. Grow up, Jenna. You won't achieve mainstream celebrity, and 'mainstream celebrity' wouldn't even be considered unreachable anymore if you were to actually make it there. The book is filled with pictures of the self-serving Jenna, so if you are a beer-guzzling male who enjoys staring at women of only average looks, you hit the jackpot. Her early pictures versus her current pictures suggests she has had a lot of work done, as her face looks totally different. Still, I wouldn't say the change is something to behold. We are talking about a porn star, after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Crock Tale","review":"I can only hope that inquiring minds will save their diginity, time, and money by avoiding the ramblings of someone who adds exasperation to their perilous condition by blaming it on self created calamities of the past and present. This book truly wasn't meant to be a means of \\"cautioning\\" readers about the perils of the sex industry. What is being offered here though, is a copious amount of icing for the depraved ego of a (...) acctress who is trying to add meaning to, by way of discrediting, her chosen path in life. It is quite apparent to anyone with a rationalized process of thought, that the (fictionalized) insanity in Jenna's life is a self serving venture. It creates intrigue, then the intrique give birth to fame, and the fame helps to build Jenna's cash pile and ego stock. Geee Jeanna, what an ingenious marketing idea at the expense of the soul!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Her porns are way better","review":"There probably isn't a man in America, including those religious figures, who hasn't seen Jenna in action. Those who haven't either are blind, lived in Mars, or lived in those monastaries where there are no TV, movies, candy, women, or anything else worth living for. But I bet they have still heard of Jenna's name because she is so famous.Jenna' gives a somewhat candid glimpse of her messed up life, and it is a big mess. I have a feeling it is even bigger mess than what appears in the book. After all, who would let 6 billion people know about all the trash that went on in her life? Having said this, there are plenty of trash in the book that makes you go woo and ahh over the details of her sex life and the porn industry. If you like National Enquirer, you will love this book. If you loved Jerry Spinger, then this book will continue where he left off. If you like porn and want to become a porn star, Jenna gives some excellent advice and insights into the porn industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressed","review":"I could not help but feel somewhat depressed after reading this book. I found her life story to mirror what I have always thought a porn stars life would be - sad and empty. As much fame and attention Jenna craves, in the whole scheme of things, she has few people who truly love and care for her. All the so-called \\"Stars\\" and every day people she meets only want one thing from her and it is not her pleasant personality. She was and still is being degraded and looked down upon, yet she tries to expound upon how she did things her own way in the porn world. Dignity and respect are two things lacking in Jenna's life. How sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever and I hate reading","review":"I hate to read and I could not put this twisted book down for a second. Except the last \\"section\\" I don't even read.

I felt that she didn't describe herself as either of these, and instead relied too heavily on the mundane, average occurances and habits that she has in common with too many other Americans.I thought that there was soo much attention paid to her drug use and abuse, and not enough attention paid to her ability and drive to overcome life's challenges.She came off not as the intelligent, sexy, strong, business-savvy gal I had thought she was; but as an average girl who came upon her current place in life simply by chance. I think that I actually lost some respect for her because of her book, instead of gaining any."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sad for words.","review":"I thought this book might just be fun to read, but it was awful. What a tragic life. I was so depressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jenna Lameson","review":"A longtime porn fan I am and I just never understood how this girl became a household name.Then again I think I do...when you got the standard bleached blonde stripper trailer trash look thats become so dominant since porn went Cali & began appealing to rednecks & you sign up with one of the tackiest, bloodless companies in adult film (Vivid) when you kiss scum like Howard Stern's filthy butt endlessly & the media needs something to titilate its jaded but so out of it subscribers...then maybe if you are such a subpar looker/performer like Jenna Fakerson you might just pull it off.If Jenna wrote this book --- badly written, poorly edited and evasive as it is --- I'd be surprized.Want to know the true scoop on the money hungry, racist redneck Jenna?(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Many Good Books Out There....why does this one exist?","review":"If you are completely blinded to the fact that Hollywood degenerates have taken over the media and are now infiltrating the wonderful realm of literature, than be my guest and add to the insult. With genuine authors abound, I suppose it is quite easy to be drawn into a book like this, but just sit and think about it for a minute. I'm going to give money to someone who's only claim to fame is being a drug-addled adult film slave? Is this really important or pertinent to our lives in any salvageable way? Why do we want to know about this filth, just because there's a glossy cover on it and the chance of nudity? Aren't we as humans deserving of so much more. Just go to your library and see all the amazing novels out there, and please realize that this garbage should only be on one list, the list of worst books ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I found this book offensive to a normal adult mind. I bought what I thought was an autobiography, and what I found was a story full of inconsistency's and stinking of prefabricated BS. I am truly disappointed. It is so sad to see someone that is obviously still looking to be the center of attention to make up for her childhood. Grow up Jenna! The world has many more interesting things to do then cater to your issues. We all have our own issues to deal with. You can't do anything about the way you started out but you can grow up and do something about the way you end up. Find a meeting or see a shrink."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality","review":"If you are looking for a \\"I came, I saw, I conquered\\" story then this is not for you. However, if you enjoy reading biographies of life's survivors, then this is a must read. The adversities that Jenna has overcome are absolutely bewildering. I am astounded that she didn't commit suicide. I like the disconnected format of the book, because it is creative and illustrates the way her life progressed. She may be a porn star, but I'll bet she has more honesty than than every single politician in this country. How many of them are willing to tell their complete life story?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Reading","review":"Rarely does anybody reveal the bare truth the way Jenna Jameson has in this book. She has been honest is what I think in letting the world know what the porn industry is all about. Her life has been one roller coaster ride. One is forced to ponder at the plight of some of the newcomers who want to make it big in this industry but do not realize the cons of this industry. The book should be read for the right reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"The World's #1 Porn Star","review":"Jenna Jameson is the most popular porn star in the world and believed by many to be arguably the most desirable woman in the world. Her sex scenes are definately among the hottest. Like virtually all porn stars and starlets, she has literally a slew of her smut all over the internet with an endless array of websites featuring in many cases free \\"galleries\\" testifying to the same. But behind all the glamour and fame is a very troubled woman with a very troubled past. This memoir is a highly riveting account of her life from her own perspective, her own words. One might not agree with her \\"life choice\\", but you'll gain a lot of insight about this subject-matter from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite impressed","review":"I didn't have high expectations for this book. I expected it to be another cliche about an abusive childhood that caused her to become a porn star.And while it is, in a nutshell... It's a lot more then that also. It was a very entertaining and interesting read. The humor and the sarcasm that was expressed at times had me laughing out loud. Other times you could feel her pain as you read the words. I have a new found respect for Jenna Jameson now.The book is a very easy read, there are a few parts that are drawn out a bit much, but for the most part, it's a definate page turner. But beware, I was shocked when I received the book and flipped through and noticed a lot of photographs inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was really looking forward to reading Ms. Jameson's autobiography; I've always thought of her as a smart businesswoman. Even though she has more than half a brain, the book is not too articulate.There are so many inconsistencys & it should have been edited down to about half the number of pages. Although I'm sure the large number of pictures in the book were intended to appease her fans, there didn't seem to be a lot of relevancy between them & the chapters they were inserted( the major exception being the wedding pictures-she looks genuinely happy & that is what is expressed in the chapter).If possible, wait for the paperback or borrow the book from a friend, it's not something you'll want to read again & again."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Make Love Like a Porn Star","review":"Not quite what I expected but still enjoyed it.

Yes, Jenna Jameson is a porn star, and yes she and other members of her family have done drugs, so if you want to write them off as bad and worthless go ahead, but you won't like this book. Not that I am condoning drugs or sex, but what do you expect the life of a porn star to be like.That aside I think JJ does a great job talking about the mistakes she's made the lessons learned from them. In fact I think certain parts of the book would be beneficial to teen girls and even boys - with all the hormones, change, and new discoverys they have going on in their lives.This book is both very entertaining and very informative, I definately recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I do not like the \\"kiss & tell\\" at the end.

To find out why a white-trash girl with bad teeth became the Queen of Sleaze?? She is nothing more than a hooker on film, and I don't believe this qualifies as being interesting enough material for a literary project. In today's world, with all its turmoil, why should we care about a 'woman' (and I do use the term loosely) who has sex on camera with anyone and everyone??? Aren't there people who actually have MORALS that we can read about? The very fact that Jenna sees her life to be fit (and interesting enough) for an autobiography proves that she thinks quite highly of herself, even while the rest of the world doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb","review":"Not sure what I was expecitng but this was a dumb, boring book.

She was traumatized as a teen after being raped and then entered into the adult industry.It is a vicious cycle that these ladies get into. since they all think they'll be \\"stars,\\" and they never realize the riches and fame that many are promised.I am please to see that in the end, despite all the highs and lows for Jenna, it seems as if she was able to take advantage of her looks and capitalize fiscally, to her benefit.It is a shocking story that I'd read again and recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Way better than what I was expecting!!

It started off good no lie. About her life and dealing with drugs. And then it got really boring. Its endless pages of chicken scribble and erotic pics of herself. It gets boring when she constantly goes on and on about flying to LA for a scene here and there. One big part of the book she is just talking with her brother and dad. She explain the advantage and disadvantage of being a porn star. This book is more for people who want to be in the porn industry. I didn't even finish read it. I threw it in the back of my closet with the rest of the useless stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"In depth Jenna","review":"Sorry guys this is NOT a Kama~Sutra type of book.

A few hours later, she showed back up commenting that she had removed them herself and was ready to dance her heart out.And how she finally met the love of her life; *her husband Jay.This book is everything inside the industry. From rape, murder, fame, fortune, drugs and alcohol.Also great commentary by her brother, and father (former cop.)This is a definite great buy and must read. Good pics :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't really know why I read it.......","review":"I guess I just wanted to see if she would whine about all the typical things that a typical bimbo sex worker whines about, and wouldn't you know it.....I am kinda so-so on Jenna, sometimes I think she looks okay but then the camera catches her at a not-so-good angle and she has an actually plain kinda face with little eyes. So, eh, I can take her or leave her. Same with this book, I can take it or leave it. I liked the fact that I was gonna hear her story, since I knew what to expect, then when I heard it, it was kinda worse then I even expected. So....I guess the book was not great, IMO. But you know, she is a porn star, I don't expect rocket science and neither should you. She is just kinda.....there. So what."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jenna Jameson: RACIST","review":"It's funny that Jenna or, for that matter, the mainstream media that has been fawning over her all these years, never brings up the subject of how much she is hated by black porn buyers.Jenna Jameson, has never done interracial hardcore on video. Her company, Club Jenna, doesn't have any black male or female talent. Jenna Jameson is notorious in the adult film world as being known as queen of the \\"dodgers\\" (a porn term for women who refuse to do sex scenes with black men). Her excuses for \\"dodging\\" have varied over the years: From saying her father wouldn't like it, to blaming Vivid, the company she formerly was contrated with (in truth, Vivid is also notorious for not being interracial friendly), to moaning that it would hurt her career.Jenna should just flat out admit she is a bigot or otherwise has issues with black men. She needs to come clean on this matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO way","review":"I hated this book and it was horrible. I don't know who she thought she was putting something like this together when no one even cares about what she has to say. my goodness, all these good reviews. I just don't get it.

Not written very well and the only good things about it were the inside stories that may not even have been true to begine with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title; Not worth the money.","review":"The book did not even hold my interest as a porn story. I expected some novel and amusing \\"pointers\\" in the sex game, but she had nothing to offer; not even any interesting encounters.

You have made a bimbo's book a topseller. Only in America. Why oh why do some people look up to these types of women? Me? I prefer a down-to-earth cutie with big brown eyes and a natural figure. But hey that's just me. I have never found Jenna Jameson to be appealing, and I never will. At least she has improved slightly from the horror she was in Private Parts (the frizzy 80's hair! the bad teeth!) but that's not saying much. I will never understand my fellow man when it comes to this sleazebucket known as Jenna Jameson. But I guess her looks aren't the issue here, it is the horribly written book. HORRIBLE. She is as stupid as she is unattractive. That's the best I can say about her and her book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hell has frozen over","review":"That is the only way I can describe the phenomenon of a porn skank actually putting sentences together. Yeah she did have help but believe me it didn't improve this book any. She totally tries to justify the fact that she is a porn star, as if that would make it any better. Just admit it, you are a two-bit skank who can't do any better. Admit it!!! You'll feel better. She is the green-eyed monster of envy when it comes to REAL actresses or models, you can see it in the way she tries to babble on that Cindy Crawford actually came on to her. What would a gorgeous woman like Ms. Crawford want with a plastic looking floozy like Jenna Jameson? Not a thing. But she tries to make us believe that as well as a lot of other BS in this book. Don't go there."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to Make Love Like a Pornstar ....","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love Jenna Jameson. I think she is very beautiful, intelligent, a successful businesswoman, and one hell of an entertainer-but this book I found to be very sugar-coated. I often have a hard time believing most auto-biographies and find the best written biographies on celebrities to be written after they are dead (that's when people aren't afraid to speak the truth and nobody can get sued.) For instance, recently published posthumous biographies of Ava Gardner and Robert Mitchum by the very talented Lee Server provided a whole new plethora of interesting and intimate information never before published. I give this book two stars because it provided a lot of somewhat entertaining tidbits and tons of photos which most auto/bios tend to lack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"This was a great book. Very entertaining! I was not sure what to think when I purchased it, I had been hearing about the book for a long time, but didn't really think it was my style.

For someone who knows nothing about the porn industry some of it was an interesting read, though i felt like things that may have made her look bad were left out and just couldnt feel sorry for her for most of the things that happened in her life as most of them was her own doing.

The film was very intriguing to me despite the fact i was 12 years old back then when the film was released. I never got to see it at the movies but i did buy it on VHS when it came out on video. I was blown away by the script, plot and actors. The film must have been the best film I had ever seen (mind you, i was 12). Still today, i think it is still a very good film.

The marriage falls to tatters, of course, but it's not Redford's fault.

It sends out a very immoral message to viewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the beef...cake?","review":"I remember seeing this in the theater when it came out. I just watched it again here, and I still feel the same way about it. The whole point of the film, aside from the obvious moral question of taking money for sex, was to see RR and DM in the sack. When that didn't happen, I, as well as a bunch of other patrons got up and went to the theater lobby, and all of us equally outraged at being cheated out of what we felt were scenes that should have been included in the film, asked for our money back...and got it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems pretty decent now.","review":"Indecent Proposal was a shocking film for 1993 but if this film was released now, people wouldn't think much of it.

True, the lyrics are way too post-modern and ironic for my taste. But the music is adventurous, wildly multi-layered, more funk-based and soulful than before (thanks to the great Gail Ann Dorsey) and punctuated by roaring slabs of Gill's incredible guitar work. People hated it because it broke out of rigid punk-era minimalism but that to me is its greatest asset. Along with \\"Shrinkwrapped\\" it showed musical evolution and experimentation; \\"Return The Gift\\" doesn't.It's sad that a band once known for being on the cutting edge is reduced to re-recording its old work note-by-note to satisfy fans. I don't fault the band - they have to eat - but the slavish conformism of so much of its audience who want \\"Entertainment\\" and \\"Solid Gold\\" endlessly recycled.

I got into a couple of the songs, but if you have to skip past most of them, it is a bad sign. 'Cadillac' is a pretty good song, probably the best, and the cover of Bob Marley's 'Soul Rebel' is good too, but I think it could have been better. 'FM U.S.A' is probably one of the most annoying songs I have ever heard. Considering the past history of this band, I just do not understand where they went wrong.

After working for close to an hour to steam summer squash (which should take 20 minutes at most), I gave up and dumped the squash into the steaming water and boiled it.

I do not recommend that any one purchases a Microtek product. I will only buy Canon or HP. I'm forced now to go out and buy another scanner soon. Its very frustrating. I, like the others, experienced that the lamp stayed on. And for me, the scanning \\"rod\\" inside would not move and scan the objects. Now please note that I have used this scanner all of 10-15 times since I've purchased it, so its not like I've used it daily. Again, stick with the big guys (Canon and HP).

This album sounds like Andy Latimer decided one day to record an album featuring all the hallmark 70s sounds: dry, close-up vocals; meandering melodies; an unashamedly progressive feel and guitar work that could indeed just as well been featured on Snowgoose or Mirage. I like the fact that Rajaz is not seamless like Dust and Dreams, where skipping the unwanted tracks is a nightmare. Here too, there are weaker moments (Straight To My Heart being one) and some of the lyrics register high on the cheezometer, but all in all Rajaz is a majestic effort. One of their best, in fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great More Recent Effort From Camel","review":"\\"Rajaz\\" is a studio album that has a general theme dealing with the desert. It is conceptual in nature, but does not really appear to tell a linear story from beginning to end. The album harkens back to Camel's classic 70's sound and is really an outstanding piece of work. A key lineup addition to this album is Tom Scherpenzeel (Kayak) on keyboards. His signature is written all over this album, although in a subtle, often times background way. Andy Latimer's guitar work is as strong as ever and the overall quality of the music is outstanding throughout. Highlights include the title track \\"Rajaz\\". The all instrumental \\"Sahara\\", and the album closer \\"Lawrence\\". Really there is not a weak spot on the album as it is solid from beginning to end.

The characters are common enough that they you can easily relate to them, but interesting enough that you want to hear their story. The pace of the story is excellent: fast enough that you don't spend weeks trying to finish an overly-detailed epic, but slow enough that the details Mr. Rosin provide melt into your brain with picturesque clarity. The story is about an FBI investigation, but the reader finds themselves not so much worried about who pulled the trigger, like in most mysteries, but wondering which choices the character will have to make depending on who the killer is.

And like all Calphalon pans, you need less heat to do the same task than some other pans (also clearly stated in the directions). I haven't burned my pan, and haven't had anything stick to it either. I think most of the problems people have with Calphalon, is they throw away the directions before reading them.

A totally enriching experience. Also enjoyed the deleted scenes and the family tree extra. Was nice to find out when Michael was born and died.What makes this series enduring is that we see the good and the bad in each person. Sort of like seeing King David with all his good and bad traits in the Old Testament. Makes him believable, a real human being.I loved the baptism/elimination sequence in Godfather I.

Underaged, I begged my parents to take me to what would have been my first experience with an R-rated movie. I was told to wait a few years. Being the precocious and good girl that I was, I waited until I was \\"old enough\\" to watch the movie; however, I did not wait to get my hands on the novel, Mario Puzo's greatest and most famous work to date. Even at a tender young age, I loved the book. My parents, of course, had no idea I was reading the book! Finally saw Parts I & II following my high school graduation and have been a fan of both movies ever since. Like most Hollywood classics, they never get old.That said, I was not at all thrilled with Part III. But no matter as I am getting all 3 movies (and then some) for the Deal of the Day price of $25.00 (not to mention free shipping). In blu-ray format, this set is not offered anywhere else for this low price. I checked!Way to go, Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Boringfather is moar liek it. LOLOL!","review":"I know this series is in high regard for being the greatest gangster film of all-time, so I decided to check it out myself. Originally it was WAY too long for me to even want to see, but I was curious so one afternoon I sat through all of these films. That's 8 hours I'll never get back! I could've been doing something productive like playing World Of Warcraft instead. The films dragged on WAY too long and overstayed their welcome by about an hour each. There wasn't enough violence to make this a worthwhile gangster flick. Also, it was annoying when they spoke in Italian. They should've dubbed the voices instead. No one wants to read subtitles! How inconvenient. Finally, I'm giving this 2 stars because the third one was the only watchable one. Sequels made 20 years later are the bomb!See the new Johnny Depp movie \\"Public Enemies\\" or \\"Get Carter\\", \\"Be Cool\\" or \\"Dick Tracy\\" for real gangster films!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Mafia glorification from the $ crew","review":"Hollywood and the American movie-going public are inexplicably addicted to mafia-glorifying garbage. The Godfather is the bombastic epitome of this twisted world view, wherein criminals are heroes.

I love the films as much as anyone, but cannot DE-recommend this collection enough.Coppola obviously put absolutely NO effort into cleaning up the old prints. Seeing that he has not done anything really worthy since 1979 (Apocolypse Now), I take this release as a way for Coppola and Paramount to maximize their return at the expense of quality, and our pocketbooks.Please, don't make the mistake I did.

It simply places itself one level higher than other movies. It has been written with perfection by Mario Puzo, deserving the credit it has been given. A masterpiece portraying the life of Don Corleone(Marlon Brando) and his powerful family. An important part is played by Micheal, his youngest son, who rises in the family business at the end of the movie.. An incredible piece with kingly performances by Pacino, Brando, Caan and Robert Duvall. My favourite quote is: Michael: Sonny, its not personal, its just business. The intense acting by Pacino and Brando will keep you on the edge of your seat. A great depiction of the mafia in New York. Defintely one of my favourite movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressing !","review":"GODFATHER 1When my dad first introduced me to this movie,I really thought it is about a godfather.But when my dad told me what it was about(a mafia group) I immediately said : \\"No Daddy,I don't want to see this movie.When the movie started,it was in a way quite boring for a 9 year old kid.But when I manage to flow with the movie,I got engrossed with it.It is about the Corleone family.They are mafia.This Don Corleone has three children and a daughter.Tom Hegon is Don Coleone's adopted son.Sonny,Micheal and Fredo are his real sons.Some parts are really brutal.So I encourage young kids to cover their eyes when it comes to a brutal part.I admire Tom for his loyalty,Sonny for his violence and Micheal for his amazing brain.The Corleone family,Tattaglia family and many other groups are fighting for supremacy.A lot of brutal actions take place.All the families fight each other.I was really anxious for the Corleone family.Watch this movie and you won't regret buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The DVD collection is a must for fans of the movie trilogy.","review":"The bonus features is why I purchased the dvd collection of the movie trilogy.

The transaction was smooth and satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S NOT DIGITALY REMASTERED","review":"To Start the Movies are awesome for sure. But I had the Collection on tape already, and the quality is no diferent, they just threw the same picture on the DVDS with the one bonus disk with the extra footage, which is the only reason I gave it a 2. So basically I paid 80 dollars for the extra bonus footage. Almost all the other commentaries were on the tapes as well. The first DVD is all pixilated on an HD TV, and the sound quality is terrible as well. Pretty much the same for them all though. I am very disappointed in Paramount for this rerelease to DVD. They need to take a look at how Lucas remastered the StarWars, Which in My opinion is no where near as good as a movie as the Godfathers. Maybe in another 10 years, or when they want to make more money off of the trilogy, they will digitally remaster, and sell a special edition godfather trilogy set and make another 80 dollars off of everyone. Sad part is, I will buy it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Magnificent Series","review":"I am a huge film aficionado and only just recently did I get the opportunity to watch the three Godfather films. I must say that all three floored me. Perhaps I was able to love the third film simply because I had not heard much from other people about any of the films, so going into it I was not affected by other opinions. I feel blessed that I was able to watch this excellent trilogy much like one goes in reading a great novel. The Godfather Part III may not be an equal to the first two, but it undeniably completes the story of Michael Corleone, and it does so splendidly. This saga is a must for anyone who loves movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great trilogy","review":"We really enjoyed watching these movies. I recommend this set to anyone who enjoys thoughtful action movies.

The names have been changed to protect the guilty - but the archetypes remain. Every-bit a story about the great immigration of Europeans; thrown into the American melting pot and a resulting clash of cultures nobody utterly understood. Go to church on Sunday and kill you rivals on Monday. For many, the American way? This is a revealing look at human nature in all its gory glory."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Blu-Ray purchases out there.","review":"Don't listen to the naysayers, because the picture quality is amazing. It really does look like a new 35mm print of the film. Naturally this means that the film grain is retained, but if that bothers you, then you really shouldn't be watching these movies in the first place. The colors are amazingly rich, and the detail is not lost in the transfer from film to Blu-Ray.This set comes with a disc containing a ridiculous amount of supplementary materiel, including all the supplementary material from the Godfather DVDs. Interviews, behind-the-scenes, you name it, it's there.I do have to say that I don't really care for The Godfather Part 3, but I'm not going to detract a star just for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best gangster film ever!!!","review":"The Godfather isn't only about gangsters, it's also about a man trying to care for his family, and giving them evrything he didn't have as a child. Francis has never made a movie as good as this one. This film has a little of everything for the family. It has violence, drama, comedy, and love/commitment to a family. Marlon Brando at his best. This movie made Al and Robert famous in hte business. Never will there be a gangster film as good as \\"The Godafather\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite simply one of the best movies ever made....EVER!","review":"I don't really know how to review this film. All I know is that i love this film. The Godfather Part I is truly brilliant. The scene where Micheal murders McClusky and Sollazo makes me nervous every time I watch it even though I know what is going to happen. In The Godfather Part II, my favourite scene is where Micheal has his enemy's killed, when he is looking out over the lake while his brother is shot. Part III wasn't that bad either. when in comparison to Parts I and II, then I can see why people have reached the conclusion that it is pants. However, when watched as an individual film it is a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality is not of Blu Ray Standards","review":"The movie is 5 star. But I am rating the Blu Ray version, not the movie itself. Unless there is something wrong with my Blu Ray copy, then the God Father Blu Ray is not worth the money. Unlike other Blu Ray movies, where there is a significant noticeable difference in the quality of the Blu Ray version vs. non Blu Ray, I perceived no difference.I am not saying that if you had both a Blu Ray and non Blu Ray version of the Godfather running side by side, that you would not be able to see a difference. Just that with other Blu Ray movies, the difference to me has always been clear with a Wow factor. No Wow with the Godfather Blu Ray.I haven't watch Part II of the set, maybe it has improved quality.Not worth the money for the package. This is the only Blu Ray I have purchased where I have been disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not restored video -Laser disk actually better","review":"Complete rip-off. Sound quality is enhanced while video is grainy much of the time especially in dark places. And lots of video noise especially when you look at the sky. I wanted to replace my Laser disk set....not worth the expense. I went back to look at my Laser Disks and the viewing experience was much more pleasant on the Laser Disk. At times the Blu-ray will be clearer but not often...and they did something with skin tones making them look less natural sometimes blotchy. I am shocked by this restoration....and will not be so eager to replace perfectly fine Laser Disks or older DVDs transferred to Blu-ray.If directors cannot improve the picture and sound quality they should not release on Blu-ray.

What exactly did they spend that year they claim the restoration took doing? I understand that older movies won't ever look as good as other BluRay transfers but this is basically a rip-off. I have several other versions of these movies and wouldn't have bought this one if i had had any sense that the picture quality would not be any better....who would?

I can't wait for the DVD of all three of them. This movie is almost completely aloof from criticism. When people do speak badly of it, the say it glorifies violence and organized crime. This is not true. It really shows the bad side of organized crime. In the end, Michael Corleone faces many losses because of organized crime. His wife leaves him, his daughter is killed, he orders the killing of his brother and brother in law, his nephews are left fatherless because of him. In the end, he dies all alone by himself. He has lost everyone and everything he ever really cared about. So instead of a saga glorifying violence and the mafia, it is really a tragedy showing the ill effects of the mafia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movies- horrible DVD transfer","review":"The movies are no different than before, and it's nice to see the bonus footage. But the transfers are horrendous, to say the least. Even Part 3, released in 1990, looks terrible. I've seen it look better on cable, so it's not as if there aren't better versions around.

As an owner of the previously released trilogy on VHS, the video quality of these DVD's is astonishingly poor in comparision. There is a tremendous amount of grain visible, it's overly dark with poor shadow detail and there's been no attempt to clean up the dirt, specks and scratches.

It's unbelievable, I absolutely love it! I've never seen The Godfather 2 & 3 but I've seen the first one. The first time I saw The first Godfather was in my uncles car while my cousins, uncle and myself were driving up to Laughlin, Nevada. My uncle has a VCR in his Expedition so we decided to take The Godfather, because it was just about a 3-hour movie, which was perfect (the road trip was 3 hours long). So I've seen the first Godfather during spring break of 2001 and it was great. I plan to watch the whole DVD Collection with my cousin David this weekend (he hasn't bought it yet so he wants me to go over his house this weekend because he wants to see it).

Many times i have turned to the Godfather moive to see how Michael Corleon [Al Pacino]would handel a problem. It's hard to think that no sequal to a movie could beat the first, but Francis Ford Coppola did it. I have to admit the second is better than the first and the third lacks in the long run, but over all it ranks on top. The DVD collection is the one thing that could keep me up all night. Wathching out takes, acadamy award speeches, the director and actors speaking about making the movie, and wathching deleted materials is simply the best.

The leftover extras from the first set are still great like the hour-long documentary on the making of the saga and the slew of deleted scenes that do add new layers (and for thos complaining about this not being the \\"Saga\\" set, some of those scenes are included in this category). So for any fan of either these films or just great movies in general, this set is a must-have in order to enjoy these classics to their fullest."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"Awesome collection.

Truly a classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.\\"( the don)","review":"This collection, despite the weakness of the 3rd one is necessary in every collection. The movies contain some of the best actors ever from Marlon Brando, to Al Pacino, to Robert De Niro, to Robert Duvall. These movies speaking about the mafia are true classics and listen to all of the reviews here. You shouldn't rent it, you must buy it. Although it does cost a good amount of $, it will be watched over and over again. The first two are gems anf the scene where Michael Corleone removes the gun from the bathroom to \\"take care of business\\", will always be in my head one of the best scenes of all time.Watch it, watch it again, and remember it. Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece is something that everyone will love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Belief","review":"This trilogy is by far the most excilerating ever. It tells the story of the rise and fall of the Corleone crime family. Although this is a fictional story, It is one of the best stories that portrays the acts of a real Mafia family. After Vito Corleone(Michael's father) dies, it is up to Michael to take up the family business. Michael finds himself turning into one of the most feared gangters of his time. Watch this action packed film with plenty of mind blowing suprises. It is an all around great trilogy staring;Al Pacino,Marlin Brando,Robert Deniro and other great actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very LAZY \\"Restoration\\".....","review":"I bought the 2001 DVD box set and was happy with it, but when the Blu Ray set was released I was excited....Until I watched it!!The Blu Ray set does NOT look much different than the DVD set (which I set up side by side to check them out in my home theater). In fact, the DVD set on an upconvert DVD player looks BETTER!!Save your money and just buy or keep your DVD set, you WILL NOT be happy with the so called Blu Ray version....it's really just the DVD set on Blue Ray discs if you ask me.....and DARK too, some scenes are hard to see also....the dark is too dark even in a pitch black room as I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"They made me an offer, and I refused!","review":"Talk about the DVD DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE YEAR!

I was hoping to see some additional footage not in the video versions, but scenes that we have seen when the movies are being played on cable tv. The was the reason for the 4 stars. I like the DVD collection better than video for the mere fact that I dont have to get up and change the tapes, except for the GODFATHER 2 here. In my opinion that makes the movies easier to watch and enjoy. If you love the Godfater Trilogy, I dont think that this set will disappoint you.

If you have [this] (from the video usually rather than the original master, because its so much cheaper to do it that way) transfer, a great film is ruined (The Last Emporer comes to mind) because VHS is unbearably grainy at that size. Why am I posting this?Yes, they did such a transfer for this classic. My eyes weap to see all the lush richness of Coppola's camera lost.

For those of you that have not seen the blend of 1 and 2 I feel sorry for you deeply deeply sorry, you know not what you are missing and this box set is just a box compared to the blend."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Soap Opera for Men","review":"Does nobody have the \\"cajones\\" to say it? Sure, the few Brando scenes we get in the first installment are priceless (as if Brando needs to stuff cotton into his mouth to make his speech less understandable than it already is), and Al Pacino's horrible speech impediment is craftily covered up by a somewhat contrived \\"broken jaw\\", but Puzo's Godfather series is nothing more than a soap opera for men.Instead of interviews with Francis Coppola and the now-dead Puzo at the beginning of the tapes, I think they should have had commercials for Old Spice and Right Guard.All in all, the series is part of a growing American genre that glorifies the terrible acts of bullies. Hey, we love mobsters in America. Kudos to the now-dead Puzo for delivering this violence to our households in a charming fashion.In case you think this is a pan, I've seen these movies several hundred times, and I know almost every line from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING - SPLIT MOVIE","review":"just RETURNED the Godfather DVD set - I was absolutely disgusted that Paramount would put HALF a movie on one dic and HALF on another.

In a few words, they're masterpieces, pure and simple.So I'll make this review short and to the point.This set has the terrifying \\"Discs made in Mexico\\" sticker that is synonym of cheap labor and low quality control. You better check your discs for fingerprints and even scratches on the data side.I knew that there was something up when I bought this boxset for only $22.49, it just didn't occured to me at the time that this was the reason for the dirty-cheap price.Even then, I've decided to knock only one star down from this review, because, like I already said, these movies are masterpieces and I was really happy to finally have them on my slowly growing Blu-Ray collection.So for all of you guys that are always concerned about the country of origin of your products, this is a Mexican boxset."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"I love the Godfather trilogy, truly a classic series.

The sound and picture are excellent and the movie just looks great. As for the bonus material, I hope you have a few hours to waste, because this this is filled to the rim with bells and whistles. My only knock is the The Godfather Part II, is on two discs, but considering the movie is 3 1/2 hours long it might be understandable, but I figured they could have jammed it onto one disc by dual layering.

I think they should have some posters of the movie attached along with an interview with Bridget Fonda. She is the most amazing actress ever.

One and Two are among my favorite movies of all time. But Coppola made a lousy movie with Three and now he wants us to pay for it. I mean its a shame his kid can't act worth a dime (have you seen her in anything before or since?) but why pick our pockets for it. So that leaves us paying at least 75 bucks for 2 (albeit great) movies. Please, we've all waited this long, wait a little longer and they'll have no choice but to split them up and we can all buy the movies we want rather than having an aweful movie cramed into our collections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Close to HD But a Good Story","review":"I purchased the Blue Ray treatment of this classic as a requested gift. If you already own this on DVD save your money because the HD treatment is VERY poor. Comparing my 5+ years old DVD version which has been watched at least 5 times with the 'NEW' BlueRay treatment I have to say neither offers a better picture -- and the improved picture is what I thought I was chasing.Two stars because it is the Godfather.

For the following reasons:1. Each part comes on a DVD that has nothing on it but the movie itself. Just Scenes Selection, Play The Movie & Set Up.2. The God Father 2 comes on two DVDs!!! Can you imagine changing DVDs in the middle of watching the movie?!! The film was 200 minutes long. Why on earth it was put on two DVDs instead of one?!!3. The documentary (Bonus DVD) is worthless!!! For God's sake, how can they satisfy The Godfather fans with such non sense?!!

Instead, it was pan and scanned to 1.78:1 (16:9) to fill HDTV screens without a small but necessary letterbox. Therefore, part of every frame is cut out. It is inexcusable for this landmark piece of American film history. Amazon has the spec wrong, and the packaging conveniently does not list the aspect ratio. For all of the reviewers who don't notice or complain about this, maybe they have never viewed these discs. Unfortunately I did not notice until it was too late to return it, otherwise I would have.

Coppola's directorial vision and production of Mario Puzo's the Godfather leaves you with you with all your emotions entangled. Love, hate, honor, respect, sadness, happines and fear is all part of this great 3-part epic. The life of a three generation Mafia family binds you from the opening line till the gripping ending of part three. There has not since been another Cosa Nostra epic of these proportions. A fouth DVD gives you a very indepth look at the making of the Godfather. Interviews, production sets and much more gives you a pretty good idea of the brilliance of Coppola.

This was a 3 cassette set that dealt with the Limberlost 2 movies and a documentary, they were all great but the whole set did not go to DVD only the two individual movies City Boy and Girl of the Limberlost.

It is more puzzle than novel; a prophecy is introduced (we know not from where) and we are to guess its hidden meaning before the 'climactic' ending explains its metaphors, the entire solution laid out in great detail during the denouement as a detective would explain a murder at the end of a mystery novel.

So why no DVD yet?","review":"This film has once again illustrated the story telling expertise of European film makers. Given the fact that it won the 1991 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, I can't understand why it hasn't been released on DVD. This is a wonderful film. Totally unique when compared to most American movies and yet totally absorbing. It tells the story of a group of misfit Italian soldiers sent to occupy the tiniest Greek island during WW II but manages to tell us the story of each individual character as well. This is a comical, provocative, warm, endearing, movie especially for those who have a profound love of life!

It is definitely not sci-fi, nor is the story particularly interesting. It is more of a mystery/thriller that happens to involve Da Vinci going forward in time mysteriously (it just sorta happens). The author's take on how Da Vinci adapts to 1980's Canada is not bad, but could have been explored more deeply. The whole caper with Sparo Aeronautics is run of the mill fare. And the author's fascination with dorm-mates bathing and drinking together naked is just plain weird.300 odd pages later it might have made a fine short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassingly bad","review":"This is probably the worst book I actually read to thelast page.

This novel has its own ironic but not unsympathetic tone towards it characters. You might hear some echoes of John Barth, Nabokov, S.J. Perelman in terms of the novel's unusual set up, humor, and wordplay. The humor in particular is interesting because much of it is sharp-edged satire of the absurdly monied classes of the eighties and nineties, with their grotesque MacMansions, devotion to gigantic cars, and the need to demonstrate to one and all that they are indeed richer than you. Yet, once we meet one of these people in the form of Arthur Worthy, we are charmed by him, much as Theo, the neo-Thoreauvian butler, is charmed. The details are rich, the oddities entertaining (I shall never look at a wrought-iron railing again without certain unrelated words coming to mind), and the twists and turns unexpected.Buy it, read it, and read it again.

I own 3 Columbia fleeces: 2 have the traditional black & white tag, use YKK zippers and were manufactured in China. After 6 years of heavy wear they still look and fit beautifully (fading is nonexistent on the black one). The most recent fleece has a blue & white tag and lacks YKK zippers.

Then, an inside pocket is needed, since this really is a jacket. The zipper isn't lined up properly. That makes the fit even worse, when it's zipped up. I'll keep this one because I like the color and that's the only reason. I also ordered a grey, but it came with a broken zipper I couldn't get to zip. I returned it.

This book was about a drummer boy during the 1800's. The drummer boys were in the front of the army usually but sometimes in the back. They were the heart of the army, when their pace picked up the soldiers pace picked up.This boy was only about 16 years old. When the boy was sitting down by a tree the general comes and talkes to him. He talks to him about the war and how much they need him. If you want to know more about this book than check \\"The Red Badge Of Courage\\" out of you library or buy it.I think that this book was good, I liked it a lot.

Every other soldier the protagonist fights with, instead of being given a name, is labeled with an adjective such as 'loud soldier' or 'tall soldier'. Whilst I accept the author was trying to show the reader how anonymous the people you fight with are in a war, it also meant that the characters came across as flat and uninspiring, and the reader never gets to know or understand them.Although I have not enjoyed other classic works of literature in the past, I have always been able to see past my opinions and understand why they are regarded so highly. I did not feel that with this book at all. The prose was dull, the style did not engage me at all, and I am still struggling to understand why it is rated by so many people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok tapes","review":"I liked the book but these unabridged tapes where very boaring , the reader has a tiring voice , and the quality of the sound is poor. i think reading the book is a better alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"The book is totally boring I got thru the first 4 pages an stopped I have to do a book report for school so can someone do it for me??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Booooorrring!!!!!","review":"I'm in the 10th grade and I was assigned to read this book and it was horrible.

I quite thoroughly despised this book, as much as I've hated anything in a long time. The main character is a jerk set up to look like a developing hero, only the development is shallow and unlikable. The sudden enlightenment at the end is even worse -- my response was not only a general \\"yeah, right,\\" but a \\"man, did The Youth die and was replaced by some alien presence?\\" The only good aspect of this book was that I got to write a really scathing paper on it for English, which is always fun. Suffice it to say, I didn't like it. However, I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading it, because it's an acknowledged American classic, so SOMEONE out there must like it -- there must be some merit to it, it just didn't appeal to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Red Badge of Courage","review":"My name is B.S.M and I am in the 8th grade. I just read Red Badge of Courage by Stephen Crane and I thought it was not very good because personally I am not very into books about war and viloence. The book took place during the Civil War and was about a young boy named Henry who goes out and fights in the Civil War. In this book, I enjoyed the part where Henry grabs the Union flag from the dieing General because it showed Henry proving himself and making up for when he fleed in the beginning of the book. If I could change anything in this story it would be that the tall soilder dosen't die. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Red Badge of Courage: Stephen Crane's masterpiece","review":"People say that The Red Badge of Courage is Stephen Crane's best piece of writing. Personally, I think that if The Red Badge of Courage is his best, then he shouldn't have been a writer. The Red Badge of Courage had no action. The entire book was detail. Nothing but detail, and that made it boring. This book was a war oriented book. Stephen Crane should have put some more action in the book, because that's what war is, action. Stephen Crane just described Henry's battles, but if I wrote the book, I would have placed Henry at the battle. I'm not slamming the book. It was okay at some times. I knoe it must have took Stephen Crane a lot of thought and effort to come up with the detailed descriptions that he did. I would not recomend this book to a friend. It was really dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't stand it","review":"I hate this book. I have to read it for a book project and it is absolutely the worst book I have ever read in my entire life.

The book does not have any cliff hangers. It is really boring the author makes the book so boring you could fall asleep if someone is reading it to you.

If you have already read it it has wasted allot of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, to say the least.","review":"\\"The Red Badge of Courage\\" is a poor excuse for a classic. I took me over a month to finish this dreadful book, and I have nothing to show for it. I've gained nothing by reading it, except hatred towards Crane's writing style.

In this book, I enjoyed the part where the loud solider, Wilson, changed his personality because the war had changed him and he is like a motherly figure now. If I could change anything in this story, it would be Henry because he questions his own character. I do not recommend this book for any girl. If you like a classic Civil War book, I think this is a story for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"a masterpiece to be enjoyed","review":"There is an old saying: no one returns the same from war. The universality of this statement is masterfully demonstrated in Crane's _The Red Badge of Courage_.The experiences Henry Fleming has before his first battle: the bragging, the terror, the confusion, horror, and anger are all reminiscent of my own emotions before combat. Such timelessness and clarity are all hallmarks of a classic. I am all the more surprised to learn that Crane created this work entirely as fiction, having never experienced these things first hand. That his character is ultimately hailed as a \\"hero\\" for doing nothing (in his mind) heroic is further testament to the genius of the work. It takes only a few days to read, but it is worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Reveiw","review":"The Red Badge of Courage was a great book.My favorite chapter is 1, I liked chapter 1 because it was really cool how Stephan Crane talked about the fog and the setting and soldiers.

Stephen Crane's RED BADGE OF COURAGE was a standard part of my course's curriculum every year. It is a classic, and it deserves to be one. It tells the tale of The Youth who goes off to war imagining war to be a glorious encounter with nobility on all sides. As he endures his first battle, he learns otherwise. There has never been a better book written about the American Civil War, or was that war called (as my mother, an Alabama girl, referred to it) The War of Northern Aggression."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you didn't read this in high school...","review":"If you didn't read this in high school, you should have.

The Red Badge of Courage story will touch anyone who is old and honest enough to admit our true feelings and emotions when face with certain death."},{"rating":"1","title":"American, yes!

Despite the fact that this is the only Stephen Crane book I have read, I already have a very bad impression of the author and have no intention of reading any more of his books.The characters in this book are extremely underdeveloped, and Crane's way of reverting back and forth between actual names and descriptions such as \\"Wilson\\" and \\"the Loud Soldier\\" gets extremely confusing at times. I feel no real connection between the characters, and even when they died I felt no emotion whatsoever.Also, this book requires much more action than it contains. Most of this book is about Henry's inner struggles and his thoughts, most of which are about whether he should fight or run.Crane's style is also probably the most boring I have ever encountered. It is like a dull monotone, and I found myself dropping off to sleep as I read this.Do not read this book, much less buy it, if you can help it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and hard to understand","review":"I really did not enjoy this book because it was very bland and everything had to have a description after it.

The main character might be a little hot headed, but there is a reason for that. Steven Crane is trying to get an idea across to the reader that life is not always the way that you would like it to be, or what you thought it would be when you first went into a certain experience. I was required to read this novel for school and found it a very good contrast of Henry David Thoreau's work in Walden. Nathaniel Hawthorne has the same ideas behind Steven Crane's writing. Life is not always what you think it should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the two or three dollars","review":"Reading The Red Badge of Courage was almost as pleasant as getting body hair waxed. The novel by Stephen Crane, while having extensive and descriptive figurative language, lacked a thorough plot, one with a beginning, middle, and end. I suggest to the reader if they want to get any pleasure out of it, to read it on a very superficial and shallow level. Reading it for school only takes away from the book and causes the student to become distracted with the pointing out of all the figurative language and color descriptions. In my opinion, the only way to enjoy this piece is to read it as a young kid that way no analysis is going to take place."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Appreciation Of Beauty","review":"\\"So it came to pass that as he trudged from the place of blood and wrath his soul changed. He came from hot plowshares to prospects of clover tranquilly, and it was as if hot plowshares were not. Scars faded as flowers.\\" Perhaps not the best quote, but it is at least a taste of the work of art that is The Red Badge of Courage. It has been suggested that this book lacks plot, that it is boring. I would count those who consider this boring amoung the numbers of people who would find an art museum dull. It has also been suggested that the main character, Henry, referred to as \\"the youth,\\" is a coward. Anyone who could say that obviously did not read this book through to the end. It gave me insight into the Civil War that no History teacher ever could. The details of both the scenery and the youths feelings and thoughts is thorough but elegant. If this appeals to you, you are in for a treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Action packed and educational book","review":"Stephen Crane has done the imposible! He has made a book that is action packed and that is educaional! the book is about a young boy who enlists for the cival war and is given a look of what war is realy about.

The book is about a soldier finding his courage by the end of the book, but my feelings were, \\"Thank God its over!\\" The moral of the story could of been to not give up on things that seem impossible at the moment but the book, while reading, seemed pointless and very boring.

I. like the rest of US grade schoolers, had to read this.. watch the movie... read it agian in a lter class.. and watch the movie again. Now in 12th grade, and looking back..

I was required to read it for school, and not only is it totally confusing and unrealistic, but the descriptions of battles and dead soldiers are repulsive. It stars a young man who wishes to gain his own \\"red badge of courage,\\" a battle wound, in order to \\"prove\\" his courage. This young man supposedly \\"grows up\\" after seeing the horrors of war, but, personally, his maturity seems rather debatable to me. For a better Civil War era book, I would recommend \\"Killer Angels,\\" or for another point of view, \\"Gone with the Wind.\\" I think your time should be spent reading more valuble novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Epic in a minute space","review":"I found the book \\"The Red Badge of Courage\\" quite impressive. I found it as a very interesting short novel. It was quite different from the long novels that i am used to reading. As many novels use many pages to convey its story and meaning, \\"The Red Badge of Courage\\" was able to do just that in such a small amount of space. The characters and dialogue were well thought out and vivid, creating an atmosphere in which you felt you were part of. The book conveyed the feeling of war and battle in a fashion i found very effective, as war is one of the things i am most interested in. The feeling of intense battle and warfare, with the bullets piercing the flesh of the soldiers whom destinies were carved by the guns of the enemies, was quite overwhelming at times, but created a brilliant atmosphere. I quite enjoyed the book as it was a nice read that didn't take too long, but was as effective as a full length novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring and Very hard to read","review":"I have attempted to Read the Red Badge of Courage twice, both times resulting in giving up on the book. The word usage very stange and unless you have a dictionary next to you to look up words in every paragraph, your going to have a difficult time trying to understand the text. It may have been considerd a classic in its day but it doesn't hold much Relevance anymore especially compared to many other civil war books. Even as you get more into the book the plot is still satisfactory at best. I however grant it at least 1 star for historical accuracy. It does a pretty good job of keeping it realistic to what actually happend in the civil war.

Maybe it is considered a classic because it was the first book about war to employ this strategy.The book is poorly written. The sentences are choppy. There is no flow, no lyricism and ultimately little point in any of it.If this manuscript was submitted today to any publisher it would be laughed at and thrown in the garbage. It is that badly written. Unless you're forced to read this for some class stay away. If you are a lover of great literature you will be greatly disappointed.

The book took place during the Civil War and was about a young boy named Henry who desperately wanted to be a heroic soldier. In this book, I enjoyed the part where Henry joined the line of wounded soldiers, and found his friend Jim Conklin because it was good to see them find each other. If I could change anything in this story, it would be the way the dialogue is written, because it was sometimes hard to understand. I do recommend this book even though it was sort of slow. I recommend this book because I think that it is a classic book, and has been around for a while, and everybody should get a chance to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic? Not in my book...","review":"The Red Badge of Courage, written by Stephen Crane, for me, was not entertaining. I found myself lost in most parts of the book. Crane is a very talented writer, he is very descriptive in his works, but I just do not prefer his writing style. If you prefer hemmingway-straight and to the point, you won't enjoy Crane's writing. Stephen Crane spends a lot more slower pace on his point making. Usualy taking a page to explain one thing. Another interested fact that I saw in Crane's writing was that he doesn't name specificly his characters. Instead he will use a characteristic that they will go by through the whole book. Again, I thought this book was very boring, and found my self drifting away from it. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another over-rated antiquity","review":"I had heard the praises of this book sung so many times, perhaps it was doomed to disappoint me. After wading through this convoluted and disorganized \\"classic\\", I was left with little but disbelief and a feeling of being cheated.Don't be mistaken; I understand that war in general (and in all likelihood civil wars more than any other) ARE convoluted and disorienting by nature. Nevertheless, this book utilizes disorganized, repetitive, and hollow sentences to describe, almost as if Crane were using the intrinsic qualities of the war itself as a crutch.I would only recommend this novel as a quick (couple of hours)route to teach readers to keep an open mind; that antiquated \\"popular\\" opinions should not be subscribed to blindly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boredom and Imagination in the American Civil War","review":"I really have to wonder what the intention of this book was. Was it a history, to give readers an idea of what the war was like? If so then the author certainly failed. While there are not enough details provided in the book for certain innacuracies to be pointed out one glaring detail was the almost total lack of interaction with civilians in the war. But perhaps some great philosophical point is being raised here? Probably not because the lesson at the end of this book is hardly universal and most people learn it before they leave elementary school. If you want to read good, realistic books about wars (Civil War included), check out Bernard Cornwell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly Emotional and Poorly Structured","review":"This book was recommended to me by an employee at Barnes and Noble. The employee said it was very emotional and touching. They were correct. The characters in this book sign up for the Civil War hoping for glory, but realize the war is a horrible thing to experience. The characters in this dark romantic book over react to everything and become very bleak and gloomy. The book would only interest those looking to read about touchy children complaining about everything. The language used in the book is very unnatural and does not flow at all. This book is very similar to All Quiet on The Western Front except the characters are less captivating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time","review":"I don't feel that I can adequately express my disdain for this book. I would rate it as one of the worst books that I have ever read. The main plot and theme of the novel would normally make for a good read: A youth hurt in the civil war matures after rationally evaluating his perceptions of the war. Stephen Crane, however, has taken this idea and gives the impression that he has somehow infused an unwieldy verbosity to the main character, and the book drags unnecessarily."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT READ THIS BOOK","review":"I think that this book is horrible because it is extremely boring and most of the time you have no idea what anyone is doing.

The soldiers hardly do anything.I enjoy reading about the Civil War, but surely not in this book. I think the writers who raved about this book had to be drunk when they wrote those positive reviews.

It was really and truly one of the worst books I've ever read. It would take me forever to describe just how awful it is, but these are the main problems:(1) There is ABOSLUTELY NO PLOT WHATSOEVER.(2) The little dialouge that there is, well, it's mostly swearing--not to mention the fact that I can imagine what a farm boy from the 1860s sounded like without having his accent spelled out for me.(3) The main character (who is never addressed by his name unless someone's talking to him, he's always just \\"the youth\\") is a wimp and a coward! Okay, I can see how war would be terrifying, yes, I can't understand that--but, my gosh! He's such a wuss that it's almost sickening.(4) The book is altogether badly written. The sentences are awkward, and I kept getting lost.

It took too long sometimes to get to the next point, making me wonder, \\"When will I ever get to the next interesting part?\\" But the good news is you'll never be too far from the next one.

His writing is hard to understand and harder to interpret in even the most shallowest of ways. It's not just because of his time period. I've read Twain and his books were 10 times easier to understand, even with his usage of dialogue. You know what, forget Crane and just head over to Twain, who is more worthy of your time.

I just read the Red Badge of Courage by Stephan Crane and I thought it was bad becuase it was a very slow. boring. and repetitive book. The book took place during the Civil War and was about a boy named Henry and his thoughts and feelings as he went through different battles and challanges of war. In this book I enjoyed the part when it ended and in whch Henry met the 3 men his regiment captured from the Confederates. If I could change anything in this story it would be the ending I thought it was bad and just left the story unfinished. It was almost like Stephan Crane wanted to finish it as quickly as possible and took the first chance he got. I do recommend this book to people over 50 years of age and people who can't take to much of anything at one time.

Then you here about the Red Badge of courage Henry wants to get hurt or shot or something so he can have a red badge of courage or what the common person would call bad luck. But Henry wants glory and how is he going to get it unless he gets hurt. Crane has the tendency to compare everything with everything whether it's necessary or not.

The symbolism is wonderful, the metaphors add beautifully to the story, and even the physical descriptions are well written. But I don't LIKE Henry Fleming!

I am sorry I missed out. The length certainly makes this book easy and accessible to people of all ages, but it is so much more. Not only is it very fast paced, unpredictable, and the best character study I've ever read, but it is timeless. It is about war, specifically the Civil War, but there are no politics or specifics about that war, it is about the emotions of a youth at war and the world through his eyes. There is no difference between what he is thinking as his regiment is charging and what a 20 year old in a modern war would feel. Though Crane had never seen a war before writing this book, he paints an incredibly powerful, honest, and realistic portrayal. It is a fantastic book and one that deserves a very careful, detailed reading, but can also be enjoyed and finished in a couple hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review from spellbound Teen","review":"This was a very historaclly accurate book.

It is a classic story telling how a young man conquers his fear throughout the Civil War. Henry's dream is to find glory and honor in the Union Army. After running from his first battle he eventually finds his regiment. While Henry is on his own trying to find his regiment, he is hit on the head with a gun. Henry lies to his regiment and tells them he was shot in the head. But after Henry lies a few times he starts to build courge. Henry then leads his regiment to victory and at last conquers his fear, achieving his dream of glory and honor.I would recommend this book to just about anyone.

Not that it was particularly gruesome, or anything---just SO BORING.Easy on the description already, Crane! It's not a capital crime to insert some dialogue in every now and then. Honestly, this book is 98% long paragraphs, 2% short dialogue. Supposedly it paved the way for the \\"modern American novel,\\" but thank goodness we've evolved over time! I shudder to imagine current novels resembling this book.Granted, the book made me think. How would I react if I was in the main character's place, my life constantly in jeopardy?

It is true Crane never saw battle in his life, publishers have never made a secret of this, but after the book debued he was congradulated by war veterans for his accurate depictions and even consulted by various periodicals as a war coorespondant.

I've gotten \\"For Dummies\\" books in the past and have had great success with them; however, this particular one is confusing, non-discriptive, and the pictures are vague. I would not reccomend this book to anyone. This book gives a brief overview of various topics, but never explains anything...the patterns that you use to sew with are more helpful. I just use YouTube now to figure out how to sew what I need to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"It's been years since I have sewn and this was a great refresher course for me.

While it has a lot of information, I was specifically looking for a book on how to alter/\\"fit\\" clothing that is too big or small. I have very little sewing experience, so from a sewing basics standpoint, this book is a good choice, as it will give you a little (I stress the word little) information on many different sewing topics.I felt the book could've had better illustrations and the author's duplicate instructions for those using a serger were a little annoying. I mean if you are reading a Sewing for Dummies book, what are the chances you are using a serger?!I would suggest if you have a certain aspect of sewing you are wanting to learn about, try to find a book that is specific to that subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"This book has a lot fo information but it's so hard to read.

At least that's my experience in learning to sew from books and buying a bunch. This book though is better than most and for that I'd recommend it. I learnt to sew a seam properly with this book. I found the projects enlosed awful though and I'm not tempted to make any of them, not the greetings card with buttons sewn on, nor the waistcoat made of napkins for example.

It captures the romanticism of the life these outlaws led, the underlying sadness of their plight and the intense loyalty they had to each other.

Perhaps this is the music from the Wild Bunch, but not the sound track.

It boasts high speed and excellent photo quality. In the end I paid $20 more and got the iP3000 instead because (according to my Staples sales guy) the iP3000 allows individual color tanks, so when you run out of one ink you don't need to replace all the colors.Of course, in reality the colors tend to run out more or less at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad purchase","review":"The printer was inoperable when I received it. After looking \\"under the hood\\" I discovered that the drive belt for the printer head was off it's rollers and twisted around the printer head. There were no cables included. Clearly the seller was hoping to unload a defective printer. In order to get a refund, I had to ship it back to the seller at my own expense. And because it was selling for $100, I had to insure it. Thus I was out a little over $20 on this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as great as they say, but still very good","review":"I will start by saying I buy cheap ink for my printer. And I will follow that by saying HOLY COW can you get some SUPER CHEAP INK for this printer!!! (generic, of course). The photos that print look good and I don't mind the quality, but they certainly aren't comparable to real photos from a lab. But it works for what I need it to, it prints normal text really quick, and I couldn't be happier (mostly b/c the ink is soooooo cheap!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"useless","review":"My version of this printer was pretty much useless because everytime I went to print, the paper would get jammed.

Since then I've read both this book and Hallowell's \\"Delivered from Distraction.\\" While I found Mate's personal story to be quite compelling, there is little more found in this book outside of a lot of conjecture. Hallowell, on the other hand, packed his book with the latest science, which was incredibly helpful to my understanding of my special brain, how to live with it and manage it."},{"rating":"1","title":"News Flash....It's the Mother's Fault","review":"This book spends a lot of time hypothesizing on what causes ADD. Dr. Mate proposes it comes from insecure attachment and maternal unhappiness in infancy. This did not ring true for me and I found his strong attachment to his theory so off-putting that I couldn't get to anything good the book might offer. Anyone who is dealing with ADD knows how frustrating it is and how confusing all the information can be. My advice is skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for laying on Parent Guilt","review":"I have an ADHD child and I have always wondered WHY? Is it genetic since he does have at least an Uncle, an Aunt, two cousins and a Father with ADD or ADHD? Oh no it's not geenetic! but now I have the answer from Gabor Mate!!It is due to MY poor parenting skills! It is due to not providing a stable, loving home for this emotionally wounded child. Furthermore, if I only would satisfy this child's need for attention, his need for love and affection then everything would be OK AND his ADHD would very nicely disappear. Of course, Mate does not back up his opinions with facts other than his own childhood stories. No, I don't buy it, and I will not keep this ADHD book on my shelf.If you want a great book on how to help you work with, and parent an ADHD child read Barkley's Taking Charge of ADHD book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freud? On ADHD? Are you serious???","review":"I was a bit shocked upon discovering that someone has actually tried fitting ADHD within the framework of traditional psychoanalysis (i.e. Freud). Suffice to say, it doesn't work. A neurobiological condition doesn't quite jibe with complexes, classical narcissism, and the like. But the author does invest a good deal of elbow grease to adapt some very awkward Freudian theory to contemporary brain science. It might help his case if he limited his explanations to purely cognitive/behavioral/scientific or Freudian/psychoanalytical/\\"It's All Mommy' Fault\\". Trying to squeeze both into one book is a bit, eh, ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing Insights","review":"As a 50-plus woman who was only recently diagnosed, this is by far the best book I have read on ADD. It's a shame that it doesn't come up IMMEDIATELY when a search is done on the subject. Gabor Mate writes with such eloquence and humor about the all-consuming mind that threatens to consume us like a wild beast - a thought I had often had, but could not have put into words (like everything else I feel). His theory on origins is that we are dealing with an emotionally immature brain, due to early experiences in life in addition to genetics - but we can move beyond it, and grow up! Thank you Dr. Mate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book makes sense.","review":"This is the best book so far on the ADD subject. The theory makes much more sense than other explanations. Interestingly, a negative review here finalized my decision to purchase the book, and I am very happy I did. I simply could not put the book down after I started reading it. The author goes beyond where most would stop in admitting their own experiences. Combined with numerous tales of ADD patients, this book provides very helpful views on the condition, family, and relationships. While it is true that the book is a bit sketchy on how to \\"cure\\" adult ADD as compared to its guidelines for children, the underlying theory that the neural structures can be modified offers hope that other sources do not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"He writes in a very practical yet gripping manner.

Each of the four has a favorite among the Second Stage Lensmen, even if they won't admit it.This book has a different feel, in that it is a tiny bit focused on family, and the mental war part of it means the insane space battles are a much smaller part of the whole thing.The end is the final battle between the Arisians and the Eddorians, with the third-stage Kinnison gestalt as an important part of the assault.Afterwards, what the Arisians tells the Children comes as a bit of a surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boskone looses again!","review":"Read the 1950's original and the series is GREAT!

I've been waiting for the right someone to come along so that I can start enjoying my life again. This is not a good way to live. This book has gently shocked me into facing the reality that right now I am single. I have felt sad and ashamed about my situation, but after reading the author's story, I felt proud of her and of all single men and women who refuse to settle for less and have figured out how to be satisifed, fulfilled,and independent.

This book will do a pretty good job of doing that from his early days up until 1993."},{"rating":"2","title":"for shakespeare fans","review":"this is a great book for shakespeare fans. it was the first time i read shakespeare outside of class, and it was very interesting. i didn't like the prefaces much, i didn't have the patience to read them. i felt they were very of long, and harder to read and understand than the actual shakespeare. they actual plays-not stories, just to clarify- are wonderful. it would be a great book to read if you are taking a literature class and want to get a head start or if you want to expand your vocabulary. you can even relate the problems of those times to the problems of today. the plays were very fun to read once you got into them; shakespeare is just as great as he is said to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sweet and tart tale of a summer love!","review":"What happens when you take the familar tale of two rival gangs fighting over the right to keep two new lovers apart?

Is it OK to approach a solitary bear? No. At some point you'll encroach on the bear's personal space and force it to fight or flee. You don't want to provoke a charge from a male grizzly, do you? You don't want to drive a female black bear away from berries, acorns or some other food source, do you? It's dangerous and unethical to approach any bear for a photograph. If Garfield doesn't know this, you can imagine all the other mistakes in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent !!!","review":"Enjoyed it thoroughly.

Abbey Lincoln, is well known as a singer but makes her mark as an actress in this film. I saw her in \\"Mo Better Blues\\" and didn't recognize her but these two performances were her best.

Unlike their previous album which boasted heavier rock ballards with a more 80s style stadium rock sound, this album took on a more funky, acoustic approach. The main problem with this, is that it has about 5 seriously amazing songs, and the rest aren't really anything special. They lack the more atmospheric heavier rock sound and well placed dynamic guitar solos that were found in the first one. The really amazing songs such as 'living in America' and 'love don't bother me' are great to sing along to, they are intelligently lyricised and the production and mixing just add to the atmosphere of emotion that makes this album so good. It is worth buying just for these songs, and because the rest of the songs aren't that bad, but could've have been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good movie","review":"Although the special effects would be consider cheezy today, they certainly are better than those used in the 1958 Attack of the 50 FT Woman.

I had lived in Miami for about eight years, and I think I was in my 5th year or so when I finally heard about \\"Miami\\" by Joan Didion. It was only after I had finally moved to the Beach that I happened upon it, at Kafka's. At any rate, it is an excellent book. I think about it every time I hear on the news about the bumbling CIA or news of Castro makes the NYTimes. Incidentally, 1987 also saw the publication of \\"The Corpse Had a Familiar Face,\\" by Edna Buchanan, another equally excellent non-fiction book about this city. I also highly recommend \\"A Book of Common Prayer\\" by Ms. Didion."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"This is a complex and detailed history chiefly of Cuban exiles in South Florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various U.S. administrations. In that sense, it is the story of two cities - Miami and Washington - and two peoples - Americans and Cubans.I have an objection, though, with the stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously, even gorgeously at times, written. Didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and, worse, the result is a cold, humorless, colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup.The author, in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose, apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end - readers. It is, in that sense, a boring little disaster of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated---Ancient History","review":"Exiled Cubans in Miami up to 1987. This is real old stuff.

These MSM practitioners fall into the trap of all such: they think that sin resides equally on all sides. If, as they show, Republicans, industry lobbyists, even the Christian Coalition, and ignorant citizens, are arrayed against a project blaming the brave at the Alamo is stupid. The fact that President Obama is now facing similar problems after trying to avoid all the Clinton's so-called errors shows that this is not a fight that is remotely fair. And the press, including the Johnson's and especially the Broder's are in large measure to blame because they adopt a \\"he said, she said\\" everyone's a sinner stance that gives the opponents, once again, an unfair advantage.

What a disappointment. I honestly suspect that this disc is a bootleg production that has somehow managed to sneak by the record labels. For starters, the video and sound quality are horrible. It looks worse than a VHS video. There are noticeable glitches throughout. It looks and sounds as if someone was adjusting the tracking on a video cassette player as this was being transferred to DVD! A couple of the videos have obvious edits and skips in them, and \\"Breaking Us in Two\\" by Joe Jackson is missing about the final 1/3 of the song! There are NO extras at all, nor are there any credits or record company recognitions listed, furthering the notion that this is a bootleg. How many compilations have you seen or heard where the original source is not credited? Please don't waste your time on this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's so bad, it's almost funny!","review":"This was the worst purchase I have ever made.

But Brown is no Tull. His voice is dull and repetitive, and it has little differentiation between any of the characters. More than that he doesn't seem to try and make the story interesting but seems to be in a hurry to get the whole thing over. Whereas there is some great spirited writing in the book you wouldn't know it from listening to the CD, he could just as well be reading from the phone book.BTW the story is great as usual and deserves a four star rating. So read the book or listen to the cassette.Zeb Kantrowitz"},{"rating":"2","title":"As with all O'Brian work - brilliant!","review":"This was my introduction to Patrick O'Brian's work. While it begins a bit slowly, the pace quickens soon after as it thrusts Stephen Maturin into some death-defying intrigue and danger amidst the grandeur of the Andes Mountains. I tend to prefer O'Brian when he ventures onto land most of the time anyway, so this was a real treat. Some day (probably after he has left us) Patrick will achieve massive critical acclaim, the media rushing to heap credit on itself for having \\"discovered\\" a great writer. Until then, why not beat them to it and acquire the O'Brian taste now!

I used it to cook rice and beans last night, have made small servings of soup in it, etc. Mine is exactly as pictured with glass lid, and is a great medium-large size. It is heavier than I expected, but feels very sturdy. Most of my other saucepans and pots are expensive ones by All Clad, however I much prefer this non-stick pan and you can't beat Amazon's price!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lid fit is not quite perfect","review":"I'm used to very good quality out of calphalon and am not completely disappointed with this product. However, I have noticed that the lid does not fit perfectly and has to be slightly pushed down to seal. Other than that, the pot is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Pot for sauce and other preparation","review":"We are a fast moving couple and were looking for a good little all purpose pan to do everything in from sauses to a quick boiling of water. This has nice even heat and, with the non-stick surface, is great for people that may be doing a little too much multi-tasking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad Coating","review":"I sent an older non-stick pan in for replacement because it was flaking. They sent this as a replacement. It is a piece of crap. After less than 6 months, the coating is coming off. I use it almost exclusively for rice and never use anything but safe utensils. I have always like Calphalon, but this is not a good piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calphalon is good, but could be better","review":"The pros: Calphalon is a great material for cooking, it has a very uniform heat distribution and is very solid. On this piece, the shallow design is perfect for simmering up your favorite sauce. The curved lip makes spills a thing of the past.The cons: Calphalon is not dishwasher safe, so make sure you are ready to hand-wash your new pan. Also, avoid drips down the outside of your cookware at all costs - Calphalon stains like crazy! They DO sell a cleanser, haven't had a chance to clean mine yet - so I hope it works. Finally, this is NOT the standard depth pan, it is SHALLOW, so make sure you know what you are buying.Final word: This is a fantastic price for this piece of cookware - can you believe this is going for 60% off? Problem is, if you want to complete the set, you had better be willing to shell out some serious dough. If you love to cook, can afford Calphalon, and don't mind the clean-up, this is the pan for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT !!","review":"I bought the sauceppan to cook food for my daughter, age 5 months. I can cook anything in it and it doesn't stick and so far nothing has burned, even when the water boils away. The see through lid tells me when I need to add water and the handle is long enough to stay cool so I can pour the contents directly into the food processor. I also like using it for heating my own dinner...the extra surface area on the bottom seems like it heats the food faster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item!","review":"This is a great pot, with a great price, and it arrive only a few days after I ordered.

I recently noticed this after I was making a white sauce and was confused why so many \\"black flakes\\" where in there since I had not peppered my sauce. After inspecting the pan I could see small textured scratches along the bottom that showed the pan was flaking and it's anodized layer was wearing away.While this pan was an absolute dream to use before this it will not stand the test of time. I highly recommend Amazon users to not purchase Calphalon's anodized pans or sauce pans. I can't imagine consuming the flaking anodized layers are good for your health."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great saucepan","review":"I bought this saucepan with a little trepidation because it looks a little like a cross between a saucepan and a frying pan but now that I own it I am sold. It works much better for making anything that needs a little sauteing first because the shape allows more of the contents to be in contact with the bottom. And at a gentle heat, the contents of the pan heat up more quickly for the same reason. As with the other calphalon products I have, nothing sticks and it heats very evenly on my gas stove. The handle does not get hot even though it is metal and the lid is great because you can see through it to see if your contents simmering gently. I have only had this about two months, so can't comment on how well the coating will last, but so far I am very happy with this pan. I wish they made a smaller version."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the second time, this saucepan disappoints.","review":"About 2 years ago, I bought one of these saucepans and really liked it...until the non-stick coating deteriorated after about 18 months of use. (Yes, yes, we were careful about utensils and how we washed it.) Even though I prefer kitchen equipment that stands the tests of time a bit (much!) better, I liked the pan so much that I replaced it. Well, after only 6 months or so, the non-stick coating on pan #2 has started peeling off. NOT acceptable.

Unlike most pan, the sheet of metal is thick and by soem magic heats up really fast. Now after carful using (alwasy wooden spatulla and hand wash) teh coating started to peel of soem tiem middle of 2007 and the process is still on. Now, it sticks up everything, only thing I can really cook is sause; I used to saute my food a lot and now I can do so only if I use a different pan. Overal, not worth the extra $; I think a more resonable way to get nonstick is hard anodized stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, but ... a rare miss from Calphalon.","review":"First, the product is Calphalon, so you know it's going to wear very well. But ...The shallow design is a loser for most purposes, and in fact its width and the lengthe of its handle make it difficult to clean in my evenly divided sink (key for living, NEVER install a standard sized sink divided exactly in half). Furthermore, the handle is very awkardly placed. I'm no weakling, but even with the saucepan empty, it is uncomfortable to hold. This could have been made easier with a secondary handle on the opposite side.Therefore, unless you really need this exact diameter, I strongly recommend getting a less-wide, deeper saucepan, with a straight not curved handle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not clear on how I lived without it","review":"Got this pot recently, only because with holidays I needed another 2-ish quart.I feel like an annoying TV ad.

If you have a glass top, or otherwise completely flat cooktop stay away from this pan.I contacted Calphalon and was sent a replacement which took approx 2 months. When I received the replacement I put approx. 2 cups of water in it and began to heat it on medium high heat and had the same result. It had a terribly warped bottom and is what I would consider to be unusableI do have other pieces of cookware from them that do not exhibit this behavior. I am again contacting Caphalon to replace the pan a second time however since I have had two pans now with the same problem I have little faith that a third replacement would be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try \\"Stranded\\" instead","review":"The story behind this movie is one of the most amazing stories I ever read or heard about in my life.

The director and producers, as well as the survivors went to great lengths to ensure that every detail was captured verbatim of the 1970's catastrophe. It's as if there was a documentarian on the plane with the rugby team at the time of the incident. Anyone who watches this movie will truly appreciate what it means to survive a disaster, and some may even be inspired to develop ways in which to prevent future tragedies of this magnitude ever happening again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, Inspirational Movie that Touched Me Greatly","review":"Unsurmountable odds, defying forces of nature, dying hope of the human spirit. This movie showcases the incredible power of the human mind that surpasses any odds it thinks it can.

The is an incredible story of survival, a thought that cannot escape you as you watch the movie. However, the movie itself does a rather weak job of portrayal. Most of the acting is seriously flawed and just not realistic. Scenes are frequently over-dramatized -- for example, lots of overdone slow motion waving to rescue helicopters...with Ethan Hawke hanging out the door with smiles and waves to boot...he seems o.k. for a guy who just spent two months eating people and climbing out of the mountains with no gear. The story carries the movie, and if it were fiction, it would get just one star. This story truly deserved a better movie portrayal. If someone just doesn't read books, they'd likely thoroughly enjoy the movie. I'm am quite confident that the book in my cart will be much, much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most important movie to see","review":"Great story, a true film, the director and screenwriter truely re-created the event that happened over the Andes mountains.

How sad it is when tragedy strikes (no matter how many years) Hollywood is going to reap the rewards. If you want to see a somewhat more of a documentary type of a VERY low budget of the Mexican 1976 version SURVIVE! instead. Amazon has a decent copy really cheap and it's not the terrible dubbed American cut. This film is cheaply made but gets to the heart of the situation at hand. This movie to me is more disturbing than the Hollywood re-make. Don't know how many friends of mine tell me what a great film ALIVE is, but I have to disagree. It is like watching Hollywood making war movies that look 'too polished'. Check out SURVIVE!Survive (Supervivientes de los Andes)instead.

Unfortunately, this book exemplifies why I came to it so late: it recounts the facts without examining any assumptions, has little tone or style, and absolutely minimal narrative.

I skimmed this book and felt no wonder, no desire to read further, and no incentive to remember what I had read so laboriously. It is a complete and utter bore.Fortunately, this style of writing has long since become obsolete. There is great popular history available - e.g. the new series of Oxford histories that is first rate - that also satisfies academics.I cannot recommend this book.

I hung my sandal files on the closet rod, inside the closet... and the handbags file on the outside of the closet door with a metal over-the-door hook.

Shure's proprietary connectors frustrate that end. Shure has its origins in my hometown, and I was a fan of Shure for most of the last forty years.

I think a lot of the previous reviewers were looking for a LOST MASTERPIECE but let's JUST LISTEN TO THE MUSIC AND IGNORE THE BULL. OK, even the band members admit it's not up to THEIR snuff but who are we listeners to pass judgement on their standards. Lots of artists release [junk] after their initial genius has faded but these guys were in their prime (alright, maybe a little tired and ready for some R & R) and if you listen without any preconceptions, there's some HOT tunes here in the vein of their debut LP. May not be everyone's cup of tea but I think better than anything recorded after it under the Mahavishnu Orchestra name. Don't be swayed by the naysayers...if you liked the original band's studio albums, this is a revelation and a welcome release!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"In my youth the MO polarized a lot of people. You either loved them or hated them. But to me the people who hated them never really bothered to listen. John McLaughlin and company could compose and improvise. The trouble is that pop music is based on mediocrity and hype and people saw music as just a ticket to fame and fortune rather than a real life evolving art form. Well anyway, whoever the powers that be released this album, please get some of their live material released. As best my memory serves me, the live versions of many of the tunes on IMF and B of F were evolving pieces and were done better in concert than on vinyl.Thank you Will Sperry"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeepers, I think it's great!","review":"While some critical reviewers didn't enjoy this CD, I thought it was clearly the spiritual successor to the first two studio releases and thoroughly enjoyed it. Of course, I'm a Mahavishu fan. They were one of the few bands that I enjoyed as much on stuidio recordings as I did live. (P.S. I don't live in New York or L.A. which may account for my freedom in expressing this opinion. P.P.S. I like music more than fashion.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the correct Book","review":"I ordered this book for a gift and it came with the correct cover and had a cover page inside that was correct.

This excellent book shows very simply that we can be good at networking just by being polite and gracious. It povides helpful tips and at the same time re-enforces some basics common-sense things that we all know but may not realize that they are valuable and helpful networking assets. Most, if not all of the 101 networking tips can be utilized by everyone. It is refreshing to see a book with such a postive and motivational approach to networking...it makes it seem less like work and more like fun. I especially like the tip that the name tag should go on the right side instead of the left side! Great easy, quick and invaluable reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow Strategies and Trite Tactics","review":"I read a 2000 First Books edition of this title, and I was not impressed. There are so many books about networking available; I'm not sure that this adds to our collective knowledge. Drawing entirely on the overly general personal experiences of a \\"networking coach,\\" this slim, large-print volume seems intended for clients and friends more than a broader readership. Focusing primarily on stereoptypical workaday networking tactics such as not wearing rings so you don't hurt people when you shake their hands and wearing a name tag on the right side of your shirt, the sometimes chatty book doesn't offer a lot of useful information. That said, I did appreciate the author's comments on the free flow of information, positioning of the lagniappe, and allusions to indirect reciprocity. There are better books about networking available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastico","review":"A friend recommended this book to me because I am suffering from fatigue brought on by prolonged antibiotic treatment. In the two years that I have been sick, nothing has given me as much hope. Although Andrew Weil describes the shortcomings and dangers of traditional medicine, this book is not a rejection of traditional medicine but an attempt to broaden our understanding of the mind and body and their mechanisms for healing. Weil gives examples of patients who have been healed despite medical failures, proof that the human body is capable of curing itself, an idea that Weil describes repeatedly in the book and that can give hope to all patients whom modern medicine has failed. Weil also describes varios alternative treatments and gives suggestions about diet, exercise, vitamins and herbs."},{"rating":"2","title":"La Curación Espontánea, Dr. Andrew Weil","review":"Very recommendable.

I absolutely loved it. It's very very quiet and really just a nice, simple machine. BUT...the other day the prong broke off of the cord when i tried to plug it into the wall. When I took it to have it fixed, the guy told me that because of the way the vacuum was made, i would have to completely replace the entire cord winding mechanism...and of course, this would have costed about as much as I paid for the vacuum. The cord winding spool is wired to the vacuum and you cannot just replace the cord. Just FYI. I ended up buying a Hoover Wind Tunnel canister vac from this same company (Allergy Be Gone) and I love it. I have no idea if it has the same design flaw, but i will say it works much, much better than the Electrolux. The first day i had it, i picked up three canisters (it's a bagless) of dirt and cat hair off of what looked like clean floors. In my opinion, it's money better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Stand Behind Product","review":"At first, we loved this ultra quiet vacuum cleaner. After one year, however, it started sounding like a jet engine. The turbo-nozzle had broken. I live in a major city and no one within the city limits services these things, and when I ordered a new turbo nozzle, they sent a mini. It turns out that the actual replacement nozzle, listed at $29.99 a year ago, now costs $125.00! The explanation I got was \\"Prices are subject to change without notice.\\" Now I'm stuck with a 5-inch mini turbo nozzle and my wife is going to kill me. Plus the cord, which used to snap back into the cannister at the touch of a button, creeps in while we're vacuuming--and when we press the button too. I love it at first, but I'll never buy another Electrolux. It's not well made, and they don't stand behind their product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good things do come in small packages!","review":"Don't let the size and the weight fool you. The Harmony is powerful for its size. This unit is unbelievably quiet when compared to an upright or other canisters. We have hardwoods throughout and 2 dogs that shed (tumbleweeds)all year round. This vacuum has no problem handling the job. This is a must vacuum for pet owners! The unit does an awesome job of eliminating dust and absolutely no odors from the unit (unlike the bag units). I have never had a vacuum which has made doing carpeted stair cases so easy. I finish in half the time. The tools are easy to switch around. I do agree with the previous review, if you have wall to wall I would suggest the larger unit.All in all, I am very pleased and have recommended it to several friends and family who will be purchasing the unit soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an Eureka- not truly an Electorlux","review":"As my vacuum repairman put it, \\"That's not an Electrolux, that's Eureka JUNK.\\" And it is....

Suction is good, the carpet sweeper does a good job of rotating and brushing up the carpet and the head design on both allow for good access and pivoting.

I love it! It's powerful, lightweight, gets in corners and under furniture, picks up pet hair and it's SO QUIET! You can talk on the phone while you vacuum if you like. Actually makes vacuuming a pleasure because you don't have to put up with that loud, high-pitched jet engine sound all the time. Also, it definitely has a HEPA filter already installed in the vac.

Instead of picking up the hair on wall to wall carpeting, it just bunches it up. I have to stop at least every minute or two to pick up the bunches. It takes twice as long to vacuum as it should. It is AWFUL on scatter rugs. I go over and over and over and they are still not clean. The turbo brush that comes with it works better but the company rep I contacted said if you use it all the time, it wears out quickly, very quickly! I would not recommend this vacuum at all. It is quiet and that is all it has going for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Discouraged","review":"I too loved this vacuum when I first purchased it. It was quiet and everything seemed to be just fine. The turbo nozzle lost its wheels, lost its suction and became torn and battered in a short period of time -- less than a year. The paper that came with the vacuum indicated I could purchase a new turbo nozzle for approximately $30. I thought, \\"Great\\". When I called to order it I was informed that the price was now $125. There was no way I was going to pay that amount! In addition to the problem with the turbo nozzle, the retractable cord now retracts whenever it feels like it while I'm vacuuming. Definitely not worth the money that I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice unit but attachments are poor and scratched my floor","review":"Overall the unit has a nice feel to it and is quiet as expected. However, the concern is with the attachments. We have dark hardwood floors and therefore any scratch becomes obvious. Unfortunately the attachments for the floor rely upon either a brush or red felt to guide the front of the attachment. In short, grit got caught under the attachment and scratched my floor. I was obviously very disappointed and returned the unit. I have since purchased a Bosch which is ideal in that it has wheels which support the main head attachment on the front and the back and therefore reduces the chance of scratching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vaccuum","review":"I got this on super super sale and would have paid more for it.

Not the brush itself but a plastic ring that keeps it attached to the hose. I replaced the brush with a regular brush and that one lasted about 6 times and is not powerful enough on the carpet. I now have to decide if I want to buy another turbo brush for $130 or so or if I want to invest in a new vacuum cleaner. If electrolux would have not have used the cheap plastic parts both brushes could have lasted a lot longer. I would not buy this brand again. The plastic parts are too flimsy and do not last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is good until you need replacement parts","review":"I just can't seem to find a replacement attachment since the one which we use broke.

I found that the turbo brush is the easiest tool to use on carpeting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing longevity","review":"This vacuum works well on hardwood floors. It is lightweight. The attachment for carpet does not have a power head so it doesn't work so well if the carpet has much dirt or pet hair. The bags are expensive and do not fit well in the compartment. My main complaint, though, and the reason why I would NOT recommend anyone buying this machine, is that it does not last. It is all plastic. And the plastic parts break and render it useless. We have had it for 4 years and now it's headed for the dump. What a disgrace! My previous vacuum was my grandmother's Electrolux, which she got decades ago and used regularly. It was metal, durable, useful for a lifetime (or more). This vacuum is a cheaply made, poor imitation and Electrolux should be ashamed for falling so far below the bar they set so many years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Powerful suction, flimsy parts","review":"Although this vacuum has powerful suction, the quality of the plastic wand and cleaning attachments are not consistent with the cost of this vacuum. The carpet attachment does not come off easily and in my case, broke off from its collar.

Overall a poor value and not recommended for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for floors.","review":"I have three cats and a husband who shed hair constantly.

When your floor tool breaks and it will...(mine broke at one year) you can't buy a replacement! Yes you read this correctly. Electrolux does not sell a replacement floor tool. So you now need to duck tape your vacuum together or buy a new vacuum.

This little guy is awesome though; lightweight (I find myself carrying the base around with one hand while vacuuming with the other), super quiet (for us night owls that want a clean place without bugging the neighbors), powerful (it works much better than my old upright). It has an adjustable power/suction bar, there is an attachment that easily switches between carpets and hardwood floors. The HEPA filter stuff is nice too, though I already have a good HEPA air filter so I'm not too worried. It hardly takes any storage space, and has a nifty retractable cord with a push of a button - I hate dealing with cords.I'm not sure about the guy who said it broke, it seems fairly robust, none of this stuff is designed for extreme manhandling. I look forward to using my little buddy at least once a week (hi mom)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This vacuum is okay if you have tile or wood floors, and you don't have anything pea sized or larger to pick up.

They talk out of the side of their mouth. In the spirit of \`Heart of Worship' this works well. But on most other tracks, the singer might as well be humming. Open your mouth dude. Either that or be consistent and tell us you're a wordless dervish.Track 7 has got to be a low point. And who's the guy in the background (e.g. track 2, 2:50)?

Now, we wish we would've just gotten the stainless All-Clad instead. These were cheaper in the beginning, but they're costing us in the long run. If you're registering for your wedding gifts, DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE WE DID.

The pictures are fabulously clear, the photgraphy brilliant. The music is the most amazing feature, though, combining instruments and styles from around the world in an impressively creative way. For example, the bagpipes and drums that blare out as the oil fields of Kuwait burn always raise the hairs on the back of my neck.If you liked Koyaanisqatsi you'll love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cup of Dreams","review":"I watched this film and felt like I had been drinking a tea cup of my dreams.A prophetic and powerful experience; it effects you only if you breathe.If [Jalal Al-Din] Rumi wrote a modern-day cinematic poem, this might be the essence.When I see the snow monkey in Nagano Springs, I remember something long forgotten.[see also Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi; *almost* as fulfilling.]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Baraka Blu-Ray Freezes on Samsung BD-P2550","review":"From reading various posts on other sites, it appears that there is a known problem with this Blu-Ray title. I don't know if it is a bad batch of discs or what. When I play the disc on my Samsung BD-P2550 with the latest firmware as of 1/19/2009, it freezes in Ch 18 in the scene showing the Egyptian ruins. I am unable to move forward and get the player to continue. I have to return to the menu and then select Ch 20 to be able to get past the problem. I requested a replacement from Amazon and received it. The replacement does the same thing. I don't know whether to return it again or not.Other that that, I love this disc. The cinematography is beautiful. I would give it 5 stars instead of 1 if I could get this issue resolved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Koyaanisqatsi wannabe...","review":"Sorry, but I see this film not as a unique new view of the world, nor a unique way of filming the world, making a statement, etc.This is really just a Koyaanisqatsi/Powasqatsi wannabe.The film looks like it was made in the same locations, many of the camera angles are the same, even the dump scenes are virtually identical. True there are some very unique perspectives, but overall the degree of similarity makes this very nearly plagaristic.Do yourself a favor. Buy Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi. Rent Baraka if you want to see it, but save your $$ for the \\"real McCoy.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange Movie","review":"I am not sure what all the hype was about.

You're presented with lovely images of nature and sacred places and the next thing you know you're shown a million baby chicks flying through chutes and being culled into a chick destroying machine. I don't enjoy seeing images like that. I purposely don't watch movies about people or animals being tortured.

The only way I can describe it as sort of like an extremely well done National Geographic special without any narration and with an excellent soundtrack. Why do I give it 2 stars then? Because of the disgusting scenes of animal torture involving live little chicks (as in baby chickens). I never got past these scenes which the director seems to fixate on.

This non-narrative film that explores the human condition was shot in 70mm in 24 countries on six continents, and has, with this blu-ray edition, been restored with a 8K HD Scan, the first and only film to receive this ultra-high definition treatment. Its sequel \\"Samsara\\" is planned for release in 2010. This disc also includes a restoration documentary, and an almost one hour feature about the making of the film.

With no narration and original fusion music, it's an all encapturing film. The 70 mm lens captures images in a way that puts you right there.

A highly recommended documentary- you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"After watching this you will view the world through a different lens.

Its 'message' is simple, trite and after a while repetitive. It is a good advertisement for bourgois holiday makers looking for 'gritty... oooh magawd!' holiday experiences. A higher 'new age vacuity' quotient than should be allowed in a feature length film."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Depressing Adventure","review":"When I popped this DVD into my player, I was expecting a serene, uplifting experience that was, as the case says, 'beyond words to describe. At the very least, I expected a nice diversion of peaceful scenery and calming music. Well sir, that is not what I got. This video meanders from the mildly boring to downright depressing. If you've ever felt that this world is over-populated with people who struggle through a pitiful meaningless existence or that life is a hopeless torment then you have some idea what waiting in this 104 minutes of footage. Now this might be exactly what the filmmaker meant to do and if so, Bravo! But if you're looking for an enlightening experience of hope, wonder and serenity I suggest you keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was a YAWNER","review":"This movie was boring. I don't honestly don't understand how anyone could like it. The soundtrack was just a bunch of nature sounds albeit edited very well. It wasn't a music soundtrack.Unfortunately, it's this that causes the movie to be nothing more than a glorified one-hour documentary on the Discovery channel.Koyaanisqatsi is a lot better. It's got Philip Glass that goes very well with the scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Having seen this film twice I am increasingly amazed at the subtlety here. Yes, when showing it to my college students the usual groans occur at the incubation & handling of chickens but the impact of this contrasted with urban frenzy and rural tranquility are stunning.

The best part of this DVD is the imagary. The filming is crisp, clean and the colors are vibrant. Most of the scenes are very pleasing and/or interesting. Some of the soundtrack weaves beautifully with the images but some of the music was so harsh or odd that I found it to be more of a distraction to the film than a complement.

You will not be disappointed if you approach this movie as if it were your favorite album (CD) and you are going to sit down and listen to (watch) the whole thing. It has some slow spots (depending on personal interests) but the imagery is awesome. There are lots of Time-lapse segments that are nothing short of inspiring. It can put things into perspective, from the sped up city scenes set to a hypnotizing musical set with people running around shuttling through a city maze, to chicks being shuttled through a hatchery, while their destiny lingers. I can certainly look to this movie again when I am in need of a change of mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baraka","review":"Loved it! Very inspirational, we need to watch movies like this more often to connect with nature and the things that matter in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing","review":"If a picture is worth a thousand words, then this film is truly priceless.

I have been to but a few of the regions of this film and feel I have been to the unknown places by the sights ,music and enviormentals that transports the omnicient eye of my soul. A critic sees only a travelogue. An American will see how much resolution their machines will render while watching the 1 1/2 hour film.

The film has no words and yet it tells us a story that a million words could not tell us in a lifetime. The visuals and the sounds bring out our deepest dreams, emotions and imaginations.

I can't praise this film enough. Don't waste your money on Koyaanisqatsi/Powaqqatsi. Baraka puts these to shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film - Pity about lack of DVD image quality","review":"The sole reason for existance for a film such as Baraka is the stunning cinematography. Unfortunately these stunning visuals did not make it's way onto this DVD edition.What you might have seen in stunning 70mm in the theaters is reduced to a soft, low resolution, NON ANAMORPHIC(! ) DVD with plenty of edge artifacts. It is unviewable on my calibrated 9 ft projection system.May look okay on 27inch or smaller TV.What a shame to do this to a film like Baraka."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Treat this Day and Age....","review":"While blockbuster hits are fun to watch, Baraka gets you to the roots of humanity and the world we live in. Filmed in 57 Countries around the world, you get to see the vast variety of cultures that humans live in. This movie also focuses on nature as well, and tells it's own story. With the Blu-Ray version, you get spectacular visual and audio quality compared to the older DVD. Baraka was shot in 65mm film, so you get a pretty big \\"scope\\" on what the director wanted. This is an unique format for it's time (1992) and has been preserved to really show off your home theater system. Picture is 5 stars and audio is 5 stars. In fact the non-narrative movie is 5 stars as well. DON'T FORGET TO WATCH THE MAKING OF THE FILM. This is equally enjoyable as the crew tells many unique stories during filming. This Blu-Ray is a MUST HAVE! Enjoy......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to describe in words","review":"The film defies categorization. I find it hard to put into words the emotions that this film evokes from me and others I have shared it with.

I'd recommend it to any age...","review":"Not since Koyanaskazi have I seen such beauty. Uplifting, thought provoking, and beautiful. This movie manages to get viewers to think about this wonderful, diverse world with cinematography that is unparralelled in most other movies I've seen, and all without speaking. A visual journey that you'll want to take again and again. After seeing it, I would have gladly paid double the price. The music is perfectly timed to the scenes, and the combination makes for a wonderful experience for the senses. This one's a must for anyone looking for something out of the ordinary, something that delights the mind, ears and eyes. Get it, you'll not regret the decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baraka","review":"A concept simalar to the 80's film \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\", Ron Fricke's film without words is very rich in visual setpeices. There is no story in a cinamatic sense i.e a narrative or any actors. However the photography is first rate on the 70mm film and for lovers of the moving image this will not disappoint. Watch out for the cigarette makers,the baby chicks and the slow camera shots of people in New York crossing an busy intersection these imagss are particulary striking. The DVD quality is good,however the featurette is very short and not very informative. Overall a good exercise in providing a good visual cinematic treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"excelent movie","review":"This movie is a must see by everyone. It will touch everyone.

Watch it, you will not be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"SURREAL AMBIANCE...JUST MAGICAL","review":"IN Baraka, You see people around the world unite in one fluid motion to an ambiant soundtrack including Dead Can Dance.

The high definition is stunning. I think it looks better than \\"Planet Earth\\". I bought this disc from Best Buy in Houston Texas on October 28, 2008. I was watching this on my Sony BDP-S500 and when I first put the disc in my machine and it said it \\"could not read\\". I opened the tray and re-seated the disc and it loaded. I was watching the film just fine when at 1 hour 13 minutes and 23 seconds into the film it froze for about 3 seconds and skipped to the next scene with NO AUDIO for about 10 seconds. The film then jumped to the next scene and the audio returned. After that I backed up the disc before I had the problem and it did the same thing again. Not Good. I'm taking it back to Best Buy.Does my machine need a firmware update to play this movie correctly.Has anybody else had any problems playing this 8K Ultra Digital HD Disc?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique life-affirming postcard from Planet Earth.","review":"I consistently rate this film amongst my all time favorites.

It is a movie that can be watched repeatedly, usually with friends. You can imagine my great disappointment in having to return my Christmas present - the DVD version of the film - to the place of purchase because of its poor quality. It is unsharp, excessively high in contrast and low in color saturation. What is more, the image flickers in certain scenes, especially those of skyscapes, giving one the impression that they had been shot through the rotating blades of a helicopter. This must be one of the rare instances where the DVD is inferior to the laser disc.This is a great pity, for it is a film that will continue to entrall, surprise, amaze, sadden, etc for a long time to come.I will purchase it when a new remastering becomes available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speechless.","review":"This is more than a movie. Baraka trancends everyt movie you have watched. It offers a true glimpse of reality in the world. The imagery is utterly captivating, while at the same time, sincerely touching.

This is a must for anyone looking for that something in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinatingly tedious or tediously fascinating?","review":"\\"Baraka\\" is well-crafted wallpaper, penetrating commentary, New Age balm for tortured urbanites, or overblown travelogue, depending on one's mood. The best way to watch it is with a sense of HUGE perspective (and patience). What the film is great at is presenting the vast multitude of global activity (people praying, working, and generally doing their thing) as a cohesive pattern that is now baffling, now illuminating. I ended up both dizzy and enlightened - as troubled by things going on in the world as I was hopeful.\\"Baraka\\" is the perfect film for pointing out how confusing and seemingly pointless our world is... or it could point to our common humanity, whether we live in crowded Tokyo or the deserts of North Africa."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Extraterrestrial Scope","review":"Baraka touches on both aspects of life, the dreadful and the wonderful.

Unfortunately it appears that MPI Media for the DVD release has merely retransferred the original video transfers that were made a number of years ago for the Laserdisc and VHS release. My DVD copy has the same dust specks that were visible on the Laserdisc release from a few years back. As an owner of a 16:9 widescreen television it is really sad to give up nearly 1/3 of the resolution on the widescreen version to letter boxing.

The only song I would have left out is \\"Platinum High School\\", but it represents his attempts at movie stardom and probably belongs in the collection. I got the cd for a great price and would have paid more for it. In fact, it was so good, I bought the \\"Tell Me One More Time\\" album.

Certainly \\"Sgt.

First, the box set is overpriced for what the buy gets. Many more than ten previously unreleased songs could have been provided. There exists a mountain of Rolling Stones material from the \\"Sticky Fingers\\" - \\"Exile\\" era. The actual \\"Stone's In Exile\\" DVD could have been included rather than an incomplete promo.This \\"Exile\\" re-issue should have followed the example of the recent 40th Anniversary \\"Get Yer Ya Ya's Out\\" re-issue.

With the highly overrated Don Was at the helm I knew this would happen. It is so hyper-compressed and limited it sounds like holy CRAP! A full 8dB louder than the original CD release, vocals are pushed back in the mix, horn parts are barely audible, all of the traits of an over-mastered album. Granted the original CD was strident in the upper midrange, but you could compensate with a touch of eq around 3k or so. This, you can do nothing with. I only give this two stars because the album is so great even Don Was can't completely screw it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Classic Rock Album Ever","review":"This is the greatest album ever recorded by the greatest band of rock and rollers that have ever lived or ever will. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards pen brilliant tracks infused with there frustration and pain to such a degree that one cannot help but feel it. The guitar work of both aces (Richards and the untouchable Mick Taylor) is raw and rockin'. Jagger's vocals are just sublime and the band has simply never sounded better (though who ever has?). It's impossible to fathom that the Stones recorded Beggar's Banquet, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, and Exile consecutively! Excluding Bowie and Roxy Music, those may be the four finest albums ever released. Richards also sings on \\"Happy\\", which was the biggest hit ever to feature him on lead vocals. There are no highlights on this album, because it's all so amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The most monotonous Rolling Stones record","review":"I can't understand, why so many people regard this as the Rolling Stones' best work.

That said, Tumblin' Dice is one of the great Stones songs. But too many songs hit one groove, and STAY THERE. There is pretty much nothing in the way of dynamics for many of the tunes. A lot of the imagery is pretty gross - and I usually dig the outlandishness of the boys. But here it just feels lazy and...pointless. None of the righteous ridiculousness of Shattered, and none of the ragged beauty of Wild Horses. I know people love this album in a very protective way, like they do their little brother.

My immediate impression was, 'this is in serious need of remastering'. Mick's vocals were all wrong - mixed so far down that it was hard to understand him. The whole thing sounded like a murky mess. 'What a shame', I thought. These songs seem like they'd be good if they didn't sound like they were all record in someone's basement.I was wrong.Exile was never intended to be a sonic masterpiece.

I do go anyway, because I want to avoid the plaque.This record is one of my favorite artifacts from one of my favorite periods in popular music, and it continues to entertain and inspire many. However, it has been suggested by some reviewers who don't get it that since Mick has made some disparaging comments (never saying Exile was a bad album, just not the Stones' best), it really isn't very good. By most accounts, Mick wasn't very happy with the process or the surroundings during recording of the album, which may have forever skewed his estimation of the quality of the final product. And it is Keith's favorite Stones album, which pretty much overrules Mick and closes the case for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best Rock Album ever done!!","review":"This album is a masterpiece! The amazing thing is that Mick and Keith knew what they had when they recorded Exile - the first and lst song on every one of the four sides is simply perfect! Rocks Off, Tumbling Dice, Sweet Virginia, Let it Loose, Happy, All Down the Line, and Soul Survivor are Masterpieces, and the second song on each side are also outstanding: Rip This Joint, Torn and Frayed, Turd on the Run, and Stop Breaking Down.

The albums before were great, but this is the first Stones LP to be amazing. It takes a few listens to get into, but once you do, you'll discover its one of the greatest albums ever recorded. The mixture of country, blues, and rock is one that has yet to be topped by any band. The Stones were hyped as the world's greatest rock 'n' roll band, but its on this album they truly live up to that title. I never was much of a Stones fan until I decided to listen to this album. After that, I bought countless other LPs (I'd only had a greatest hits before). The album is bleak and weary in a way that would make Hank Williams proud. Not a single bad track on the whole thing, this is a highly reccomended purchase.

The Stones are generally over rated and this album is a case in point. It has no emotional element to it all. The vocals are largely incomprehensible and the lyrics that can be discerned are rubbish. Rip this Joint is a maybe four stars but none of the other songs stay in the memory or create any interest at all. The rhythm mix is stale and there is little musical virtuosity on offer here.

However the complaints about the sound quality expressed elsewhere are apt. The limited edition LP cover CD is much better mastered; there's probably even better to be had if they ever remaster the tapes again - the bootlegged outtakes are all in great sound.The Stones were always oddly cavalier about technical matters - Bill Wyman expressed frustration that their mid 70s albums sounded like they were recorded on mono cassettes and he couldn't get his bass lines audible on them. Well, hunt the limited edition CD and you won't have that problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good+","review":"No instant classics on the album but most of the songs are really good.

This is one of their best along with all the other albums from 1968 to 1973. They would never meet that creative period again and \\"Exile\\" was their best.

Time passes, and although Tatoo You (among others) ranks higher on my list, this album is a good one. Tumbling Dice, Rocks Off, and Happy are classics. Much of the album is blues/gospel/50's style rock, and other styles mixed in. It is different from what the Stones did before and since. This one would be worth it, but only after you have integrated your self into more mainstream Stones material. It may take several listens and a couple of days, months, or even in my case, years. It does deserve it's classic repuration. I do disagree, however, that this is the last of the Rolling Stone's so called \\"best\\" (insert material, years, creativity, etc.) whatever....

Though they may have relied on the horns and backup singers a bit excessively on this one, its definetly one of their say top 5 defining albums, for the rough and tumble raunch of songs like 'Rocks Off', and the way they were able to switch gears into the soaring melodicism of tracks like 'Loving Cup', 'Torn and Frayed' and 'Shine A Light'. Probably the last album on which the Stones hit the mark so much with so little effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"new to rock but what a great introduction","review":"If a album sums up a band sound and integrity then this album does all that imo.

Loving cup torn and frayed (A brilliant cover by the crowes on their latest tour by the way) stop breaking down shine a light among many others are simply in my mind just a seance of magical interweavings of a band working as one.And Keith Richards lead vocals on happy are simply blissful to one's ear.As another reviwer advised pass the bourbon mama and let's take a exile on main st."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Stones album?","review":"For me the Stones were at their peak in this period (prior to stadium concerts sponsored by SPRINT!).

They've done good albums since, but not great. Rock 'n' roll doesn't get much better than this, but there are also blues and country elements throughout, so you've got a good weaving of styles on this album. The only clunkers (to my ears anyway) are I Just Want to See His Face, Shine a Light and Let It Loose. These songs aren't bad, but in my opinion the Stones set the bar very high with the other songs on this album, and these songs don't clear that bar for me. Be that as it may, this album is worth every penny. Get it now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another casualty of the loudness war","review":"With much respect to the album (among my favorites) and without causing any offense to those who like the sound of the reissued disc---the sound is not so much to my liking. Heavily compressed, just like the other 2009 Stones remasters. I have done back-to-back comparisons of the 1994 Virgin remaster and this one with good equipment. The dynamics have been squeezed out, and I found myself reaching for the volume knob to turn the 2010 disc *down*--which is a real travesty for such a good-time rock record. Perhaps due to the compression and EQ choices, there seems to be a tad more detail, with more emphasis on the mid-range (this does bring out Mick's vocals quite well, as others have said), but to my ears, the sound is harsh and fatiguing and a tad lifeless. I do wish this album would have been treated as lovingly as the 2002 ABKO re-issues, which are mind-blowingly good. I cannot comment on the bonus tracks just yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"hey, vinyl fans - \\"screw you!\\"","review":"Do Not Buy This Reissue. This reissue comes with none of the bonus material. I can understand not including a 3rd record with the bonus tracks on it, but they don't even bother with a CD insert or an MP3 download of the bonus tracks. All you get is the original tracks in an insultingly cheap version of the original jacket. Get $12 together, go to your local used record store, and buy a decent used copy of this fantastic album.

Bands these days are disposable commodities. A ridiculous amount of music is released on the unsusptecting masses in an attempt to see what will stick. If there is any justice in the music world, Dogs Die in Hot Cars will stick. This is music that matters. I immediately thought of Talking Heads when listening to this CD. The music is all over the board, funk, punk, pop, ska, rock. The lyrics are intelligent and, unlike bands such as U2, don't tell the listener what to believe. Instead, these lyrics open discussions and invite the listener to participate. For my money, \\"Lounger\\" is the best single track of 2004. The perfect song for slackers or the intelligensia.

But as a fan of XTC from the days of 'Making Plans For Nigel' and 'Generals and Majors', I reckon this album by Dogs Die In Hot Cars is better than any single album XTC produced. Humourous as XTC were but more consistently bouncy and catchy, DDIHC are certainly a prospect, and this album is one of the best of the year. The three videos included with the CD are well done as well, and capture the off-kilter sense of humour evident in the lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete and Utter Rip Off of XTC","review":"I can't believe a band can get away with this. Well I guess I can, but...... Not only do they instrumentally sound like XTC, they even have the vocals down as well. Pretty shameless to copy a great band and pass it off as new and innovative to the unsuspecting. Is it that hard to come up with your own stuff? I mean bands will always pull sounds from this or that band and come up with something relatively fresh, but this is just shy of musical plagerism. Shameless, corporate-spewed fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip - off artist of the year","review":"To say that Dogs Die in Cars sounds like XTC is quite the understatement.

There is not a single track that I'd feel like skipping over while listening.

Here the human heart is opened for us to see in a most illuminating manner, using the novelist's tricks of suspense and phraseology to keep us turning the pages. And we do!I fear the title might be off-putting. Not that it is inappropriate, but when one reads on the jacket that the book is about oppression in Burma and Thailand of the unheard of Mon people, and written by a Catholic Missioner, and with such a title, the temptation is to give it a pass as probably rather dreary.

Because of the common believe that these two technologies are mutually exclusive, an enterprise often have to make a tradeoff.

What Nature IS in reality.You will NEVER forget this book.KINDLE - This book is formatted perfectly for my Kindle 3 and there were no problems viewing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple enough for children; arousing enough for adults","review":"Frequently used as a child's book, this tale of a house pet transformed into an Alpha male dog in the wild will waken your senses into what being wild can be all about. Simple word structures, emotional prose, certainly a classic piece that is likely to never be forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call of the Wild","review":"A great classic, this story discusses a dog's view of the world during the 1898 Alaska gold rush, and the mis-adventures that he went through after he was kidnapped from being a family dog in California to being a sled dog in Alaska and the Yukon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely urprise that sneaks up on you! I loved it!","review":"This book sneaks up on you. By the end you will be thinking about it for days. I love this story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw struggle","review":"This classic brims with testosterone and adrenaline. I could identify with Buck, the dog forced to struggle for survival in Alaska, where he was sold as a sled dog and then fought to become leader of the pack. The writing is vivid, and the story shows what it is to be a man. If you crave Alaskan adventure, you might also tryThe Golden Catch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad It Was Required Reading For My Daughter","review":"I don't know why, but I was never required to read this book as a youngster. At 42 I read it for the first time along with my daughter. I agree with another reviewer, as an adult I have a great admiration for this work (much more than I would have had as a young person). The written story is a great one of adventure, the underlying message is a tremendous exploration of survival and spirit. If you are buying this book for your child as required reading, take the time to read or re-read it yourself. It is amazing how Jack London survives the passage of time.As a side note - the afterword by Dwight Swain is a great help to young people to try to understand the underlying concepts, as are his comments on the life of Jack London."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Call of the Wild","review":"In my opinion, The Call of the Wild is a good book to read if you are wanting something quick to read. If you are interested in dogs than this is the book for you. It is loaded with lots of detail, but within the course of the book not a whole lot is covered. At the begginng of the book it is very slow, but near the end it starts getting good. It is definitely not hard reading. Anywhere from a fifth to sixth grader would be able to read this book. I probably wouldn't suggest it, but after reading I can say that it is a decent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleasing","review":"I did not like this book. It was very confusing and boring. I'm used to reading about action and adventure not dogs in the snow. Some may find it cute or compelling but for me it was just plain childish and corny."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Call of the Wild","review":"This is an exciting book full of action! It's about a dog named Buck who is sold and is shipped up to Alaska. There he meets many many dogs such as Curly, Spitz, Dave, Sol-leks, Joe, Billie, and Pike. Buck learns the law of fang and the law of club. In one part, Spitz tries to attack Buck, but Buck breaks both of Spitz's legs and lets the rest of the team kill him. This book is action packed with many highspots. Buy this book, it's worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe His Worst","review":"I'm a big Jack London Fan, he has written some wonderful stories. This is just not one of them, as this was one of his first I can see where he got so much better.

I was forced to read this awful, terrible, abysmal, horrible, tedious, soporific, stolid, just bad book. I mean, the main character was a dog. You can just imagine how, clever, witty, expressive, and interesting the diaglouge was. NOT!!! The book simply lacked. It was painful to read and I don't think that anyone could torture me into reading it again. I would give this book half of a star if I could. And I would only give it a half of a star because Jack London went to the trouble to bother write it. I don't understand how it is a classic or why people like it so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!","review":"This book was really dumb. I mean think about it, a 115 lb dog KILLING a bear. Come on! Even a 215 lb man, without a gun, couldn't kill a bear. It was unrealistic and it was sick! Why would anyone want to hurt a dog? And for what cause? To go deliver mail across Canada? Which, the author didn't really explain well. The author put in all of these characters that don't really need to be put into the story at all. The author didn't really make the story interesting. Maybe it was because I read it for school instead of on my own, but it was a really really boring book and I don't recomend it to anyone at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like boring books, this one's for you","review":"I am reading Call of the Wild for an Accelerated English class and I can not stand it. I don't see why so many people find it exciting and a \\"classic\\", and I know even if I was not reading it for an assignment I would still find it dull. I mean,the main characters are dogs, the plot is very slow and boring, and it is extremely predictable. It is one of those books that I would try to read, but never finish. I have to do an essay, plot chronology, ect. on a group of prissy dogs stuck in the Yukon suffering from a reality check. This is not anywhere near my definition of a classic novel,it is more like a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well..........","review":"The book \\"Call of the Wild\\" by Jack London isn't what I thought it would be. I normally don't enjoy to concept of an animals' point of view and this didn't help the idea that I might like it. The whole book was very boring and it switched the point of views too much. The paragraph's are annoyingly long and TOO full of detail. He wastes like a whole page describing one expression and some of his sentences are really confusing that it takes me long periods of time to find out what they meant. As I read this I found my mind drifting off to other things and I kept glancing up to see if anything interesting was going on. I had to read this in my 7th grade reading class, and a large majority of the class didn't find this interesting.[...]. I don't reccomend this book to anyone except to those who love dogs this book may be for you but the one part of this read I did enjoy was the action scenes, those were good and they kept me on the edge of my seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE THIS BOOK","review":"this book really gets on my nerves. it's about a spoiled little dog that sits on his spoiled yet \\"hardened\\" butt on his \\"sun-kissed\\" farm.things only go downhill from there. buck- (that's the dog) is now forced to be a sled dog. (the horrors.) read this book- but only if you're brave enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very interesting book","review":"\\"The call of the wild\\" is about a house-dog, Buck, who is taken from his comfortable home in California by the family gardener, and put into the harsh northland. There, he is sold to several different people to pull dog-sleds. He quickly rises to lead dog among the sled-dogs.This book has very well written descriptions and an okay story-line, but it just isn't interesting to read. It drags on and on even though it is only about a hundred pages long. It is also rather depressing, with all the descriptions of dogs being beaten with clubs and ripped apart by huskies.I do not particularly recommend this book, unless you really enjoy either detailed descriptions of dogs being hurt, boring storylines, or are obsessed with dog-sledding.~Rijii"},{"rating":"2","title":"Call of the Wild","review":"Call of the Wild, is one of Jack London's best works, that is, next to White Fang. He displays the hard ways of life of an Alaskan Husky in time of the gold rush in a most unique and beautifull way. The story is about Buck, A tamed outside husky, that is taken away to learn about the gold rush."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty coo. not Amazing","review":"Prior to reading this book, I had heard incredible things about it, so when I finally started it, I thought it was going to be one helluva ride. The story was good, the characters were pretty good (and half of them were dogs), the history was good, and anything else I am forgetting to mention about the book was \\"good\\". Its not even close to being one of my favorites, for I have read a good many, but it is worth the time spent. If you are a dog-lover, if you are interested in the Alaska gold-rush, or just like an all-round action-packed adventure, then you will probably like this book. Just don't get your hopes up, because you could get disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call of the Wild...","review":"Classic tale of the Alaskan Gold Rush, and of Buck, the heroic dog who is torn between two worlds--the wild, and man's.

Reading it is like a nightmare. It should be properly be labled \\"Call of Boredom,\\" and I'm not kidding! Though it's only 150+ pages, and it includes only seven chapters, it really drags and you'll fall asleep after reading its first few pages.It has no story at all. It's just about some dog who has to survive in the wilderness of Alaska after getting kidnapped. Jeez! What kind of plot is that? This book includes lots of poor, one-dimensional characters, even annyoning ones like Francois. It's really pointless to read, and I recommend that you stay away from it, unless you are forced to read it for school. \\"Call of Boredom\\" is one of the world's overrated books, and I mean it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUH?","review":"i had more fun watching my dog pull this book apart than reading it.

Even the introduction can be fascinating- I have a collection of the best of Jack London with an intro written by Eugene Burdick. Given all this, can you imagine having a copy of The Call of the Wild and on the cover is a picture of a German Shephard? The dog in this story is a St. Bernard and that is pivotal to the story- long hair dogs in california were being kidnapped for work in the frozen North. Anyways, as Mr. coselle used to say \\"And there you have it, folks\\"Steve Kane"},{"rating":"2","title":"Call of the Wild is Still a Classic","review":"This novel, even in 2004, can still be considered a major piece of literature that has infulenced American Literature since its first writing. Adventure, intrigue, hardships, friendships, and loyalty,even if it means death, are all found in this story. Aren't these the elements of a good example of literature. Isn't this what we educators still use to engage our students into reading? Dog lovers will adore this book, written in the perspective of our dog hero, Buck, an animal with human-like tendencies,intelligence, strength and dignity. A classic in every true sense is the best way to evaluate this novel. Jack London allows his readings to become a part of his stories; we begin to have empathy for Buck as he nearly dies, or when he risks it all to save his human friend, John Thornton.

That, along with it's wide commercial success, has allowed this story penetrate our culture in a significant way. Buck, although a dog, has been a powerful symbol for dedication and courage and heart and soul within our culture.I suppose that the celebration of these virtues is the most important purpose of this book. But there may be other subtexts to the story as well. Jack London was socialist, and the sled dogs working as a team may have been a metaphor for socialism. Also, the use of dogs which by nature subordinate their wills to that of their owners may be a metaphor for subject/state relationship in a socialist state.Also, the story is set in a particular corner of American history, during the Alaskan Gold rush, told by a writer who lived it. For those interested in history, this story puts meat on the bones of that time in history.Finally, this was FREE for the kindle version!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Same as White Fang","review":"Jack London, does it again, very well done story good ole Buck talk about survival skills learned the hard way, what a survivors tale eh!Again he takes the view point of the animal, such a refreshing prespective on Humanity, and Nature.Same as White Fang enjoyed it very much, read it several times in my life time and may still yet again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book, Jack London what else can you say","review":"Read this book as a kid, was good then and still good.

The reason I thought it was a good book is because I like dogs, wolves, and I like the wilderness.

A child could never fully appreciate this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A well written and descriptive book, but not in my interest.","review":"In my opinion The Call of the Wild by Jack London is mediocre. My favorite part of the book is the in depth descriptions. For example, I really like the way that London describes Buck after he had been pulling the sled for awhile. \\"His muscles had wasted away to knotty strings, and the flesh pads had disappeared, so that each rib and every bone in his frame were outlined cleanly through the loose hide that was wrinkled in folds of emptiness.\\"(London p.38) I also like the way the book is written and how it doesn't drag on forever. I do not like the beginning of the book because i think it is boring and doesn't grab the attention of the reader. I also think that the vocabulary is too tough and overall the novel is a bit confusing. Although personally I do not like The Call of the Wild, I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys a great adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"call of the wild","review":"Jack London has a very sophisticated style of writing. But the book is relatively predictable. the plot pulls you in and the book is hard to put down. Some of my favorites scenes are when Buck goes back to his primal instincts and sees the ape-man by the fire. The only negative feedback i have on this book is that Jack London is sort of racist agains Indians, the Yeehats are portrayed as the bad indians that killed everyone and then danced.

The only thing that i thought about the book that was good, was that it was discriptive in the fights against each other. One of the biggest things that i disagree with is the vocabulary, it was very hard for me to read all those big words, and phrases for example. With the Aurora Borals flaming overhead, or the stars Leaping in the first dance,and the land Numb and over its pail of snow.

My grandson started reading it and could not understand the words, he got frustrated and gave up. I thought it would be a regular size book geared to children. It is not for children. It is for adults, but not for elderly people because the print is too small. What a disappointment, a book that I had enjoyed so much turned out to be not a very good gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought this book was very good.","review":"The Call of the Wild written by Jack London was a splendid book. The book keeps you wanting to read on by having details about the places and animals. I didn't like the way all the dogs sufferes in the story. Even though Buck suffered at the point of almost death, he found John Thornton who saved his life. All the details about the characters made them almost real. London did a good job on making you feel like you were there. The quote \\"God! you can all but speak!\\"(Thornton pg.43) says all that you can say about Buck.

If I were you, I would never purchase this book, because you would just be wasting your time reading it. It is definitely hard to get into, and once you're finished, you don't feel satisfied at all.

It is a good story, and Jack London did a good job of writing it. However, this is the type of book that I will sit and read and slowly my mind drifts off and I start thinking of other things. It's very hard to keep your mind in the story, because the words go into such great details that it's hard to grasp all at once. Jack London's intentions were good. The storyline is very basic and easy to follow, however. It's a light hearted story about a dog Buck and his struggles in life. It makes you wonder how dogs really think. But honestly, I give this story a 2 because it just wasn't what I look for in a book. It's more old fashioned in a way. Maybe I'll have to give it another chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Channing Hall","review":"The Call of the Wild is a great book. When Buck is sold from his home his life instantly gets harder.

When Buck is injured, Spitz tries to kill Buck, but can not and Buck ends up killing Spitz. Buck hopes to be the lead dog but isn't.A new owner, John Thornton buys Buck, they become great friends.

He liked it, but did not rave about it. I believe this is a true story, which makes it more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOMENESS","review":"Call of the Wild is a very good book and when I say good I mean great. This great book is about a dog named Buck, with the thoughts of a human but the physical features of a Saint Bernard mix. Buck survives in the snowy and harsh conditions where only the strong survive in the Alaskan plateau. Buck was stolen from his sunny home in the Silicon Valley of California. After surviving his harsh handlers he then has to fight to stay alive every day. He never thinks about going back home - for now this desolate wasteland is home. The dogs surrounding him are his family. I believe that in this story Jack London has shone pure art in his writing. He also shows how idiotic people can be and how clever and smart dogs and other animals can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"call of the wild","review":"I had always heard of this book since I was only a kid, but never read it until last month, and to be totally honest, the only reason I read it was because it was a free book.

This book has so much beautiful desciption of the setting, characters, feelings, etc. Jack London has capture the eyes and attention of readers again with this book. His protagonist ( main charatcer ) Buck has a personality that is witty, clever, sophisicated, funny, fierce and firey. The story is told form third person omminescent ( meaning like, Jack London knows the history of all the characters and what the go through and stuff like that. ) London uses what he knows about the wild and dogs and puts it all into this wonderful written book and has the reader let it be known that all dogs and all other small or big animals have a personality of their very own that is unique in every way. I give this book 5 stars becuase of the accuracy of this book and how its told. I hope you take the time out of your day and read some of the call fo the wild. You'll like it.

He traveled thousands of miles with various trainers and dogs who came from different places but came together for the same reasons. This adventurous book is highly suspencful and will keep you on the edge of your seat. It rarely has a dull moment and it keeps you interested, for a fast read. I enjoyed how the story was told through Bucks point of view. I very raely think about how a dog feels and realize now that they are a lot more intelligent than i've given them credit for. anyone with a short attention spand who is interested in an easy and exciting read should consider reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Answer The Call","review":"Running, fighting, and surviving that is what Buck has to do. This is an amazing story about the life of a dog. The Call of the Wild by Jack London is an extremely exciting book. As you turn each page you encounter a new toil just as Buck does. You don't just read this book you live it the details are incredible. This is a great book and I recomend it to people of all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Call of the Wild- NOT FOR YOUNG KIDS","review":"I am in the eighth grade and this was one of the two books that I had to read this year (see my review also for The Giver). This book is about a dog named Buck who is kidnapped and has adventures along the Yukon in a team of sled-dogs. He has trials and tribulations, and the whole time, his \\"primordial instinct\\" is pulling at his soul, and he yearns to be free and wild.Let me start off by saying that this book is NOT for kids under 11. Some of the details (i.e. a dog is attacked and ripped apart-alive!) are too much for young kids to handle.I personally did not enjoy this book. It was much too grotesque in some details and it made me depressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This book told the story of a dog named Buck who went through many homes. When Buck finnally gets to a place to stay for good, he is whipped and abbused and is forced to be a sled dog. it takes him a while to get used to the harshness of his new life. When he sees one of his friends killed by the other dogs on the team, the reality sets in. After a while Buck adapts and becomes the tough lead dog.

At the time, I was in elementary school and I checked it out from the middle school library when we were on an orientation visit. I found it so interesting that I proceeded to read everything of his that I could find. London's expression of events from the perspective of the dog and the innate killer instinct of Buck combine to make an accurate story about nature, the kill or be killed reality of survival.Yet, Buck is also capable of great love, his actions when he is with Thornton expresses the best traits of a domesticated dog, loyalty, courage and intelligence. Buck defends Thornton when attacked, rescues him from a watery death and engages in simple affectionate play. A true classic of American literature, this is a book that all children should read. Now that I have rediscovered London, I am on a hunt for his other writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"bucks nasty fights","review":"I liked this book because of its detales in fights like when buck fought the man in the high walled back yard. in this fight jack london describes bucks anger and the pain with words like red-eyed devil,a fierce blow and blood flowing from his nose and mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well written and descriptive book, but not in my interest","review":"This book \\"The Call of the Wild\\" was written in 1897 by Jack London. The story takes place in the Yukon during the Goldrush. I thought this book contained a good combination of action and suspense. I liked the detailed description such as this quote from the book, \\"Because men, groping in the Artic darkness, had found yellow metal, and because steamship and transportation companies were booming to find, thousands of men were rushing to Northland. (pg.1) I also liked the heavy vocabulary, although it was difficult at times. I also liked the nature and rough mood that London set. It kept the story interesting. The only part I didn't like was the abrupt ending of the story. I thought that London was just trying to end the story too quickly. Overall I liked this book and coming from a person who doesn't like to read, it was pretty good. What I'm trying to say is that this book is worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A well written and descriptive book, but not in my interest","review":"Jack Londons The Call of the Wild, was a very well written book. Although it has great uses of words and phrases, the book didn't grab my attention. I thought the time period follows the book very well. Nothing was too modern. One of my favorite parts of the book was at the end. Buck becomes friends with the other wolves. Before that, Buck and the wolves got into a quarrel. One of the scenes in this novel that I disliked were how much the dogs were traded. Because London did this so much it makes The Call seem like the same things keep happening over and over again. London writes: Francois called Buck to him, threw his arms around him and wept over him. And that was the last of Francios and Perrault. Like other men they passed out of Bucks life for good. (London pg.27). I advise readers who enjoy naturistic adventures, to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A well written and descriptive book, but not in my interest.","review":"In my opinion The Call of the Wild by Jack London is mediocre. My favorite part of the book is the in depth descriptions. For example, I really like the way that London describes Buck after he had been pulling the sled for awhile. \\"His muscles had wasted away to knotty strings, and the flesh pads had disappeared, so that each rib and every bone in his frame were outlined cleanly through the loose hide that was wrinkled in folds of emptiness.\\"(London p.38) I also like the way the book is written and how it doesn't drag on forever. I do not like the beginning of the book because i think it is boring and doesn't grab the attention of the reader. I also think that the vocabulary is too tough and overall the novel is a bit confusing. Although personally I do not like, The Call of the Wild, I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys a great adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"The call to nature is the call to freedom...","review":"Jack London's short novel reflects the story of a St. Bernard dog, Buck, who is stolen and sold as a sled-dog in the harsh Arctic North. It is the time of the Klondike Gold Rush, and Buck not only becomes aware of himself as a wild animal but as a dog which must answer to the nagging 'call of the wild.' A wondeful story, and indeed, a prelude to a great lesson which we all should learn and know well"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Call of the wild.","review":"Almost a juntapose story to the other great classic from Jack London \\" White Fang\\" but instead of the domestication of a wolf, it deals with the slide from domenstic dog towards his ancient wild nature.

I think it should be REQUIRED that abridged versions be identified as such."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE CALL OF THE WILD!!","review":"This book is a classic for good reason. Jack London is a very talented writer, and although some of you kids out there find his material boring and unimportant, there are lessons that can be learner from Jack, and from Buck who is our hero in this novel. I grew up in the Yukon, and although it was much more recent that the time in which the story takes place, this book is very realistic to me. Some of the other reviews say that this is a tall tale, but there is truth to it. Mother Nature is unforgiving, whether it be in the desert or the snow, and Jack portrays this fact very well. In the North, it really is survival of the fittest, though it has mellowed out somewhat over the last hundred or so years. There are people and creatures in this book that are cruel, but reality is no more kind to us now than it was back then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uses vivid descriptions","review":"An excellent book that will nearly paint the scenery in your mind. Most of the book is set in the arctic north and is centered during the time of the Klondike Gold Rush. After reading this I wanted to get up and head north. The book is about the life of a dog named Buck, which is a half-St.Bernard and half-shepherd dog. The book unveils Buck's reversion from a typical family pet dog to a hard working sled dog. His breeding allows for growth and strength as he will become of the greatest dogs during his time. It makes you think about simple life, about the outdoors and nature, and most of all, about the \\"call of the wild.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A good but swiftly changing book","review":"This was the first Jack london book I read. I loved reading all my life and when my flow of favorites came to a standstill , I just took out this book from the library and started to halfheartedly read it a loved the avid descriptions of the settings and the way London narrarrated it. the changes in plot were not always pleasent such as the battle or the death of some of his masters, but overall this book was the best i ever read, other than white fang, which is a bit happier and the ending is reversed. please excuse any errors found in this reveiw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

I just wanted to say..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very good book to expand your knowledge.","review":"In my opinion, \\"The Call of the Wild\\", by Jack London is a good dipiction. I would recommend this novel to intelligent readers, because London uses difficult vocabulary words. When some of the people talk it is hard to understand, because they use colloquial language. For example \\"And seein' it's government money, you ain't got no kick coming, eh, Perrault?\\" (London page 7). The characters represent the time period very well. They show the hardships of living near the Yukon, how dogs are important for pulling a sled while the people look for gold. Overall if you are looking for a book to expand your knowledge, and vocabulary, this is the dipiction for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The call of the wild has some good parts, as well as bad!","review":"I think The Call Of The Wild was a decent book. It had some positives and some negatives. Some positives about the book I liked was the description he used. he described the characters very well, as well as the senery too. Also i like how he made the dogs out to be just like humans. Some negatives about the book I didnt like very well was that the book was not very interesting! It needed some kind of spark or something else added to it to spice it up a little bit. Also it lacked action, there was some action but not enough that made me want to keep reading the book. One quote Jack London used in my mind, that i liked is \\"Dat Zpitz fight lak hell, but that Buck fight lak two hells!\\" I like this quote and it stands out in my mind because it shows some dominance Buck has in the book. It also shows that buck is the rightful leader of the pack! These are some things that i like and dislike about The Call Of The Wild."},{"rating":"1","title":"The call of the wild was a boring, pointless book.","review":"The call of the wild was a boring, pointless book. I had no intrest in it because it was just another book about a boy and his dog. It was a plain old boring family book. It's even stated on page forty-one \\"it's my dog.\\" Said by Hal to John Thornton in a fight over Buck. That quote totally proves the whole boy and his dog theory. I would never recomend this book to anyone. I'm not saying that it is a bad book but it was not a book I could get into and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really thought this book needed some spice.","review":"I thought that THE CALL OF THE WILD by Jack London was a decent book. It was kind of dull and lacked that spice that keeps the reader glued to the book. I did like how descriptive he was in some situations, but this description was also the downfall of this book. I didn't like how he gave the animals human feelings. Like on page 42 when he was talking about Buck. He says \\"love, genuine passionate love was his for the first time.\\" In all, I would only recommend this book to people who have nothing better to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is about a dog who devolves into the primitive.","review":"Jack London's The Call of the Wild, I think, wasn't that great. It was descriptive, nd the characters did seem real, but I wouldn't recomend it. For one thing, there isn't much dialogue, and when there is, it's not very understandable. For example: \\"T'ree vair good dogs. Dat Buck, heem pool lak hell. I tich heem queek as anyting.\\" Ther are worse, but I could't understand them. Also, I don't like the way that all of the characters died (or left without return) except Buck. I don't think that the main character should miraculously live through everything, just because he's the main character. That is wht I think about Jack London's The Call of the Wild."},{"rating":"2","title":"review of the Call of The Wild","review":"This book was pretty good over all. It was a slow read, but Jack London knows how to write a good book.I would not recommend this book for anyone under 5 grade. It was pretty Gory. The first couple of pages were hard to follow. This book was a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Not a Childrens Book\\"","review":"This book, about a dog being terribly mistreated throughout the story, should come with a warning label. Some of the more graphic computer games are not as descriptive as the treatment that the good natured dog, Buck, receives from most of his owners throughout his travels. Finally, the one owner who saves his life and gives him love dies at the hands of the Indians! Not a fun book to put down at one in the morning without another good book to pick you up. This book probably should not be advertised for children under age fourteen."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a let down.","review":"If you are interested in reading a srory you cannot relate to, try \\"Call of the Wild\\" by Jack London. This book was a real let down. In the begining a swindler named Manuel got me interested, but he soon exited the story. The setting never got devloped properly and would change before I could visualize it. Although the book had up's in the dog fights the constant repetition was ever present in my mind. Of the little dialouge in the book, my Favorite line is \\"I spik true w'en I say dat Buck two devils.\\" Francois said this on page 25. This line was said about Buck after he kills a fellow dog. This story never got me into it enough to like it, and I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"If you would like a computer to read this book to you, this would be the book for you to purchase.

HORRIBLE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Call of the Wild was a good, descriptive book.","review":"In my opinion The Call of the Wild by Jack London was a good book. Jack was very descriptive; he made the novel come alive and he kept me reading. Though, there were certain sections I didn't care for, such as the beatings of the dogs and John Thornton's death. Also the characters Mercedes, Hal, and Charles were very annoying, and it seemed unrealistic when they made it so far acting the way they did. The quote \\"I spik true w'en I say dat Buck two devils,\\" (page 25) shows that Buck was a strong fierce fighter and what the language they spoke back then was like. I found the colloquial languages easy to comprehend. I suggest this novel to all younge adults eager to learn what life was like in 1897. Again I enjoyed The Call of the Wild and would like to read more books like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did like the book.","review":"In Jack London's Call of the Wild I thought that it was a very detailed book. This book was so detailed that you got a really good picture of what it was like. Then other times it was so detailed it got really boring. You really get the feeling of what it was like back in the 1800's and the Yukon. \\"Dat Buck for sure learn queek as anyt'ing\\" I like this quote because this is how I think that Buck is becoming wild. This is how Buck earns the respect from his handler and teams. It is amazing how he could become a great sled dog so quick. From a scale from 1 to 10 I give this book a 7 because it had good detail and a good story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call of the wild","review":"Jack London is a great author.

I first read this book in the 6th grade. It was \\"OK\\" but I had no context in my life to connect with it. An adventure I've been on made me recall some of the haunting words of Mr. London and I re-read it. There is much wisdom in acknowledging that the \\"call of the wild\\" is in and all around us and every living creature. Buck was domestic and happy, yet the call to something greater and unknown after hardship and tragedy is inspiring. Maybe our intuitive selves are as powerful as our educated and well- behaved selves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild Call","review":"This is an excellent book to read from whether it be that of for pleasure or as an assignment.

I am highly allergic to many beauty products, so I was not really getting my hopes up, but it had great reviews here and on other sites, so I gave it a try and WOW! WIthin just a couple days the cracks and rashes started to heal. It has only been 10 days since I started using it and my hands are smooth and free of injuries, even if I forget to put it on for the day. I have never had anything work so well so fast! I have started using it on my nasty dry elbows and am starting to see similar effects. Even though it is a little high priced to use as a body cream, I think I will try it on my ultra dry legs next! I am going to be a regular for this great cream. By the way, I LOVE the scent as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dried My Hands Out","review":"Maybe I got a bad batch but Lather AHA Creme with Evening Primrose Trio actually made my hands feel dryer than they were before I applied it.

Originally started by L. Frank Baum writing as Edith Van Dyne, the series was continued by Emma Sampson after Baum's death in 1919. While Baum favored Mary Louise, Sampson continues the series focusing more on Josie,the young detective, and treats Mary Louise as a minor character. In this book, Mary Louise donates the house she inherited from her grandfather and a significant sum of money to the local orphanage. Two new orphans attract the attention of Josie O'Gorman who begins to investigate the mystery of their missing parents and the strange young woman who abandoned them. This was an enjoyable novel of the post-war years written with a strong female character which is a pleasant light read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb and thorough introduction to woodturning.","review":"As a beginning turner, I really appreciate both the clarity of the discussion and the detail with which tool technique is discussed.

She went through puppyhood with a mini version of \\"Terrible Nasty Scaries Angry Kitty\\". This toy has lasted over a year and a half (we still have this unscathed toy and she still enjoys it). We are hooked. We purchased the full size Dirty Rotten Kitty because she has now grown up. My dog can play tug-of-war and not rip limbs off. She can chew on it and it doesn't wear out. Her teeth do not pierce into the strong canvas fabric and tear it. I also purchased the \\"Postal Plaything\\" because my husband is a mailman and I have a warped sense of humour. These Fat Cat Toys are virtually undestructible and my furkid and I love them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment!","review":"After reading most of the reviews for these dog toys - I ordered 4 for all of the special dogs in our lives. We were hoping to get a very durable toy (and cute - which they are), but they didn't even last 15 minutes. Our Lab had the arms and tail off in no time. Our friends all reported the same thing. So - if you are looking for durability - look for another product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T PURCHASE THIS DVD!","review":"This DVD (and it's first volume) are absolutely unacceptable as anything other than complete trash. What a disappointment! For starters, the video and sound quality are horrible! It honestly looks worse than a VHS video. (No joke here.) There are noticeable glitches, it looks and sounds as if someone was adjusting the tracking on a VCR as this was being transferred to DVD! Most of the videos have obvious edits and skips in them, and most (95%) of the songs have the beginnings cut-off (mid-lyric) and the ends just chopped. I don't believe one video is complete. Some videos are so washed-out it's ridiculous. There are NO extras at all, nor are there any credits or record company recognitions listed. Please don't waste your time on this thing. Unbelievable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst DVD I've ever seen","review":"Like any big 80's music fan, I was thrilled when I saw this DVD. Of course, I bought it right away, drove home, and sat down to watch. I quickly realized 30 seconds into the DVD that I made a big mistake. I could record these videos on my VCR with better quality and transition--almost anyone could. Please save your money and treat yourself to a couple pizzas--they will be much more satisfying and last a lot longer than this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-VHS quality","review":"The videos look like someone dubbed a video, then digitized the result. There's actually a video hiccup at least one of the videos. These were apparently originally broadcast on something called \\"That Teen Show\\". Sound and video quality are poor, and the beginnings and ends of many songs are cut off.On the other hand, there are several songs here that are hard or impossible to find on video anywhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remastered from old tapes - Not DVD quality","review":"I was very excited when I found this disc. Classic 80's videos from my formative years watching MTV. I knew these videos and couldn't wait to see them in high quality DVD fashion with Dolby Digital sound - as advertised.Well, I was quickly driven to \\"Disappointment City.\\" This disc was clearly mastered from old, worn out, home-VCR quality tapes. The images are fuzzy throughout ... you can even see tape-skip and white fuzzy lines. If you have surround sound, most of the music comes from the center speaking with a little in the front right and left channels. Basically, a mono effect.To make matters worse - I didn't believe it could get worse - the videos just cut off abruptly toward the end each song. Cutting off the music and video.You'll be disappointed in this DVD. It's an embarrassing effort. If you love 80's videos, you'll be even more disappointed because it will far under delivery on your expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"SNIPER RULES","review":"Forget religion, forget your parents, forget even showering.

SNIPER FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FACE VALUE","review":"You've got to take this recording at face value. What you hear is what you get. If you want the perfect dance record, stick with (or desperately try to find) Baby Ford's Bford 9 (1992) or Jam and Spoon's 1994 release Tripomatic Fairytales (that's 2001 AND 2002, folks), or for the more adventurous, Final Cut's Consumed CD(1992). If Lefitsm was never recorded, everyone would go gaga over Leftield's R+S. It's an extremely impressive follow-up CD, and my only personal gripes are the seemingly commercially-motivated singles, Phat Planet and Afrika Shox, which completely disrupt the ominous tone and overall continutity of the CD. Use your CD-program button to skip these sub-par tunes and you've got a great listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope you like reggae","review":"Hope you like reggae. I bought this CD because I was linked to it from an underworld purchase - you know - \\"people who bought this cd also bought...\\". Well, I happen to dislike the junky sloppy flavor of reggae - it is actually appaling. I like clean, precise, flowing sounds. I could see how some would like some of the more trancy songs on the CD, but the reggae mixed between - ruins it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"So, Leftfield finally released a new album. I can't put in words how excited I was when I bought it. And neither can I tell you how disappointed I am now.Let me tell you, I'm not one of those rock'n roll radicals, I love rock and I love techno. Maybe I don't understand techno enough to make a fair review, but I LOVED \\"Leftism\\". Leftism, Fluke's \\"Risotto\\" and Prodigy's \\"Fat of the Land\\" are my favourite techno albums. And I was hoping that \\"Rhythm and Stealth\\" was, at least, similar to Leftfield's debut album. It is not. I'm sorry, techno fans.I can't make a fair judgement, but the songs are not as danceable as \\"Open Up\\", \\"Afro Left\\" and \\"Release the Pressure\\". I found it very dark and boring.So, if you really are a techno fan and like all kinds of techno stuff, you might like this album. But if your just a fan who loved Leftism and the way it made you dance, stay away from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a grower, not a show-er","review":"Like some other reviewers here, I was disappointed at first, but this is a record whose subtleties only emerge with repeated listenings. The beats are most definitely NOT straight out of the box but fantastically layered and groovy. \\"Phat Planet\\", \\"Double Flash\\" and \\"Swords\\" are THE techno tracks of the year. Nobody mixes the ambient with the fierce like these guys do; the way the mood shifts over the course of the record is pure genius. A top notch record in any genre and, needless to say, it beats the hell out of all other electronic comers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the epic that Leftism is","review":"So it's taken 4 years to produce this...???? Somehow, I don't think so.Big beats? Yes, and they are infectious. But it has none of the enchantment that Leftism had. It sounds like Leftfield just put their sequencer into automatic. Even the sounds are nothing new, and I can hear samples from the Leftism remixes.Buy this CD if you're a DJ looking for muzak fillers. If you're looking for a CD that demonstrates all that's innovative about British music, this ain't it.Sorry guys, but the wait wasn't worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good.","review":"There's no debate for me - I already like this better than Leftism. Not as corny. Can seem monotonous but if you give it a chance it gets under your skin; it takes a few listens to appreciate. Also, comes with a cool enhanced-cd-thingy video, at least mine did."},{"rating":"2","title":"a brave move","review":"Like a lot of people, I've been looking forward to this album for years. When I first heard it, I was disappointed. But now, I think it's a very brave follow-up to a classic. They could've just made a 'Leftism Part 2', but instead they've made a fine album which stands up well on its own merits. Some of their best work is on this - 'Dusted' in particular is excellent. I think people probably have a problem with the mood of the album - it veers from the laid back 'El Cid' to the pounding, agressive 'Double Flash'.Overall, it's a superb album from an innovative band. Can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"'Phat' indeed, but lacks the vision of 'Leftism'...","review":"'Leftism' was so ahead of it's time, following up such a masterpiece must have been an unenviable task. With tracks like 'Phat Planet' they pull blindsiders once more and thier ambient moments still feature (see 'Rhino's Prayer'). A great album that can stand up to a lot of stuff that that tries to pass itself off as electronica, just not quite as sharp as what came before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compared to the first release, this is simply boring","review":"I'm sorry to spoil the other reviews but when compared to the first release this is simply boring electronic music with no real new ideas.

That being said, most of the tracks sound like their energy is threatening to burst from the rigid framework they are written in. I suppose dance music isn't about writing songs, but dance-albums really ought to be. In fact, there are a few dance albums that are. Beaucoup Fish, Risotto, Movement in Still Life... Those three albums alone make this particular effort look just rather weak. High production value, yes, it sounds pretty. But pretty what?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The pinnacle of Techno music","review":"The first thing you need to realize about this album is that it's best heard through surround sound. This is the first techno act to completely capitalize on all aspects of multi-channel amplification. From deep house rave to dancehall ambience the flavors and layers of this album excite the senses . This album justifies sampling and dubbing to the masses. Years from now they will be credited with opening the doors."},{"rating":"2","title":"just buy the album. you can't lose.","review":"Do not disappoint yourself and compare this album to \\"Leftism\\". To do so would not be fair. This album is a living, breathing collage of many different colors. I especially like \\"Chant of a Poor Man\\". If you are a rasta, try sitting still while this joint is playing.\\"Phat Planet\\" is a breaker's dream. When I first played it, I began to pop and tick, and uprock like it was '85 again. \\"El Cid\\" is a very dark and bittersweet track, very trippy indeed. Overall, the album satisfies, and has something for everyone. If you were looking for just techno, I suggest you take a course in music appreciation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I sure hope that first review I saw was accurate, because I just finished listening to it for the 1rst time and I am really disappointed. I only like 3 tracks on it, I don't think it has the rythems that LEFTISM had, in fact most of the rythems and drum lines a mundane or just don't spark any interest, and I kinda wish I hadn't bought the CD. Sure hope it changes next time I listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the dark side","review":"Of course there are the inevitable comparisons to Leftism, but therein lies an important difference: Where Leftism maintains an amazing consistency, I think R&S finds our heroes trying to impress on too many levels. This could have been a minimalist beat feast a la Double Flash and Phat Planet or filled with slow, brooding pieces like Swords and Poor Man, or even showpieces like Dusted and Afrika Shox. But a few of all of the above doesn't gel well.For my money I'd have opted for the second, since the best and most fully realized part of all this was the Swords single, which had no less than five fantasic remixes. Rare and essential.Lastly, after four or five years (whatever it was) to fill out the disc with such filler as they do is puzzling and a little sad.Lastly, the cover was (to me) a clever evocation of Steely Dan's Aja cover. What that means I cannot say."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning album on its own","review":"They did fail to come up with an album as stunning as \\"leftism\\", but \\"leftism\\" was a very hard act to follow, being one of the most greatest electonica albums on its time. This album however Doesn't seem like \\"new ground\\" at all. The track are very great, but some of them just strike you as being only \\"decent\\" and unlike all the stunning tracks on leftism. Some of these are forgetable. Its also fair to note that nothing on this album is a \\"must have\\" in the way that \\"Open up\\" and \\"original\\" are.A very good album on its own. Just seems like a step down in many ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still techno at its best","review":"The variety of sounds presented is very enjoyable.

Leftism was way ahead of it's time and is full of sounds that practially tickle your ears whereas Rhythm & Stealth is full of sounds that are ugly and not nearly as pleasant to listen to. This is my synopsis and apparently I'm not alone as this CD sells for much cheaper on the used market than Leftism.My advice?

Her take on \\"A Kind of Magic\\" is the worst kind of lite-FM pop complete with saxophone. Ugh.The highlight is \\"Radio Ga Ga\\" in which she added actual bits from BBC radio giving it a true nostalgic feel (which was what the song is all about.)A fairly good album...if you like late 80's adult contemporary music."},{"rating":"2","title":"This record takes my head to another galaxy","review":"Melvins have come one hell of a long way as a band, mentally and physically. The dark, drony, drugged out and trance-like opener, \\"They All Must Be Slaughtered\\", incorporates a creepy synthesizer and clocking in at almost 8 minutes. The next cut, \\"Mombius Hibachi\\" is more of a Ramones- esque, fast-paced punk / metal track, \\"Lovely Butterfly\\" is one of the craziest songa by Melvins I have ever heard. In fact, it's so damn crazy that it makes Buckethead's music look as normal as Phil Collins. \\"Pitfalls In Serving Warrants\\", another musically delectable track deals with crap I don't even understand.

The story revolved around having a drink every waking moment, constant cattiness, predictable hookups, and boring conversations. This may sound like interesting drama, but it wasn't. If it is at all possible to make drama drab, this book has accomplished such a thing.

Of course any interviewer worth their salt will be able to see right through some idiot trying to use buzzwords to look smart.

I found this out after the paint started to chip off during cleaning! Who did the engineering and testing of this design? Very bad design indeed. And water can be trapped under the metal band of the lids which the black paint band is suppose to hide. What a joke!Also the lid's lip is easily dented if accidently dropped.So in sum, the attractive look of the Contemporary series quickly fades when its vulnerability and durability are factored in.

An expedition and rescue goes to an old uncharted island where they see the most unbelievable thing, a land of dinosaurs and a carnivorice apeman with a chimp that lures pray to him! At the time, these special effects were amazing and so realistic.

And Sloppy, too. Very Sloppy. Slingshot gives us a (reasonably) good transfer of a classic and lovely old monster movie, but the supposedly \\"Special Collector's Edition\\" fails to deliver half of the extras advertised on the back of the DVD. There is no Second Audio Track (Music Only), no in-depth essay by Scott MacQueen, no Ray Harryhausen Letter, no Technical Notes, and no recreation with stills and script excerpts of \\"missing scenes\\" of the original 10-reel version. What a pity! I'm returning my copy and hoping that someone else releases it with the care and supplements that the movie deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Viewing Treat","review":"This \\"The Lost World\\" 1925 film is beautifully restored. The last time we rented a copy of the movie, the video was grainy and entire scenes were missing. But on this new DVD version, the picture is clear throughout the entire movie, and no part of the story appears to missing. The \\"CGI\\" has been cleaned up and may surprass its original clarity; a must-see for anyone who loves the history and process of special effects. A soundtrack has also been added to this silent film, not voices, but with accurately placed animal and dinosaur bytes and a tasteful, light musical background. All in all, a wonderful evening's entertainment, suitable for the entire family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Restoration!","review":"My first viewing of \\"The Lost World\\" was a highly abridged super 8mm. film, my second a VHS tape, still highly abridged, and dark!This new restoration is a amazingly impressive restoration; the images are clear and bright, the tinting, which changes appropriatly from scene to scene, adds an important visual texture.The sound tracks are equally impressive. The classic score on the alternate channel provides the original experience, but in my opinion the newly composed score is equally impressive, and adds hugely to the impression the film makes.All in all, for people who love this genre of film, Willis O'Brien in particular, or silent films in general, this restoration is more than worth the few dollars it cost!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost World","review":"A weak script and tepid direction derail THE LOST WORLD before it has the chance to leave the station.About the only reason to rent this one is for the chance to see a youngish Wallace Beery in a fright wig and Bolshevik beard and a stop-action animated brontosaurus stomping through downtown London. Director Harry Hoyt may have established the tradition of welding a weak story to a special effects spectacle and hoping for the best.

Right out of the box one was missing the crest on the end of the knife, others are glued on crooked. They are not sharp and the bread knife tears the bread apart instead of slicing it, and the slicing knife does a much nicer job on my breads. RUST spots appeared the first time washed, now I just throw them into the dishwasher, because they are not the quality I expected.. The handles are comfortable and you get a good grip on them even with wet hands, so that is a good point.

I thought maybe they would be a pretty good set of knives. I was Wrong, They are GREAT! We recently had a BBQ, and anyone who has ever sliced open a Pig for BBQing knows that often you have to kind of Saw on the pork, But these knives slice through it like a razor through Hot butter. That prooves it for me. This is a great set of Knives. You can spend a lot more, and get a lot less, or just buy this GREAT set of knives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Over time, I bought several different sets of Sabatier knives.

I don't know how long they will had a good edge. The handles are cheap plastic and the little silver end pieces remind me of cheap models I made as a kid.

BTW this set was bought as a gift, the sears set will be given instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap handles and decent steels","review":"I still can't understand why in the world they took a nice set of knives and put such cheap plastic handles on them.

But if you are looking for a good quality set at a cheap price, this set isn't. The small knives are like using saws. The larger ones are not real sharp nor will they hold an edge.

But what do you get for this price?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it!!!","review":"Complete waste of the little amount of money you pay for them! I didn't even waste the money to ship them back. I threw them out. Just the block was worth saving. But no good without decent knives. These knives are terrible. Can't cut a single thing. The are extremely dull. My knives rusted after the first washing. Spots and stains all over them and they were hand washed and dried. The steak knives just shred at the meat they don't cut it. Like using a grater to cut your steak. Please do not waste your money on these knives. I will never again look at a Sabatier knife they ripped me off once never again.

Will tricking customers encourage repeat customers? If the answers to these questions is yes, Amazon should continue on its present deceiving course, if the answer is no, the head of amazon.com should purchase a quality set of Sabatier knive for everyone that purchased a cheap set of these knive and send the good knives along with an apology to everyone that was tricked by Amazon.coms false and misleading advertising!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even good enough for dorm use","review":"I got these for my college dorm suite's kitchen. They look like cheap junk, but who cares? I only wanted functionality.But the knives are really badly balanced. I'm a vegetarian, so I spend a lot of time chopping onions, tomatoes, etc. These knives are too light, and it hurt my wrist to use them for more than a few minutes.I wish I hadn't bothered with this set. Quality over quantity.... I've since replaced them with a chef's knife/paring knife/break knife set of slightly higher quality. Live and learn.I can see one value for this set: if you have a collection of kichen knives with lots of different functions then you could probably purchase this set for the block alone. The block is adequate. Just be sure to throw the knives away!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOCKING SCHLOCK!","review":"Amazon has just lost my confidence!!

Whoever made these knives is a Chinese knockoff who has stolen the name, symbol, and even product-line identification (i.e. ChefStar, etc.) of the originals.These knives are cheap, plastic-handled, lightweight and don't even qualify to be called imitations. Tres, tres junque!When I finish this review, I will be digging the carton out of the dumpster so I can send them back.

My children have enjoyed playing with it off an on, but they enjoy their 'little people' house, barn, fire station, etc much more. This 'loving family' doll house is a little on the 'rickety' side - the steps broke off within a week [they were REALLY flimsy], and the whole dollhouse is a little on the flimsy side.

I put mine in my shop so that doesn't matter.The speakers have perhaps a one ounce magnet, but I suspect even less. The cones are paper, I didn't know they even made automotive speakers from paper anymore. Expect them to rot fast in humid environments. They of course sound very tinny, maybe with a bass or loudness control they would be better.The cd does work I doubt it would play ripped mp3's.

Hey there's the word I was looking for. This classic album shows the band at the top of its game. Plenty of Rock N Roll and Blues as well as Country and Jazz influences. Mick Taylor displays some awesome guitar playing most notably on Sway and Can't You Hear Me Knocking. Some people seem to knock Dead Flowers as a weak number but truthfully its their best Country Song ever recorded. You can't go wrong here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Remastering? Really Mick?","review":"So what Virgin didn't get it right in 94? How anyone can justify the difference in sound quality to buying Stick Fingers or any post-ABCKO release for the third time now is absolutely beyond me. The whole remastering scam was warranted in the early 90's, but the Stones don't even add additional tracks or linear notes to these. I'll wait for the 2021 50th anniversary remastered edition.

Founder of the Rolling Stones ) Since 1968 - 9 they began moving away from their strength ( R & B ) and headedinto these uncharted waters. Most of the content of these songsleave you empty.

This CD has a dynamic range of about 8db. Everything has been compressed to make the average volume louder. Try the new Rod Stewart remasters of A Night on the Town and Atlantic Crossing, which were not compressed to increase the volume, to see what might have been with these new Stones remasterings. I actually like the EQ choices Stephen Marcussen made in the remastering of this and the other Stones remasters, but the lack of dynamic range and compression ruin it. No bonus tracks and a loudness war remastering make this one a loser for me.

Every song on the record is a winner and in typical Stone's fashion, they meander between Blues to Country satire to Jazz to straight out rock.Listen to the anguished scream of Jagger on Sway, a greatly underrated cut. Then listen to the melodic interplay on Wild Horses.

Seger had minor hits prior to the release of BEAUTIFUL LOSER. He and the band open with Tina Turner's composition NUTBUSH CITY LIMITS. Other BEAUTIFUL LOSER tracks include the title track,JODY GIRL,TRAVELIN' MAN and KATMANDU.

Though it was released before the album \\"Night Moves\\" and as a result contains few of his best known songs, it is still full of great songs and great performances. The best sequence is \\"Travelin' Man/Beautiful Loser\\" in which he links two good studio songs into one great live performance. Also first rate are the burned out performer anthem \\"Turn the Page,\\" (lately covered by Metallica) with its weary vocals, the ballad \\"Jody Girl\\" and some great rave up versions of his early singles \\"Ramblin' Gamblin' Man,\\" \\"Katmandu\\" and \\"Get Out of Denver.\\" Any fan of Bob Seger or of great American classic rock should own this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest live album ever made","review":"One of the legends surrounding this album is that Capitol was going to drop Seger if it wasn't a hit, so this represented his last shot at the big time. I'm not from Detroit, so I don't know if that's true, but in thirty years of hearing concert recordings I've never heard the kind of effort and emotion Seger put into this record from any performer, especially the mythic \\"side 3\\", the linked versions of \\"Ramblin' Gamblin' Man\\", \\"Heavy Music\\" and \\"Katmandu\\".

It is another casualty of the \\"Loudness wars.\\"[...]Just look at this for example:[...]Why would anyone want to replace their old version with this new, ultra distorted junk. Some remasters are fighting back. Paul McCartney's new remasters are lovely.This version encoded as a 'lossless' digital file would probably sound worse than a 128k mp3 of the original cd release.I know my Seger. I drank beers with Seger at the Red Carpet Lounge when he met Alto Reed when Alto Reed was with Ormandy and Teegarden & Van Winkle were the MC's. Seger cared back then, now he must be too busy, or on vacation. He doesn't seem to care about his legacy as much as his fans do.

Mr. Seger was a huge star in the Midwest, thanks in large part to his raucous live performances. But he was never able to make a dent in the national scene save for a few minor hits. This live album released in 1976 showed his strength of the stage and gave people a chance to sample his best music. The reflective \\"Travelin' Man\\" & \\"Beautiful Loser\\" perfectly segue into one another while \\"Jody Girl\\" is a lamenting ballad. \\"Turn The Page\\" is a classic tale of live on the road and Mr. Seger perfectly captures the haze and monotony of a musician on tour. Mr. Seger really shines when the band cranks up the energy on such workouts like \\"Ramblin' Gamblin' Man\\", \\"Katmandu\\", \\"Get Out Of Denver\\", \\"Let It Rock\\" and \\"Heavy Music\\". \\"Live\\" Bullet only peaked at number 34, but it was a multi-platinum seller and made Mr. Seger a star.

Chapters one through three are a great introduction to installing Eclipse and using it to work with Java applications. It then takes a turn away from Eclipse by covering CVS in chapter four, and then continues into a basic Java development book in all of the chapters that follow. If I wanted a book on how to develop Struts I would buy Programming Jakarta Struts. I don't need chapter ten to give me a cursory glimpse into Struts programming.

Being 1980s based, the story reminds us of what we were really like in those days, with our over-reliance on fads (the guru, the dog psychologist, the radio psychologist) and neglect of important issues like homelessness and our own children.This book is based on the film of the same name, but where it lacks the charisma of the three leading actors, it compensates by fleshing out their characters. There are additional bits ad pieces put in (in the book the son is gay, whereas in the film he is just a bit effeminate) which make it more thought-provoking, but not too serious.Marter skilfully captures the comedy and mayhem of the film, without losing pace. 'Novelising' a film or television programme is a difficult skill to master, but Marter has managed it.

Nowhere do they tell us what a \\"theory\\" IS. Worse, even this \\"talk around the subject\\" approach is fuzzy. We are told that theory \\"applies to a BROAD range of phenomena and is applied to a SMALL aspect of nature\\" (my caps). In the process of describing theory, they diverge into the requirements for a hypothesis to be considered scientific. However, they don't define hypothesis either. Perhaps they define it elsewhere (I doubt it), but the reader has no way of determining this, because there is no index. The rest of the book's sections are similarly vaguely written.

It is astounding to me to read that \\"none in the group has had any formal musical training. \\"We learned music Hawaiian style\\" -- from relatives at first then mostly self-taught. All three musicians are in their early twenties and at the begining of a musical career which continues more than thirty years after this album's release. Mr Dennis Pavao displays impressive vocal control on these songs, especially E LILIU E. Mr Nedward Kaapana plays a frimly planted bass in support of his twin brother, the now legendary Ledward Kaapana.

As such, I give it extra time over a lower heat to get the whole griddle hot. It does conduct heat nicely but is worth noting that if you put the griddle on, turn the heat to medium high and pour on the batter, you'll have a hot spot in the middle until the rest of the pan catches up. Instead take it slower and don't go above medium heat and I think you'll get better results and probably a longer lasting griddle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warped Griddle","review":"I purchased this griddle In August of 2006 and use it every Sunday.

Not because of any financial rewards, but just because she knows she gave us this, an amazing body of literature that will always be there.This book and IF MORNING EVER COMES have a special charm for me because they bring back memories of my own childhood.

I was not disappointed. The book was originally written in 1977, which is a good thing as many of the principals were still alive. Their memories are a big part of the story, including all the conflicting memories that add spice. The author has a chapter on each aspect of the movie, including the munchkins with accounts of many of the 100 midgets used in the film. There is plenty of background on the major figures. The whole book is very enjoyable and is highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I ordered this product and it didn't have anyway to hang it up in our tree. The part that was suppose to get attached to the hook wasn't even there. The ropes came apart also and even if all the parts were there we couldn't of used it. The wooden arms were all sticky and paper stuck to them while shipping. We called customer service and they said they would send another one if I wanted. I decided to try another one and that one was in worst shape then the first one. The poorest quality of wood finish and the rope fell apart again. I called again and they gave me my money back which was the only good thing about ordering from Amazon! Thank you Amazon but beware, don't order these chairs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It fell apart","review":"After about a week the chair fell apart while adjusting the ropes on the top wooden dowl (per the instructions). Fortunately, I wasn't sitting in the chair. The wooden dowl near the top of the chair fell and bruised my hand. Above the wooden dowl the ropes from the chair and the ropes from the S hook connects - the ropes are intertwined but that connection doesn't hold. The chair as advertised is designed to hold at least 200 lbs. I'm well under at 130 so it wasn't the weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hammock chair","review":"Have not been able to use, the adjustment straps slip and you cannot sit in the chair.

The wood and rope portions were very poorly manufactured. The packing material stuck to the polyurethane finish, some portions of the finish had no stain at all. The ropes were hazardous to use. When assembled and hung, the first person to use hit the floor when the permanently attached (factory assembled) rope separated, allowing the person to hit the floor. Rope was uable to be reused. Foot rest ropes were too short for application and could not be used. I returned both and am still waiting for refund for second chair (over four weeks). I would not recommend these, since I was just lucky that no one was injured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Ropes do not lock in place, adjusting is almost impossible. Foot rest rope is too short. Didn't buy the stand in time to be able to return the chair, now I'm stuck with it. Wish I would have spent the extra money and bought the Airchair outback lounger. My friend has that one and will have to see if we can modify the bars/ropes on this one to make it usable/adjustable.Don't waste your money on the Nami Chair!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic - This is a classic!","review":"This new book by Michael Lutin has my highest applaud. This book has a wide range of audiences, from the person mildly interested in astrology and their \\"sun sign\\" to the experienced astrologer hanging on every word and thought by Michael Lutin, who brings his witty and deep perspective to another classic.

I rarely return books, but after reading some of this book I couldn't continue because, try as I might, I couldn't relate to the majority of what I read. The author holds zealously negative views of people, it seems. I am very introspective, feel confident admitting my faults and make a life's work of searching for how to be a better person, including learning of more faults. I was born on the cusp, gemini/cancer, but am gemini. The description of gemini was so off the mark that I read cancer, but was almost as disappointed. As I continued reading specifics for birth year under each sign I gave up. It seems this author confidently sees the world as a place chock full of extremely problemed people with little going for them (or at least all geminis and cancers). Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guy, Great material","review":"Michael's doing what most Astrologers have to (and should) struggle to do with their work - find a way to relate the cosmic-ness of it all, to mundane things...like people.The Nodes of our charts are left behind by many Astrologers but I make a habit of using these deeply in my own Readings at NewWorldAstrology and Michael does a fantastic job here.

I bought it because the price was great and it was made of sturdy plastic. But the chair legs are too long and get more narrow at the bottom. My son was constantly tipping the chair over and hurting himself. It is a very sturdy set but I wanted something he could use now and ended up returning the set."},{"rating":"2","title":"So happy we bought this set!","review":"We purchased this for our daughter when she was about 18 months old, like a lot of others because it matched the kitchen, and we have never had any problems with it. Never noticed a problem with the chairs tipping over. And it has been used everyday since we bought it. She can eat meals at it, it's lightweight and easy to move outside to use for messy craft projects. Our daughter is now 6 years old and very tall, we are all sad to realize it will be time to get rid of this item very soon. It really has held up well, cleans very easy, and still looks great.However, I don't remember how much we paid for this set when we bought it, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't $200.00 probably around $80 to $100.00. So the price suprises us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your MONEY!!","review":"I bought this set for my 20mth old son thinking it matched his toy box so well. I thought it would look cute and was a decent price. My advice - spend a bit more for wood. The chairs are TERRIBLE! They are top heavy so everytime my son went to sit in one, it would topple. He started to use the table as support, well that also is top heavy. He couldnt get in the chairs without help nor out of them without them falling over. We even tried weighting down with sand!! I am soo frustrated. Dot waste your time with sand. Does NOT make a big enough difference for me to even bothering dealing with it. It took us an hour to even 1/2 way fill one chair and the plugs underneath the chairs (thought they were there so people could weight the chairs) they are impossible to remove....I had this set exactly ONE day!! I am returning it tomorrow for a wooden set!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disappointed","review":"I am completely floored, so to speak, with the chairs that come with this table... and so are my 2 and 5 year olds because they always seem to end up on it!

I called Step 2 and they sent me 2 new chairs that they said were better designed. Not!!! When I called them back, they said to fill the chairs with sand! In my house?

Also, the legs of the chairs are completely vertical (up and down) and do not provide much stability further ensuring that your child will fall over. We have pretty much given up using the chairs altogether and have our toddler sit on a box of baby wipes instead. Even though this table set is cute, BUY SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous toy!","review":"We bought this to go along with the kitchen and it has caused so many accidents in our house. We tried it on the kitchen floor and then move it down to the playroom which is carpeted. The chairs are so light they tip -- add in a toddler's lack of balance or unrefined gross motor skills and there is an accident waiting to happen. I actually don't even let anyone play on them anymore.In addition, the set is poorly made. The piece of wood that holds the drawer in place broke off so that it no longer fits in. 2 legs have fallen off.I'm not sure what sort of plastic paint this has on it but every time I clean it, there is green all over the cleaning cloth. That can't be healthy. Especially for kids that are constantly mouthing things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chairs too high, toddler topples off constantly","review":"We bought this around Christmas time for our 18 mo. old.

He is over 2years now, 35 in. tall and today tipped over and almost hit his head on the fireplace (my fault it was too close, but still!) These chairs are just not stable.

I've read it several times, given copies away and then bought replacements. It's not particularly well written, nor is it badly written. The story is so-so. The main character is annoying. The few fights in it are under-described or only mentioned in passing. There are so many things NOT to like about this story. Yet somehow it stikes a chord in you as you read it.

Kawabata is a master at depicting loneliness and sadness. You can feelthe whiteness and the cold, cutting against your face and under your feet,and otherwise engulfing you as a whole.Against the freezing quiet background, the passion between the characters stands in stark contrast,while the inevitable outcome blends in perfectly.Seidensticker did an excellent job with thetranslation."},{"rating":"2","title":"majestic nostalgia","review":"Nobel Prize winner Yasunari Kawabata's best known novel paints the human condition and the Japanese landscape in mournful hues as he constructs this tragically beautiful work. The story follows Shimamura, a Tokyo diletante, and his trips to the snow country as he searches for himself in the landscape and in his affair with a enchanting and tragic geisha, Komako.It is in the subtlety of the narrative and lushness of description that Kawabata stands out from other Japanese authors such as Oe and Endo. The reader is softly, lightly, wisked along through the novel, as if a drifting snowflake, and more absorbs than directly obtains the meaning of this fantasitic novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Mediocre Work","review":"Snow Country is about a man who takes regular trips away from the city & goes to a little town in the \\"snow country\\" in northern Japan to have sexual affairs with the local geisha. On one of his trips, he sees a young woman & becomes attracted to her. The book has some beautiful imagry that makes me see the sights, hear the sounds & smell the smells of the snow country. But the book just doesn't have the ability to really draw me in to the character's lives. Instead of fascination, I'm only mildly interested. While the sensual imagry is beautiful, it's not masterful, as in a work like People In The Summer Night. I've read another work by this author, Thousand Cranes, and enjoyed it much more. I was really drawn into the world of the characters in that novel, but not here. Overall, I felt that this book, for the author & classic Japanese literature as well, was a letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow Country","review":"In spite of all the professional reviews singing the praises of this book I found it difficult to read. The characters are tragic individuals caught up in a state of existance that is pathetic at best. Yasunari Kawabata uses a mirroring technique in the dialogue between the two protagonists that dulled my senses. For example, \\"I am going out\\". \\"You are leaving\\"? This is often followed by a paradoxical response, \\"No, I am staying\\". This was most difficult for me to appreciate.Kawabata does a wonderful job describing various nuances of life in the mountains and the life of one Geisha. He makes the scenery tangible and the people visible to the readers eye.I had to make a commitment to the book in order to read it through to completion; and, by the time I was finished, I was depressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apathetic","review":"I didn't really care about the characters nor the love story. The implied passion was just that, more implied than revealed through the actions of the characters.

Just a heads up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, dull, dull......","review":"Ok, being fluent in Japanese and familiar with Japanese culture, I can see how this book (and style of writing) may be considered \\"of literary significance\\" in Japanese. Rendered in English, it is simply dull. For students of Japanese literature and writing styles, it may be worth \\"research\\" or \\"study\\" time, but it is not something the average English reader would pick up for entertainment value. The premise of the book seems to be based on \\"painting\\" the atomosphere around the characters, in all the drawn-out details. In Japanese, there would probably be a lot more significance in the descriptions and words, simply due to the underlying subleties of the language. However, in English, it's simply boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible","review":"I'm being generous with the one star rating.

He is able to bring readers to tears and emotional highs with exquisite composition of words. Snow Country is a sad story of wasted emotions and inescapable lives, and Kawabata's writing fits perfectly with the gloomy moods of the plot. The snow, mountains, indoor furnitures, clothes, sounds,and facial description of characters are so brilliantly written that it leaves the readers in awe. Kawabata, whose lyricism is so vivid and exquisite, can only be paralleled by F.

It was just him and his guitar, and I was moved to actually buy Dusk and Summer. Where have I been? This man can not only play and sing, but the lyrics he writes are so different, moving, reflective, intoxicating, and sad. I haven't had the chance to listen all the way through but I can tell that I will be buying more of his music. I bought it for \\"Stolen\\" but \\"So Long, So Long\\" has quickly become my favorite. It is very bittersweet, as most of his songs are.This is a new fan that would recommend getting this.

We thought these girls were amazing! There was nothing else like them!

But if you're buying the anniversary edition for the extra disc of outakes and live recordings, think again. Disc 2 contains 21 tracks, most of which are excerpts from the original album that are played in the BACKGROUND while McCartney and others talk over the top. 3 complete live tracks are included, but they are from the 1989 and 1993 tours. The one live recording from 1975 is a 55 second excerpt of Bluebird with unbelievably terrible sound-quality. Need a copy of Band On The Run? Then buy it.

I have to buy the 2 or 3 disc version to get that on one of the extra discs. It's on my old vinyl version. wtf? Thanks for nothing, Paul, thanks a lot...OK, and for those getting on my case about not reading the listing online: I saw it in a store (remember those?), grabbed it, bought it, played it, not even thinking the record company had screwed around with it.

It is all but impossible to get off without ruining both the card and back cover. And it is necessary will to take it off because it's flimsily secured only in the centre and flaps around and gets caught in everything. My card tore, and the back cover cloth is all stretched from trying to remove the glue, most of which stubbornly remains on there and looks terrible.Collectors beware!As for the audio content, there are no unreleased tracks, aside from the One Hand Clapping material. And the recycling of the fairly pointless 'documentary CD' from the 25th Anniversary release is an insult to McCartney fans.Granted, the remastering, book itself, and polaroid 'outtakes' are great, but let's hope we get something more interesting in the way of unreleased and exclusive material when it comes to reissuing the rest of the catalogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, but get the two cd 1 dvd","review":"Get the two cd 1 dvd unless an extra cd of interviewing to you is worth an extra 40$ on here I highly suggest getting the 2 two cd edition.

As for the music; 'Helen Wheels' is a good rock tune that was a top-ten hit, the title track and 'Jet' are just great songs period, and McCartney continues to push himself artistically with the cubist-styled 'Picasso's Last Words'. Paul even plays most of the instruments on here, including drums.

The most mature album he had been a part of since 1969's Abbey Road, Paul, along with phenomenal rhythm guitarist Denny Laine, and wife Linda released a powerhouse album that showed why Paul was and is a driving force in music. The album lacked his usual goofbally lyrics which would flood London Town and Back To The Egg. He produces his own \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" on a smaller scale with the title track, a great rocker in \\"Jet,\\" and beats John Lennon at his own game with the minimal, but wonderful, \\"Let Me Roll It\\" Worth buying even if you are not that fond of McCartney's material!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice set, but one suggestion for the upcoming McCartney reissues","review":"All in all, this 2CD/1DVD set is a very nice reissue of Band On The Run (the 5th time I've bought BOTR!). I didn't expect dramatically improved sound since it's has been remastered so many times before, and found that to be the case. The \\"One Hand Clapping\\" bonus tracks and video are nice to have.Just one suggestion for the upcoming titles in the Paul McCartney Archive Collection: removable booklets. It's ergonomically challenging to read a CD booklet attached to a multi-fold CD cardboard case (three panels being open is the minimum in order to be able to read the booklet).I'm looking forward to upcoming titles in the series and hope that it continues til completion."},{"rating":"2","title":"collective set","review":"this collective set comes with 2 CD. some of the songs in this set are band on the run, bluebird, no words let me roll it plus more. the sound is great what you would expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome re-release","review":"I have loved the BAND ON THE RUN recording since I received a copy on 8 track...

I purchased this album after hearing a few samples and knowing it was from Paul McCartney, but other than that I knew nothing about this album. I was blown away -- musical genius. McCartney is so talented and this album showcases that so well. The Beatles were the greatest band of all time, but each of those band members went on to have an incredibly amazing solo acts. This is definitely a great album, and totally worth the $4.99 that I spent on amazon.com. There is a deluxe version on itunes but much pricer. For the price on amazon you really can't complain; I mean, seriously, Paul McCartney album for $4.99 - awesome.

It is a pricey set but as I said worth while"},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars, but not because of the bonus CD","review":"Five stars is what Band on the run deserves, it's obvious. But what about this special package ? Well, the original album sounds a little bit better than the original CD release, it's been well remastered. So if you don't have Band on the run on CD, you must get this package, which isn't more expensive than the \\"normal\\" edition. But if you already have the old CD release, buy this package only if you're a McCartney completist like me. Because CD 2 is not \\"full of unreleased material\\". It's just interviews, which are interesting but that you won't listen a hundred times, and the few unreleased songs are 1989 or 1993 rehearsals, or recent and short acoustic recordings. There isn't a single outtake from the actual recording of the album. Too bad !

The CD is clean so it can't be just my machine. I also agree with the other reviewer who mentioned that the first few seconds are cut off so that the first song starts mid-measure of the song. It's kind of annoying for something which is supposed to be the be-all-end-all of audio technology.

Disc 2 would be a fine one-off radio program, but doesn't stand up to repeated listenings, and was misleadingly pre-promoted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Band on the Run (Archive Collection)","review":"Brilliantly packaged and first class, the order arrived ahead of schedule and also an email saying the other part of my order would be shipped seperatley but without an additional shipping cost.

I recommmend this book for biscuit enthusiasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biscuit Bliss","review":"I really like this book. It's interesting reading, very informative, and the recipe I tried, \\"Mother's Buttermilk Biscuits\\" were the best I've ever made. I have paper bookmarks stuck in all of the recipes that I want to try, including his sisters' 7-Up Biscuits.He includes a lot of very good tips as well, and I am learning a lot. I followed his tips instead of doing things in my usual manner, and I'm going to continue with his methods. I can highly recommend \\"Biscuit Bliss.\\" He knows his biscuits."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoughtful analysis of the common ground","review":"An impressive body of work by John W. Riggs (Associate Professor of Historical Theology and Church History at Eden Theological Seminary, St. Louis, Missouri), Postmodern Christianity: Doing Theology In The Contemporary World offers the proposition that postmodernism and Christianity both have much to offer one another, and should scrutinize one another while avoiding complete acceptance or rejection. A thoughtful analysis of the common ground between philosophy and theology, Postmodern Christianity is a timely and welcome addition to Christian Theological Studies reference collections and personal reading lists."},{"rating":"2","title":"STILL A FINE ALBUM","review":"No, this album might not rank with her real classic ones, but it still doesn't make it a bad one. Very relaxing, very serene, Barbra sounds wonderful - even with the fallback of \\"age\\". I don't recall when she hasn't sound so unforced. I also and warmly recommend to get the single that includes 2 songs that were not included on the album. They are in the same vein, and though if included in the album would have made it too long. Still Streisand fans have to hear everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"OKay","review":"First I'll comment on the cover (no one has), which finally is quite good since Streisand cover albums vary in quality. As for the album itself, I definitely like it, though it doesn't contain the great material that elevates Streisand to the stars. The plus side, is that Barbra sounds good, relaxed, a lady who knows to do the job. The production is also Ok, and doesn't drown her voice away, and it's good to see her return to singing Gershwin & Legrand. She sings to us and it's simple. On the negative side, a bit more fire could be used in the selection of the songs. Still when she sings Broadway material, it's like the 4th of July - fireworks and all and you cannot not listen to her. Here she is more appropiately laid back, but missing is something to turn the album into a classic. It remains as a good and truthful effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"She still has it!","review":"This is an absolutely beautifully done album from start to finish....You can really sit down and just relax and listen to a voice that has gotten better from year to year( if that's possible). One of Barbra's best albums to date...."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN...","review":"Love Streisand's voice, but in general, the production on this disc is overblown. Even the duet with Vince Gill (who has a great voice) is bland and not worth much. \\"We Must Be Loving Right\\" sounds good until you hear George Strait's original. Hope the next disc is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't it a pity?","review":"Barbra Streisand has truly lost touch of her audience and her talent on this one. Always a superior selector of songs, here Streisand fails miserably. While her singing is still top-notch, this set comes off sappy, dull and frankly quite boring. The only standouts on this album \\"The Music That Makes Me Dance\\" and \\"Isn't It a Pity?\\" get lost in a mish-mash of bland, contemporary \\"songs\\" utterly incompatible with her astounding talent. After 20 years of loyal following, this fan has been lead astray with this album. This is the worst Streisand album in two decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, As Always","review":"I've been reading reviews both pro and con for this album. I cannot imagine giving this beautiful album a bad review. There may be songs that don't meet your \\"Streisand\\" standards, but they are rare. Her duet with Vince Gill is wonderful, their voices blend together perfectly. People are always accusing her of being self-glorifying, and self-indulgent, what great artist isn't to a certain degree? She recorded a collection of songs that reflect how she is feeling at this moment, very much in love. There are thousands of people out there who are very much in love, or once were, or wish they were....and this CD fits the bill. To a true Streisand fan she rarely does anything wrong, maybe Jingle Bells on her Christmas album. Buy this CD, you will love it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is music?","review":"If you think this is music then you need to check yourself directly into the smackdown hotel.Sappy love songs... how original.She sounds like every other worn out singer who couldn't come up with anything new to say. What is she 80? At least.This album could have been put together in days easy.Yet this woman has popularity through out the decades.How? Why? when this century is over people will talk about the greats... Nirvana,Black Sabbath,The Beatles,Aerosmith,N.W.A.,Weird Al Yankovich not this fossil."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Single Star","review":"This is the very prototype of the CD that the 1 star rating was made for. Streisand fans like to tar and feather anyone who does not worship the ground that she walks on. However, I think that the woman herself has done more than enough ground worshipping for all of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"SEEK THERAPY ELSEWHERE; JUST SING","review":"Once, a good number of years ago, Barbra could bring to a song emotion without making it melodramatic or phony. I regret that I have lived to see her become such a bad parody of herself. My fear is that she is more \\"dramatic\\" and \\"emotive\\" to mask the simple fact that her once superlative gift has faded after a forty year career. She needs to stop recording and explore other avenues of expression. I, for one, will not continue to purchase her CDs only to be once again sadly disappointed. Since this material and her interpretation of it is not what it once was, I will remain content listening to the classic Barbra: \\"The Way We Were\\" and the other late 60s and early 70s albums, when her gift was truly amazing. This new CD is an embarrassment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Obnoxious Diva Of All.","review":"A sad release here. Miss Streisand keeps putting her life on display for us. I, for one, could not care less about what she thinks, what she does, and who she does it with. I realize there are thousands of people who hang on every word and action of this woman and are happy to spend lots of money on her. Not me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"give this album a cup of coffee","review":"Barbra you're happy in love and need I say it boring?? Buttah believe you could take a lesson from the woman who sings \\"believe\\". \\"Snap out of it!\\" As my wife said who wants to hear about a 57 yr olds boyfriend?"},{"rating":"1","title":"She's ok but she's no Celine","review":"I like the song with Celine the best. Celine really pulled it off. Babs is getting golder and it shows it her voice. Celine has surpassed Bab's vocal short-comings, but Babs hums real nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad she's in love, but weak songs make for a boring outing.","review":"Other than \\"Just One Lifetime,\\" \\"The Music That Makes Me Dance\\" and \\"Isn't It a Pity,\\" the songs are sub-par and boring. Barbra's voice is still the 8th Wonder of the world, but this is an album she should have just given to her hubby and close friends or family members."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm So Glad You're Happy Barbra","review":"One of the most overrated performers of our time becomes happily married. Good for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbra is back and all's right with the world!","review":"The voice is still the most majestic of all, even better than one would expect. How this lady can thrill with an instument made for the ages. She is a one-of-a kind entertainer and this latest Cd proves without a doubt that Barbra is in peak form. Incandescent, shimmering, sensual songs from the premiere voice of the century. Anyone truly concerned with the stae of popular singers today should listen to what Barbra does in the first verse of \\"It Must Be You\\"...simple, straightforward and right to the heart. Stunning!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bland, boring,barbra! what happened higher ground was great!","review":"babs whats up with all the great song writers and arrangers,why do you continue to sing songs that sound like they are from bad love movies written by some that should have retired<TheBergmans>. the lack of sales should give you a hint. the worst part is that we may have a live version of this from the new years eve concert.i hope you find some new music before them,and please leave james at home!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much \\"voice\\", not enough background music!","review":"Her voice is in-your-face and all you can hear, no soothing background music. The volume also fluctuates too much. Although I have been a fan for several years, this is a big disappointment and I turned it off after a few of the songs (that all sounded alike)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major gag-a-thon","review":"This has to be one of the most gag inducing albums I think I have ever heard - certainly in recent memory. Why Babs seems to think the rest of the world cares about her and James Brolin being in love (although it is clear this two deserve each other) is merely proof as to how out of touch she is from reality. Does anyone else remember that horrid duet she sang with Don Johnson? Please. No more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"She's put out some good ones; this isn't one of em. That's just my humble opinion, but there just isn't anything new and at times the music seems so trite one would think it's Brittney Spears, not a talented artist like Ms. Streisand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I am not in any way trying to down Babs but you gotta like the slow, standard type of music in order to enjoy this and being a young person, this kinda slow music does not mix well with me. THe songs are nice love song but for people who appreciate older and/or standard type songs. THere are some nice vocals throughout though which shows that she still got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"the songs she loves","review":"It's a pleasure to listen to a singer who dares to sing the songs she likes! Besides If you ever leave me, one feels that the making of the album has not been restricted by commercial criteria. In A love like ours she is pure, deprived of marketing concessions and grandiose arrangements, and this is why her voice reminds us of her early recordings. Her voice sounds even better than in Higher Ground, probably because she has finally abandoned some of her highest notes. Her rendition has the quality of classics. Every word she sings carries a distinct taste, the taste of perfect diction . The actress is always there, behing the words, playing the role of each character. Her songs become scenes. And the listener is transported to the theatre of dreans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated collection that never surprises or inspires","review":"At this point in her career, Barbra Streisand can do whatever she pleases, and apparently, she pleases to record dreadfully outdated songs with lush string arrangements that will lull you right....to.....ZZZZZZZZ. No stretch here for Diva Streisand whose singing sounds about as exciting and entertaining as someone who has fallen in love one too many times and it's simply just another day."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst album ever.","review":"Barbara streisand should be arrested for the injustices she continues to do to eardrums worldwide. Never will the pain be erased that this recording caused me. If only she stopped while she was ahead, i.e. before she ever started singing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy, lazy, self-indulgent, \\"aren't I special\\" sap and tar.","review":"When Barbra started doing films or attempting happy patter on her albums, I often found myself saying \\"just shut up and sing\\". After listening to this CD, I find myself saying, \\"just shut up and go away\\". At least until you stop hiding behind film-score arrangements and lazy self-indulgent self-glorifying Hallmark cards you call music."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, she still sounds better than ANYBODY, EVER.","review":"But, and it's a big BUT, the song selection and arrangements will make you instantly diabetic. By the end of the second cut \\"Isn't It A Pity\\", a great, slightly-bluesy Gershwin song that I couldn't wait to hear Streisand's \\"take\\" on, I was already getting nauseous. It's all THAT sweet, destined to be a hit in dentist offices and elevators everywhere. ANY of Barbra's other albums (listen to \\"I Never Had It So Good\\" on LAZY AFTERNOON) have more interesting love songs than this collection. Sorry, Barbra, if this is what being married has done to you, you need a vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lazy, nasal, self-indulgent album of dull songs.","review":"After her last album, the beautiful 'Higher Ground', I was looking forward to Miss Streisand's new album. What a disappointment. We all know she's in love and happy, and that seems to be the whole self-indulgent point of this record. Its 12 songs all sound the same: big orchestra, lyrics about how special/wonderful/precious love is and the dullest, laziest delivery since her 'Till I Loved You' album. She could have knocked this off in her sleep.If you want to hear Babs singing this kind of thing with a bit of feeling do yourself a favour and get hold of 'Love Songs' (released as 'Memory' in the States).Personally I prefer her earlier material where you feel she really cared about what she was doing. To hear her belting out something with emotion and attitude listen to 'J'm appelle Barbra' from the sixties. Now there was a voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD must be a bust...","review":"Looks like there's no sample tracks to be heard here. It's either because Barbara is now *too* good to let folks first sample her music before buying or the music is *too* average. I suspect it is both factors at play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed - a nauseating CD and I LOVE Barbra","review":"I could not wait to buy this CD and cannot believe what a disappointment it is. Her voice does not seem as good as all her others and the \\"love\\" thing is overdone with horrible songs. The only decent song is the one she does with Vince Gill. I feel sorry for her if she ever has marriage problems as this CD will be a mockery. I am so disappointed........"},{"rating":"1","title":"The First Barbra Brolin CD!","review":"Barbra Brolin is no Barbra Streisand. She looks the same on the outside but she sounds a lot more boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Streisand at her best","review":"What can I say? Every song is as fascinating as the other. So far I like best \\"If you ever leave me\\" the gorgeous duett with Vince Gill, \\"The music that makes me dance\\", \\"Just one lifetime\\", Isn't it a pity\\" ... This is truly an amazing record and you don't want to miss it... believe me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbra: The Menopausal Album","review":"Being a fan of Barbra's for nearly 40 years, this is her first big stinker. Except for \\"The Music That Makes Me Dance\\" and \\"Just One Lifetime,\\" the songs and performances -- how can I say this -- SUCK! Her voice is incredible. Wish the album was up to her voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE \\"BESTest\\" EVER!","review":"I bought her cd three days ago, after months and months of desperation for not having found it in my country! This last album is simply wonderful... as all of hers! I congratulate her for so many years of love to her music and intensive work as well as the people who ever helped her grow as an artist and human being too. Her music and lyrics are all we need to fill our lives everyday and everynight (well.. at least mine) So I encourage the people who haven't listened to her... do it! You won't be disappointed! NO ONE can imagine how much I admire and adore this woman! BRAVO Barbra! //bstreisand@yahoo.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine album!","review":"No, She doesn't try anything new, but in a way Barbra has reinvented herself again on this album. Mainly because she sings so simply and straightforward that it just amazes you the beauty of that voice coming thru without any gimmicks. The production is rich and simple too. It is also Barbra very much being subtle in her interpertations. Maybe many of the songs are not important (except the classic old ones) but at the end of listening one cannot not be moved by this wonderful singer of ours. For other fans, try to get hold of the additional 2 songs not on the album: \\"Just because\\" & \\"Lets start right now\\" (when have Streisand fans been treated to additional material?!). This album is an unexpected treat in its direct approach and I very much recommend to buy it immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"She is in love, and it shows.","review":"Obviously, the reviews on here are from people who don't understand what it means to be in love. And this album shows her elegance and voice. In her 50's her voice blows away women many years younger. To hear the pleasure and joy in her voice is a nice change."},{"rating":"2","title":"A risky effort that realy pays off!","review":"I think that if this album had been heavily promoted, it would have been a big letdown to the general public.That said, I think this cd is a real gem! For those that are expecting torch songs or showtunes, this is NOT that kind of album.It is a collection of love songs...repeat, LOVE SONGS! It is very simple in its exocution, and is also a much more relaxed Streisand.That is where it stands apart from most other albums.One more thing, I don't think it's fair to expect the \\"brilliance\\" of \\"The Broadway Album\\" in every new cd she lets out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give the lady a break!","review":"She has done bad choices in the past,especially regarding her films and sometime selection of songs - but this time she recorded an album which suits her fine. It isn't even an egotrip that bars her judgement. Barbra returns her to the simple style that makes her unique. The production and arrangments are quite good and don't work against her. And the voice... even her worst enemies gotta admit that no one sings like Barbra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming songs from an overwhelming talent","review":"Tracks like \\"Isn't it a Pity?\\" and \\"The Music That Makes Me Dance\\" remind listeners that Streisand is among timeless talents such as Garland and Sinatra. Her duet with Vince Gill reminds us that the singer is more than capable of recognizing and aligning herself with talents/voices that stir passion and love from audiences. Why then, is this latest album one of the most disappointing in years? Clearly the voice is at once as radiant, powerful, and affecting as ever. Streisand has always fit more with generations just prior to her own. She began her career when songwriters still knew how to write songs that touched the heart and challenged the imagination. Why not return to those roots as artists like Tony Bennett have done with so much success and acclaim? Nothing would please fans more. On a personal note, may I suggest \\"Somewhere Out There\\" from \\"An American Tail,\\" as a duet with Mr. Bennett for the long-rumored Movie Album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bab&#65533;s Ballads to Brolin","review":"Ugh. Like eating a too sweet dessert, the lyrics of these songs make even a middle-aged romantic choke and blush. Love the voice, am definitely a fan (ADORED Higher Ground) but unless you're wanting cooing and gooing, you might just want to pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless boring cliche. I can't believe they released this.","review":"They need to take this one back to the drawing board. It's lacking in a big way. She sounds strained, bored, cloying. I went back and listened to some of her older songs and I just realized something. She sings with a cloying nasal cooing tone. Once you pick up on that it stands out like a sore thumb. And you realize she uses the same technique in every song. To achieve higher notes she nasalizes and tries to overly emote it, to disguise her inability to pull it off. But her little trick is unvieled. The next time you listen to her, you will see what I'm talking about, and she will annoy the heck out of you. Cut the nails and get with it Babas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ow Ow Ow. Please stop","review":"It is painful to even know this album exists.Her voice is a beautiful thing, but since about 1975, La Streisand has lost her sense of taste and proportion. Why do so many divas pick such bad songs, bad arrangements, bad vibes? Why? Why? This album makes Celine Dion seem discriminating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Our girl","review":"Went to her latest \\"concert\\" and let me tell you, save your money. It's not so much a concert as her own little political rally. You get to hear whats left of her voice in between her political diatribe and side show. Mindless socialist drivel. What Babs forgets is that she is the beneficiary of our democratic financial empire. But she defends and comforts the socialist leaders of the world. Funny Girl indeed.Let her go live in Cuba with the Dixie Chicks"},{"rating":"2","title":"'Sounds of Barbra'...wonderful!","review":"This is Barbra at her best! songs of love...to share with'us'and finally...this time for her! be happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunner!

Except for \\"Isn't it a Pity\\" (a standard) and \\"The Music That Makes Me Dance\\" (a B'way classic) there are NO memorable songs. Streisand is as smooth as ever, but an artist as powerful and discriminating as she should pick better material.

To be sure, this is no Broadway Album and even worse than Higher Ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Could Ask for Anything More...","review":"... to quote the great Ethel Merman. Barbra Streisand has created a beautiful, haunting album of love songs in \\"A Love Like Ours.\\" With a voice from God, Streisand sings some great songs and some good ones, and has NEVER SOUNDED BETTER! 5 STARS PLUS."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES, YES, YES!","review":"Barbra is in a class all of itself. The voice of hers cannot be compared to anyone and on this album she sounds absolutely wonderful. The lady actually sounds 37 instead of 57. The selection is really good, much better than the past, with orchestrations that put her voice first - and yes, let barbra sing live on her recordings since that is when she is at her best. This album is not becoming a #1 Billboard hit and fans should recommend this album since it is heartfelt, honest with a voice that soars thru the universe! She should honestly cut a Gershwin/Harold Arlen album of songs. Yes, it's been done thousands of times - but no one will sing them like Barbra. SHE SHOULD READ THIS AND NOT DREAM OF RETIRING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbra -- Well, you got three cuts right","review":"\\"Just One Lifetime\\" is an incredible vocal performance and an incredible song. \\"The Music That Makes Me Dance\\" is simply gorgeous. \\"Isn't It a Pity\\" is great.The rest all miss the mark. And trust me, it's hard for me to say this, as I own every album the woman has produced and nearly all of her obscure 45s.I don't know what the hell went wrong here -- it almost feels like sacrilege to say this -- the whole thing (other thant the previously mentoned three songs) leaves me totally cold.And I see that seems to be a very common reaction.I truly wish I loved \\"A Love Like Ours.\\" As it is, I just kind of, sort of like a triplet of the selections.Maybe she needs some new producer or someone with a better view (and track record) than sycophant Jay Landers. Get a strong exec producer, Babs."},{"rating":"2","title":"a beautiful, warm album","review":"this is a beautifully sung expression of love and feeling... earnest and heartfelt... one of streisand's best ever..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Love Like Ours is \\"The Best Thing She's Ever Done\\"","review":"Boring? Elevator Music? Dull? I don't know what Barbra Streisand album you're referring too. Maybe, WHAT ABOUT TODAY, but this album will keep the listener entertained from start to finish. However, one must under-stand the concept of \\"love\\" before they listen to this. I appreciated it being that I've had the pleasure of being in love with an extraordinary woman and understand Barbra's feelings towards her love. And that's not even the songs, yet!! The songs are perfect, and the album has definite consistancy, however, not a point of bordeom. There is a wonderful blend of new and old, soft and contemporary songs. \\"The Island\\", \\"If I Didn't Love You\\", \\"Just One Lifetime\\", \\"It Must Be You\\", \\"The Music that Makes Me Dance\\" and the fantastic duet with Vince Gill, \\"If You Ever Leave Me\\" are true highlights. It's an album of love songs for ALL time."},{"rating":"1","title":"She has no shame","review":"With this release, Striesand proves she has no shame. This would be hystericaly funny if it wasn't so scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Sounds Great!!","review":"To the people who don't like Barbra, or this CD, a few words: Listen to what makes you happy. To the rest of you, like me, who have loved that voice since the early 60's, I say, isn't it great that Barbra is sounding better than ever? I can't stop listening to this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quintessential Streisand","review":"Barbra Streisand, I have always maintained, is in possession of this century's greatest voice. She alone commands my greatest deference and admiration. This album, although it exposes Streisand's aging voice, never fails to impress and awe. While her voice is no longer as quick as it once was, it is still a crushing force in today's everchanging musical industry. Celine Dion? Whitney Houston? Mariah Carey? Please. Their voices pale by comparison. This album is both mollifying and awe-inspiring. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An instant classic from The Diva.","review":"Thank you, thank you, thank you. As a long time admirer who can still remember the very first time I heard that incredible voice back in 1968, I've been waiting for this a long time. An instant classic. A beautifully packaged album. Thanks Jim Brolin for inspiring this incomparable vocalist to record this album. I thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush,Romantic Settings!","review":"Streisand has really outdone herself with this one. Although it may seem to be a bit pushy as to her own life, the style that we have all been accustomed to with Barbra is there and then some. She truly has improved with age,(not that she hasn't always been great) but the settings for this album have truly captivated her vocal range in many,many ways.Sit back with the one you love,and a few cocktails,put this current release on,and you are sure to fall in love all over again!A real winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Subdued, relaxed and controlled. Magnificent production.","review":"At 57, Streisand once again proves she's got the best pipes in the business. Sure, she's lost some of her top notes, but those in the middle and lower register are just as crystal-clear as always. The material, for the most part, is worthy of her talent. There are a few less-than-steller selections, including \\"Just One Lifetime\\" and \\"If I Didn't Love You\\". \\"Isn't It A Pity\\", \\"The Island\\" and \\"The Music That Makes Me Dance\\" are as good as anything she's ever recorded. She's still the best there is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern reminder of Simply Streisand","review":"A wonderful collection of love songs performed by Barbra...Simply Barbra"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, man what crud!","review":"This album is probably one of the biggest wastes of money I ever spent! Streisand needs to get some advise on what to record. Her albums were once such a joy. Now, just pure junk!And the photos-- it made me want to puke-- almost more than her dedication of \\"Higher Ground\\" to Clinton's overbearing mother. Well, what do you expect from a clueless socialist?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Babs' ego trip","review":"She gets worse as she gets older..shrieking the songs at top volume should not be considered talent. All she needed to make this complete was a guest turn by her new best friend, Rosie O'Donnell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strewth!","review":"Well I am sorry to do this to you, but let's face it, this is an absolute load of tosh! The woman who's voice could break crystal has finally sold out to the big buck once and for all! This is easily one of the worst albums I have ever heard and a complete waste of my hard earned cash! I only gave it 1 star because there's no option to give it none. I have a lot of Streisand CD's in my collection and a number of vinyl albums from the good old days, but I think this wil be the last...I'll concentrate on the old stuff and singers who are still capable of keeping up with the times, like Diana Ross etc. Sorry Babs...not good enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbra, do something!","review":"Sorry to add a discordant note but isn't this album just a way to test just how gullible and stupid an audience can be? Not only is this a bad album, for Barbra it's positively shameful. It would be downright immoral for her to terminate her career on this one. Barbra, take some advice: Carole King is still alive, give her a call. For Barbra beginners I suggest the video recording of the 1990 concert in Vegas. There, she proves that she was one of the greatest American singers of the century."},{"rating":"1","title":"The butta has turned rancid","review":"When I heard this cd, I didn't know if I wanted to laugh or cry. This is an embarrassment. Her voice is gone. It has faded. when I listen to her old albums now and I compare them to Celine Dion's, I realize that she was never so good after all. Celine has a more powerful voice, more defining and more intoned, refined, and fine-tuned. B-a-r-b-a-r-a should retire.

Compare it to her young girl version on \\"Funny Girl - Original Broadway Cast Album\\" and you see how mature and refined her voice has become. All others <yawn>. Her voice is still spectacular but with much more verbrato than I ever noticed. You can tell she picked the songs for the \\"lyrics that describe her life with Jim\\" and didn't even think about the tune. You'll never be humming any of these tunes in your head. What tunes?

There is something different about her voice on this album! Being a Huge Barbra Fan and having every recording she has ever made, it just amazes me that she keeps topping herself! On this Album, she really lets loose and you can tell that she had fun creating this Album. The standouts on the album inlcude \\"I've Dreamed Of You\\", \\"If You Ever Leave Me\\" which is a duet with Vince Gill, \\"Just One Lifetime\\" and my favorite \\"It Must Be You\\", she really soars on this song and Barbra has never sounded better. To Sum it all up, Barbra has found Love and Happiness and it has seeped into her music. Thank You Mr. Brolin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll take an \\"overbearing...paean\\" like this anytime!","review":"As I listened to that beautiful voice singing with and from her heart, I couldn't help but recall the old Johnny Mathis ballads that inspired generations of young lovers. How refreshing it is to hear Ms. Streisnad bring out those same emotions in \\"boomers\\" so many years later. To me, there was nothing \\"overbearing\\" (as found by your reviewer) in her delivery, unless one considers honest emotion and warmth to be overbearing. I rejoiced in hearing a woman in her 50's celebrate in song the love and happiness she feels for her husband.

I'm in a diabetic coma","review":"Once again, Streisand turns in an album of sugary shlock, and her pundits can do nothing but sing its praises. Unbelievable! If this album had been released by any other artist, they would have been taken to task for recording a dull, tuneless album, devoid of character. It's elevator music, period. The songs are absolutely tuneless...no melodies to speak of whatsoever. Her duet with Vince Gill was inspired, but nothing else on the album catches spark. NO, no one wants Babs to be Britney Spears, and I'm not being critical of this work because it's not radio friendly. Babs has one of the best voices around....I just wish she'd start recording material worthy of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five stars?

The demands placed upon the actors, who must \\"interact\\" convincingly with characters and weaponry that isn't even there (added later by special effects artists and computer animators) is astounding. The reader gains a new appreciation for the genius of George Lucas and crew...as well as a hope that this won't REALLY be the last of this magnificent saga.

Screw the art galleries, take your work straight to the people! Many of your fans would delight in a different aspect of your phenomenal talent. But this serial recycling of the past must stop! The original albums are all superior to these collections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Released only for profit motives?","review":"(4 & 1/2 stars for the songs, 1 star for the concept) I can't think of any ARTISTIC reason for the existence of this collection, especially with so many of the songs on Joni's various other previous compilations, including the \\"Hits\\" and \\"Misses\\" CDs. Her recently released \\"Beginning of Survival\\" CD at least had an environmental theme to justify its existence. This new CD has no justification. I really love Ms. Mitchell's music - the Blue and Court & Spark albums are two of my all-time faves - so it's sad for me to see her be a part of a money-grubbing move like this.

Investigation found me articles outlining the disturbing errors in Tenney's interpretation.Please DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. Instead read your Bible (which Tenney, by the way, refers to as \\"old love letters\\" and the \\"old, moldy pages of what God has done\\").

It's better then what I had before which was a slide-show of my sister's newest litter of newborn Pug puppies in some sort of backyard pool with a Disney Tinkerbell motif which always seemed to depress me to no end. My god, Pugs are even ugly at birth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immitation of the wonderful Lean epic!","review":"There is no way anyone can compare this movie to the superb David Lean version, Lawrence of Arabia. If you're looking for the greatest film of all time, Lawrence of Arabia is it! It gives the viewer insight into Lawrence's personality as well as the history of the time. Ralph Fiennes is not a bad actor, but he has a tendency, both in this movie and in The English Patient, to immitate Peter O'Toole! By the way, I suggest you watch Lawrence of Arabia first and then The English Patient in order to see how much the David Lean epic has influenced modern movies. The English Patient is a rip-off of Lawrence of Arabia....the only thing that is original is the love story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Historically Accurate","review":"Being a student of TE Lawrence, I particularly enjoyed this movie about the Paris Peace Conference post WW I British-French handling of Arabia. Ralph Fiennes was wonderful in the role of Lawrence. His physical stance, body language, facial expressions and voice were as history describes TEL. This movie was subtle, sets and costumes historically accurate and famous figures very well cast. It would be of interest to history lovers, specifically of this era, even who knew nothing about the specific subject. However, knowing the facts probably does add to the appreciation of the movie. I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in TE Lawrence and/or the history of Arabia and the Middle East."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little research will help you","review":"This movie does not have the sweeping cinematography that \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" had, but this is still a good movie. The viewer will see what happened behind closed doors after Lawrence returned to Europe in an attempt to further the Arab independence cause.Fiennes is a great choice for T.E. Lawrence. His expressions speak volumes of all the things running through Lawrence's head as he tried to fight the agenda of France and Great Britain. In his interaction with his Arab counterpart, you see that he does not always share what he is thinking and that his fame is beginning to cause some trouble for him.Although a fine movie, you really need to know a bit about this time and the events to really understand it all. Mentioned in the movies is Lawrence's book \\"Seven Pillars of Wisdom,\\" which would be helpful.I would recommend watching this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read Seven Pillars of Wisdom","review":"The revolt in the desert was a sideshow of a sideshow, so it is said... But, what about the long term consequences of the Paris Peace conf. and the mistreatment of the Arabs. This excellent film explains the history of some of the roots in the middle crisis in the modern time. Excellent acting, and excellent story telling. Lean's popular story is good, this work is again excellent and more factual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb viewing","review":"This is an excellent film which gives the viewer a more intimate view of the enigmatic Lawrence than its predecessor \\"Lawrence of Arabia.\\" The acting and directing are first-class and the rapport between Lawrence (Ralph Fiennes) and Feisal (Siddig El Fadil) is wonderful to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent actings and realistic history","review":"As a student of Middle East history, I loved this movie. Lean's film was excellent as a movie, but its history was flawed and it gave Lawrence too much credit. Fiennes' portrayal is closer to the truth. As a fan of both Fiennes and Siddig, I loved the acting. I highly recommend this movie, but it helps if you are already familiar with the history of the Paris Peace Conference and of the Middle East during the early half of the century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice coffee table conversation piece","review":"Illustrations are very good representations of Bev Dolittle's most popular art. good for peaceful enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Clarelynn Roses's album Meadow Run is probably my favourite of her albums.

Beautiful stuff, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Top Ten CD of 2005 by New Age Reporter","review":"Named the number 7 CD for 2005 by New Age Reporter, Meadow Run brings you lots of pastoral beauty. You might not think a steel-string guitar could transmit the beauty, warmth and spirit of the natural world to you, but it does. The artist is a forester and -- again -- has translated her experiences in the woods into a musical trek through the woods everyone can enjoy.Mellow and invigorating all at once, this album is great for background music or intense listening.

As a huge fan of the Zombies, this CD has little or no relationship to the simple, yet amazing band from the 60's. Although we expect musicians and their music to evolve, this isn't the evolution I had hoped for. This CD gives off an overproduced impression with some of the songs sounding like out-takes from a Broadway show, while others are reminiscent of forgettable 80's pop. Unfortunately, I expected much more from these two musical icons, but this CD isn't it. Colin Blunstone's voice is still one of the best to ever grace a pop record and Rod Argent's talent requires no explanation, but that isn't enough. Maybe one day they can make a CD that's simple, leave the overbearing strings behind and get back to their brilliant rock roots. Maybe they could just re-record some of their best stuff from the 60's, but if it means they'll sound like this CD, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Remaster","review":"Downloaded it from Amazon..........

From \\"Children of the Future\\" through \\"Number 5\\", the Steve Miller Band made great music.The came a troubled period, followed by \\"The Joker\\". With this album, he set his sights on breaking the Top 40, and while he succeeded, it was hardly admirable work (not an uncommon tale among those who trade respect for profit).\\"Fly Like An Eagle\\" continues that pattern of pandering to the lowest common denominator - a pattern he seems determined to maintain.If you'd like to know what the man is actually capable of, I recommend \\"Sailor\\", \\"Brave New World\\", or \\"Your Saving Grace\\" (sadly, out-of-print)."},{"rating":"1","title":"somebody start a school for these idiot concert producers","review":"the DVD concert.

If you look at the bottom of it, you can see that the middle it a little bit higher than the rest of it. That means it will SPIN when you have it on the stove. This causes completely uneven cooking, and if you accidentally get water or other liquids on the bottom of the pan, they'll squirt out at you at random times when you're trying to stir. I had always heard Calphalon pans were fantastic, but this one was nothing but a huge disappointment.The handle design is also a big pain, since its impossible to pick up with one hand, but that's just preference.

I love the Pimsleur method of teaching and have used their French tapes with much success. However, the speakers on these Portuguese tapes sound bored, the vocabulary is extremely limited, and unfortunately, you are not at all ready to use the language as a traveler when done with these tapes. I would love to see Pimsleur do justice to continental Portuguese."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor value!","review":"The Pimsleur method itself is really quite good. I used the comprehensive Italian course and was quite pleased with my results. The problem with the \\"compact course\\" is that there really isn't enough \\"meat\\". By the end of this course I was quite comfortable asking \\" Do you speak Portuguese?\\" \\"Would you like something to eat?\\" and \\"Do you have escudos?\\" That, however is about the extent of the vocabulary one will pick up from this course. Really not worth 70 dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK lessons/terrible delivery service","review":"The lessons taught on these Pimsleur CD's are fine, but the delivery time was completely unacceptable. I will never buy any such item online again. Why would I? It took nearly 4 weeks to deliver an item I could have gone to Barnes and Noble and had (certainly similar) same day. This is the reason people are dissatisfied with online purchases. Service sucks...and when it is good the expectation is for a 5 star review. I am not a hard critic, but I do know what 5 star service is and it was not associated with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going to Mozambique","review":"I had 6 months to learn enough Portuguese before my trip to Mozambique, Africa. Pimsleur's program has given me a great beginning to the basics. My daughter (living in Africa) shares that my dialect is spot on. She is very impressed with how far I've come with no background in the language. I am on the last CD in the program with 5 months of time to absorb more. This finds me needing an intermediate to advanced program. This is the only short-coming I can find. I also found myself craving a workbook. However, I would recommend this for anyone who has not studied the language. The audio is extremely effective and really gets the dialect inside your head. They say speaking is 20 times more effective than reading. I think it is a positive that it has left me wanting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Limited Language Learning Tool","review":"I was mostly disappointed with this product. Over the course of 10 1/2-hour lessons on 5 CDs, you are drilled ad nauseam on a very few words and phrases, only a few of which were actually helpful when I traveled to Portugal. Amazingly, you only get to numbers higher than five after something like 6 lessons have gone by. Moreover, the pathetic \\"booklet\\" that accompanies the CD only offers 10 pages of words that the speaker reads on the CD and you just passively listen. That's it. Except for the plus that the repetition of the words and phrases did provide some benefit in preparing for my trip, there is little else to recommend here. I would suggest that someone wanting to learn basic Portuguese get something more substantial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Plug and Play External Drive","review":"This is a terrific device.

It's full of examples covering the whole stuff in DSP. However this is certainly not fur use as an introductory book because the aim is not the explanation of fundamental concepts in DSP (for that go to Lyons \\"Understanding Digital Signal Processing\\"). Maybe it is possible to learn DSP with this book but then as a companion of a good undergrad course, not for self-study.As stated by another reviewer, this book is over-crowded with developments, details and examples that could be overwhelming to the newcomer. This is probably its biggest drawback, in that its completeness hinders on its readability. So be aware that this is not an easy DSP book, it's THE DSP book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good for Self Study","review":"I am currently taking a first course in DSP where O&S is the text used. The text is just plain HELL to read. Explanations are often incomplete. I don't believe my professor had a choice in the selection because the other day he called in incoherent. I recently spoke to a second professor at UT who said he never uses it in his courses because he believes the authors are trying to impress their colleagues with the writing style.Specific topics covered so far in the course, which are mentioned, but NOT covered in the text: Closed form solution of Difference Equations, complex convolution theorem, unilateral Z-transform and their use in the solution of Difference Equations with non-zero initial conditions, and Contour Integration.I can see where some people use this as a reference, because there are many brief, accurate statements.

And the squirrels are happy again. Squirrels are too smart for me. I had one of those heavy metal feeders with a spring loaded arm that would close if there was too much weight.

It works with your feeder, and when you hang the feeder from it, turning it on will cause it to go through a calibration cycle to set the hanging weight. Supposedly, it will spin for 15 seconds when the weight goes up by about a pound, assuming there is a squirrel causing the weight increase. Oftentimes it will just spin on its own with nothing to trigger it. After the 15 seconds, it stops, then starts again, and continuing this cycle for no apparent reason. . When that happens, turning it off and back on will re-calibrate it for its current hanging weight, and it will work OK for a while. But before long, off it goes again. Seems to be OK until a squirrel gets on it again, and then the sensitivity makes it go berserk once more. I would NOT recommend this to anyone.

The tension that keeps these headphones on your ears and off your neck comrs from a thin piece of clear, easily breakable plastic, so don't get them if you can't treat them carefully or have a big head. For me, they rest on a hook above the ground.

Its even worse if your fingers are at all wet or sweaty.I first noticed this while placing a printed DVD back into its case. I thought the printer ink was the cause at first, perhaps some wort of reaction with the surface. However, after some experimentation with some unprinted DVDs, I have concluded that the print surface itself was to blame.If you're really careful, you may never have this problem.

Well....it's quite a possibility if too many more movies like the Green Hornet are made.The only redeeming feature of this movie is the portrayal of Cato by Jay Chou. One can get the sense that he was trying to stay true to the Cato in the 60's shows but Seth Rogen made it virtually impossible. Aside from Chou, the acting is horrible and the plot is so flipping predictable that the average child would get bored after an hour.Stay away from this movie if you have any respect for your brain cells!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is somewhat silly","review":"This film is a non-traditional version of the Green Hornet and is somewhat silly.

When his father dies, he pals up with his father's servant who made coffee for him, and decides to engage in even more difficult pranks, to become a better gangster than anyone else.

It was probably cool and exciting back in the days when a guy wearing a halloween ballroom mask was cool,m but like Superman, they cannot fly in this era.I would say pass on this all together. They had too many 1960's references from Kato's clothes, to the cars to the music although it was supposed to take place now. This movie sucked and the cahracter was not one that people wanted on film. Bruce Lee's The Green Hornet may be old, but at least you would want to see that because his career was cut short, and his superior skills. At least this film was funny.

Rogen pretty much brought his Pineapple express, Observe and report, and Zack and Miri characters and mashed them all into Britt Reid.That wasn't a good idea, since most, if not all comic book heroes don't throw F bombs into every other sentence. Comedy in a comic book hero is one thing, but it shouldn't be over the top.This is a PG-13 movie, but even that should be a strong 13 with all the vulgar language.

That's what makes him identifiable to the audience.But THIS \\"Green Hornet\\" actually ABANDONS Kato during a botched sting. He even yells out, \\"Every man for himself!\\"At that point, I knew I wasted money seeing this.It wouldn't be fair to compare Seth Rogen to either Gordon Jones (the movie matinee serial) or Van Williams (the '60's tv show), since a movie and actor should be taken on his own merits.But a cowardly, selfish \\"hero?\\"Forget it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE MOVIE","review":"The only good thing that I can say about this movie was that I rented it for $1 from RedBox, so I don't feel too bad about wasting money on it.

After watching this, I just couldn't get with it. From beginning to end, this character wasn't taken seriously, in fact, if it wasn't for the character of KATO and BLACK BEAUTY, I would have fallen to sleep on it long before the movie ended. I don't mind restructuring characters as long as there is a meaning and a purpose at the end. If THE GREEN HORNET was meant to be that bumbling, then a new actor should have been introduced. It would have made the movie more believeable and flow that much smoother. Using a known actor who has made a nice living off of being \\"the loveable, yet (and I use the word again) bumbling guy\\" kinda killed it for me and made the movie more of a financial waste of time and resources instead of bringing to life a character strong enough to warrant a sequel...I mean, a REAL sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP Green Hornet","review":"While the Green Hornet might have made it out alive by the skin of his teeth in this movie...in this viewer's world he died a horrible lingering death. The Green Hornet could have been an awesome movie if the characters had been given some respect. This was suppose to be a movie about a hero. Yet, not a single heroic action occurred in this film. Even Kato who was the highlight of this feature turned out to be no more than Rogen's glorified babysitter. And what the heck was Diaz doing in there?!!! The fact that they had an age reference for her \\"twilight\\" years just made it even worse.

Of late the trend has been to take tv shows or older movies and make them funny. Big mistake, Green Hornet was never meant to be funny. I am not saying that there weren't funny moments in the tv show because there was. Like when Bruce got stuffed in to the garbage can by one of the crazier villians on the show. Al films have this in them, some than others but this was atrocious. The only good thing was the car and that was blown out of proportion as well. Yes, I know there is no Bruce Lee around to fill in the gaps in this movies but even he couldn't have saved it.

This movie deserves to be lumped in with Joel Schumacher's atrocious Batman & Robin. After seeing the trailers I was looking forward to a superhero movie with a sense of humor featuring a guy I like, Seth Rogen. This Green Hornet tries to be Pineapple Express with Rogen reprising his role from that movie and Jay Chou in a non-stoned James Franco role. Jay Chou is easily the best thing in this disaster, and talented actors like Tom Wilkinson, Edward James Olmos, and Cameron Dias are completely wasted. Go watch Pineapple Express again and wait for the sequel to that much better movie. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS!

Anyone expecting to go to a movie called The Green Hornet starring Seth Rogen and expecting to see Christian Bale bellowing in a low-tone voice was/is delirious. Stop comparing it to Batman. Batman is what it is, it's redefining super heroes on the serious level, but that doesn't mean every super hero has to be Batman.This movie to me was absolutely hilarious. Seth Rogen, from my view, essentially played Tobias Funke(David Cross) from Arrested Development and somehow turned him into a semi-serious crime fighter.Bottom line is don't go to a movie with expectations unless you were a real serious fan to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Money","review":"Bad story, bad acting... even worse inputs of comedy.

The same tired \\"comedy\\" that he always gives us. Just image his character from pineapple express wearing a mask. Thats ALL this nonsense was, in the end. He turned the character into a complete joke, for his own twisted amusement.

Kato rocks hard and the Green Hornet will grow up. Hope there are 3 or 4 more and that Miss Diaz stays the course as an older, wiser, educated character with a wardrobe as beautiful and appropriate as, say, Audrey Hepburn in \\"Charade\\".

Unfortunately, this movie won't make you laugh, and will not endear you to the main characters. Seth Rogen plays his typical role of the loud, obnoxious, crude doofus. The only change in that role, this time around, is that this time he is also very wealthy. Does this qualify oneself to be a self-styled super-hero? Of course not. It's incredibly unrealistic and improbable, but that's the story that the script writers set up for us in this movie. Just as Batman or Spider-Man or Zorro movies would have failed as non-funny action-comedies, so, too, does this movie fail. Take a pass on this one.

The acting was decent and the 3D was pretty good (I had expected less than average 3D due to the fact that it was converted in post=production).

Yes, I laughed a few times but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with taking comic book heroes and converting them into jokes. And if you're going to do it, maybe a more anonymous hero(s) would work better. In fact, how about \\"Kick-Ass\\" which is much better? Anyway, this feature falls into familiar territory. Short fights with plenty of adversaries, long fights that should have ended with 1 punch (Kato & Hornet) and a ridiculous finale that defies any reality. The filmmakers obviously had a big budget and damn, I suspect they used every bit of it, but in the end, the film doesn't hold up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to like this movie!","review":"I went into watching this movie with an open mind. I wanted to like it. The movie started out alright, but as time went on, I got bored. I had to switch it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"too corny","review":"The green hornet radio brodcast from the 40's was very serrius comparred to this movie ,the tv serries was also better than the batman tv program with Adam West , both from the late 60\\"s .The movie I just watched that was released this year on dvd, starring Seth rogan was a joke ! and a huge dissapointment to green hornet fans every where , the only thing good about this movie was the action and the performance of Jay Chou as Kato !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth renting even for a dollar.","review":"Rented this title from Redbox and it was boring/unbelievable. I wonder who was the target audience, those new to the title or those who liked the 60's TV series. While the 60's TV series lacked any humor that I can remember this remake was goofy and not well done at that.It only cost me a dollar plus tax but the dollars add up to a good deal of waste. Revisiting my collection on DVD, LD and VHS/Beta is comparatively better and cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Green Goof Ball","review":"The Green Goof Ball. Sorry, but I'm one of those who didn't like the \\"idiot brother\\" can't walk and chew gum at the same time take on the Green Hornet. If they'd wanted an idiot for the role, they should have just gotten Will Ferrell, he's got that down pat. And the final scene shoot out at the newspaper - what was that? The total goof ball ending to the total goof ball superhero movie. There were a couple good laughs in it, but that's it. And speaking as a big Cameron Diaz fan, she just seemed lost in this film. I saw it at the discount theater for $1.50 so I guess it was worth that, but if they'd made it $2, I would have felt over charged. I collect DVDs and am presently closing in on 2500, this one won't be added to the collection tho."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a farce.","review":"For anyone that saw the original series or read the stories this movie will be a colossal let down. Seth Rogen basically turns the hero of the original story into an idiot of marginal intelligence capable only of using every cuss word in the book in virtually every sentence he utters. There is no sense of the good guys fighting and overcoming the bad guys and you're left with a bad taste in your mouth over the whole thing. The over the top and often inappropriate acting make this movie a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"amusing and light","review":"I am usually a pretty tough critic when it comes to film, but I like this movie because I take it for what it is intended. I don't think it deserves all these bad ratings. It's supposed to be pulp and it is, and was never meant to be the greatest movie ever made. What it does accomplish is a likeable jerk in Rogen, a worthy sidekick in Chou and a passable performance in a miscast Diaz. Everything else was basically a cameo for Franco, Almos and Wilkinson. Black Beauty is very cool, the gadgets are fun, and for a family full of boys it is good amusement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzz","review":"I'll admit up front - I could not get through this movie. If it got better, I will never know, but 1 hour into it, I felt my life slipping away and simply could not continue. I was watching this movie with my friend and even he didn't want to finish watching it and he can watch paint dry!! Now I love all the Marvel movies. I am a adult woman and get teased all the time that I prefer to go see Thor and X-Men to romantic movies. Give me a good graphic novel and I'm happy. But this movie was dull, boring and irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Hornet can't deliver any sting","review":"- Only the first 15 minutes are funny. The rest of the film is not. It's also boring.- The special effect is so so.- The acting is not engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, but Rogen fails","review":"I admit I had doubts going in to this movie, I mean Seth Rogen as a super hero?? I gave it the good ol' college try and went in with an open mind. First, it couldn't make up it's mind. Rogen tried to be a playboy/comedian/action hero/serious leading man and failed miserably at all three. He wasn't funny and couldn't remain in one type of character for any length of time. I couldn't take him seriously as an action hero as he simply doesn't act or look the part. If he was serious the entire movie and acted like a bad a$$ then it may have been better.Chou plays Kato and he is pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of the slow-mo fight scenes but he did a great job being funny/bad-A during the film and I hope to see him in other films. I would say with a different actor playing the green hornet it would have been a much better movie overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bug Spray Anyone?","review":"If you happen to hear the sound of a high pitched whistle just as you're about to hit your DVD play button be forewarned. A bomb is about to explode on the television screen. This bomb I'm speaking of can be more easily identified under the alias 'The Green Hornet'. Yes, this film IS that bad! Who would have ever thought someone would portray a superhero in such an unlikeable fashion that the audience would absolutely hate him? I wouldn't have thought it possible but then what do I know.Obviously something went horribly wrong during production. They didn't know whether they should play it straight or go with a comedy touch. The end result was neither. A word to Seth Rogen (aka: Green Hornet). Seth, green is not your color and if you ever don that mask again you may be forced to defend yourself off the screen as well as on it. As for the Hornet's trusted partner Kato (Jay Chou), he was the only redeeming part of the film. Thanks for trying your best to save this dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"For a film that cost over $100 million to make it was awful,half the money must have gone into the vehicles in the movie as that the only good thing about it!!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really poorly done!","review":"Sounds like it would be good fun!This was just pathetic, slow paced, not not funny, bad actingand just a waste of time. The entire family felt the same way.It just was so poorly written and directed, that even if these actorswere great, they could not save it!Rent something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Green Honet Movie, thumbs down","review":"I watched the Green Hornet TV series that was on TV in the 1960's; I thought maybe the movie would be decent. How wrong I was. If the producers of the movie were going for a young Will Ferrell then they cast the right actor, but he was incredibly cheesy. The movie was hard to watch, it was disjointed, horrible acting on most of the actors parts. Van Williams and Bruce Lee still are the Green Hornet and his side kick. I'm glad I only spent $3.99 to rent the movie and didn't waste more money at the box office. My thanks to Van Williams and Bruce Lee for great entertainment, and ones my kids are still watching today. They both thought the TV series better than the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, lame, lame.","review":"Granted, I accidentally rented this movie because I'd been wanting see \\"The Green Lantern\\" and confused the two titles, but.. I really didn't like this movie. It contained: crass jokes, a lot of swearing, suggestive content, childish mindsets, a plot that seems as if it were written by a little kid, and action sequences that leave you saying, \\"What was that?!\\" Of course, this is all just opinion, but I was disappointed in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"More cheesy than the 60's Batman TV Show","review":"In the 60's the Batman TV show was cheesy, and The Green Hornet tv show was a bit dark and serious. Flash Forward to today; the current crop of Batman movies are dark and serious, while the Green Hornet movie (and I hear they are making another one) are cheesy. In fact, this movie is more cheesy than the 60's Batman tv show!There are only three things I like about this movie: Leonre Chase can kick ass unlike she did in the Green Hornet TV show; the Black Beauty is very cool; and the end credits were great! Particularly, the animated Green Hornet and Black Beauty!If you like cheesy movies, this is for you! If you want a serious Green Hornet, watch the old TV show!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a violent joke?","review":"Special effects do not a movie make. There were two TV series, both better than this bomb! Having the hornet make constant racial slurs at Kato is uncalled for. The was never a split between Kato and the hornet until this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"POINTLESS","review":"The only good thing about this movie is that it is so lame, there could not possibly be a sequel. On the other hand, if you enjoy Rogen's constant mumbling of wisecracks, this is the film for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected.","review":"When I saw this one, I really didn't expect much. But I found this movie wonderfully strange. Yes the casting of Seth Rogan was unusual, but the script made this work. It was exciting and funny. I can understand why some people didn't care for it (my wife fell asleep), but my son and I had an enjoyable evening at the movies. Great this is not. But it is an enjoyable film diversion which I expect to watch again."},{"rating":"1","title":"a poor effort","review":"A total waste of time. The movie is very poor and is a constant disorganized jumble of hard to describe what."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Dialog","review":"This action packed movie, was completely ruined with crappy dialog. It was painful to watch and in fact I skipped chapters because I could not bear to hear the pedestrian dialog. I would be amazed if the writers have a collective IQ above room temperature, because they couldn't find two SAT words to rub together.Cameron Diaz is well on her way to finding her movies in the direct-to-video category. It's unfortunate but true that the dialog writing was not on par with the action of this film."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},R=["disabled"],M={key:0},x={key:1};function N(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(o(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(o(),b(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",x,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,R)):p("",!0)])}const H=d(C,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-15e01733"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/30.md","filePath":"glossary/30.md"}'),W={name:"glossary/30.md"},G=Object.assign(W,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
