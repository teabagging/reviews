The songs on Last Mango are the songs countless generation X Parrotheads grew up on. My parents love to this. My grandparents love this. Someday I hope my children will love this. His songs transcend time barriers like no other music can. I was dancing to this stuff at live concerts when I was four years old and I haven't gotten over it yet!

Caribbean rhythms, a couple of ballads, and song titles that cleverly twist a familiar saying. Last Mango In Paris provides all of these ingredients. You end up with a good recording, although not one of Buffett's best works. The title track and \\"If The Phone Doesn't Ring, It's Me\\" are perfect examples of how Buffett can turn a phrase into a song lyric.I've been listening to Buffett and the Coral Reefer Band for almost 25 years now, and the reason is simple: no matter where I am, no matter what the weather, I can throw on a Jimmy Buffett CD and instantly be transported to a beach somewhere on an island, complete with warm summer breezes, cold beer, free from all worries. And in the end, what more can you ask from a record?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I adore this album, and it potentially is my favorite Jimmy Buffett work. I know alot of Buffett purists tend not to like it much, but I find this is be among the best.The interlinking of this album to the previous Riddles In The Sand through La Vie De Sant, and Frank and Lola is great. It has alot of just fun music included like Desperation Samba and Gypsies In The Palace, and also wonderfully reflective songs like Last Mango In Paris.Admittedly I am a child of the 80's so maybe that warps my music taste, but this is a great one in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not one of JB's best","review":"I am a huge Jimmy Buffett fan and I love just about all of his albums, this is not one of them.

I'll grant you it is cool when a company takes the old master tapes that were originally recorded in stereo but released back then in mono, and lets us here them for the first time in stereo.Also, despite 21 songs, there are many hits missing such as \\"All of the Sudden, My Heart Sings\\", \\"Having my Baby\\", \\"The Times of Your Life\\", \\"I Believe there's Nothing Stronger than Our Love\\", on and on and on.I'd recommend buying a cd with the originals and then supplementing any other desired pieces with the Amazon music downloader."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the big stars of the 50's","review":"While Paul Anka never looked like he could be a rock and roll idol he certainly had a huge career in the 50's.

Most of the tracks on the second and third CDs are repeats of tracks on the first CD. Only six tracks on CD2 are not on CD1, and only three tracks on CD3 are not on CD1. Most of the transfers are decent, though some are from vinyl and are not cleaned up (or not cleaned up well). The Mindbenders' superb \\"My New Day and Age,\\" for example, suffers from a few ticks and pops that easily could have been removed. There also is no licensing information, nor are there liner notes.

If I install it with the mirror up above the handle bar, my arm end up covering most of the rear. If I install it below the handle bar, it's too far from my eyes, which ends up creating a split image of the rear. Also, in either configuration, I have to focus my sight at the mirror to clearly make out what's behind me. The only configuration I have not try installing it is at the end of my handle bar, on top of my rubber grip and I wasn't going to do that (looks ugly). I ended up buying the \\"Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bicycle Mirror\\" and use that instead. I really like the Mirrycle that I end up buying a second one for my other bike. Don't waste your money on this mirror and spend a few dollar more for a better mirror, you'll be glad that you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sunlite Bicycle Mirror","review":"It does not hold position on the handlebar.

The handlebars must be turned to sweep and get a full rear view which is difficult to do at times. The mirror also, even when tightened considerably, still loosens with road bumps. It is also difficult to adjust because the axis's of movement are oblique.I consider using this mirror more dangerous than safe. While I have my eyes on the mirror searching for dangers behind I find myself missing what is going on in front.I now orderedCateye BM-300G Road Mirrorand hope it will be a better choice.

The mount has been designed so that when you tighten it the arm can still rotate freely within the mounting bracket, making it fun to continuously adjust while riding. The bracket is expertly engraved with a large Made in Taiwan logo, it looks classy!

Yet this pleasant album sounds just as if it could be the one that followed Seekers Seen in Green, the Seekers' previous album which was released just before they broke up in the late 1960s. That's its strength and its downfall. The songs, some by the very underrated Bruce Woodley, are all extremely good within the bounds of the parameters which The Seekers established all those years ago. Nothing risky, nothing different. That's fine for me, but the much more jazzy/bluesy Keep a Dream in Your Pocket (not on this album)shows that The Seekers could stretch themselves a bit more. As it is, this is the last Seekers album and is well worth adding to any collection. But it's not quite Seekers Seen in Green. A shame, by the way, it's so hard to get hold of - but the Amazon-recommended supplier I used did an excellent job at a very fair price."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'LL KISS MY ...

First, she states that art must represent more than a powerfull image, emotion or mood. Then she calls Vermeer \\"the greatest of all artists\\", noting that he devoted his unquestioned skills to \\"a single theme: light itself\\". Welcome to my world, Ayn, that's all photography is, a two demensional representation of real light. But her Vermeer argument is badly weakened by that famous work of 17th century pornography, Girl with Pearl Earing. In this work, Vermeer shows he has more than light on his mind, producing about as powerful an image of raw sexuality as the time would permit. There's nothing intellectual about either beautiful light or a sexy girl. They're both about image, emotion or mood; that is, all the things Rand herself insists are not art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who says rationality doesn't apply to art?","review":"In this great book, Ayn Rand shows how to rationally interpret art.

I have traveled with them and used them just recently on 14 hour flights to/from China. Very comfortable, even for my big head. They also worked very well with the in-flight entertainment system. The movies sounded very clear with plenty of good bottom end. The case is nice as it protects the phones well. Be patient figuring out how to fold properly to put them back into the case. The graphic instructions are printed on the case and are simple and accurate. ALso know that Sennheiser makes another foldable pair PX 200, I believe that are closed back - might be even better if they provide some isolation from outside noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for travel.","review":"I purchased these to go into my laptop bag for traveling. The case they come in could be better thought out that is why the 4 stars. However it isn't something that should stop you from purchasing these. The sound is clear and they are quite comfortable. They store easy enough in my laptop bag and are quite easy to travel with and pull out. A true gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trust me not good","review":"The ear cushions fall off all the time. The sound is ok but not any better than a pair of $20 Sony headphones. Also the connection to the mp3 is not tight..lots of static when it moves around while working out or jogging..this is my second pair after first defective return..same problem..my other headphones no problems with this mp3 player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Sound (Especially the Bass)","review":"If you have an iPod and are not happy with the sound of your current headphones, then try these. The one thing no one explains to you, when you buy headphones, is that you need to match the impedance of the headphones you're buying, to the output impedance of the iPod. Most iPods have an output impedance of 32 ohms. And yet the majority of headphones sold have an impedance of 16 ohms. That mismatch affects the sound quality, especially the bass. I have an iPod Nano and I bought these Sennheiser headphones specifically because they have a 32 ohm impedance. I couldn't be more pleased with the incredible bass response. Fantastic sound !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!","review":"I have spent way to much money on headphones between cheap and expensive. I just got these in today and they are awesome. Extremely comfortable with a descent sound. I hat in ear headphones and can't stand the idea of spending 100 dollars or more on a good pair, and don't understand spending even more money on phones that will probably break in a year. These are affordable, comfortable, and sound good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound and value...","review":"Even on the super-bass \\"Groove\\" function of my Sony Discman ESP2, these headphones sound great. The sound is full and undistorted. It takes a minute to figure out, but there are nifty cues engraved into the band showing you the proper order in which to collapse the headphones down so they can be stored in the convenient storage case. I would call these the BMW of open air headphones--and the price was reasonable, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"Great sound for the price, but defective wiring will cause them to be garbage within about six months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound but break easily","review":"I bought these and used them for one week before the plug snapped off in my ipod (with very little pressure applied). While I was using them they had great sound and folded up nicely into the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"Overall, I am pleased with these headphones. The sound is good, and they fold to a small size for travel. My only disappointment is that they can be heard by a people around me, so they are not good for use in a quiet setting. The design allows sound to come out of the inner and outer sides of the earpieces, which I didn't understand from the description."},{"rating":"2","title":"great headphones!","review":"Okay, so these headphones are everything they claim to be. They're lightweight, while being heavy on sound. When I was ready to travel w/them, it took a while to collapse. But after following the diagram on the case, I was fine. They are so great, that I rarely listen to my iPod w/the other headphones, unless I don't have these on me. Anyway, the only thing that concerns me is what people say about the connector. I've had them for two months with no problem. Another reviewer suggests that you cover the connector w/heat shrink tubing or tape, when you first get it. I haven't done this yet. But if they were to go out, I'd do it when I got the replacement. For the price, you can't beat these headphones. They don't look all bulky while on your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser PX 100 Headphones--Great Sound!","review":"I needed headphones for air travel; one that wasn't earbuds, sounded great, travelled well and weren't too expensive. These fit the bill. These were comfortable, the music had nice depth, came in a handy travel case and were affordable @ $40 (maybe not for a teenager, but I'm a middle-aged professional).I don't listen to music too loud, so I wasn't concerned whether others could hear my music or not--which is likely the case for these headphones if volume is loud.I have no problems using these with my iPod Touch. I enjoy the headphones so much that I wish there were more applications/uses for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I chose to purchased a pair of Sennheiser after reading a lot of reviews and shopping around. My main reason was I was tired of my Bose ear buds falling out of my ears all the time. I think the sound is every bit as good as the Bose and significantly less money. The fold up feature allows me to store neatly without the cord becoming a tangled mess. They are comfortable to wear and adjust easly. Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not 40 dollar headphones","review":"The main drawback about buying a product like this on the 'Net is that you really, really, really want to be able to listen to them first. Yeah, these phones have gotten great reviews, but are they really that good? Since I can't let you listen to mine, all I can say is that if I had been able to listen to them first, I would have easily dropped $100 or more on these. I have a pair of Sony \\"Studio\\" phones that cost over twice what these do, and the sound horrible. The PX 100's have incredible frequency response, I can hear every note on the standup bass, all the way up to the screechy highs of the piccolo and trumpet. Incredibley light, the carrying case is well designed and the folding mechanism is intutive. My only complaint is the cord length: 1.4 meters, so a little over 4 feet is a bit too short for my tastes. But at about 40 bucks, you absolutely cannot go wrong. A resounding Five Stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just good for the money, but good, period.","review":"I reviewed a lot of headphones at Stereophile, and never found a pair under $100 that pleased me. Either they were highly colored or blah-sounding.These are neither. If you didn't know you were listening to headphones with a street price of $40, you'd think they were more like $140. They're not only neutral, but transparent and detailed. The \\"graininess\\" common to inexpensive 'phones is missing. Voices have a nice bloom and focus. Ambience is rendered well, not smeared or obscured.I wouldn't call the PX 100 dark or dull, but the top end does not seem to extend into the ultrasonic. I find this a minor failing, as (most -- many?) recordings tend to be overbright, anyway.Unreservedly recommended. If you don't like the PX 100, you probably prefer colorations to accuracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible sound, Incredibly compact","review":"These are hands down the best headphones I have ever listened to. Even after reading the rave reviews on several sites, I wasn't prepared for the depth of the bass and clarity of sound across the mid and high ranges produced from these lightweight, portable headphones. Perfect for portable devices, as well as any other use, they deliver the high quality of expensive closed-ear headphones without the bulk, and under $50. The only disadvantage of the open-air style is others could pick out the noise in a quiet room, but the advantage is that you can actually hear whats going on around you to a certain extent. I've used them for gaming, music, and movies, and in every case the experience is made completely different. The best headphones under $50, and the best portable headphones out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones for the price","review":"I am big on getting the most bang for my buck and that is exactly what I got with the PX 100's. They are a comfortable, lightweight headset that produce a nice crisp sound while using it with my iPod and they also come with a nice plastic case that is very functional. I had also considered some of the Bose products but I couldn't see spending anywhere from five to seven times the cost of the Sennheiser's and not getting any better performance or comfort from the headset. If saving money is important while getting a superior product to boot, do yourself a favor and buy this headset...you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I can say is 'WOW'","review":"I bought these headphones based of the recommendations of the 'AnythingButIPOD' web site. These deliver a crisp, full, natural sound. It's a pleasure to use these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect headphones for me!","review":"I've been looking for the ideal listening device for my iPod so I can walk and hear what's going on around me also, and these headphones really are perfect for me - the sound for all my music, from arias to rock, is excellent, plus I can hear outside sounds for safety - without having them intrude on my music. My music is hardly audible at all outside the headphones so I doubt it would bother anyone else, in case I decide to use them on a plane. I don't like earpieces in the ears as I find them uncomfortable. These are high quality and come with a great case to carry them in - excellent value for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"best headphones for this price range. excellent clarity and loud bass. if an mp3 is of low quality, you'll hear its faults. but that reflects on the file itself, not the headphones. as good as some $200 models and miles above traditonal $15-$40 headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones, with one problem","review":"These are an amazing deal for the combination of sound quality and portability, but I have encountered one problem with them that no one else seems to mention. That is, they project sound out into the room far more than any other portable headphone I have used. This is sort of a problem for me, as I like to listen to music in libraries, computer labs, etc...and there is no way to listen to music with these at an enjoyable volume and not have those close by listening to it, too. I would still recommend buying them, but I would recommend picking up a cheap pair of Sennheiser MX400 earbuds to take along--the sound quality on these is still pretty good, they're real cheap (10-15 dollars), and you can bust them out when you don't want to piss off every person in a 15 foot radius."},{"rating":"2","title":"they are what they","review":"the folding thing is easy and it is very handy having the plastic case.the sound is very good, not excellent though.... especially on the lows, I have never tried the porta pros, so I can't compare,I bought a $20.00 pair of Sony's that were so bad they were unusable before purchasing these.I use them for mostly for running, they sound good, they stay in place, what more can you ask...., well, OK, a little better reproduction and accuracy on the low end."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the original PX100's!!!","review":"Product arrived quickly, but unfortunately, it was the wrong product. The item described online is the original PX100, however, I received a pair of the new PX100-II's. I have had the newer version of these headphones and to me, they just don't compare to the originals. Plus, I wanted the hard case, not a soft bag that doesn't protect the headphones at all. In the end, I have returned the product and will continue looking for a pair of the original PX100's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light weight Headphones","review":"Outstanding comfort and performance for a very minimal price which is pretty hard to come by.

Incidentally, this is better than the series 200 models that cost morer that I also own.Kenny G"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing headphones, except broke.","review":"These headphones were definitely the best I've ever had. They are extremely comfortable. The pads swivel to fit your ears, and the material if very comfortable, so it isn't even hot in the summer. It sounds great, with balanced treble and bass. It does not cancel that much noise, but for me that's a pro, since I like to know what's going on around me. The fold-up design is fantastic and I can fit them easily in a pocket or bag without worry of them snapping. Although, I never use it case, since it is a hassle to squeeze it in there. I was very pleased with these headphones until they broke. The rubber around the wires near the plug began to wear away, and then I couldn't hear in one ear. However, that may just be my fault, since I use these headphones all the time and treat them quite roughly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound","review":"I bought this headphones because of the reviews on line and I have not been disappointed with the result.

For less than $50, there is not another headphone out there for under $100 that sounds as good. Folds easily, and stores in a very nice hardcase. A tremendous upgrade over the iPod in the ear 'phones. The only way to get a better sounding headhpone is to upgrade to the bulkier, full enclosed haedphones, like the Sennheiser HD497 (another fantasic buy at around $40)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact, sturdy, good cans","review":"Sennheiser PX 100 Collapsible Headphones - Compact, sturdy, good sounding cans.

The 200's need to be held exactly in the right position to seal the earcups to your ear, and even if you manage to get them in the right position, they still do not sound as good as the 100's. Forget all the Audiophile lingo - they just plain do not sound near as good. The 200's were promptly thrown in the trash.I have put around 7000 miles on the 100's now and still love them!I just wish I could write a foul review about J&M;'s totally lame motorcycle headsets!

They are definately great for cost/quality ratio. I needed a second pair of headphones for use, and was debating to get another KTXPRO1 or the upgrade to something better. The KTXPRO1 does sometimes start to hurt after wearing for a long time and looks kind of ugly I think. Lots of headphone review sites recommended the Sennheiser PX 100; it costs about $20 more than the Koss so I figure I'll try them.So far I've very pleased with the PX 100. It has cushions; making it very comfortable to wear, even for extended periods of time. I like the compact design and the way the ear speakers are moveable and can adjust to fit on your ears. I think it's a pretty nice upgrade from KTXPRO1 and an excellent pair of headphones for the $30-40 range!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty much the perfect headphones","review":"These headphones sound great and can be worn for hours without causing significant ear discomfort. I use mine at the gym and at home when I want to get some good sound from my laptop. Heck they even sound better than the sound system in my car.

I plan on stocking up on several pairs of these since good headphones are hard to find at this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, superior comfort, portable & affordable. Wow!","review":"I bought these headphones to replace the Sony crap ones that came with the Sony MZ-NH900 minidisc recorder. They sound terrific, only negative, if any, is that they are a little less efficient...i.e. they don't get as loud as the stock phones.My 14-year old tried my PX-100's with his CD player...he put them on, closed his eyes and got one big smile on his face, saying they were soooo comfortable compared with the junky ones he'd been using. So, he received his own set for Christmas along with a new CD player.Build looks and feels solid, not flimsy like the Koss Porta-Pros I saw at the store. Could NOT for the life of me find the PX-100's in a store before buying them, but I went the reviews here and one or two other audiophile sites I trust, and have not regretted it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"These headphones may be a step up from the headphones that came with your portable. Maybe.But that's about it.People who are impressed with these headphones probably have never heard good headphones, or good speakers, for that matter.If you know what good sound is, these are a waste of money.Note that the specs do not list a +/- db for the frequency response. These headphones have very little bass or high frequency response. But what they do reproduce is fairly clear, though there is some coloration.And the headphones are comfortable.So they would make excellent headphones for a foreign language lab, which is where you most often see Sennheisers.Listen to these headphones before you buy them. And compare them with some good headphones.THEY ARE A WASTE OF MONEY.I should have returned them.I do not use them because the sound is so unpleasant.I am not exaggerating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Build Quality: Poor Sound","review":"Unless you listen to classical the mids and base sound horrible- muddy and distorted.

The PX 100s are also great sounding headphones. In fact, they're the best you'll get for the money anywhere. They were a bargain when they were first introduced at about $70 and are a steal now.If you want to hear detail in your music, buy the PX 100s. For example, if you like to really hear bass guitar or percussion, these offer a balanced, detailed sound. Vocals stand out and you'll hear more resonance in guitars than you're probably used to. If you're looking for ear-thumping bass, get something else.While these headphones sound very good with almost any music player, adding a good headphone amp really makes them stand out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value for the money","review":"This is my second set- I am pretty clumsy and the first set took quite a beating before I decided to replace them.

Bass is very good, voice is clear, highs are not tinny. The sound of these headphones is ideal for me.They fit, unlike the eyeglass style that hook over the ear and never line up with my ear canal.Minuses:I use these at the gym. The foam style ear pads get very wet and must be dried after every use and occasionally taken off the speakers and rinsed off. I suspect they will tear at some point, making the headphones too uncomfortable to use.They are over the head style. Big for gym use as compared to ear buds. That makes them a bit less convenient.Overall:If these last a year before anything happens to them then I'll purchase another pair ... unless something better shows up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top notch headphones","review":"Excellent product worth the money.

The salesperson was also impressed by the quality of HD433 (I brought with me to compare) and agreed to no headphone came closer, even the most expensive ones. This PX100 sounded the best of them and I bought a pair of those. In the first couple of days I was impressed, then, all of the sudden the sound quality started to deteriorate.

Other reviewers have pointed out it takes a little work, which is true, but it becomes second nature very quickly. One piece of advice is to take it out carefully the first time so you see how it packs together!I've only used mine with portable equipment so far but I have no doubt it would perform admirably if I connected it to my stereo system.For the price you cannot beat these headphones!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great headphones, bad cord.","review":"I loved these headphones.

Why did they make it straight instead of a 90-degree bend?I've had them only a year under normal use and the cord broke (right) at the plug. This renders these headphones useless. It is so stupid, even cheap Sonys have a 90-degree bend on the plug to avoid breaking the cord.Because of this problem, I would not recommend these headphones. I will be looking at another brand to replace them. It is unfortunate, because they are perfect in all other aspects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chord wires coming loose","review":"As the other reviewers have mentioned - yes, the chord is terrible. In less than a year the wires are coming apart and ready to break at the mini plug. Decent sound quality is no use if the headphones become useless in a few months. Hope the manufacturer takes note of this very common complaint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, but fragile.","review":"I've gone through 2 sets of these. The weak point is the plug. It does not hold up over time. The sound quality is excellent, the durability is terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"7 Years Worthy!","review":"I've own a pair of PX-100's since 2002. For under $50, these are great headphones! Very light weight, and I've used them constantly for the gym. I am use to using audio gear of much higher caliber, but these are just awesome headphones! Perfect for the gym, or subway, or walking. They are open-type so you can hear outside, but it only leaks just a bit. I bought a second pair a year ago since I lost my original pair, but my original pair lasted 7 years of gym, working, etc... and no damage. They do seem fragile at first, but they can handle it. I can't say enough good things about these speakers. Yes, I use better headphones at home with an amp, but it's hard to beat these for great music and portability with an Ipod/MP3 player."},{"rating":"2","title":"QUALITY!!!!!!!","review":"This product functions flawlessly, and is a top notch set of earphones!

So happy that I chose these! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Was not expecting much, pleasantly suprised","review":"I was looking for a pair of headphones for the office and did not want your typical $20 Sony's that break in a few months, but at the same time I did not want to spend over a $100 like we did for our Shure's noise isolating earphones. So I went cnet reviews and found these babies, then I saw VERY high ratings from 900+ people, so I was sold. Got them today, hooked them up to my Digitial Media Player and wow, the word Natural comes to mind. And the BASS, holy crap... I expected a nice neutral sound but I did not expect the amount of bass these things put out, and I am a Bass Head. I have a $1500 HT Subwoofer... In any case if your on the fence, go ahead and buy, you will not be disapointed, $40 is a steal for headphones that produce such a nice neutral sound with tons of bass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat sennheiser!","review":"This is my second pair of the PX 100's and I will get a third pair when these go! They make you want to workout. The sound is so articulate and driving it is perfect for rock and jazz.Like the other reviews say, they are open air headphones so I would not use them for indoor/public listening. Running on the road or in the gym is ideal.The carrying case is a snap. Literally and figuratively. I don't understand all the fiddle-faddle with the assembly/disassembly.

These are the large size, both open air and sound deadening. I was looking for a pair small enough to fit in my commuter bag and use with iPod and computer. When I got the PX 100 I found I could not wear them comfortably, the audio was really bad, and they did not keep out the noise of the bus. I gave them away. I then ordered the Sennheiser in ear model and they have been perfect!!Forget the PX 100.Mike"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good because of the size - like for backpacking","review":"One star because I want people to know the sound quality of these Sennheisers is passible at best. I generally use Sony MDR-V150s with my iPod because the quality and price are great. Much better sound than these Sennheisers. I ONLY use these to backpack because I'm a super light weight backpacker and these are small and fold. That's all I'd use them for. Other wise the Sonys every time. I'm a music freak, thousands of albums, CDs, digital files, worked at Towerrecords etc. I'm into sound but I also like to keep my money. I've got half a dozen headphones or more.

I was disappointed to find the sound quality lacking in comparison. To be specific the PX-100's are much to bass heavy and the high end sounds tinny. Tested on my home system with EQ, some improvement noted with bass cut and mid boost but still not as good as the buds. Either I have some really good earbuds or the PX-100's are not all that, I tend toward the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap quality build with poor sound","review":"I'm honestly stunned at the high praise these headphones are receiving.1. They feel very cheap and flimsy.2. Sound quality is very poor. Sounds like a pair of headphones I can buy from Radio Shack for $3.3. The cord is very fragile.I accidentally pulled the cord, not too hard, and the headphones stopped working.They are now in the trash where they belong. Very very disappointed. Expected more from Sennheiser. Don't know why they are receiving so many 5 stars from the reviewers here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound great, but break easily.","review":"My pair had a great sound broke after about an hour when i removed them.

The Koss PortaPro Headphones were not as comfortable as expected based on what I had read prior to purchase.After about 15 minutes I wanted to take them off. The sound quality was excellent however. But what good is that if they are not comfortable [to me]. The Sennheiser PX 100 Headphones were just the opposite of the Koss! They were very comfortable - hours on end. Sound quality was very good, but a cut below the Koss. Bottom line - for an expected short listening sesson where I want the best sound - I use the Koss. Otherwise it's the Sennheiser most of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good headphones, close to the best in this price range","review":"I mainly agree with the other reviews on here (convenient, folds up nice into its case, overall great sound).My only complaint with the PX 100 compared to other recent affordable headphones I've auditioned / purchased is that the highs seem to be a bit muffled on these for me. My Senn CX-300 IEMs just have a bit more \\"sizzle\\" on the high end without sounding unnatural; these just seem a bit muted on the high end. On the other hand these have excellent bass, and it is not \\"over-boosted\\" like some other value priced headphones.Overall a very good set of open air headphones for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"CJ","review":"I researched many brands before purchasing these headphones in Dec 05. I deployed to the desert and took em' with. WOW! What a great pair of headphones. Great clarity and great ranges -very good sound all-around. I used these headphones alot and they really have performed. They have proven durable and dependable as they were sweat on and violently yanked off my head numerous times. The plastic \\"box\\" they arrive in is great for daily storage and transport. Would not hesitate to buy these headphones again! No complaints! Fantastic value for the price!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Money","review":"For a $40 pair of headphones I've been fairly impressed in the month that I have been using them. I was looking for something other than ear buds, and in a moderate price range and these certainly fit the bill. The sound quality is pretty good in both the treble and bass ranges. Only drawback I've noticed is having to crank up the iPod volume extremely high for my tastes, and it isn't even overly loud. Might be either my hearing or just being too used to earbuds for the past couple of years. Tricky to learn how to fold them and pack them back into the case the first time around, but high marks for the design of the carrying case.I don't think you'd be disappointed if you bought these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"I,m very happy with these headphones.

First, they are very comfortable, second, the sound is excellent with nice deep base, and mid-tones and highs that are not harsh. I also have a pair of older Sony's that I really like but these sound even better. Lastly, the price is right."},{"rating":"2","title":"STOP - These are the ONES","review":"You cannot beat the quality of these headphones, not for the price, and not compared to most headphones you may be considering. These are lightweight and fold up into a hand-sized, compact bundle. They are feather-light on the head and will not put undue pressure on your ears, making for a comfortable experience that lasts for hours. The sound is incredible. And, despite the light frame, these headphones are ruggedly fashioned, so you needn't worry about them bending, breaking, or falling apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't seem as well made as the first one","review":"I purchased this same product about four years ago and it is still going strong. This time the case was warped or does not quite fit the ear phones as well as the first pair I bought. In fact I don't like the case at all. It takes too long to wrap the cord up and squeeze it into the case. It's not practical. Otherwise, the earphones are good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hahahahahah Yes!","review":"Oh man, not only did they come a day SOONER than estimated but they have exceeded my expectations. Very rich sound and I feel that the openness lets the sound waves breathe a little, which is a good thing. And noise cancelers can sound a little sterile anyway. Very attractive design. And cool languages on packaging. Worth like [...] bucks easy but so much cheaper. I will certainly buy Sennheiser again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Buying","review":"These headphones are very light weight and produce good sound. Much superior, and more comfortable for me, than ear buds."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"i read several reviews before purchasing this product.

I've always been impressed with Sennheiser products, and this is no exception. The phones are stored in a nice plastic carrying case, and taking them out and snapping the headband into position is a snap. The sound blows you away. One of the reasons I decided on this product was the advertised 15-27,000 Hz frequency response. The sounds are very tight and clear. The headband is very comfortable with the two cushions and not fatiguing to wear. Overall an excellent product for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser review","review":"I have had these head phones for a month or two now. They work very well.

I've had them for years and have not run into the durability issues others here have commented about. All I have done in the past is clean some hair out from behind the foam earpieces. These have the signature Sennheiser warm sound to them--strong in the mids and mid-bass. The bass might be a bit too strong, especially for plucked string instruments, like a guitar for example, but that is easily fixed with a equalizer. I have not tried the second generation of the PX100, but you can find the first generation for a good price if you're willing to bid on some auction sites and have a bit of patience and luck to find the right deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steal these headphones","review":"So I have owned a pair of px 100 headphones for two and a half years. I have abused the crap out of them in that time and they have held up marvelously. The sound quality is as good as any over the ear headphones that I've owned, including other sennheisers. (Im calling the px 100 an on the ear headphone rather than over the ear) Super confortable, the number one thing I use these for is watching movies in bed and falling asleep listening to music. I am amazed that for over two years of falling asleep wearing these that they still work and the cord doesnt have breaks in it. I think I only paid $50-60 when I bought them and wouldn't pay more, and If I couldn't find these for that price I would go with the koss porta pros. not as comfortable, but possibly louder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, messy to fold away","review":"Had these for 3 years and my kid wants a set as well. Price has almost tripled!The sound is brilliant and they sit nicely around my brain.Only gripe is folding them back into the strange carry case.

If you are looking for bass heavy headphones this is not it.

Folds into a nice container that I take with me all the time with my laptop bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser PX 100 headphones","review":"The Sennheiser PX 100 headphones have great sound even though the earpads are \\"open\\". I prefer open pads because the closed tend to hold perspiration in. These were purchased to be used primarily during workouts at the gym and I only have one complaint about them. During periods of high impact cardio, the movement makes the sound crackle. I am guessing it has to do with the wire and how it attaches to my MP3. My previous headphones and others that I sometimes use do not do this so I am sure it's not the MP3.Otherwise, the sound is great and the fit is perfect. I will continue to use them and just deal with the occasional crackle sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small headphones, big sound","review":"I got the PX 100s to use with my iPod, in hopes of getting sound comparable to my Sennheiser HD 212 Pros in a more portable form. They delivered.The sound is quite crisp, much better than i'm used to hearing from headphones their size. The bass pretty good too. The only minor issue is the amount of sound that they leak out. Someone sitting next to you will easily be able to make out the lyrics of the song you're listening to, even at reasonable volumes. If this isn't a problem for you though, they're a fantistic choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portability and good sound at it's best","review":"I bought these for a mix of computer and mobile gaming. They're comfortable for long wearing, easily portable, and nicely protected in the included case. I've been very satisfied with the sound quality and would definitely buy these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much bass","review":"I recently took the plunge and bought an IPod. Impressed by the sound quality, but unhappy with the supplied earbuds, I searched the Web for reviews of headphones, determined to upgrade. Based on the excellent reviews of the Sennheiser PX 100 s on a variety of sites, I took the plunge and bought a pair. What a disappointment. The sound was muddy and distant, with way way way too much bass. The bass seemed to overpower the highs and midranges, making even Sinatra and the Carpenters sound like they recorded with Stanley Clarke or Bootsy Collins. I went back to my $20 Sony headphones, which provides a much clearer and tonally balanced sound in my opinion. Maybe with next year's tax refund I'll splurge for the Bose set"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay sound, poor quality","review":"I used these headphones only a handful of times and the sound was okay. The last time, I wrapped the cord around them and didn't use them for a few months. When I tried to use them again, I got sound on only one side. I thought it might be a loose wire before I realized that the wire insulation/covering had worn through, which was presumably the cause of the problem. Again, this happened after just a few listens and from wrapping the wires around them the way you would normally do with headphones of this type. I had to throw them out because they were useless. It's a disgrace to make something so shoddy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightweight, Excellent Sound","review":"I purchased these headphones 8 months ago when looking for a pair of over-ear headphones for work and travel. These have exceeded my expectations. These headphones are super lightweight and rest comfortably on your ears, helping avoid the fatigue and irritation that can accompany several hours of listening. IMHO, the sound is crisp with an emphasis on the treble side -- not super for big bass.The design is relatively rugged while also easy to collapse and store in the useful travel case.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure why everyone rates them so high","review":"So, I bought a pair of these after reading all the positive reviews, and I don't really get it. These are middle of the road quality headphones. The padding around the earbuds is of cheap quality and not comfortable. The sound is just very 'meh'.If you're looking for top quality headphones, then look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased with quality until they broke","review":"These headphones do a great job of combining portability with decent sound quality. They fold to a compact size and are fairly durable so you can put them in a coat pocket or backpack. However, these headphones broke less than 1 yr after purchase.

I use it to mostly listen to audio books while I travel. The headphones are lightweight, reasonably sturdy and of good material quality. The case is excellent.

A better ear cover could have prevented ambient noise.Still for the price, it is a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bang for under $50","review":"My co-worker uses these and she swears by them, so I picked up a pair to go with my new 3rd Gen Nano, and I have to say I'm impressed. I haven't had a pair of over-the-ear head phones since college, so I was skeptical. The collapsing feature can be a little tricky, but it does work. The fit is comfortable without feeling heavy. The sound quality is solid. The bass comes through consistantly without buzzing, and the treble is tempered. Essentially, the pitch from Sennheiser matches the product, \\"Natural Sound\\". If you're looking to get the most from your private listening without breaking a budget- I highly recommend the PX 100's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser headphones","review":"I've had Sennheiser headphones of various types over the years and have always found them good in sound.

When I went to the gym, I could hear just the vocals of the song on my iPod, because the bass from the music playing over the gym's PA drowned out everything else. (I really, really don't understand how people can use those teensy little earbuds.) So I bought a pair of Sennheiser PX 100s, and now I love my iPod. These headphones produce great all-around sound, they're light and comfortable, they fold up like a charm, and -- last but not least -- they're black. Now I can actually hear the music playing on my device.

I've gone through 2 sets of px200's and one set of px 100's, same scenario with both products. Disappointingly, overtime, they just don't hold up to any kind of physical abuse which a pair of stock headphones can easily sustain. Everything is solid from sound quality to the headphones themselves but, unfortunately, the wires are fragile which will most likely render these headphones useless before it's intended time. On the upside Sennheiser honors the warranty with no problems (you can do an RA through their website). But, unfortunately, you will most likely have the same scenario with the replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but why the price hikes?","review":"These are great headphones.Really good sound, and comfort to go with it. You can wear these for hours, witheyeglasses on, and not notice that they're on. I can't say that about any other headphone.These are better than their ostensible replacement, the P-100 II, which is too \\"boomy\\".However, the price of the 100 has become silly.The good news - there's a workaround.The Sennheiser MM60, is the same headphone. With a mic. And it's available at Amazon for $39.95 (as I write this).The sound and construction quality is exactly the same (I own both and A/B'd the two recently). Even Sennheiser's specs are identical. The only real difference is that, with the built-in mic, you can use the MM60 as a cellphone headset.So save your money and get the same headphone for less!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"Gives good bass reflex.

You need not worry about carrying the headphone in your backpack or laptop case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rattling sounds","review":"I've had these headphones for about 4 to 5 months, and over that time, they've started to make a nasty rattling sound. It mostly happens during parts with boomy bass, but it's been happening more and more for a month or so, and now it sounds terrible. I thought that I had a defective pair, but the same thing has happened to my brother's pair of PX100's, too. The quality was incredible, but it's not worth having a rattling sound in the background most of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke too easily","review":"These sounded fine and were reasonably comfortable. But the connector to my computer broke after only a few months of use and was not fixable so it was money thrown out."},{"rating":"2","title":"light and easy","review":"I bought these headphones a month ago and like them very much. Light on my head and ears and are easy to collapse and put in hardshell case (there are even \\"how to\\" drawings on the case itself to help you out). Good value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"right channel died","review":"The right channel died today. No trauma associated with it. The phones were working fine on my way to work. Put them on after work and only got the left channel. It's the jack. Kind of wiggle it and the right channel pops in and out. Tried the phones on a couple different audio devices to make sure it was the headphones, and yes it is the headphones. What a drag. Bought them less than 10 months ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice sounding but don't hold up","review":"These headphones have a good sound but they will not hold up. The wire is thin and flimsy and eventually they will fail. Sennheiser has a nice 2 year warranty that they honor and I have had to use it 3 times in 2 years with these headphones. My sets were not abused. I was pretty easy on them but just general use will stress the flimsy wiring. I cannot recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Workout Headphones","review":"I am using these as headphones to workout with. They sound great. Some of the albums on my iPod I had only listened to with my old work out headphones which were Nike branded, but made by Philips. Listening to these albums with the PX 100s was like listening to them for the first time. I heard subtleties in the music I had not heard with the other headphones. Very good bass response. These headphones are great; they fold up small; and they are very reasonably priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality sound, clever design","review":"Needed good headphones for MP3 player and PC.These were recommended by someone who knows more about headphones then I do so I bought them.I am very pleased with the high quality sound and they fold down to an eyeglasses-sized case, easy to stow."},{"rating":"2","title":"They sound great for the price","review":"I purchased these not really thinking that they would sound as good as they really do,for the price of the purchase you really can't go wrong.They are my ipod nano's best friend,the build quality is good as well.If you're looking to get a set of mobile headphones I would strongly recommend these with no hesitation since I have gone through a few."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good deal","review":"The sound is ok, not great. The connector is the cheapest that I have ever seen and I doubt it will hold up even under moderate use. For the price I expected a lot better sound, but it is not any better than the $9 sony mdr model. Spend less if you are just looking for a pair of headphones or spend a little more if you want something with superior sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most expensive junk headphones ever tested.","review":"I have Sennheiser PX 100 and Philips SBC HS500 Headphones and this Philips headphones gives me much better sound quality. I can't understand admiration for Sennheiser PX 100 seen in almost every review on the net. Sound from PX 100 is flat, high frequences induces terrible resonance (tested on Enya and Beethoven piano concerto). Philips SBC HS500 are much cheaper and much better! Also, they are more comfortable then Sennheiser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unremarkable","review":"I've never written a review here before, but felt so strongly to write due to the incredibly great reviews I read here.I purchased these to compare to my Sony MDR-A44 and send the best to my lady, and keep the remaining. Their sound quality is quite disappointing. Build quality is good, but high end with a new Sony Walkman was dead. MDR-A44's blow these out of the water. Sorry Sennheiser, I was really hoping (and waiting) for comparable or better than the discontinued Sony's. I don't even want them for myself and now returning them. Guess I'll have to take my chances with Sony's replacement for MDR-A44 which I hear build quality sucks. We'll see."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 Thumbs Up","review":"This is the first pair of headphones I ever purchased and they sound so much better than those that come free with walkman or cd player. I can sincerely hear a lot more detail that I did not even know they exist before. $30 AR is well-adjusted for the quality of sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound quality, horrible leakage","review":"The sound quality of these headphones is absolutely great. Unfortunately, the sound leakage is so much that they are essentially unusable in the workplace, on flight or any public place. The person sitting next to you can hear your music just as well as you can, almost as if you were using speakers. If public annoyance is not a concern then these headphones are great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW !","review":"I'm not a headphone junkie like some people out there, but I appreciate good sound. I bought a pair of $150 Sony monitor headphones a year ago and broke them, so i wanted something not so huge that i could walk in public with. I was really turned off by the looks and design of these headphones, but the more reviews i read, the more interested i got. I recently bought a mp3 player, so i wanted headphones that were really efficient (i think these are like 117db). Not only are they very comfortable, but they blew the Sony headphones away. They are so deceiving when looking at them. The bass is incredible for the style, and they dont seem to distort at all on high volume. I would highly recommend these to anyone, reguardless of music style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheirser PX 100","review":"Good sound. A little tight for me so not as comfortable as a light headphone would be expected to be. But I like them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound","review":"Great sound. Works well when being collapsed and put away in its case. Bothers the ears when wearing spectacles. Some parts of headgear padded. That's fine, but some parts are not and the metal rests directly on the head.

They are probably the best you can get for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"small surprize","review":"I got these for use late at night for my computer that has a 5 speaker surround system with a bass booster and a 460 Watt amp.

They were a tight fit and slightly uncomfortable for mt big head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best by far","review":"The only thing I can say about these is get them! They have the best sound of any headphone I have tried, including in the ear styles. For under $40 you cannot go wrong. They easily out perform headphones that cost $200 or more. The only draw back is that they do not dampen external sounds, but that is not always a bad thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work well","review":"This is my second pair, I find them to be very comfortable (I don't like ear buds at all), light weight and the sound is good. I just hope the dog doesn't find them (they are very poor chew toys, a lot of cost for very little chewing time)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy it!","review":"I can't believe I'm saying this about a Piece of peavey equipment! I had a bandit 112 as a teen and I loved it, I talked other people into to buying them also. Me and my buddy were in a band and we both had one and used them at the house to practice and write with. I remember it for its stunning reverb! Now back to this waste of space messenger, why on earth would peavey make a PA with out reverb???? Even if you don't want reverb for seminars and stuff, come on man you have to have reverb on a PA!!! well I'm very disappointed with Peavey for this and have decided to take my money to behringer as they make a messenger also!, a little bigger and more powerful and they were kind enough to not only include reverb but a whole array of digital effects and less expensive too.So in a nut shell, Don't buy a $400 peavey paperweight buy the Behringer Europort EPA150 Ultra-Compact 150-Watt 5-Channel Portable PA System"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Purchase","review":"After reading all the amazing reviews for this product, I cannot disagree more. I bought this for my wedding, and it turned out to be such a disappointment. The shipping was a nightmare, took over 3 weeks to ship. I got this system on the day of my wedding. We tried to set it up, everything turns on but the speakers came broken. During the chaos of the wedding, the venue threw out the box it came in and I was unable to return the system. Peavey and the company I bought it for were not helpful. I cannot find anyone to repair it. Waste of money and time. Peavey will not help you either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Valule","review":"I was really impressed with the sound quality and easy set up.

He plays for hours!! What an imagination! This is much better than video games and TV! The Imaginext toys really help little ones use their imaginations at play time and the toys are durable!

You name it....it's in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and memorable","review":"I won't reiterate what other enthusiastic and appreciative readers have already noted, except to say that if you love historical fiction and especially if you have an interest in the Crusades, this is an amazing novel that will make you feel like you're in the thick of battle with the men who fought in them. Cecelia Holland is an amazingly gifted writer. Jerusalem and Great Maria are two of my favorite novels of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Templar's passions for God, Jerusalem, and a ruling queen.","review":"Sibylla of Jerusalem was never worth the passion that the redeemed brigand called Saint by his fellow Templars had for her. As he knew, he should have reserved that for his God--and, to some extent, his order.In this book, which is as fierce in thought as it is in action, Hollander creates an order of Templars that lives up--or down--to the many books written about them. She has superb material to work with--the elegances and barbarities of the Kingdom of Outremer, the civilization and savagery of Saladin's power, and the paradox of the Leper King. The Templar mass at which the Leper King is received is possibly one of the most shattering scenes in the book--and is promptly opposed by a scene in which a Templar knight becomes the lover of a Saracen.JERUSALEM, like the city itself, is a paradox of blood and faith. If the ending trails off somewhat, it is only because the characters who are lost leave it desolate--and it is used to that."},{"rating":"1","title":"It fell short for me.","review":"Good heavens, this novel nearly put me into a coma, it was that dull. I had high hopes for this historical fiction set in Jerusalem as the Templars fight to keep the city in Christian hands, but unfortunately I never felt any connection with any of the characters who are about as life-like as cardboard. The plot was convoluted in the extreme and never really went anywhere....aside from a few battles, I never understood what any of the character's goals were, if any, aside from an overarching theme to keep the Holy Land in Christian hands.Many of the characters had a lot of potential that came to naught. Almost as if they were unfinished.I finished the novel, but only because I kept hoping it would pick up, which never happened for me.This is the first Holland book I've read and I hate to judge an author on only one book, so I'll likely give another a try in the future just so I don't short-change her. If anyone has some good suggestions, I'd love to hear them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A detailed and realistic, if dark look at life in the Order.","review":"Cecelia Holland does an excellent job of capturing some of the finer details of life as a Templar. This realistic portrayal shows the darker side of human nature though, and her characters are difficult to empathize with. The Order is unfairly painted as a corrupt institution with little in the way of redeeming characteristics and is overall unnecessarily grim."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap and primitiv quality","review":"It is \\"made in honduras\\", it's the badest quality I have ever seen. DON'T BUY IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique perspective covering Iraq","review":"Jackie Spinner's absorbing account of her Iraq wartime coverage is a courageous story, not just in the obvious sense of exposing herself to danger, but in exposing the vulnerabilities of herself, her family, and friends. The Iraqi staff and Washington Post colleagues became her family, drawing her closer than even her twin sister back in the states. This refreshing honesty is rare in a journalistic account of a war. She avoids the temptation to give canned histories of the region and plunges into the daily grind of finding news on the streets and homes of an ancient country torn apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting book, wrong title","review":"I thought that this book was an interesting liberal spin of the war, but felt that it should have been called \\"Tell Them I Didn't Lie\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Me, me, me","review":"Jackie Spinner is everywhere in this book--always between the reader and Spinner's subjects. She presumes to know how others feel, what they understand and motivates them. It becomes tedious and annoying. There is double trouble because her twin weighs in to lay on more and more personal pathos. Everyone is frightened in war, but not everyone blabs about it until the reader gives up in disgust. I am tired of young journalists who can't keep themselves out of stories. A wise editor told me when I was starting, \\"Never, ever write about yourself or how hard it was to get the story.\\" It is a good general rule to be violated only by reporters of great talent, and then rarely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Condition!","review":"I was very impressed with the book I received!

Most of the time, emo is horrible....and this is no acception. Lyrically, this is just an emo kid complaining about how much he hates his life of rock star luxury while occasionally throwing in Pauly Shore quality jokes. Musically, its ok at best. The drumming is pretty decent, but the guitar lines and breakdowns lack so much in creativity. The only people i can imagine liking an emo band like this are kids who feel repressed because their parents yelled at them for not doing their chores. If you want real music, check out Dream Theater or Michael Schenker Group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just cuz they're good live","review":"I really enjoyed The Bled's music, their album and all that.

I could go into a long elaborate description of why this band sucks and I could discuss which aspects of this band suck (guitars, drumming, creativity or lack thereof etc) but I honestly feel that even criticism of this album is a waste of my time (let alone listening to it).

Jonathan Stride, who failed to solve the first crime, is in charge of the second investigation as well. His initial findings point him to the step father and the possibility of an incestuous relationship. But along the way there are many twists and turns. It will be three years before the case is solved but when it is, the first disappearance can also be cleared and Stride has met someone that has changed his life.Immoral is a fast paced mystery with interesting characters who have some real depth. There are many twists along the way, one in particular I thought was very original and well done, and another that felt tacked on just to finish the book. Freeman has his forays into bad description and metaphor but overall writes very well. Yes, the female characters are all too beautiful and too many of them fall in love too easily with Stride, but I could forgive those conceits for the fast pace and riveting story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Props to the critic from Publishers Weekly","review":"Immoral is an okay time filler, but in no way is it the masterpiece some people say it is. The critic from Publishers Weekly said it all, and very well. Sure, it's a surprise when the killer is revealed, since it came out of the blue with no foreshadowing. Imagine playing Clue only at the end you find out that the killer wasn't even one of the players. A book can be entertaining without being 5 stars, but Michael Connelly, Robert Parker, Ruth Rendell, and Harlan Coben are authors that write the really good mystery. Is this book entertaining? Sure. But great? No."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut novel!","review":"What a great read! Any lover of a good suspense novel, full of twists and turns and engrossing plots, will love this one!

The \\"good\\" characters were so one-dimensional and unsympathetic and the \\"bad\\" characters were so wooden and unimaginative that you didn't give a damn what happened to whom. Then to make it worse he gives us a killer straight out of left field.

Unfortunately, this novel contains few of these. The plot is okay, capably described by previous reviewers, but there is little else to redeem it. In short, Mr. Freeman can tell a story, but he can't write. In contrast, I am in the middle of Ian Rankin's latest Scottish detective novel -- now THIS guy can write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title should have been \\"Derailed\\"","review":"Immoral does a lot of things right. It has a great setting, some good character developmnt, some interesting dialogue and interaction between characters. It builds to a climax in a classic,modern, legal whodunnit sort of way and then it just vomits on itself. It implodes in a sticky mess that makes no sense and offers no surprise. It just makes your eyes roll.Part of a great mystery is setting up a situation that resolves in a manner that makes sense, was in some ways forshadowed, but \\"gotcha\\" cause you missed it. This book falls on it's face once it gets past setting up the situation. It's as if someone told Freeman to \\"wrap it up\\" and he rolled the dice and lost.The ending jumps the tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sit Back and Enjoy the Ride","review":"Count me in with the well-deserved high praise from other reviewers. I can't wait for the next Jonathan Stride to be released in the Fall. The only part I had to slog through was the trial, but I'm not a big fan of the courtroom scenes anyways and I admit that this was an integral part of the story. What I loved about the book the most was that I lost count how many times I started to think I had it all figured out, only to find out I was wrong, wrong, wrong. But all is explained satisfactorily in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"First-rate who-dun-it!","review":"I believe this is Brian Freeman's debut novel, and he's hit a home run on his first at bat.... Truthfully, I had never heard of this book until a friend told me that she was reading it and that she couldn't put it down... So when she was finished with it, she gave it to me and I told her that I'd have it back to her in a week. I gave it back to her two days later because I couldn't put it down either. It grabs you from page 1, and it's a guessing game from the beginning. Just when you think the murder mystery is about to be solved, there's another twist. So don't think you know how it will end...until the end... Excellent! I look forward to reading future novels from this author...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immoral is a terrific story with a great twist","review":"I cannot belive the 1 and 2 star reviews I'm seeing for this book. I won't dwell in that, except to say, to each his (or her) own. Now, if you like fast-paced suspense, characters that you feel you know, a great twist, and a story that's neatly wrapped up at the end, then buy this book now. The story stuck with me long after I finished the book, and I found myself exploring what could have been had certain things happened or not have happened. What more could you want? Yes, the ending will surprise you, but Mr. Freeman gives you all the clues; they're in there...you just have to put it together. Worth it? You bet. I cannot wait until the next Brian Freeman book arrives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immoral","review":"It's been a long time since I've read a \\"can't put it down\\" book like this. Just when you think you've got everything figured out - the story takes another turn. Even peeking at the last couple of pages doesn't give you any hint as to the twists and turns Immoral takes. As a devoted reader of Sanford, Connelly and Kellerman, I have added a new favorite author to my \\"can't wait for the next one list\\".With his first book, Brian Freeman, has definitely earned \\"Must Read\\" status."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Author to Watch & Read","review":"Even though this is Mr. Freeman's first novel, it's obvious he has paid his dues. The characters are well developed, and the plot flows smoothly, although it takes many unexpected twists and turns. His work reminds me of John Sanford's, among a number of other excellent writers. Let's hope there are more stories with Detective Stride in the works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Hype....Bad Book!!","review":"What an over hyped piece of trash.....the sex scenes are like a 14 year old boy's immature fantasies....the revelations at the end of the book are highly far fetched and just plain stupid...The author spends more time on the main character's sex life than on real plotting....two long drawn out scenes of individuals urinating....boy ain't that exciting?Try the \\"Woman in White\\" by Wilkie Collins to see what a real writer can do with a mystery.....However most modern readers should love it since pop fiction is all they crave...creativity be damned.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twists and Turns","review":"This book had twists and turns that surprised me all the way through. This was a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out great, then burst.","review":"Brian Freeman writes well and the story's pace was pitch perfect. I liked the first twist (even though I saw it coming) but the twist at the very end was awful. It's like the author cheated. I don't want to give any spoilers so that's all I'll say, but it ruined the whole book for me. Also, the sex scenes were poorly written. I'd rather have no sex scenes at all than have them written that way--more like technical instructions than passion.With that said, I'll definitely give Freeman another try when his second book comes out. I just hope he doesn't toss out another ending like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nominated for an Edgar . . . but why?","review":"The middle third of this book is pretty good. That's the part that is a police procedural even though the police follow no procedures I've ever heard of. The first third, the courtroom drama is probably good if you care for legal mysteries. The last third, where the author descends into soft porn, and realism going totally out the window, is just to be endured. All this sprinkled with cliches (jeans so tight you need a knife to cut them off?) and thrown into a blender to make the storyline as convoluted as possible.There is talent here. With a stronger editor and a decision on what genre he's writing, Mr. Freeman has the ability to write a novel that is qualified to be nominated for an Edgar. But this wasn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly little book","review":"My first and last time reading anything by Brian Freeman. It started out pretty good, but then when he got to describing the lesbian Nancy Carver, his homophobia and hatred of lesbians came raging out in his completely unrealistic and stereotypical description of her. From there, the entire book went downhill. He painted every single other adult female as surrealistically beautiful with incredible bodies. Apparently he's never seen an actual female police officer: they don't fit his stereotype. His Hispanic police officer in Las Vegas sounded more like a pimp than a cop. And the ending just cracked me up. His own wife and her ex-husband??

That is the stupidest thing i have ever read.The entire ending is such a gimmick, it is a blantant attempt at hiding a bad story. There was no suspense, this is not a nailbiter. I wasted hours reading this book, hoping for a payoff. the payoff never came. The words \\"intelligent plot\\" shoudl never eb used to describe this book.HORRIBLE!!

I enjoyed the Duluth, Minnesota, north shore setting. I enjoyed reading about how the two cases were interconnected and how the murders were solved. i highly recommend Brian Freeman."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can fool everybody...Once","review":"Those reviewers who compared Freeman to Dennis Lehane and Michael Connelly must not have read either of those authors. Freeman's plot is convoluted (and illogical), his characters (mostly cliches and caricatures) have problems rather than depth, and his descriptions are too much and too hackneyed. Both his sex scene and his courtroom scene are unbelieveable at best (and hilarious at worst), and he tells everything but shows almost nothing. You can even tell which characters he likes and dislikes: he gives the few that he likes good dialogue--WHEN they're with other characters he likes. Otherwise, most of the dialogue can be cut. There's no reason to have the revelation \\"three years later,\\" either. The cops who messed up the investigation (i.e., the protagonists) come across as borderline incompetents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book","review":"The exciting story line and suspenseful writing style that other reviewers found in this book have totally eluded me. The plot was farcical, heavy with improbable relationships and unbelievable legal and police procedures. The characters seemed to be driven by an endless supply of adolescent hormones with dialogue bordering on the offensive. Does not say much about the quality of writing or the expectations of readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"Maybe I'm just jaded. I liked this book at first but soon became bored with it. For one thing, I'm always leery about books that have all these blurbs from different newspapers, authors, etc. They obviously see things in the story that I don't. And, Dennis Lehane, he is not!!! It's nice (for the sake of the author's future sales) that so many folks really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacking","review":"Another reviewer was completely accurate in describing the immature sex scenes which the author seemed to feel necessary throughout the book. I felt he portrayed police and investigators as sex-starved, mindless twits who were too easily distracted from their case. There was no reason to care about any character, which made the ludicrous, slap-it-together ending less of disappointment. Pop-lit with some relationships what you're looking for? This is it. But for someone seeking a plot that actually keeps you guessing and surprises you with a satisfying ending, keep looking. And please let me know when you find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"favorite bread book","review":"This has always been my favorite bread book. Lots of images and helped me learn how to kneed.

Laurel's directions leave much to be desired, but she brought us the desem in the first place. I got Beard on Bread mostly to review technique and for recipe ideas for modifications. So I got Bread on Bread to read and for guidance. I was well repaid. His reputation for excellence in cookbook writing was well founded. His views on fats and salt need to be downsized, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment for Sourdough Lovers","review":"When I read James Beard's introduction to his very short chapter on sourdough breads, I wished I had not bought this book. He writes that in his opinion sourdough bread \\"is much overrated and is difficult to perfect at home\\" and that he is \\"not sure it is worth the trouble\\". I profoundly disagree. Preparing sourdough is neither too difficult nor too much trouble, and a good sourdough bread such as a French country loave or a German Bauernbrot cannot be overrated! To make things worse the author suggests in his recipe the use of commercial yeast to make the starter, a procedure which most experienced home bakers advise you against. If on the other hand you want some good basic white breads or whole grain breads, you will find interesting and easy to follow recipes.

My only complaint is that the book does not go into further details about how to care for the young, newly rooted plants. For example, how do I overwinter a newly rooted hydrangea? How long after it's rooted in the rooting medium can I safely transplant it? What do the terms \\"grow on\\" and \\"grow under cover\\" really mean? The book assumes you know little details like this already.But really, considering the breadth of information the book is trying to cover, I'd say it does a good job of it. It is clear and easy to understand and the instructions are easy to follow. And, yes, it really does list every single kind of plant.

So why release a CD? I bought this and sold it. I guess I like innovative experimental techno like Jeff Mills, Richie Hawtin, and some U.R.. Carl Craig gets so much props I thought this CD was a sure thing. The title suggests something futuristic and interesting not retro minimalist house. It's a nice mix, the beats kick... but each track is like a drum machine(?) and like 1 other thing. the mix is not deep what so ever. no ambience. I thought craig did jazzy beats. He's in Detroit where they got a kickin jazz scene. he should work with it.THis CD ain't even as good as french house. He ain't from chicago so he don't got the proper disco or house vibe that tight. whatev. I don't get all the props."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"This album thoroughly disappointed me. In fact, this album embodies all of the classic criticisms of techno. It's simplistic, repetitive, uninspired and lacks any soul. Most tracks on the album go nowhere and it's generally boring. It took me three weeks to get through the entire album. This was due to the fact that I could not listen to the entire thing in one sitting. Occasionally, I attempt to listen to the album, in the hope that I have missed something but, I fail to see any redeeming qualities to this CD. This album pains me to listen to. I was so disappointed by this purchase that I have considered throwing it away but, I have decided to give it to a friend, instead.

The idea of classifying birds according to colour, and not according to the scientific classification of waders/raptors/... is a simple idea that's highly useful to a rookie like me.The photographs in the book are amazing. I have always found most of the field guides to be confusing, since the paintings used will not reflect the true vibrancy of the colours of the birds in the field. Since the book adopts the policy of using high-quality photographs, it does seem to be more accessible. Bird identification no longer seems to be the pain that it usually is. I would recommend this book to anyone who is starting out into the world of birds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a perfect sized book that has beautiful photos of the birds and clearly explains their size and markings, where and when they are normally seen in Iowa along with an attempt to put the bird's song into words to help identify the birds you can hear but not see.

Oops! You want to get \\"South Pacific,\\" and well you should, because it is one of the greatest triumphs in broadway history. A truly seminal work, \\"South Pacific\\" was taking risks and calling for racial tolerance long before \\"Rent\\" was a glimmer in anyone's mind. But this movie version is not the version to get. All the actors are dubbed (badly), and the movie of this show was such a travesty I implore everyone to avoid this version (Mitzi Gaynor? Gag...), and go get the Original Broadway Cast, with the incomparable Mary Martin and unforgettable Rossano Brazzi in the lead roles. The Original Broadway Cast version is really the only incarnation of this wonderful show worth having. Go get it -- forget about the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sounding South Pacific Album","review":"This remastered Original Soundtrack Album of South Pacific is very wonderfully done. Lush, beautiful orchestrations go hand in hand with the wonderful singing found herein. Mitzi Gaynor is as nicely suited to the part here as Mary Martin was in the original Broadway version. Rossano Brazzi is wonderful as well, even though his singing is dubbed in by Giorgio Tozzi. Bill Lee steps in here to sing Lt. Cable's songs and is nice... he also did C. Plummer's voice in The Sound of Music.This new remastered CD is well worth its price and sounds better than ever. Lush gorgeous stereo sound-what are you waiting for?The Original Cast Album, with Mary Martin and Ezio Pinza, though, will always hold a special place in my heart and is truly the definitive version of South Pacific, but this soundtrack album is definately not bad. It does, of course, put the new TV soundtrack of the Glenn Close production to shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE VERSION YOU WANT!","review":"I agree that Mary Martin (orig. cast album) is superb, but this soundtrack recording is superior in sound and in quality. Mitzi Gaynor is WONDERFUL as Nellie Forbush, and the other performers are fine. But the best reasons to buy this cd instead of the original cast album are: 1.The sound on the o.c.(mono)is boxy and shallow while the sound on this cd (stereo)is full and lush. 2.The supporting singers are better. 3.Mitzi Gaynor gets a bad rap from the previous reviewer. She was a fabulous performer with a beautiful voice and a sparkling personality that perfectly suits the character of Nellie. You will love this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Do They Do This?","review":"There are two things I would like to hear done with this CD ... The first is to add more music. Most musicals of this nature have an overture, main titles, intermission, and exit music. Why can't all this be included? It's all on the DVD so I know they have access to it.Secondly, why can't the music be presented in chronological order? While listening to the CD I want my mind to visualize the scene that the music comes from in the order it happens in the film. One explanation always heard is that they want to retain the original album concept. NONSENSE! The vinyl was limited to time and space on each side. The CD can hold almost 80 minutes if they really want to, so they certainly can add more to it and present it as the authors intended.Why not take advantage of the medium they're using and do it right!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey Woody Shaw is on it","review":"This cd is kinda like the \\"Before Kenny Garrett was Kenny Garrett\\". He even has an afro on it. It has woody shaw (the most under appriecated trumpeter of all time).

I dont know if people had noticed but from about early 80's to about 92 when Black Hope came out his sound is very \\"choked\\" and kid like, from then to 97 it seems that someone had loosened the collar, and from then to present his sound is very mature and thick.

This vacuum arrived earlier than promised ready to go out of the box. While it doesn't feel like a very substantial vacuum, I couldn't have asked for it to do a better job. It works better than our old vacuum that was at least 3x the price. At this point I don't know how well it will hold up, but like others have said, it really does have great suction which I guess is the most important thing in a vacuum!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value.","review":"This little vacuum is small, realize that before you buy it, it IS small. I'm 5'11 and the handle just barely lets me use this without bending over, anyone taller will have to bend. Other than that I'm quite impressed with the performance, it has excellent suction, probably can't beat it for the price.Some little nitpicks would be the noise, it is a very high pitched annoying sound that it creates. Another would be the 'dusting' attachment, you won't be doing any serious dusting with it. There aren't enough bristles, and they're far too short and stiff. The reach on the attachments is mediocre, you might have trouble reaching up high.Overall I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works great. Right out of the box.","review":"It works great right out of the box. Are old vac died five days ago, and we have pets. So I worked it hard right out the box. It held up great.

Very happy with it right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this bagless upright!","review":"This is my 2nd one! I loved the first one I bought so much that I bought an additional one.

Nice, clean sides get all the dirt out of the corners between carpet/wall areas and this featherweight little thing travels great around the house. The attachments are small and powerful enough to even clean carpets and upholstery in the car.After about four years of twice-weekly use, this little guy started to give out. The hepa filter and a belt had to be replaced, which is easy enough after hunting these parts down at big box stores. While it still worked, after the 'fix', our DD has had the most awful screeching noise when being rolled back and forth.Great product while it lasted, but definitely looking for an upgrade/replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible","review":"Puffs of powder and dust spit out the front of the vacuum as I vacuumed my living room carpet with carpet fresh powder.

At the beginning we thought we just need to replace the belt. But when we put a new one on and the belt melt in a few seconds, we found it's acutally the brushroll malfunctioning. For whatever reason, the brushroll can't turn anymore so the belt is burning on the axis when it tries to move the brushroll.

It is light weight, eahe corsy to move about, and seems to even get the dust in the corners. I have used the attachment on the mini blinds and a chair where the cat likes to sleep and it worked very well there. It is easy to empty too. I like that the cord is long enough to run through the entire apartment if I plug it in the hallway.I own a dyson. I do believe I spent way too much money.

One day I was using it and it sounded like something got stuck. Took it apart, checked it all, nothing is stuck. The foam insert is full of dust only after a month of use. I cleaned it, put it back and the suction is stil very low. It won't even get fuzzies off the carpet. I wish I had saved the receipt but I lost it on accident.

I had read some reviews on this baby and after much deliberation, I purchased it. If this sounds like you, just buy this one. It sucks, and it sucks and you change the filter (inexpensive) and it sucks some more. It is loud, yes, and I don't care. It is simple. No frills. It does precisely what a vacuum should: clean THOROUGHLY. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clogs easily and died completely after 8 months","review":"This vacuum was nothing but trouble from day one. It kept clogging and the clogs were very hard to remove due to the way the hose is positioned. I spent hours trying to fish out clogs using my fingers, sticks, etc. Every time I noticed that the air wasn't circulating inside the canister, I would find that it was clogged. We don't have any pets. We do have children. This might be a nice vacuum for someone living alone with very light vacuuming to do. I'm not sure. All I know is that it was a huge pain to us. It finally quit picking things up entirely... won't suction anything. I'm not sure what the problem is, but it's not worth it to us to fix it seeing as we were frustrated with it to begin with. We definitely wished we had gone with another product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unused debris receptacle","review":"90+% of the debris this item sucks up gets impacted in the corrugated hose.

Having hard wood floors led me to believe I could get away with a vacuum on the low end of the price scale, and while with extra effort this machine can get the job done it really is only good for dust bunnies and pet hair. Anything heavier than a dust ball gets spit out the rear due to the spinning brush and in order to get it up you have to hit the material just right or it just kicks it out. Sand, cereal, pet food the suction just isn't there so if your idea of easy clean up for your hardwood involves a quick vacuum and a wet swif this machine will add a lot of time and effort to that process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum - still going after 5+ years!","review":"Got this because of my allergies.Still kicking today!Replaced the filter a few times along the way (cheap generic ones on Amazon) no problem.The only reason it is short a star is recently we discovered that it isn't great at taking care of pine needles after Christams.Other than that, great, compact vacuum for small to large sized apartment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great So Far.","review":"I've been using this vacuum for a couple of months now and I'm very satisfied with it.

Unless you're using it to vacuum large stretches of straight carpet, you'll find it very frustrating to use. For nooks and crannies, corners, or brushing furniture, you need to detach the hose from the body to use the attachments. The hose is too short, so you have to have the main part close by, which defeats much of the purpose. You also have to lock it upright before using the attachments. It is heavy, awkward, and prone to fall over, and the attachments are badly made and tend to detach from the hose and extension tube."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant surprise","review":"This little Vacuum Cleaner is all I was looking for.

The floor is tile and sheet vinyl except one large area rug. This cute little mini vac does an excellent job, even picking up leaves that have fallen off my plants. The cord is plenty long and the canister easy to remove and empty. The only reason that I did not give this vacuum 5 stars is the hose. It works well but is very short. I tried to vacuum out my window tracks (standard height) but the hose was a bit short even with attachments. Over all a good vacuum for a small area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only worked once","review":"I guess I made the wrong decision when I acquired the Dirt Devil Upright. I do have dog and cat hair in my house and it quickly picked up the majority for one room. I cleaned the container, but then when I tried to continue to use it again, it would not work as nothing moved to the container. So, I guess this was an expensive buy to clean just one room. Now, I need to either throw it out or return it, but before I do, I will see if there is some type of blockage somewhere, but seriously, should I have to do this after just one room?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality","review":"This vacuum died after just 2 uses.

Glad I could get a refund though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for serious cleaning","review":"This vacuum may be okay for small area carpets that don't require much serious cleaning. But it didn't cut it for my purposes; an average sized one bedroom apartment. The cleaning deck is too small; it makes you take a lot more passes over the carpet than is desirable. And the suction power is just not up to snuff. I used it for a couple of weeks and then ended up buying a slightly larger, more powerful vacuum for just a little more money. This product seems like a good deal, but I would recommend spending a little more for a better vacuum cleaner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brush motor broken...","review":"6 months in and the motor that powers the brush broke.

It's very strong, not too loud, and gets the job done. I really like the bagless feature, but one thing holding it back is the fact that it's kind of a pain to clean out. It has to be dumped upside down. This causes the dust bunnies to get stuck against the filter and now have to be dug out by hand. Not the worst thing in the world, but it's a pain. Secondly, the canister is a bit on the small side. It requires being cleaned a few times when doing the house. I think if I lived in apartment it would be ok, but since I have a 2000 square foot house and it just doesn't work out so well. But, because it's so small, it does a great job getting into tight spots.All in all, I like this vacuum.

It was about $20 cheaper than the Bissell I was going to purchase, so I decided to give it a try. It does have pros: it is small, great if you have to carry it up or down stairs and it actually does suck up a lot of dirt. But the things I hate about it outweigh those for me. It's really loud, mine emits this high pitched piercing sound the entire time it's on. It drives me crazy. Also, the attachments are short. I need to use the attachment tools to vacuum in window sills that are up higher in several rooms. It just doesn't reach. Third, it's very messy to clean the filter. I wish it had a ring around it like some vacuums that I could just rinse under water. I definitely have to take this outside to clean the dirt out or the dust just flies everywhere.

I ordered it as I have mostly bare floors in my home with a couple larger area rugs. It does a good job on the rugs, does so so on bare floors, but I don't think it is designed for that. The exhaust is on the front of the vacumn, but I've had no problem with that. My only complaint is the hose is shorter than I would like. I have to pick up the vacumn to reach ceiling fans, high shelves, etc. It's more inconvenient than anything, The vacumn is light so it's not hard to pick up and use. I ordered extra belts and filters when I purchased it, but haven't needed them yet. I have had this for about 3 months and would recommend it for smaller vacumn jobs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirt Devil Dynamite Bagless Upright with On Board Tools","review":"While they did say this was lightweight, I was not expecting it to be as light as it actually was. This just glides with no effort at all, whether on wooden flooring or carpet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirt Devil Dynamite","review":"Vacuum has very good ratings on Amazon. I support them. We purchased this looking for a light weight vacuum that still cleaned like a full size vacuum. This unit works well. It works as well as any vacuum we have ever had. It is light weight but still has the power. The only cons I may mention is that due to its light weight, to some people, it may appear a bit small and has a relatively small container that needs to be emptied about every other time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent amount of power!","review":"I bought this Dirt Devil based on price and reviews. The ONLY thing wrong with it is that it's a little bit difficult to push, but I'm of smaller stature, so this may not be an issue for others. It's really light, though.

I was initially impressed; however after approximately a year of use, the vacuum is not doing its job! I have given it proper care (as recommended in my manual), but it has stopped \\"picking\\" stuff up off my carpet. My carpet looks the same after every use. If you are considering this product, my recommendation would be to spend a little more money, to get better quality. In my opinion, a vacuum is an investment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh well.","review":"I really liked this when I pulled it out of the box. I have one room in my house that has carpet so I'm not looking for anything fancy. It is loudish (don't mind). The real problem for me is that there is no real height adjustment that I can find. There auto height adjustment is either a joke or broken on mine. As a result the suction pulls the face into my new plush carpet and I cannot push it forward without serious effort. Upon further examination, the very front weels are only about 1/2 inch in diameter and they don't move up and down. My carpet is probably 1/2 inch deep so, no go. Anyway, If they had just made the front wheels bigger and put an adjustment on it it would work fine for me. This vacuum is probably great as long as your carpet is not too deep or plush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"Unless you have very little to vacuum, buy something else!

After the suction of a place, when you lift it or move it, it rejects(throw) what it was vacuumed.

All in all a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very much sucking power","review":"The reviews for this looked great, small, low price, lightweight, great sucking power... BUT I disagree with the sucking power. Sure the canister gets full of dust, etc... But the canister is very small. The brush does a great job fluffing up the carpet to make it LOOK like it is cleaning it really well, but the suction is awful. Especially with the hose for the stairs. The suction is so bad, it won't even suck off the hairs/ dirt that the cleaning brush picks up. My carpet gets a nice fluffing, leaving most of the dirt in the carpet. Especially the hose for the stairs.CONS: BAD sucking power, short hose, and short attachment arm, cheap attachmentsPROS: Lightweight, low price, small, easy to empty canisterThe CONS out-weigh the PROS by a long shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this little vacuum","review":"I was amazed at what this little vacuum picks up!

The only issue I have with it is that you have to put a little muscle behind it when pushing it on your carpets. The handle comes in two pieces and you can push the handle down for storage in a small space. This is convenient put also frustrating in that when you push the vacuum, sometimes the handle slides down into itself because there is no way to permanently lock it in place. I think I might just get some epoxy and glue it together. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"handy dandy little vacuum cleaner","review":"This vacuum cleaner is wonderful. It picks up like crazy and gets into small places. I didn't realize it was only 10\\" wide but I don't have that much carpet and it is ideal for me. Not having to change bags is great.

Also when you opt in for that package, and the recommended 2 replacement belts, you will be sent 2 \\"Type 12\\" belts, which won't fit. This vacuum actually requires \\"Type 15\\" belts.The sad thing, you won't figure out you've been sent the wrong parts until you find or get an Owners Manual, which of course shows the correct parts.

Ok, no problem go buy a new belt, right? Well, then the new belt melts and snaps right after installing it. The brush roll where you attach the belt is scalding hot. So now I've paid for a piece of crap that breaks after 4 months of light use and to add insult to injury, wasted money on a new belt to have it break immediately. I might as well have taken the cash from my wallet and just flushed it down the crapper. After reading a lot of the reviews on here I see that I'm not the only one that has had this exact problem. If you only want to vacuum for a couple of months then this is a great vacuum. Buy two or three though because you will need the replacements. I'm gonna use mine for target practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud and stopped working after one year","review":"Bought this vacuum in June 2011, it came with a small defect, contacted the seller and received a prompt replacement.

This week, it completely stopped working and would not turn on. Checked the usual troubleshooting, and nothing helped. Will check with the seller again and see if they can do anything about it. Will update."},{"rating":"1","title":"It blows. Negative -5 stars","review":"Yah, so I purchased this on February 22, 2012. It is now March 19 2012,and it has stopped working.

It's much smaller than I expected, definitely a compact model, with about a 12\\" vacuum width. It's a good size for a 1 or two bedroom apartment, but not really suited for a 1500+ sq foot setting. Since it clogged easily on something so light and small, I cannot recommend this little guy to anyone. I had a dirt devil slightly bigger that i bought 5 years about before it burnt out prior to this model for $60 at target. It worked well. I can't say the same for this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"You got what you paid for","review":"I have this one for over a year now, and I am going to give it away.Pros:- Cheap price (you got what you paid for though)- Extention cord is really long- good suction- nice attachment pics (allow you to clean the edge of the wall)Cons:- very noisy- unable to fit under bed- clean the paper filter is such a p-a-i-n! Now I have to clean the filter at least twice every time I use it.- I really wonder if the so called HEPA filter is the real thing.- the exhaust blowing downward and stir up dust everywhere (this is the worst part). It might work better on carpet but it's not for hard floor.Bottom line, I will never choose bagless vacuum anymore and I would definitely buy a real HEPA filter vaccum such as Electrolux EL6985B Harmony Ultra Quiet Canister Vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good on the onset but...","review":"Initially after moving to the States, I bought this because mainly of the price. Since I was used to having maids clean house for me eversince I was born, I knew nothing about cleaning! Now here on assignment in the States, I had to do the cleaning myself. In the beginning it was ok, seemed to suck up everything in sight but then the power wound down, no idea why though. I thought it was because that it outlived its purpose since it was cheap. I bought another one thinking of the first time I used it. Now I being sufficiently adept at vacuuming now realize that what I bought really sucked ever since I recently purchased a Shark vacuum lift away that cost almost $400. It's been a year now and the Shark has not changed in efficiency. All I can say is never go for cheap when it comes to something that one really needs for cleaning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY small","review":"this vaccum, while nice, light weight, and powerful in proportion to it's size..is VERY VERY small. it looks more like a little girl's toy. while it may be adequate for a smallish apartment, it is not up to a larger home. the narrow width can reach in small spaces, true enough, but to sweep a 20 x 13 foot room requires many moves back and forth movements that our previous vacuum (a now-dead bissel)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome little Vacuum!","review":"This is a great little vacuum cleanear. I bought this vacuum because I just moved into a studio and didn't own a vacuum yet. I didn't have a lot of money to spend so after searching on amazon and reading reviews for different vacuum cleaners I decided on this one based on the reviews. It's really small which makes it very convenient for storage since I dont have a lot of it. Its the perfect size for a small apartment or studio and its pretty powerful. It's alot more powerful then I expected it to be.The only negative thing I have to say about it (which isn't a deal break for me at all) is that the vent is in the front of the vacuum so you have to be careful how you aim it because it sometimes blows dust or dirt away that your trying to suck up. Yout get a technic for that down pretty quickly though. I did anyways.

My one year old spilled Cheerios and when trying to vacuum them up, the vacuum wasn't powerful enough to suck them up. I was left with smashed up Cheerios on the floor instead.

So, I bought this Devil since it it the best reviewed cheapest compact vacuum cleaner I could find. This compact creature is small & light but beats the crap out of my previous cleaners by its power too. the description says to use it on carpet and bare floors, but I was not planning to use it on our hardwood floor, which we very much care for.

On this CD he leans toward the standard bop repertoire (BIG FOOT, ORNITHOLOGY, CON ALMA, BIRK'S WORKS), which he performs to perfection. Cedar Walton is on piano (David Williams is on bass, Billy Higgins, drums) and his playing totally complements Pike's. One mannerism in Pike's playing, however, that I wish he could eliminate is his incessant \\"singing\\" along with his playing: it's a boring monotone that really intrudes on his playing. But this is Pike's most satisfying CD and should bring enjoyment to hard bop fans, especially those who love the vibes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"He is one of my favorite performers......this is one of my many purchases through Amazon.

The AV content is stuff like the author reading selected passages, an interview between the author & his editor, etc. Very nice.

To be fair, on the product page is some text saying\\"Kindle Edition with Audio/VideoAudio/Video content only available for iPads, iPhones, and iPod Touch devices.\\" but I think that if the AV doesn't work on a Kindle then you shouldn't be labeling as a Kindle edition with Audio/Video."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Gods: A Novel","review":"Excellent story, mesmerizing and thought provoking.

I don't know what other people saw in this book that I must have overlooked, but I found it a real yawn-invoking book. It's much too long and has far too many occasions where the story just meanders off into left field without really coming back. There really seems to be no point to this novel. Surely, it's interesting getting just a grain of information on numerous gods of old, but the trip is just too long and unfulfilling. When I finished the book, I put it down and muttered \\"What a waste of time\\" to myself.I really liked Stardust and Good Omens, but this book is nowhere near as good.

However, I was completely disappointed by the plot. Gaiman had a great idea going and could have done much better. Most of the \\"twists\\" turned out to taken from daytime soap operas. I guess the first red flag was when (and, trust me, I'm not giving away any of the plot here) Laura came back from the dead... And our main character was not even remotely suprised. Really now. I felt the characters were devoid of all... um... character... extremely flat. However, the idea behind the book was great. I just wish Gaiman made up his mind on wheather or not this was going to be humorous or serious (would have been much more enjoyable if he didn't try to be so serious). If you were disappointed as I was with this book, try Good Omens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as much as a novel","review":"Neil Gaiman is probably one of the best plot writters for comics and graphical novels in english language. Also is a great writter and reader of tales. Disgracefully, it seems that his abilities are not yet rippe enough for a true novel.Altough \\"American Gods\\" has many entretaining details, and is fun, it is not really a novel, but more like the plot of a giant comic nobody ever draw. It lacks the rithm and complexity of a novel, specially one which pretends to be 300 pages long. I believe Gaiman has still to mature to be able to write this kind of works. I recommend the readers to keep adquiring his works in comics and short tales, where he is superb, until he shows refinament in his plots."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Gods","review":"This book/author is amazing!!

In this work of urban fantasy Neil Gaiman explores this idea, introducing the reader to Shadow, a man recently released from prison and who has learned his wife has just died. Beginning life again essentially from scratch, he agrees to begin working for a man named Wednesday. Wednesday is preparing for a coming battle between the ancient, traditional gods (himself, Anansi, Easter, Czernobog and Ibis, among others) who have been forgotten in favor of the new \\"gods\\" of the modern, industrialized world (technology, cities, etc.).As the reader, I wanted to know a little more about the characters (the gods) and their stories and motivations. This was my first Gaiman experience and, while I highly enjoyed his writing style, I wasn't completely in love with the story. I'd definitely read another of his works."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"I so wish I'd read some of the reviews before wasting my time with this book.

Remember \\"Insomnia\\"? \\"American gods\\" is just as boring. The story just never grips you: in the first 150 pages (the total length of some masterpieces) NOTHING happens, absolutely nothing, nada! I don't think I'll buy Gaiman again in the future.

What I like most about Neil Gaiman is his ability to incorporate fantasy and myth into his novels while retaining a feel that is intimate, and while creating characters that you come to deeply identify with and care for. No matter how far out his novels get, they remain deeply human, and that is an incredibly difficult task for a writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...","review":"I've only read one other book by Neil Gaiman, and I didn't really like it. However, I'm glad I decided to give him another chance, because this book was great! Granted, it's probably more enjoyable to read if you know a little about \\"the old gods\\" ahead of time, but I thought the whole idea for the book was both clever and fascinating. The idea that technological gadgets are North America's new \\"gods\\" isn't necessarily original, but this is the first time I've seen them represented as physical characters in a novel. If you're weird like me and have wondered what Odin would be like if you met him in the street, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm now a Neil Gaiman fan","review":"I read Good Omens (featuring Terry Pratchett) and so thoroughly enjoyed it that I had to read Neil's solo work.

Now, I eagerly await summer vacation so I can tackle Anansi Boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"All-American Fun","review":"This is an enjoyable book that crosses back and forth over the line between reality and \\"this couldn't possibly be true...but is.\\" The cultural observations are astute if not acerbic and the \\"gods\\" with their ordinaryness and powers are excellently. The author excels in sustaining suspicion throughout the novel as we wonder if what we dare think could be true really is. This is a tale that shimmers just beneath the surface where most of the action lies.The only problem is the main character. He never becomes as real as the other characters, perhaps due to his utterly boring persona. Still, the story of Americans who just happened to be ancient gods who play scrabble, bowl and argue is captivating. The earth-shaking finale has parallels with many others - Buffy the Vampire, Mortal Combat, X-Men - all, by the way, as American as apple pie."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time Neil Gaiman reader","review":"As the title suggests, this is the Neil Gaiman book I have read.The book was a very easy read. The writing flowed very well and when I put the book down, it left a lasting impression. The book has something to teach you, and offers several different perspectives on things you might have already known. I found myself looking on the map for a lot of the locations that were spoken about, and it made me excited to travel the Americas some day. For these reasons I give it the 4 stars.The one area that this book failed, and the reason it did not get 5 stars, was because of the small short stories that would inject themselves into the main story. The main plot progresses fairly rapidly, and then out of no where, you are looking through the eyes of 2 black slaves, or a native woman with some connection (not much) to the main story. I skimmed the book once I completed it and found that if these little stories were removed, I would consider this a much better book overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming","review":"I grew up on New Wave sci-fi, and have seen this type of story before. It uses characters and plots we 'know' in disguise. The pleasure from such stories comes from two places - first, the magical 'aha' moment when we unravel their identities. Next, the finale, where the author reveals new twists on a familiar archetype.Unfortunately, American Gods is bland. It lacks the crackle of Harlan Ellison, the startling brevity of Roger Zelazny, or the unsettling button-pushing of José Farmer. It felt 'done before'. I got bored and couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open your mind, and enjoy","review":"This is my first novel by Gaiman I am a huge Sandman fan so of course I needed to venture out into some bigger works of Gaiman.

Neil Gaiman looks for the soul of America in this novel, and while he doesn't quite reach it, the stories and the people and the places in the novel will stay with me as some of the most sympathetic and wonderful characters ever developed. It's unfortunate that the plot wasn't better developed, but perhaps that is in some sense the point of the novel: that America isn't about gods or technology or about fearsome battles - it is about the people who have traveled here from near and far and the relationships that we have developed."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kind of humor","review":"I really enjoy Neil's dark sense of humor. I've read most of his works and American Gods is no exception, it is most assuredly good fantasy, but with a great satirical feel to it that kept me going strong to the very end. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best edition to a masterpiece","review":"There are so many reviews of the old book I won't spend much time doing that here. It is a modern day masterpiece. One that will be remembered for a long time.What I would like to address is which edition you should purchase. If you already own American Gods then there is almost nothing new to be found here. There is just a small amount of new content. You should at least read his introduction to this edition. So if you have never purchased this book before then this is the best looking and most complete version available.Bottom line is don't double dip but if this is your first copy you owe it to yourself to get this edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not you, it's me","review":"I don't understand it. I loved Neverwhere. I love fantastical quests through small-town America. I love mythology. Yet I hate this book. I promised myself that I would read half of it before I put it down, but I think I'm going to welch. My major complaint is that the book is dull, dull, dull as dishwater. I liked the main character while he was in prison. I wish he'd stayed there. His wife died. Who cares? He plays chess for his life. Who cares? He helps rob a bank. Who cares? I'd rather watch a documentary on the Hoover dam. I was quite surprised to come here and see how many people loved this book.

Everything else between the beginning and end are just words to take up space and add thickness between the covers.Character development is practically non-existent and most of the characters are really just a profusion of names that only make the theme of the book distracting and chaotic. It is not clearly and understandably recognized that the name of the character Wednesday derived itself from the Norse word 'Wodinstag' which was the day honoring the Norse god Wodin (or Odin).The book rambles from page to page without any continuity of meaning about the idea of what the author is presenting and each page becomes a struggle to finish.In summary, the author was certainly not thinking of what the reader would like to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star because the last 400 pages were a HUGE letdown","review":"I don't want to go into too much detail due to the vast number of reviews but this book started out as a real page turner and turned into a real fight just to finish...SPOILERS!1) Gaiman craps on Norse mythology.Yah, Thor shooting himself in the head is going to happen. I'm sorry but you have to be respectful about established \\"characters\\" and Odin, the all-father, as a double dealing scumbag? Give me a break.2) Who do you root for?Shadow is painfully boring. Laura is a cheating skank. Both sides in the \\"war\\" are painfully uninteresting. I wanted them all to just go away by the end of the book.3) Needs an editor.Why did we need like a hundred pages of Shadow settling in Lakewood (Lakeside?) with no payoff for those pages?etc...etc...etc.. (I could go on and on)...I think Gaiman wrote the first two hundred pages in a fit of creativity and had no idea where to go from there...and it shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"The jacket copy is the high point","review":"Yes, I'll admit I got suckered in by the jacket copy. That and Gaiman co-wrote \\"Good Omens\\" (with Terry Pratchett) which I enjoyed a ton.But, the great premise of an American mythology personified and come to life is undermined by truly disturbing sexual and violent content (no spoilers here though). The sex and violence seemed to only be in here to shock, not to tell a story. I don't think I'm a prude but there are some things I just don't want to read about and unfortunately, this book contained them. Which probably explained by it achieved best-seller status. Sometimes, it's nice not to be in the norm.Why 2 stars then?

I had never heard of it, nor of Neil Gaiman. I bought it and began to read it, just by chance.I tell you, at first it was weird and just not my type of book. By the end of the book, I wanted more and I was thrilled to have read this book. The journey \\"Shadow\\" (the main character) goes through is quite awesome and well put together. Everything in the story is just very well written. The book only gets better with every page and just gives off this unique feeling as your eyes move along with the text.The Book is also divided into four parts, so I decided to judge like this.Part One - DecentPart Two - GoodParts Three & Four - AWESOME!!My overrall rating for American Gods is...8.6 out of 10"},{"rating":"1","title":"American Junk","review":"From everything I have read, and everyone I have spoken to, it seems that I am one of the few people on the planet who did not enjoy this book. I am fan of Neil Gaiman, especially of his graphic novels, and of other works, including Neverwhere and Stardust. I enjoy darker-themed fiction.In addition to dark, however, I found this work to be dingy, depressing, and even occasionally disgusting. I had to force myself to continue on, and I simply found little to nothing redeemable in the experience.Others have described it as fascinating, haunting, and surreal. For me, it simply fell flat. There was no magic in the prose, and it felt sloppy, chopped up, and not as original as the back cover would lead one to believe. I didn't find a single character compelling enough to care about through the end of the book, or even to remember once I'd closed it.My recommendation on this one? Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the ride","review":"I disagree with those who think the ending fizzled.

Well worth the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"As novels go, a stand-out","review":"Prior to reading this book, I had read (and loved) Gaiman's Adams-esque \\"Good Omens.\\" However, comparisons must be avoided. This book is in a different ballpark.First of all, the world which Gaiman creates is so engaging. When I finished the book, I found that I missed visiting his world in a way I don't recall experiencing with any other book.Secondly, the story is fascinating. Mixing ancient mythology (a hobby of mine) and great story-telling, he weaves a yarn which works on many levels: sociological commentary on mankind, modern fable, and so on.His style is good, although he's perhaps no Bradbury or Cervantes; but the story is so compelling and his imagination so engrossing that I cannot but highly reccommend it. However, I ought to point out that it is a very graphic book, with some bizarre sexual situations and a lot of violence and language. Watch out for that. But all told, a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original, Nice Execution, Quirky Writing","review":"This is an enjoyable book that crosses back and forth over the line between reality and \\"this couldn't possibly be true...but is.\\" The cultural observations are astute if not acerbic and the \\"gods\\" with their ordinaryness and powers are excellently.

It has great ideas and is well written. The characters are rich and bring the reader into a private circle. There are mysteries and puzzles that keep the reader involved from page one to the final word. The worst part about this book was that I read it first having not known of the original. It was a gift from a huge Gaiman fan and i didn't have the heart to tell him I didn't know the writter or the original book. Once I finished this version, I immediately went to the local library and read the original over a weekend. Now that I am a fan myself I can honestly say that I like this version better.

I think things got lost toward the end. Actually there really wasn't an ending, the promised great confrontation which seemed to be such a central theme never took place. I guess even the author realized that the outcome would have been too one sided, but still even lost causes can be somehow emotionally satisfying, sort of like the elves leaving middle earth in Lord of the Rings. I wish I could write, I would rewrite the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Story...But","review":"I thought that this story was an interesting read...exciting in some places, pensive in others. IMO, I thought there were a few things which could've been improved - more interaction/activity with the various Gods/Goddesses...better explanations as to why certain things were the way they were (i.e. Horus being crazy, etc.)...and did Shadow ever have an emotion? I must've missed it if he did. He accepted things...bizarre things so matter-of-factly that it seemed a bit false. Like the whole thing with his deceased wife...any regular person would've been scared sh*tless at first. Anyway, without getting too \\"wordy\\"...a worthwile read, but it could've been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neil Gaiman in his element, all of them.","review":"I absolutely loved American Gods. Despite what some other reviewers have said, I think Neil Gaiman, a brit, was the perfect person to tell this tale. Who else would be better suited to telling the story of a clash between the gods of the old world and those created in American than a man born and raised in England who's relocated to middle America and has made a career of writing about dreams?Old world versus new, old beliefs versus new vices. The character drama with issues of loss that won't fade away are gripping, and hold equal time with the not even slightly subtext of what we put faith in. And it works, never seeming scattered or spread thin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something new!","review":"I have been curious about trying a Gaiman novel for some time. I enjoyed his other work in graphic novels and in movies and such, in the past. This was my first pick for sampling his fiction in another medium and I am happy I did! He is creative and generous in his description of the characters and worlds he creates. I am going to read more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Everyone should read this book. It's wildly entertaining - impossible to put down. I've bought more copies of this book than I even know - I give them away just to share this story with people. If you've never read it, you really should.The main character, Shadow, is strange and interesting and boring and epic and small and extraordinary and average. He's a sort of every-man and he's so much more.The \\"Coming to America\\" stories are great and are dotted throughout the book. There are poems I studied in college that I recognized - a line from e.e. cummings \\"in Just\\" (which still to this day creeps me out) was exactly the perfect line to set the mood of the chapter it precedes - it sends a shiver down my spine. Gaiman is great at choosing exactly the correct piece of literature to set the mood.I have listened to this on audio book and I've read it in paper copy many times and I've read it on my kindle and on my kindle app on my phone - it's amazing and I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping","review":"I thought it was gripping and I enjoyed the down to earth nature of Shadow and his other worldly collaborators, which nicely offset the mythical overtures of the book. I highly recommend this read."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could this book win the Hugo?","review":"This book was waste of time. I read the first 210 pages and felt cheated. I kept waiting for the plot to develop and it never came close. How in the world did it win the Hugo? I may never read another Hugo winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writer/Bad book","review":"I picked this book up because I enjoyed Gaiman's Neverwhere.I had expected a book that was about how America (US) is run... or might be run. Being that he titled his book with two very important words I thought that this would be a book with an important feel to it.Instead... American Gods is a book that seems to be made up of Gaiman's nightmares, nightmares that no one but his therapist should be exposed to.The title misleads. These are two words (American and God) that are held dear to many. This book is NOT about America and is NOT about Gods. Rather, it takes place in America and IS about nightmares.I will ask Neil Gaiman to please warn us somewhere on the book about what it IS actually about.I threw my copy away. For anyone considering buying this book: I strongly advise against it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most over-rated author of our time","review":"For the life of me I can't understand why this guy gets all the acclaim that he does. His books are no more than blatant rip-offs of Stephen King et. al. This guy at 'best' should be a CO-script writer or editor for a Sci-fi channel series or something. I picked up American Gods on the recommendation of \\"friends\\" and I found it to be unoriginal and boring, with unsuccessful attempts at \\"shock\\" in between. The characters are are irritating and mindless and you find yourself wishing they would die. One review I read of this compared to a modern day \\"On The Road.\\" Yeah. Right. As much as I didn't like that book either, at least I can acknowledge that Kerouac had genuine writing talent. Gaiman is a hack who just liberally \\"borrows\\" inspiration from others without adding anything substantial. He's not even a speck on Stephen King's shoes. Gaiman's a hack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clumsy","review":"Admittedly, I read only a few pages. The language was clumsy, the descriptions were mundane, and the characters were goofy. I'm a fan of Gaiman's \\"Sandman\\" series, but this novel is just childish."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mess","review":"The book starts out in prison, and immediately kills the first nice character that comes along - Shadow's wife. He is released, and heads for home. We are told of this great love they had, but there is no emotion in this character whatsoever. The next female character devours a partner in the act of sex as he worships her as a Goddess. Honestly, I gave up shortly thereafter. This book did not kindle my interest at all. I had hoped it would be spiritually uplifting, something to link Americans with the deities of their own land. Instead, it began ugly and dark, and I saw little to cause me to think it would improve. Very disappointing, considering that friends had recommended this as a must read. It's a work of fiction, of course, and it seemed to be in the genera of books that take themselves too seriously, where darkness somehow equals depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Bad Bad!!!","review":"I have never read Niel Gaiman before picking up this book. I do not plan to read him again. The entire plot is pointless, and absurd. The old gods are envious of the new gods. Who cares! If you like to waste time reading bad books then by all means pick it up, otherwise don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird Crap","review":"Starts off with a weird sex scene and morphs into a collection of weird stories. Got 2/3rds through it and trashed it. What a waste of time. I am reading \\"State of Fear\\" br Micheal Critchen. Much better read. Some people seem to like artsy crap just because it offends people. Why?Waste of money - as I tried an author I was not familiar with, which is good to do. But not Neil Gai man again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaiman's Best (so far)","review":"I'm actually not sure what to say. The central premise that the new gods were coming to drive out the old gods seemed very intriguing, and there were certainly some interesting characters along the way. But the way things resolve with Shadow bing the son of Odin and stopping the war feels contrived. The dead wife feels like a Deus Ex Machina at times, and the prologue doesn't seem to fit. But excellently written - 600 pages rarely go by this fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Gods rocks","review":"I've read the earlier version of American Gods many times, so I notice the changes ... and approve of them.Hard to believe that so good a book can be bettered.Its only flaw, in my opinion, was that Neil didn't mention until late in the book that his protagonist is a person of color. In the US, and especially in the south, this would still affect how people treat him. Perhaps not so much as was true 50 years ago, but still ...Now, it's mentioned in an early scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute JUNK!","review":"Because I wasted so much time trying to read this book I'm leaving this short.I was told that this was a great book by a hand full of people and they said I would love it. The premise was great, it was nice and long so I figured I was in for a really interesting ride. That ride began a bit slow, but had some promise. Halfway through the book I found myself skipping over pages of useless banter and having to start another book just to finish American Gods. Finally, I just started to speed read through the last hundred so pages until the painful ending.Now I have read plenty of over-hyped books and this one takes first prize. Normally, I'll give books I will NEVER read again to the library, but I felt so cheated and pissed when I finished this garbage that's exactly where it went; the recycle bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"This won awards? Really?","review":"Rubish. Good premise, but wasted on a completely unlikable main character who, after being hired as a bodyguard gets kidnapped twice in a several day period. Also bogged down by several x-rated passages that are there only to be x-rated. How edgy! Sorry Neil, I'm sure the Coraline movie will be cute though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"I read this book because both my sister in law and my nephew raved about it but I've never been so bored in my life. Lot of movement in the book but nothing happens and in the end you feel as if you've just wasted your time. There are better books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of paper","review":"I am sorry that I wasted as much time as I did with this pretentious, rambling, uninteresting, pseudomyhtologic \\"novel\\". I found myslef bored most of the times. I couldn't wait for bad things to happen to everyone in the book. And nothing really bad happened becasue none of the characters were believable enough to make me care. Good cure for insonmnia. Otherwise totally poorly spent hard earned money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably as great as everyone says","review":"Neil Gaiman is a wordsmith. I have thoroughly enjoyed his books written 'for all ages'. However, I am very uncomfortable with some 'adult' themes. I couldn't get past the 'eff...' words and some explicit sexual descriptions. I had to stop reading; hence, only two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible waste of time","review":"I was suckered in by virtue of reading all Nebula and Hugo winning and nominated books each year. But folks, the committees were \\"out to lunch\\" on this one. The premise was great, the execution terrible. The plot was lost in blathering vignettes of minute, if any, consequence. At 3/4 through the book, after page flipping through the second hundred pages looking for plot, after exclaiming to my wife: Where's the beef? a number of times, I just gave up. I tore the book into pieces and threw it forcefully into the trash can so nobody could repeat my exact mistake. I do this once every 3 or 5 years. That's how disappointed I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"As a teacher I should have known better but my impulse to buy and read got the better of me. I have to agree with a previous reviewer who said the writing is clumsy and the characters are skeletel, ie 1 dimensional. Scenes were thrown together nonsensically at times. Gaiman adds 2 sex scenes to the book just so they are there - they add no value and serve no purpose to the story whatsowever. I guess they are meant to shock. Without those two scenes however the book might have been approriate reading for my middle school readers - it is written at that level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Reinforces My Admiration for the Writer","review":"I've loved the Sandman graphic novels ever since my younger brother introduced them to me, so I was already a fan. Having heard good things about this book for a while, I finally picked it up while buying \\"Hurricane Charley\\" books. I devoured it. The characters are richly drawn and you can empathize with almost every one. To marry midwest America with ancient mythology - what a tantalizing prospect! And he delivers. Plus, an actual plot that keeps you - or at least kept me - guessing until practically the end. Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even good for the first-time reader.","review":"I picked this book up at a bookstore with no real expectations. The cover is what initially caught my interest, and the blurb was sufficiently attractive, but I never expected this great a read. I figured the book would be a quick, entertaining read, but I fell in love with the book about halfway through. Gaiman's writing is so captivating to me, I can feel and understand every word uttered, and I enjoy it. Soon enough, I found myself completely entwined in the story, feeling everything. I often found a slight grin on my face, or a furrow in my brow, and that's what makes it all worth it. I didn't feel the book was too short at all, (keeping in mind that one of my favourite books of late is House of Leaves, which is like 700+ pages in its twisted glory). I think this is a great read for anyone, weather you are a first-time Gaiman reader or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Road Trip Across America","review":"American Gods by Neil Gaiman is a rollocking road trip through and American littered by Gods large and small that people have been bringing to America since they could get over on boat. Gaiman again takes material and mythologies that are familiar and but dated and brings them to the modern world.This fun fast read that takes detours, back roads, and fast highways that mimic the American Road Trip experience.It's a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing new","review":"This book was certainly a page-turner, but it was nothing new and left me feeling dissatisfied. The basic idea of competing gods with alternate \\"realities\\" like the \\"backstage\\" idea of this book comes straight from Heinlein's \\"Job: A Comedy of Justice.\\" This book would be good for folks who have not read much science fiction, because then they wouldn't know that it wasn't recycled. I'm very surprised that it won a Hugo."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little too terrestrial, but it gets better","review":"During the early chapters, I was a little bored by all the descriptions of who was drinking what sort of tea and even further descriptions by the tea coming out later. However, the book does have Neil Gaiman's trademark wit, and it does (eventually) build up to a very satisfying conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrific and beautiful","review":"Shadow is released after three years in prison, only to find that his wife has died in a car accident. On his way to the funeral, he meets a man who calls himself Wednesday and offers him employment. Shadow, his life shattered, accepts.This brings him into an ever more mysterious world, for Wednesday turns out to be one of the old gods in the New World. There is a battle coming between them and the new gods, the gods of the Internet and the television, and Wednesday is endeavoring to rally his side for this armageddon, with Shadow's help. Caught up in this conflict and being played as a pawn by both sides, Shadow tries to figure out right and wrong, and what his role should be-as contrasted with what Wednesday and the others want it to be.Saying much more would be giving too much away (and I may have gone too far already). Gaiman evokes this world with superb craftsmanship and skill, creating images that are sometimes horrific and sometimes hauntingly beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, it's bad.","review":"Just thought I would throw my lot in with the negative reviews here. I read constantly, and can probably count on two hands the books I started but never finished. American Gods finds a place on that prestigous list. As others have noted, the main character is unrealistic and poorly developed, the storyline wanders, events lack punch, the personification of the gods seem inappropriate. I found the little back-story exerpts of old gods out of place and awkward. And after reading that the ending is a let-down, the only good thing about this book is that I didn't waste the time finishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time.","review":"I keep reading about how great Neil Gaiman is, and he's especially revered by some of my favorite authors (Patrick Rothfuss, for one). This was the first Gaiman book I've read, and it was terrible. Too weird, and his writing style is too often so ambiguous and intentionally vague with it's descriptions that I had a hard time understanding what was going on. I'm no dummy...I have advanced degrees and a high IQ...but I couldn't get a firm grasp on what was happening through most of the book. Just a big waste of time. I'll stick with Rothfuss, Hobb, Redick, etc. To each his own, I guess, but I just don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really boring novel...","review":"Having read several of the Sandman comics, I went into 'American Gods' expecting sharp, incisive wit or at least some degree of dark humor. Sadly, this book delivered neither. The central tenet of the story was interesting, but the basic plot device (i.e. gods mascarading as humans) seemed old after about 30 pages. After that the book was just plain boring. I agree with the other reviewers who said Neil Gaiman should stick to comics..."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Gods","review":"This is the first Neil Gaiman novel I've read, which shows you how slow I am. I first became aware of his writing while reading a comment by the Query Shark on her site.I was struck by the similarity between his writing and that of Stephen King's in the Dark Tower series. It had me wondering who had influenced whom.Shadow, the unwitting protagonist in American Gods, held me captive throughout the novel. His method of handling adversity is a lesson for all mankind, though I hope no one has to endure the trials and tribulations of this main character.Mr. Gaiman's writing style and application of his extensive vocabulary assure that I will continue to read his stories, if only as a lesson in writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real slog","review":"Gaiman is a good, original writer, but this novel was a huge let down. Meandering,slow and fairly pointless as far as I'm concerned, with odd interludes that add nothing to the story. I suppose they are intended to add some kind of epic scope, but the main character is so frustratingly passive throughout that I had to really push myself to finish it, and then was sorry I'd wasted the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Read this based on the other reviews from Amazon readers. This is a great book, very compelling. WHile it would help to know something about the great mythological religions of the past, no knowledge is necessary to find this book intricate and satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this and look forward to reading more books by Neil Gaiman. Prior to this, I only read Good Omens but that was primarily because I am a Terry Pratchett fan. I am glad I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I enjoyed every page of it. The deleted chapter at the end was worth reading too. Hard to put it down"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I loved this book!! This was the first book by Gaiman I read. I fell in love. It was such an original concept, and so well written. Gaiman managed to merge the realistic and the fantastic. Before I knew it, I was hooked. I was totally immersed in his fantastic world. I have since read every other book I could get my hands on by him."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Gods","review":"I really enjoyed how the story unfolded. each chapter held a new piece of evidence, each a surprise and wonder. Neil Gaiman is one of the most vividly imaginative writers i've come across. His words reflect colorful, and sometimes disturbing pictures. It put my over imaginative mind in heaven!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"something for everyone","review":"Gaiman really did his homework when researching religions. I was really impressed with the way the story unfolded."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was on my bucket list of sci-fi books to read...so","review":"So I decide to read the top 25 rated sci-fi books of all time. Enders Game, the whole series, Dune, all of Heinleins stuf, Asimov, Arthur C Clarke. etc etc etc. This book is well written. The author is obviously talented, but the whole story never \\" jelled\\" . By page 350 I was trudging through itexpecting the last 100 pages to be so phenomenally plot twisting, to make the first 300 pages worth it. But it never happened. It fell flat on its face.Usually when i read a good author I crave to try more of his stuff. I will avoid Gaiman , if only because of the book. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Care for It","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but I couldn't get into it. With so many cliches on the shelves, I was saddened that by page 50 I was bored with American Gods. Give it a try, you might like it. Not my style, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best novels I have ever read","review":"An amazing novel beautifully written and executed. The characters and story are wonderful. You cannot call yourself a fan of writing and give this book a bad novel. Too many people come to the book with their own prejudices. Hey, if you want to write your own novel, feel free to do so. Along With Susanna Clarke Gaiman is one of the best writers working in the English language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads Like a First Draft","review":"This book is derivative and meandering. The idea that human belief literally creates and sustains deities is not original. Gaiman's uses this idea in an ambitious attempt to write a fantasy novel that is also a detailed commentary on the role of belief and values in American life. While he deserves credit for trying hard, this book is not very succesful. The quality of writing, including plotting, characterization, and satire, is mediocre. Gaiman's social commentary is conventional. The idea is good and with considerable editing and rewriting, this could have been a decent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never disappointed","review":"Another amazing book from Gaiman. I have lent it to many people and they all share my rave review. Always something unexpected and unique. Highly recomended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grim, gripping, grin-inducing-- all in one book","review":"I'm not usually a fan of urban fantasy but Neil Gaiman is changing my mind. NEVERWHERE is very good, too, BTW. This one is darker but more tightly written. One minute it's hilarious, the next it's gross, the next it's unbearably sad. The characters are wonderfully drawn. The basic concept of the old gods living among us is really well done-- imagine the god of thunder committing suicide from depression, the father of all the gods as a con man. Gaiman has obviously done his research; the details about the various gods add richness to an already rich story. I'm putting up every thumb I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This is one of the most well written books I have ever read. Neil Gaiman has the ability to make characters that you love to hate and hate to love. He easily draws up mental landscapes and populates them with quirky and insanely human characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost me...","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Anansi Boys and Neverwhere, so I was really looking forward to American Gods because I knew so many people that looooved this book. When I finished the first chapter, I was sure I'd be one of them. But by the time I got halfway through, I felt like I was still trying to figure out where the story was going. There were too many scenes that didn't seem all that relevant to the plot. This one just didn't grab me like his others.I know many people value a strong literary voice; I'm not one of them. Gaiman really seemed to capture a nice balance between the literary arts and the pace of unfolding a plot with Anansi Boys and Neverwhere, but I felt American Gods tipped over on the literary side this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, with some reservations","review":"I waited a long time to write this review, mainly because I wanted to read more of Gaiman's work before I wrote this. I read American Gods about a year ago, and I just read Gaiman's other related book, Anansi Boys, yesterday.Of the two novels, I enjoyed Anansi Boys more. American Gods was good, but it seemed to plod along in places. I hate spoiler reviews, but lets just say that the part where the main character is wrapped up in a tree went by very, very slowly. I just think that plot had too many threads-- it was a million minor characters and it made it hard to keep everything together.It's still a good book, because Gaiman is the master of creating alternate universes-- completely plausible environments that make the reader question their own reality. I love that. This is a good book, but I liked Anansi Boys even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"American drag...","review":"Interesting concept, nice style of writing but it starts slow, very, very slowly. Sure it picked up speed a while through but overall I still didn't love it. I simply didn't care about what happend to Shadow, Laura or Odin - none the characters weren't truly developed, nor did I feel that many of the plots were. I had expected a truly brilliant ending for all those 'empty' pages but it never came.I think I need to stop reading highly recommended books. My expectations are too high..."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time reading Gaiman","review":"Being an avid Prachett reader, I finally got to reading Good Omens. I liked it so much that I decided it was time I read something of Gaiman. Luckily, my sister got it to me for my birthday.It's a really really good book. It's both entertaining and educating. I learned from it more about folklore and myth than I did from books dedicated to this very subject.Gaiman is a very talented writer, and I've started sampling his other works on my Kindle, so I guess there's more to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gripping and Involving Tale","review":"Since everyone else has summarized the plot for you -- the ancient gods are alive and not so well in America, and competing with the new gods of consumerist society, and trouble is a-coming -- I'll just stick to the mechanics, This is a beautifully plotted and written book, free of loose ends, and surprisingly well constructed at every turn. It's full of surprises, and you get to feel the identities of all the characters, whether real or 'imaginary.' Maybe it takes a while for the central character, Shadow, to become real, but then, that's probably the idea. I'd vote this the best sci-fi I've read since Cryptonomicon...It would make a great movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Story Telling","review":"No point in writing a plot synopsis on this one, thats all over the product page anyway. What I will tell you is that Neil Gaiman spins an amazing tale here. It's fun and and unique. I really enjoyed this book and the characters, although I did feel that the new gods really didn't receive enough of the story to make them feel relevant, although the plot twist at the end is not something that i expected. Although the book drags on a bit, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"That's Crom, strong on his mountain!","review":"Crom is my god, and he lives in the earth, but I seldom pray to him, he doesn't listen.Gaiman's gods do listen, and even Gaiman listens when his fans ask for more. There's not much to add to the many excellent reviews of this book, but there's also not much added to this edition. If you already know this tale, don't bother with a few extra flourishes. If this is your first experience, you can't go wrong with this edition.Crom laughs at your American Gods. He laughs from his mountain."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book.","review":"Great book. As an anthropology major, I love Neil's thoughtful use of mythology. There is so much there for someone like me who is interested in these relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good dark fantasy","review":"American Gods is the story of an ex-con with the single name of Shadow who is reluctantly recruited to participate in a war of the gods. The ancient gods are fading as they are being forgotten, and new gods, representing television, computers and other modern objects of worship, are coming into power.Gaiman, more well-known for his critically acclaimed comic book writing does a good job here. At times the story does drag a little and at other times he is a little unclear, but overall, he has written a good novel.The obvious influence for this novel seemed to be Harlan Ellison's Deathbird Stories (with its tales of the gods of modern life), and I was pleased to see Gaiman acknowledge this influence in the afterword. In style, however, this book is more reminiscent of Clive Barker at his peak. As dark fantasy, this is a good work, and although there is some room for improvement, I'd be willing to read more by Gaiman."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Beginning","review":"This was my first Neil Gaiman experience, and I can't wait to read much more of what he has created. This novel is not for those who want a short, quick entertaining read, because of the length of the novel and the many short detours. But it presents very interesting views of religion and the significance and value of a single life, along with lots of other stuff. The characters are solid and well-drawn. My only complaint is the name Shadow. It seems too much of a pet's name, especially when his wife calls him \\"puppy.\\" My advice to a reader is to read this book as an experience, not a story, and savor every bit. Neil throws a lot of stuff at you, so be prepared. Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it, and recommend it to anyone looking for something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of time, money, and talent. horrible!","review":"I've been reading the genre as well as world mythologies and stories with gusto my whole life, and cannot recall the last time I've been unable and unwilling to finish a book.

Though the idea is great, it went nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING HAPPENS","review":"BORING.Huge build up about a war amongst Gods...Incessant and irrelevant descriptions...No real demonstrations of Godly Power (or any action for that matter)...Pointless acid-trip dream sequences...The War itself... less than 2 pages.Gaiman managed to make a war uneventful.A concept that should have been action packed and epic...Gives a novella's worth of substance.-Couldve been told in 30 pages"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not for me","review":"I wanted to read a science fiction book. I selected it based upon awards it had won. I enjoyed the first part of the book but somewhere around 200 pages i started losing interest. I hate to say this but at 400 pages i said i give up. I had no desire to finish it and i was just wasting my time trying to complete it. It just kept going and going and nothing to make me want to continue. I feel a huge weight has been taken off me now that i decided to give up on it. This book was a total bore after about halfway. Dont let it torture you onto reading it. And i really wanted to like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innovative and delightful","review":"I bought this book to prepare for a discussion group. I had never heard of Neil Gaiman before, and I am so happy to know this writer's work! This book is a total delight. Original ideas are scarce as hen's teeth, but Gaiman has one here. It is one of the most innovative books I've yet come across.It helps to have some working knowledge of pagan gods so you can get the many subtle jokes woven into the story, but that's really not necessary. It just adds another layer of joy to the experience.Gaiman is one of a kind and is surely one of the best fantasy writers I have read in a fairly long lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"This novel is simply worthless garbage.","review":"With no bearing on reality, a novel had better have some kind of redeeming aspect in terms of story, or insight, or perhaps morality, or... something. This novel has no redeeming aspects at all. It reads like an undergaduate's night-before-deadline stream-of-consciousness brain vomit. Utter garbage, and indeed I threw it in the garbage after disembarking from the plane on which it was the only thing I had to read (after reading the in-flight magazine in its entirety, which was much, much better)."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring nonsense","review":"A fat road novel that goes nowhere fast.

Finding the rare translation might already prove a challenge. The movie with the same name is also worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"B O R I N G and Disgusting .... I threw it away!!","review":"I bought this book when it first came out. I was at the airport and I was travelling cross country and had lots of time on my hands. I gave this book a really good try but it was so incredibly boring, depressing, and frankly disgusting that I ended up throwing the book in a trashcan at the airport.. something I have never ever done. I didn't even want to pass it on to anyone in the event they might enjoy it even though I hadn't. It was just THAT bad.At the time I bought it, it hadn't won any awards. In fact, as I was browsing Amazon, I was shocked to see the rating this has book acquired. I just did not find a man consumed by a prostitute, in a very disturbing manner, all that entertaining (I won't describe it beyond that because I want to keep this review clean). It was, quite simply, gross. The story is depressing, too. Blech. It's just a loser.I am an avid reader and I treasure books. This was not worth the paper it was printed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"drivel","review":"It's hard to believe this book could win any award. I found the characters mostly wooden and not believable. The plotting mediocre and nothing intellectually very interesting either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, I have such a thing for savior stories...","review":"\\"American Gods\\" is about a normal guy with his past in shadows, not only to others but also to himself. After he gets out of jail and tries to return home -- wherever that is, as it's not where it was before his incarceration -- he encounters many beings of dubious diety while wandering the heartland of America. Things get tangled, loyalties get challenged, duties get passed back and forth. And our hero's past, present and future become clear. The last few chapters, for me, were truly moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind-numbingly Awful","review":"There is absolutely nothing to recommend this book. The idea is old and has been done several times before, to much better effect. The characters are two-dimensional, dull and unreal- if the author knows anything about humanity, he's not showing it. The actual plot (fragmented, dull and thin as it is) ends at least 100 pages before the book itself, maddeningly dragging on with an unfinished idea from much earlier on, finally finishing on a note that strains to be profound but just comes off random, stupid and unnecessary. Save your money, time and mental peace that comes from not wasting the first two on a worthless example of thoroughly incompetant writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh, god... more bad writing","review":"Yet another work whose premise is great, but is very poorly executed. This book joins the millions of other failed attempts at something truly good. Character development is terrible and clumsy. I could say a lot more, but end the end I would just have to say that I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"First novel in 4 years I left unfinished","review":"I've read maybe 90-120 novels the past 4 years ranging from classics like Shakespeare's plays and 19th century Russian novels to Tolkien and Stephen King. For some reason American Gods left me with an utterly disgusted feeling after 70 pages. I threw the book in the trash at Seattle airport. Maybe it was a way too realistic description of our time and society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to believe people are reading the same book...","review":"I bought this on the strength of it's reception of the Hugo award and was initially very excited to read it. However, I ended up very dissapointed. As many others have noted: the characters are weak; the writing is poor; and the plot is about the most plodding I have read in a long time. The last point is perhaps the worst ... it was just not an entertaining read. This book is not a page turner.I note many other reviewers at the other end of the spectrum: a 'seminal' novel, a dark sense of humor, amazing allegory, 'you have to think to read it', etc. I just can't relate to these...I find it difficult to believe they were reading the same novel. I particuarly don't understand the 'humor' aspect of many comments...I found nothing funny at all in here, not in the least. If you want funny (and an excellent book overall), I would recommend Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this book win a Hugo?","review":"I picked up this book on the recommendation from a friend who raved about it. Sorry, but I don't see the appeal. The first couple of chapters were interesting, but then the book just petered out and become dull. I usually read books fairly quickly, but I found little motivation to return to this story. I forced myself to finish the book only to see if it was ever going somewhere. Sadly, it did not. Just when I thought Gaiman was going somewhere with the plot, he would consistently muse about nothing. Must have been very slim pickings for the judges to have picked this one for a Hugo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This is a boring book and not written particularly well. Nothing much happens in this book. I must admit the premise is fantastic, a great idea, but the delivery of the idea was such a let down. All the fantastic mythical stories were there from thousands of years of mythology but I found the manner in which the story was strung together amazingly unimaginative. The book could have been so much more.All of the negative reviews on Amazon seem to touch upon the point that this book is incredibly boring at times. I found it a real struggle to finish. So many clichés (\\"he came to a fork in the road\\") and predictable plot elements destroyed the book for me. Buy the book if you like badly written ones, and also if you like a book to be lightly strewn with irrelevant overly-descriptive gratuitous sex scenes. God-porn is something I hadn't heard of before I read this. An absolute burden of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I represent a small Minority","review":"I wanted to take some time before I write a review, just to calm down and sort out my thoughts. I know, I represent a small minority of readers. Why? Because I disliked the book. My personal description of the book is the dumbest book of the year 2007(I finished the book just before Christmas). I don't know why people like it so much.I didn't like Gaiman's style at all.The protagonist is a fool and you get tired of him 1/4 into the book as well as from others. There is no humour, the story and characters are flat and not interesting.I just had to force myself through the story because:a) so many people recommended itb) to be qualified to judge the bookc) it was a long flightI believe I am going to avoid Gaiman for quite a while. He is definitely not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Read this book after a friend recommendation. Very good choice since I like realistic/fantastic books and that the plot is starting really early. Easy to read, new concept, I would recommend it to mostly everyone looking for something new to read"},{"rating":"2","title":"10th Anniversary Edition Win","review":"I love Neil Gaiman - he is not my favorite Author, but he is in the top ten and an important voice in my generation. I love his mix of relevance and the fantastic. I felt a little like I was getting hit on the head with this book at times - but patience paid off - I think the Odyssey nature of this book was instrumental in the end. I highly recommend it.The Kindle version was flawless - again as it should be. There was nothing to hinder the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, nice writing and fun characters...but boring book....","review":"I loved the premise of this book, it was creative and had so much potential. The writing style was fun to read and delicately playful. The characters were neat. However, the plot dragged... and dragged and culminated into nothing....I was very disappointed because at the end of the day if the book doesn't tell a good story, well then it just ends up being a boring and horrendous waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairy Tale for the adults","review":"sometime you come upon a story that strums all the right strings in your soul.I guess this is one such story for me.Admittedly just about every story by Neil Gaiman that I've read has had this similar effect on me.The American Gods stands out even among his works.There is something familiar about all the characters, something everyday. God or demigod or mythical creature. We do see them on the commute, and at the store, or live next door to them. Their story is both glorious and sad, terrifying and comical, and rings true even if it's just a modern day fairy tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond his Depth","review":"Neil Gaiman is beyond his depth in this novel. He simply can't write a successful or substantial novel yet. He still needs the padding of comic illustrations. He writes excellent short stories, but hasn't mastered the art of writing a book. The editor should have cleaned up and shortened the book as it rambles and tends to veer off into plot developments that don't add anything to the story. The premise of the book was very interesting, but the execution lacks clarity, character development, and suspense. I found myself not caring about the main character, as he seemed a bit dim-witted and uninteresting. The \\"American Gods\\" that littered the chapters were cartoon sketches of beings that should have had more spiritual mystery or meaning. I found this book hard to finish, at the end I simply didn't care about the resolution of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK book but not half as envolving as I thought it would be.","review":"I had read you couldn't put the book down, that it was insightful that the story was amazing and thought I didnt hate the book, I kept waiting for something interesting to happen and it never did.I read the book To the Vanishing Point a few years ago and it was simular and I enjoyed that better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaiman got into my head","review":"I read this book just after it came out. I first became aware of Mr. Gaiman through the Sandman series, and was eager to read more of his work. When I started reading this book, everything else stopped, because I couldn't put it down. At night, I would have dreams that seemed to lead right back to the book. It's not often that you find an author who can get that thoroughly into your head through a book, but Neil Gaiman is one of those rare few."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why so many negative reviews?","review":"I have only read American Gods and Neverwhere. I will start by saying that Gaiman goes much deeper into American Gods with describing characters and settings. I was captivated by both and I agree that there were more comical parts in Neverwhere. However, Neverwhere is not in the same leauge with American Gods. This book is for much more mature audiences and some may not be able to handle that. It is a much harder read, but that does not mean it is not as good as Gaiman's other works. Its genius can be compared to Pynchon's \\"V\\". Honestley, after reading some of Stardust and all of Neverwhere I have come to a conclusion: it would not be a stretch to say that Gaiman's only great work is American Gods. It is the only book that sets him apart from other writers in the field and beyond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I read as much of this as I could waiting for it to get good. The result? It disturbed me so much I had to get it out of my house immediately. If you enjoyed Anansi Boys, Neverwhere, or even Gaiman's short stories, don't expect this book to measure up...I found it light on engaging storytelling and full of graphic descriptions seemingly included only for shock factor."},{"rating":"1","title":"just kind a stupid","review":"I really did not enjoy it. It seemed too fantisafull for me. Maybe I just don't like that kind of book. I read another of his books & semi liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome awesome awesome...","review":"Go ahead and look up the people- and place-names as you read, it will enrich the experience so much for you.

But simple this story ain't! This book is a journey through America through the eyes of Neil Gaiman:The Master who gave us The Sandman. When reading this book, keep this in mind:Don't let any detail pass you by. Things have a way of relating to each other as the story progresses. I'm going to leave it at that, because to say any more would spoil the surprise..."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word... Ugh","review":"I rarely feel as though a read is a waste of time, however, this one was a total waste of brain space.A thoroughly boring and laborious process which I continued only for the sake of my OCD tendencies to finish what I had started. I contemplated dropping the book on multiple occasions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly Plotless","review":"OK. I know this book has won just about all the big awards, but I found it to be nearly a plotless meandering that I had to work at to finish. I enjoyed Gaiman's run on Sandman a long time ago, but I don't think I'm a fan of his more recent work, both the Eternals and 1602 made me yawn. This book as well; it's more like a bunch of short stories loosely woven together. I'm not a fan of short stories, so it didn't work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A captivating story!","review":"Shadow is released from prison early after receiving some sad news. On his way home from prison, he is followed by a man whom he can't seem to shake. When this man, who refers to himself as \\"Wednesday\\", begins to appears uncannily at all places that Shadow travels, Shadow's interest in him him becomes more acute to the point that he finally agrees to take a job with him. Shadow is not entirely certain of what his job entails, though.This story walks a delicate line between reality and fantasy, incorporating characters who may, at first glance, seem normal but are not. In addition, there are many dreams that Shadow experiences that also make it hard to distinguish between fact and fiction in his life. Shadow, however, is a likeable fellow and one with whom the reader sympathizes and wishes well. It is for this reason that this novel succeeds so well. For every difficulty that Shadow faces, the reader is left hoping he'll make it through his bizarre experiences unharmed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dark Look at America","review":"I was surprised by how much I liked this book - I'd never beenable to get into Gaiman's work before (particularly Sandman), butI found this to be one of the strongest works of modern fantasyI've ever read.This is a different kind of road trip and it tells the storiesof many gods, both living and dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I was very much looking forward to reading this book because I really enjoyed Neverwhere. The premise and beginning of American Gods were great but the second half was terrible. The \\"plot twist\\" and climax were very poorly thought out and not interesting in the least. It seems like Gaiman got tired of writing this book half way through and just scribbled down some nonsense to finish it. I'll think twice before reading another of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"sandman rehash","review":"Reading Neil Gaiman's Sandman series of comic books was a life altering/enriching experience for me, and keep in mind I am not much of a comic book reader. That said, American Gods seemed to be derived largely from the idea of gods existing and fading largely by the depth of the populations belief in them: a core plot motivator in the Sandman series. What you don't get in American Gods is amazing graphics, characters you really give a flip about, and an intriguing 'oh my gosh where will this go next?' page turning plot.Do yourself a favor. Order Gaiman's Preludes and Nocturnes instead, and read the idea behind American Gods. His novel format retelling isn't worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huh!?","review":"A very different take on what Americans believe and why. Although very imaginative in its writing, and expertly written, this book only adds to the milieu of books and movies about thing that Americans seem to be obsessed with, i.e. vampires, ghosts, gods of all varieties, and all of which do not exist. How about a little reality for a change?"},{"rating":"1","title":"American Gods, very disappointing","review":"I was terribly disappointed. \\"Neverwhere,\\" by the same author, was the \\"One Book/One Chicago\\" recommended by Mayor Daley a few years ago. I loved it and thought I would enjoy \\"American Gods.\\" A great concept but the narrative moves way too slowly and there is none of the sparkling dialogue or character development that made \\"Neverwhere\\" so enjoyable. I was also disappointed in Gaiman's introduction to \\"Gods.\\" Very unseemly, indirectly insulting anyone who criticized it. Shame on you< Neil."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good fantasy novel","review":"A hard-to-put-down and very enjoyable read. A nice fantasy novel, sprinkled with allusions and reminding to dig deep in one's memory of mythology. The characters are easy to relate to and draw you in. Gaiman certainly has a message, but I didn't think it was the profound philosophical statement on the American spirit that some have taken it to be. Generally, highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant invention of an American mythology","review":"Neil Gaiman is a treasure, and everything he does is worth a look, but this is his greatest work. A tale of an America where the gods and folk traditions of other lands are brought to our country as part of the immigrant experience, American Gods sees a world of Gods and sacrifice in the everyday experience of our lives. While the plot tells the story of a conflict between the new gods of technology and the old gods of tradition, the most powerful parts (which can be read almost like short stories) describe the harrowing tales of immigrants, slaves and raiders who came to this country still in need of the help of gods of their forefathers (and mothers) and who are willing to trade important things for their survival. Exceptionally clever, dark, funny and moving, I can't recommend this book highly enough. Oh, and it will soon be a series on HBO, so read it before actors become too associated with these amazing characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"College text","review":"This book was selected to be used as a college text for an English class.

The idea regarding our Gods was an old idea with an interesting twist, well worth the read with rounded characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange, but nice","review":"With a rambling plot that doesn't end up where you expect it to - three or four times - this book is incredibly hard to categorize. It's fantasy, it's edgy urban thriller, it's murder mystery, it's hallucenogenic magic realist literature, it's horror ... it has old gods moving among us, a walking corpse, secret agents, and small town life. Honestly, it's not quite what I expected (and I'm a long-time Gaiman fan), but I kind of liked it. He's said in his online journal about it that it's designed to repay rereading - that after reading it once, you should come back and enjoy seeing where he set things up, the motions backstage in the magic act that is this book. I don't know that I will, but it was worth reading. Try it from a library, if you don't feel like justifying $20 worth of book; it's impossible to say whether you'll like it or not until you've read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"But it echoes Doug Adams","review":"Good writing, good pacing, but I couldn't help but wonder at this book's treatment of a theme similar to that written by Doug Adams several years earlier in \\"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul\\". Adams' treatment was comedic, rather than dramatic, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!!","review":"American Gods was the first book I read by Neil Gaiman. I am hooked because of it. This book is about a man named Shadow who gets released from prison and finds out his wife is dead. He begins working for a mysterious man named Wednesday and all sorts of bizare things start happening.I dont want to give too much away, but it is definitely worth the read. I \\"read\\" this one as an audio book. It was very well done. You can completely tell the difference between each character. And believe me when I say, that is a big deal. There are TONS of different characters in this book that you have to keep straight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius!!!!","review":"Mr. Gaiman has become one of my top ten favorite authors. He is able to paint characters that you swear you will meet on the street. I find I am transported to places where reality blurs and yet brings the real world into sharper focus at the same time. What an imagination! Thank you, thank you for many hours of fascinating reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recommend Adams over Gaiman","review":"A much better and funnier take on forgotten gods is Douglas Adam's The Long Dark Tea Time of the Soul. I found it hard to read Gaiman's book without thinking that he stole the main plot points of Adam's book, and added a lot more fluff and sex to pad it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and unique story.","review":"My first Neil Gaimon book and I thought it was a pretty good story. If you are into mythology at all you will probably like it even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will not disapoint","review":"This book will not disapoint, if you have even heard of Neil Gaimen this book should be on your must read list.

An epic tale that is a must for those of us who are lovers of mythical characters & creatures. The common interwoven with the unreal in a convincing manner is a tribute to your writing skill. I had known of your name from your comic book work, but had never read anything of yours until now. It makes me wonder what I have missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for thought","review":"I really enjoyed this book, and I had a hard time putting it down. It made me think a lot about the nature of divinity, about the place of the old gods in the modern world (though I was disappointed not to see any of mine in the book), and about what kinds of things Americans seem to \\"worship\\" nowadays. The conversations I've had based on this book were quite interesting. So maybe as a novel it's not the best ever (though it's quite good), but as a starting point for pondering and conversation, it's superb.(Plus, Odin's conversation with the \\"Pagan\\" in the coffee shop was quite familiar to me, and good for a laugh.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"At first, this book seems to have a simple set-up with a ex-con finding out that his wife died. But then more and more characters get thrown in (although most are rather minor) The presence of new gods - like Media - made the book intriguing, as well as different gods doing different things or simply living as mortals. Overall it was a good read and I would have given it five stars if it wasn't for the anticlimatic ending.Personally, my favorite character was the Queen of Sheba/Bilquis. I loved the scene where she was eating the guy, and I was rather sad with what happened to her. She certainly didn't deserve to end that way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I fell in love","review":"I wasn't quite sure about this book when I first started reading it, but as I understood more of the story I ended up really loving this book!

Makes you think very closely about your way of life. I do recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive and confusing.","review":"I'm sure this would have all made a lot more sense if I were, say, a specialist on gods throughout all cultures all over the world during every time period ever studied by man.However, I am not.Overall, I thought the main character was underdeveloped, the story was drawn out in painfully pointless details and scenes, and the climax was utterly pointless, especuially in light of the ending.Ultimately, I found the book to be well-written but not my style.Read \\"Neverwhere\\" if you really want something fun. This just lacks color."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big pile of \\"meh\\"","review":"I just finished American Gods. I've read that along with his novel Neverwhere and some of his graphic novel series, Sandman. I am prepared to say I don't see why he's such a big deal. I found American Gods to be self-indulgent and mostly just plain boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't draw reader in","review":"The basic flaw of this book was that the inherent disinterest that the protaganist, Shadow, has in the events happening around him gives the reader the impression that this aren't really amazing events and shoThere's a plethora of fascinating characters in this book, but there's no glue that binds the whole story together because the main character doesn't give a damn about anything. I was more interested in when the clunker was going to fall through the ice than anything else. If the protaganist doesn't find interest in anything else in the book, why should I?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe in Everything","review":"Shadow gets out of prison only to find that his beloved wife is dead. He then takes a job from a strange old con-man in which he learns that all the gods, new and old, are real; they want to use him as a pawn in a dangerous game where dreams and magic shape reality, and he isn't being told the rules. He learns that coins can save or condemn, but in the end are just tools in a shell-game. Shadow also learns that his wife will always be there for him when he needs her most, even after her death. \\"American Gods\\" is a strange and uplifting journey through the history, legends, side-shows and small towns of the United States of America, as well as a personal grief process, through which a man finds himself again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaimans best?","review":"Would love to see Mr. Gaiman follow this up someday......please?

I had zero connection with the main character. The story is bafflingly disjointed. I purchased it solely on the 5-star reviews here on Amazon, an impulse buy. Never again.There are some interesting elements and concepts, for sure. But it's a mess. I struggled to finish it over two months, when a book this size should take me 2 weeks max. SO PAINFUL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grossly over-rated. Wait to get it from the $2 bin if you must read it.","review":"After reading the author's over-puffed introduction to the book where he states that his 10 year old book was so good that he decided to add more for this edition, I should have stopped there. The story had promise, but wanders all over the place and only about half of what is written actually contributes to the story. Most of it is just rambling crap. It's comical that author feels that just because his characters visit a few roadside attractions and travel to Las Vegas that he has \\"captured a sense of America\\". Really?..... I don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turned Me Off To Gaiman Forever","review":"Don't be decieved by the raving reviews you'll see about this book. The homosexual crowd has banded around it to cause this. This book is painfully bad in every way. It's not just the homosexual make-out scene that's done in such a way that even homsexuals gag while reading it. The first 75-pages of the book could be a used as a classroom example of wasted words. Actually the first 100-pages could easily be condensed to 15 without losing a thing. That's perhaps the worst thing about the book. Take out the insipid homosexual scene and cut it down to 50-pages and he could have had a nice little novelette. Instead you've got a book that will have you skimming through every page. Wasted words equal wasted time. Don't waste yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Of All-Time?","review":"If not the worst, it must be darn close. If you aren't a homosexual and/or have mush for a brain, stay away from this trite book. It has absolutely nothing to say. Most people don't get past the first 100 pages before throwing it away. (Wish I had known before buying it.) Fortunately, with a Kindle you can just delete the damned thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much symbolism abounds","review":"This is one of those books that people either really hate or really love. Myself, I enjoyed it. Some reviews on Amazon.com reveal how some readers thought it was hard to get through--somewhat slow. I can understand why people would think that, but I found myself trying to interpret what Gaiman is trying to say. Much symbolism abounds in \\"American Gods.\\" Not a quick read, but for me, it was worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaiman continues to please","review":"I enjoyed this book thoroughly. Gaiman is definitely one of the more imaginative and original SF/Fantasy writers of our time. While the Old Gods v New Gods and reluctant messiah angles have been worked before, the quiet, down-to-earth tone and real-life settings of American Gods lend it a flavor which keeps your interest. I live near and have visited some of the places in which this book takes place, so perhaps I'm getting something out of it which others might not: but I think that there's a realistic texture to this book that adds to the enjoyment.I do, however, think that \\"Neverwhere\\" is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unrealistically Entertaining","review":"Shadow, the main character, is a likeable fellow. He is a model of a good-at-heart kind of a guy with his own sins or shortcomings to live. His surreptitious quest moves along pretty swiftly. Furthermore, Mr. Gaiman, the ultimate creator of amazing characters, is very perceptive of area slang all across the United States - at least, the route that Shadow trudges - and he amicably brings them alive on paper in compelling dialogues. His tale is a mixture of fantasy, myth, science fiction, love story, mystery, action, and comedy. All burning questions are duly answered at the end of the novel. Mr. Gaiman's brilliance and phenomenal inventiveness has resulted in a book that is a page-turner from the beginning until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but something missing","review":"The majority of reviewers are right, this is a great novel and well worth reading. The only thing I can say is that there seems to be something missing. That something that takes a novel from being a good novel, to making it something meaningful. When I finished the novel, I was left wondering what it all meant.However, as I said before, it is a great novel and fun while it lasts. Maybe it will speak to you more than it did me."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Just that Nothing Happens","review":"After hearing so much about this book, I thought it would be only fair to read it a few years after it has been out. But as another reviewer already wrote, this book is \\"numbingly SEDENTARY\\". It's painful to read as there are sentences that don't belong. There are too many \\"gods\\" who disappear and really have no significance. Basically, it's about a bunch of people (who are gods), that sit around, drink coffee, smoke, and bull. Really.I can't believe I paid for this crap.I'm giving it 2 stars because the Gods idea is cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and entertaining","review":"A truly interesting read. Neil spins a rollicking, twist filled adventure tale full of colorful character. Wednesday alone is a reason to read the book. A good story. Great entertainment; however while this book spins a great yarn and fascinating history, it does not present its characters with as many levels of complexity as say, Neil's Sandman works. The characters are interesting and not mere black and white, but the they firmly stick in their allotted shade of grey without shifting much. Still, the plotting is near perfect. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and Disappointing","review":"I love unique and quirky and often like a lot of stories with a science fiction or fantasy slant. I had high hopes for American Gods but came away disappointed, and I'm perplexed at how much other people enjoyed it. I struggled through many of the sections and ended up just skimming through the end until the final chapter ... and I don't think I missed much. There were elements I found interesting and one or two developments I found surprising, but character development was lacking and I found a lot of the narrative simply exhausting.The only other thing I had read of Gaiman's was Coraline, which I did like. Maybe some day I'll give Neverwhere a try, but not until I've read something else more rewarding in the interim."},{"rating":"1","title":"So long!","review":"The premise of this book has been done before. It's a good premise but Gaiman drew the story out too much. The beginning kept me interested, but it got real dull and boring. At times, I kept wondering when things were going to happen. I know it's an epic story and I should sit back and just enjoy the writing, but I started not caring. The final 50 pages of the book finally picked up, but I had to trudge through 500 pages to get there.I actually liked some of the side stories more than the main story.First Gaiman book and I don't know if I want to read another if this book is indicative of his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quantity not Quality","review":"Unlike Gaiman, I'll keep my comments brief. His plot and storyline could have easily been condensed into a 50-page novella. The characters are one-dimensional and hollow. Much of his scenes and descriptions are filler. Gaiman could argue that gee whiz, that's the whole ironic, clever point! Still, it doesn't take 500+ pages to do that. By the way Neil, in case you didn't know, dream sequences are quite cliche these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"no meat in this one","review":"the idea of gods in modern times is not new, and even if it was, i'd expect the author to give us some substance whether it be in the skilled use of scientific or historical info, but there is nothing of interest here, no intracacies or complexities. i expect the book won the hugo on the popularity of the author's graphic novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly disappointing. I really wanted to like this book.","review":"Ultimately, this book felt like an old friend letting me down.I have read a large number of Hugo and Nebula award winners. This book doesn't fit. I read all of the praise for this book. I listened to a podcast of the author talking about The Anansi Boys. This book is simply a let-down. You keep reading it knowing that at any moment you will be rewarded with a masterful Hugo-calibur novel, but it never comes. The book only becomes interesting right at the very end, and then just as your interest is finally roused, ...well... the book ends. The main character, Shadow, is apathetic and the author captures that beautifully by completely eliminating any character development or interesting action for Shadow."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Michael Chabon thinking?","review":"I love Michael Chabon and I bought this book because the cover contained a supportive quip from Chabon. I'm 100 pages in and I have found no compelling reason to be interested in the story or any of the characters. It reads like the random wishful thinking of a 17 year old boy. It is full of scenes where just as it looks like the protagonist is in dire straits, some unexpected super natural randomness saves the day. It might make a good movie for me to watch because at least I would be soothed by my bowl of popcorn and the knowledge that it would be over in 90 minutes. I think I must have dipped into a genre that's not for me. There must be an audience for this novel, but I'm not part of it. I'm moving on to something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Waste of the Author's Talent and of the Reader's Time","review":"At the least, a good novel should achieve one of three goals: to entertain, to educate, or to inspire. In \\"Neverwhere,\\" Mr. Gaiman nailed the first of these. Here, he gives glimpses of his talent (the sub-plot in the Wisconsin town is very well done), which only makes this mess of a book all the more disappointing.Mr. Gaiman apparently wanted to write an \\"important\\" book, so he chose an \\"important\\" theme (and title). In the process, he established what should become the \\"Gaiman Rule\\" of book selection. If (a) the author achieved his fame in writing fantasy literature, (b) the book title and/or subject includes \\"Gods\\" (note the plural), and (c) the plot includes any variation on a crucifixion, avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Junk","review":"I bought American Gods because of all the hype and because I had read Neverwhere and loved it. All I can say is that American Gods was a failure... I can handle machco, but the writing was poor and poor writing is unforgivable. Where was his editor? I especially loved lines such as \\"She entered the room through the door.\\" So? She was in a funeral home. What was she going to do, pop in through the window? Neil Gaiman is not a great writer; he is an opportunist taking advantage of a book-buying public no longer capable of reading anything more sophisticated than a three line blip thrown across a televison screen. I wasted my money. Boo hoo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Gaiman is an intriguing talent. While the ideas which drive his writing remain inventive and interesting, his ability to capitalize on these ideas is lacking. This results in books which appear interesting in brief plot reviews and back covers, but are unsatisfying when read as books. American Gods suffers from poor characterizations, bad dialogue, and ideas which are never explored past the superficiality of the back cover. Indeed, the main plot consists mainly of creating a world which could be fairly interesting, but then spending the latter half of the book destroying it with slapdash plotting. The poor plotting makes it seem as though Gaiman was merely trying to get the book out on time by throwing things into the book and resolving any problems by deus ex machina. On the other hand, I found one of the subplots to be fairly compelling. In all, though American Gods is full of ideas which could be interesting if explored, this book never reaches its potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to cherish","review":"Neil Gaiman's latest is spectacular, complicated and wholly original. When someone sitting next to me on the train was curious about the title \\"American Gods\\", I was hard pressed to come up with a concise description and resorted to describing it as an apocalypse/resurrection myth. I won't recap the plot, since many of these reviews have already done that. Besides, you'd never believe me.There are novels I read greedily, staying up all night to finish them because I can't wait to see how they end. This one absolutely had to be savored, and I tried to make it last as long as possible. I seldom re-read a book (feeling there are too many books I haven't read ONCE to spend precious time repating!) but I WILL read American Gods again, and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out Great...","review":"You have to be a certain type of reader to enjoy this Gaiman work. I have only read one other of his, \\"Neverwhere\\" and I recommend that one highly! But this one has soooo many twists and turns, you feel like you are a rat in a giant maze.The main character, Shadow, lacks depth, and Gaiman segways into so many side stories in order to bring the plot together-you tend to feel like, \\"Gee, is this ever going to get to the point?\\" Overall, I would've rated this higher, but I just didn't enjoy it as much as \\"Neverwhere\\", the plot is very slow and runs into so many walls, you get a headache reading it! Not to discount Mr. Gaiman's writting skills, he is superb at his craft, but I just couldn't get into this one, and had to force myself to finish it. You can try this one if you want, but I would suggest getting it from a friend or the library. But, if you want to read some better work by the author, get \\"Neverwhere\\", it is a much better read that moves a lot quicker."},{"rating":"2","title":"A first- Intellectual fantasy!","review":"Loved it! In a world of Tolkien clones, and never ending cash cow 'epics' it is oh so refreshing to find a truly intellectual fantasy novel. Gaiman has created a novel that the well read individual can read and not feel like they are induldging in the equivalent of a fast food burger. People like Goodkind satasify that certain craving, but you feel vaguley ill after finishing it. American Gods, though, is an incredibly original, intelligent, involving story. Anyone who ever studied world mythology, enjoys sociological observations that are, at time, incredibly enlightening, and likes to read an enjoyable novel needs to check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book With a Meh Ending","review":"Neil Gaiman is a genius, but sometimes he becomes so epic that he has a hard time figuring out how to end things. American Gods is an example of this. The first 9/10 of the book easily get 5 stars from me, but the end feels anticlimactic. Still, it is a staple for Neil Gaiman fans. It is still a must-read, but be prepared for a fizzle out. This is partly because Neil Gaiman write it to feel more episodic and less like a neat Hollywood Script.If you enjoyed this book, you should LOVE Anansi Boys. I feel like Anansi Boys took the concepts explored here and completed them more successfully. I know it is blasphemy for a Gaiman fan to say American Gods isn't their favorite, but this is how I truly feel. It is a very solid 4 stars, but the end left me unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Gods","review":"I dropped out of this one by about page 200. I have read and thoroughly enjoyed Neverwhere and Stardust so I was eager to read this book. Unlike the earlier works, American Gods failed to engage me. I love to lose myself in a good book, to feel like I'm part of the story; but when your main character is unaffected and apathetic to all that's going on around him,as Shadow is, it tends to make the reader feel the same way. I'm sure if I hung in there it would have picked up a bit, but I don't like having to work so hard to turn pages. Life is just too short and there are a lot of good books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"Man, this book was pretty stupid. The concept was interesting, but it just dragged on and on. The ending was unsatisfying. Should have been a novella."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is the first of Gaiman's books that I've read -- I've now requested the others through my public library. I'm not very adept at describing WHY I like a book -- its either go on for pages, or write nothing at all. But I would recommend this to anyone who likes Neal Stephenson's books, or enjoys fiction that makes them think a bit (not TOO much, though). :)Great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intially engaging, but prys itself from your attention...","review":"My initital impressions of 'American Gods' were nearly uniformly positive. Although I had not read any reviews previous, I was aware of the level of hype and praise for this novel. But like a doomed traveler in Fred Pohl's 'Gateway', the book never achieved \\"turn-a-round\\". The central storyline is further and further pushed off, and often seems to occur on the sidelines. Gaiman's prose is engaging and easy to slip into, but I felt empty in the end, without significant payoff or a true sense of journey. Those wishing to delve into urban fantasy may be better served by Tim Powers. \\"Last Call\\" in particular serves as an excellent counterpoint to \\"Gods\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"300 pages in ... so bored","review":"While I like the Shadow character and quite enjoyed the brief enounters with Sam, nothing ever happens in this book. I need a plot, not random and nearly pointless vignettes of small towns similar to those I grew up in. I decided to give it a chance to the halfway mark. I don't get the Gaiman rave, I'll never pick up one of his books again."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Gods","review":"Sorry, not a book for me... Too jumpy, complicated, things left without explanation, confusing. Not a kind of a book that you can get into it and relax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"I was loaned this book by someone whose opinion I respect a great deal. She loved it and thought that I would too. I read and enjoy a lot of sf, fantasy and horror. It's been a long, long time since I've read a book that I wasn't able to finish. After several months, I reached the halfway point in this book and then gave it back to my friend. Why? First, I was bored rigid by it. Second, this kind of book is just not to my taste. I know it's become trendy these days to recycle other countries' mythologies and put them into books, but to me, it's akin to baking a cake from a mix instead of from scratch. I wouldn't call that great cookery."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star to many","review":"This book had an interesting premise, that never got off the ground. You never even learn the main characters name. He spends the first 3/4 of the book blundering along aimlessly following a guy named \`Wednesday' he spends the last 1/4 of the book in what seems to me a justifiable goal of just getting the thing to end.I found it utterly boring and as compelling as toast. I finished it just on the hopes that some characters I didn't like would die."},{"rating":"1","title":"ticked off-waste of time and money","review":"As one other review stated, I kept waiting for the payoff and the brilliance, but it never came. It is a long book and since the book had so many amazing reviews, I thought it would be great, but it wasn't and it didn't really make any sense at all. Too bad the people in charge of getting the book out there, missed the mark so badly.That said, I am happy for any artist that makes it througha nd becomes a success. Neil, better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone up for a healdache?","review":"I'm sorry, but after the first 100 pages I became apprehensive about my chosing this book. I enjoyed the character of Shadow until he began to morph into a bad acid trip. Guess I'm really just not that into the \\"gods\\" or mythology. I'm sure those who DO enjoy Celtic and Native American mythology would be the ones to really get into this book. As far as the other \\"gods\\", I haven't a clue as to what that's about. It gave me a headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"This is one of the few books that I couldn't finish. Discussed it with my friends. They couldn't finish it either. It was hard to read, the plot (what plot?) was incomprehensible. Didn't care about any of the characters. I read about 3/4 of the book before giving up. I dislike not finishing a book I started but this one wasn't worth my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hightly praised, but highly disappointing","review":"After reading all the glowing reviews of this book, I had to give it a shot...This was quite honestly the worst book I have ever read; at no point did I even find this book even slightly interesting. I somehow managed to finish the book, but with each page I turned, I grew more and more resigned to the fact that the book was simply drivel, and disappointment was inevitable."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible!","review":"Absolute boring gibberish and nonsense. Couldn't make it past halfway. Is this just a runaway snowball of people all liking something because everybody else does? It's just maddening trying to read this. Makes me never want to read anything else by him. I must not get it because everybody seems to love this book. Ugh its like pulling teeth waiting for something to happen or something interesting to pique my interest or get me thinking....anything! I can't think of a single good page in the half of the book I forced myself to read. Garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ain't that America","review":"All the really good, intellectual stuff has already been said.I will just add that I picked this up at a used book store, have never read Gaiman before, and had nothing but generic expectations.Great book, great read, strong combination of character, mythic minutae, and story. A myth within a myth. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Gods","review":"Read this if you're looking for something completely out of the ordinary, more occult than sci-fi or fantasy. Masterful descriptions bring this dark, morbid world to life. Gaiman crosses dimensions of life, the afterlife, and otherworlds like a camera cuts between scenes. You will be changed, long after you put the book down. Gaiman \\"shines.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply great","review":"Many people will overlook this book only because it is in the fantasy genre section of the store or library. And they will miss a lot. With many fantastic elements and a fantastic plot premise, the book rightly belongs there, but it is also great fiction.As the main character Shadow is getting out of prison, he suddenly finds himself the assistant of a strange man, surrounded by strange associates. His boss, Wednesday, is mobilizing his associates for a fight against the modern idols. Struggle for power, love, betrayal, loyalty--the book has everything.Many reviewers compared American Gods to Terry Pratchett's Small Gods. And obviously Gaiman and Pratchett have cooperated onm the book (Pratchett is mentioned in the acknowledgements). However, what the book reminded me a lot of is The Master and Margarita, another great novel about religion, love and man's mission."},{"rating":"2","title":"A contemporary fantasy with sophistication and style","review":"This is one wonderful read. From beginning to end, Gaiman hooks the reader with humor, history, fascinating little side trips on the road to the heart of America. From the bar fight with a leprechaun and the beginning to the pagan crucifixion at the end, the book is wrought with stylish images, keen imagination and a look into the soul of a country of blended immigrant cultures.What a wild ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Once is not enough","review":"This is a book you will want to read again as soon as you are done the first time. Gaiman does a supurb job of weaving fairytale, myth, legend, fantasy, and a little science fiction into a complex, tale.Reading this book, I was sucked into the parallel universe Gaiman had created with such detail. You couldn't help but appreciate the time and effort that must have gone into researching and learning about so many different religons and legends. His new twist on these ancient beliefs are what made this book exciting to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book like an onion-- layers and layers the further you go.","review":"American Gods is about, well, american gods. And american myths, and the infinite variety of people and places that \\"america\\" encompasses. This is also Neil Gaiman, so along the way there are significant coincidences, and coincidences-that-aren't, and coincidences-that-REALLY-aren't, and plot twists that seem meaningless at the time but suddenly slot into place so seamlessly that you can't see how you missed the significance the first time around. Misdirection is a major theme of the book, from Shadow's coin tricks to Wednesday's con games and beyond-- another characteristic of America (and of course gods). And then just when you think Gaiman's exhausted his bag of tricks, the epilogue (set outside of the U.S.) throws a whole new light on the events of the book.If there's a problem with American Gods, it's that you'll have to read it three or four times to get everything-- and it will be a different book each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mythological Magic","review":"I read this book in 24 hours flat. I felt bad doing it too since I know it took Neil two years to write it...but how could I help myself? The story was engaging and the writing brilliant. In fact, I plan to read it again this weekend just to make sure I didn't miss anything the first time.Fans of Gaiman's other work will not be disappointed -- this is his largest body of work since The Sandman series. In fact, American Gods may just be the ticket to hooking friends and family members who are too jaded to read comic books.I have a literary pantheon of gods, and Neil is definitely one of the top deities."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Kind of Road Trip","review":"Neil Gaiman has redefined the New World. Just as in Nevermore, Gaiman turned his unique perspective on the everyday and presented us with a strange tale that takes the reader across a different terrain; in this case, America. In American Gods, Gaiman explores that happens to the old gods/ideas when they are replaced by newer versions. The old gods decide that they're not going down without a fight, and each man (or woman) is on his own, with our hero, Shadow caught in the middle. This urban fantasy / adventure has a bit of a dreamlike quality to it, but there is plenty of action and adventure and weirdness to go around. It's a unique story from a unique and gifted writer. Very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaiman is about the journey","review":"In this book as in other Gaiman novels, the characters are the star. The story is good and the settings are OK, but it really is his imagination with the characters that set him apart. The two main characters, Shadow and Wednesday, both are complex and enjoyable. The supporting cast is also really varied. In turns spiteful, ethereal, crass, innocent, folksy, and crumudgeonly, the supporting characters are really rich and is the X factor in making this a really enjoyable read.What I liked:Outstanding characters; varied and imaginativeThough parts were predictable, I thought that the story in general lent itself to lots of surprises.Really fun take on American culture, history, and folkloreMeh:In this as in Neverwhere, the journey was better than the destination. If you are looking for spectacular climaxes, this is not it.I really liked it and I think that others interested in general fantasy will as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I'm a big fan of Neil Gaiman. I go into him when he wrote the Sandman comics. I decided to also start reading some of his novels. My favorite isNeverwhere: A Novel, but American Gods and its sequelAnansi Boysis very good.

It is almost impossible to put down. The poems leap off the page, as if the speaker (\\"Here I am, captured, in my black & white phase\\"-- speaking, in this case of a photograph) haunted the physical pages of the book. Nazarene brilliantly accomplishes this through the dramatic (never melodramatic) staging of the poem on the page, complete with italics, boldface type, jagged lines, etc., but there is nothing unearned here-- as Nazarene says in another published poem (not in this collection): \\"No false moves.\\" While loss is a common thread, and despair never far off, these are deeply religious poems (irreverently so, as in the work of Franz Wright), full of risk and beauty.

I simply have not been able to make any headway into this book and it's drawing methods at all.

Either way it didn't work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just to be fair.","review":"I've just started the long journey and I'm pretty sure that I'll do fine with this course. Obviously I don't expect to become a master artist with only one book, but I think it's a good start.This said, I just wanted to point out that most of the negative reviews are from uninformed people.For example:1) The book was published after Nicolaides death, the students took their master's notes (\\"a book to be\\" so to speak) and inserted the pictures, they were not choosen bye him, he left only text.2) No-one could be called a teacher if he laugh at anyone attempts to teach, especially art! Someone can be a very good artist, but he is no teacher does behave like that.3) Quick magic pills simply do not exists.4) \\"natural way\\" refers to the book aim to teach how to have the right experiences to learn how to learn to draw. At the end of the long journey one is supposed to have gained the tools to learn what to do to became a master.Cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"little un-natural","review":"I beg to differ with the other reviews this book normally gets and is prescribed by virtually every art instructor. I found it to be little unnatural as opposed to 'natural' way of drawing. There is a lot of emphasis on blind contour (which is a good thing to help loosen up) but the way exercises are designed just doesn't fit in today's day and age. It takes away the spontaniety from you if it tells you to sit for 3 straight hours and do this exercise then move on to the next one, so on so forth.The chapter on Drapery is probably the worst and goes nowhere.If you dont't like this book it doesn't mean you are not disciplined. Its just that like everything else in life, people have different likes and dislikes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern art junk","review":"I browsed a copy of this book at the library and I looked at paintings done by Nicolaides on the internet. As far as I can determine, it seems he was just another deluded member of the modern art movement of the early 20th century. I haven't seen any evidence that this book will make someone a good figure draftsman. Justin Sweet's drawings are terrible. I choose not to be one of the lemmings who follow this charlatan Nicolaides. If you want to be a great draftsman of the classical tradition, this book is utter rubbish.

It is hard to tell once the reader's entangled in his verbal trap of dialect, half-baked description, and misguided rhetoric. And none of the characters, with the exception of the black cook, is memorably drawn. We really don't care what happens to any of them.

And that doesn't include the hours of NASA films from the era.There are only two issues I have that keep this from being a five-star review. I'd really give it a 4.5.1) There's the \\"Boom de ya da\\" ad for the Discovery Channel that goes on at the start of every disc you cannot skip.2) The music, while good, gets repetitive and bombastic after a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ CAREFULLY!!!!","review":"Please note this is only 1 disc of the set.

I'm very satisfied with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for science fans","review":"This series is great for any fans of NASA, space, or space sciences. It is done very well. As most modern documentaries and series do, they dumb down the science so that the lowest intelligence can understand. I wish it was a little more science-y. But again this is coming from a guy who just got done reading a physics book for fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great program, decent bandwidth","review":"This was an awesome historical account of our space program that was jammed in to several hours of documented video and interviews. Amazon's Instant Video doesn't always give the best viewing experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific information on the early Space Age","review":"Anyone who followed the beginning of the space age, as I did, will enjoy this series. It contains interviews with the actual astronauts who flew the missions, and also the controllers who sweated every detail while they were in space."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great box set","review":"This is a great DVD, it covers a lot of ground but the music was too loud sometime. I had a hard time hearing the interviews over the music. Other than that it was great! I would recommend it to all my friends"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...","review":"Now we're talking. Documentaries in general are just getting better and better and this movie is superb in every way. It should be like the God Father of NASA films. Every time it was on cable (couldn't remember if it was The History or Discovery Channel), I couldn't takes my eyes off of it. It's also the best movie on the subject thus far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but not enough depth","review":"This documentary could have been terrific, but it suffers from abysmally poor editing and design. \\"Jump cuts\\" are the modern advertising and TV technique of limiting on-screen images to 2-3 seconds each before quickly cutting to the next. This entire series is almost all jump cuts. There are very few sequences longer than 3 seconds. The presumption is that the viewer has an attention span equivalent to a small child. So there's very little depth, and little effort to develop more thoughtful sequences and accounts. Great video footage, good interviews, could have been great, but ends up quite mediocre."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great but.","review":"Lots of unseen footage from the NASA archives, however for far more indepth coverage of the early days and how they got there, the one to buy is 'Rocket Science', which is also available only used now.The major flaw in this series is that they speak nothing of the pioneers of rocketry, i.e. Goddard, Von Braun and Korolyov. Also Gene Cernans' perfect observation to the effect that what a shame it is that he was the last one to be on the moon and that was over 30 years ago.Rocket Science"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought them, but no longer have access to them.","review":"I bought this series, but no longer am allowed to view them.

Gary Sinise narrating only adds to the excellent series of DVDs in this collection. If you enjoy space movies, documentaries, & videos, this is a must see. This set provides many hours of actual, never before seen for most, footage including great commentary from real astronauts such as Neil Armstrong. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Broken cover...","review":"Great content, as expected, but a real bummer when the inside of the cover is smashed up, everything afloat inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning and exciting","review":"A must-have in your library. I'd seen it two years ago with my son and we sat transfixed as the space program flashed before our eyes. Perfect for the whole family. Exciting, educational and emotional. If you love NASA and space and the unknown, this puts it all into perspective. I must say, the packaging...a tin box..arrived slightly dented, so the vendor could have done more to protect it. But the disks are in perfect condition. A great gift for yourself or someone you know would love this type of series. Also, be sure to buy \\"Wingless Flight: The Story of the Lifting Body\\". It's the book that goes in-depth about the real beginning of the shuttle program. Both are must-haves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Video","review":"Not great but it's nice. I got it on one of Amazons deals, probably wouldn't buy otherwise, but it is nice to have. I'm not really into the space stuff so this is just a really basic review. Like the video quality, really like the images of earth and the music selection. To me it's just nice background stuff. We put this on for our 3 year-olds \\"quiet time\\". You can choose from a pretty big selection of classical music to play while the video is on. I haven't really sat down and watched this from start to finish, just listen to the music and stop and watch images as I'm walking by. I've done this enough to have seen quite a bit of it by now though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Set To Treasure","review":"Production quality of this set is top notch. Ok, I was disappointed by the early videos, but I should've expected it. The sound, editing, and footage choices were superb. More than anyhing, this set gives you a strong sense of the significance of the 60's NASA programs. While being fully informative, it also containes some appropriate romanticism and entertainment value. Young people like myself who didn't live through the era will understand WHY the missions were so important in addition to gaining a comprehensive knowledge of them.The only criticism I have is that I didn't really need the disc on post-Apollo programs. I would've happily taken more 60's stuff on the 3rd disc in place of the other recent stuff that I know about. But beggars can't be choosers. The first two discs were enough to make this set worth keeping forever. They are a testament to one of man's greatest achievements. I only hope that our generation will have a calling to something as significant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice peek into space travel history","review":"I certainly liked very much the series.

It's neat to see many of the \\"original\\" astronauts from the '60's & '70's in recent interviews as well as vintage clips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invisible Dial","review":"When a 25 year old clock radio finally needed replacement, I jumped at the pretext to own this design classic. But I packed it for return the day it arrived. The control and tuner dial markings were almost invisible unless the light hit them just right. I know that small, low-contrast control markings are (unfortunately) fashionable, but this was absurd, especially since the tuner has no presets. In the hour or so before I decided to send the unit back, I was thinking about how I would mark on the tuning dial the two stations I listen to. Then it struck me how absurd it was to have to do such a thing to a brand new, premium quality product. Perhaps the individual unit I got was defective, but I didn't feel inclined to start a series of exchanges to find out. Back it went to be replaced, at half the price, by a Sangean WR-2, with which I am well pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Priced!

Clock makes noises","review":"I just had my old MODEL THREE repaired. They replaced the clock. The new clock generates a slight click noise every minute when it moves to the next minute. It is not loud but noticeable in a quiet room. Very annoying! For me the model is unusable as an alarm near the bed. The old models did not have this flaw but a check in a store turned out that the new models all do. Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tivoli Model 3 Clock Radio","review":"The Model 3 Clock Radio is flawed. Its sound quality though is excellent.The biggest problem for me is that the front and back panels are nearly unreadable under most ambient light conditions. The standard lettering and background colors combined with font size and the reflectance of the \\"metallic\\" treatment do not produce enough contrast to promote legibility. A flashlight (held at the right angle to avoid reflectance) is a useful tool for changing frequencies. My Tivoli Model 1 (classic/walnut), in contrast, is much much easier to use and sounds just as good.I agree with another reviewer that another problem with the Model 3 is that the clock is entirely dependent on batteries. It would be better for this AC radio to have an AC clock with a battery backup."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice furniture","review":"overall, good sound and great looksyou pay the premium for the looks - i'd suggest getting the extra speaker to get stereo soundi haven't listened to am radio in years and a great throwbackdial is a bit hard to use going from fm to am if your bands have a high spread (lots of tuning).also, hard to see at night the notches but again, you pay premium for form and not functionalityi am very picky about audio quality and making sure things in my bedroom are furniture and not gaudy - this foots the bill7/10 on audio qual (w/ stereo) 10/10 on looksgood buy for me and nice work to tivoli for id'ing high price yuppee radio market :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Even Think About......$300 paperweight.....well, plus clock","review":"Stay far away from this radio. I'm looking at my broken one right now and feeling very ripped off. My $300 Tivoli Audio Table radio Model Three has started going in to hum mode whenever I turn up the volume even a little. The hum takes over and I have to shut it off, turn it on and try to not raise the volume. Eventually however, it just goes in to hum mode. When I called Tivoli today I was informed that for $75 they would take a look a it. They must be motherlovin' joking. I've got Zenith radios from the Sixties that still never miss a beat and this thing craps out after very moderate use at best. The unit looks cool but the sound leaves much to be desired. I really really regret the purchase. If I can save one person from dumping $300 on this hunk o' junk, I'll feel groovy. Basically you will end up with a $300 analog clock like I have. (actually I like the backlighting that everybody's moaning about)"},{"rating":"1","title":"failed within 2 weeks","review":"This item looks great, sounds great, but the clock stopped working within the first two weeks. As others have noted, the clock and alarm settings are a bit wonky (difficult to set alarm precisely, sometimes alarm will trigger inappropriately when attempting to set) though this wasn't a deal breaker. Deal breaker was when the clock stuck at 5:45, and the time was unable to be changed. No amount of fiddling was able to correct this.

I'm now on the third unit and it has been a complete disaster. The first arrived with the cabinet damanged. The second, the radio didn't work. The third, the clock doesn't work. On top of it, the clock is a cheap battery powered clock that you can get anywhere for about $2. yes the radio works but after the first day being late for work, I was ready to toss this piece of over-priced junk in the trash. And that's what it is, Way over rated, over-priced, cheap junk made in China. Now I have to pay another shipping charge back to some company called HIDEF Lifestyle and hope for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Poor Customer Service","review":"Paid $300 for this clock radio. The radio does not establish a solid connection with its power supply, causing it to \\"drop out\\" frequently. A joker named Ron in customer service confirmed that they have seen this problem in a number of units but otherwise was completely unhelpful (as well as rude). He said the company could fix the $0.50 part for a $75 fee. I have two other Tivoli products. I've always thought the sound quality was good (for what they are), but I will never purchase another Tivoli products. There are lots of companies out there that are producing quality products backed up by good customer service, so there's no reason to roll the dice with Tivoli. Good old Henry Kloss would turn over in his grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Well, I just got to work late again thanks to my Tivoli. This has happened many times. Setting the alarm on this unit should be easier than it is. On a cheap clock radio, all you have to do is turn one switch to - alarm on. On this unit, you must turn on the radio, tune in the station (stations tend to go in and out on their own on my unit - if it's clear as a bell when I set it, I often wake up to static), then hit the alarm button. Even then, sometimes it doesn't go off in the morning. Also,I have never, ever in my life seen a clock in which the minute and hour hands are the same length. I woke up the other night and couldn't tell if it was 12:20 or 4a.m.I got this unit as a wedding gift and it sure is pretty. But you're better off spending 20 bucks on a drug store clock radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this clock radio!","review":"This is the worst clock radio I have ever owned! The hands of the clock are very close to the same length making it near to impossible to tell the time without glasses. The volume is hypersensitive at the lower end which means it either inaudible or blasting. The snooze button makes a loud click when hit and often takes two or three shots to activate and it is preset to 5 minutes with no options. Tuner is fine, sound is a little bass heavy but otherwise fine. They should have stopped there and skipped the alarm option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tuner had major problems","review":"I bought this slick looker for the desk in my office. I had a beat up 20 yo digital clock radio that had poor sound.However its tuner worked ok and I figured with the Tivoli rep I'd get some good listening along with the good looks. My office is inside the facility without windows so reception can be tricky...the tuner for the PA speakers in the rest of the office has to have the antenna just right. I was very frustrated to find that the radio simply couldnt hold a signal. A station would tune in nice but the fade in and out to barely hearable. I bought an amplified antenna but didnt help. Then I tried it in a windowed room and same problem......I was very disapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the clock the sound the radio","review":"the battery powered clock is a good thing try setting the alarm even in the radio mode then pull the plug on the power this thing knows it lost power and goes off anyway it defaults to the beeper in the back of the radio thus we do not miss work, school or whatever our plans are for the day. and if we have power then you start your day with a great sounding radio"},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable marketing tactics","review":"Several months ago I looked on Tivoli's site but did not order. Since that time they have attached advertising stating \\"completeyour order\\" to many other sites I have visited.

I would not buy their product based on this alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze function sucks","review":"Totally agree with the other comments regarding the snooze function. This sucks.The light is also to bright, and its difficult to see the contrasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price of admission. Why? Read on...","review":"I bought this item for it's clean design and great tuning section (their analog radios are way better than their digital models). My complaint is this: The jack where the ac adapter connects malfunctioned within a few weeks of purchasing this product. They sent me a replacement since it was under warranty. Now that the replacement is no longer in warranty the same malfunction has occured. Without power only the clock will work. You can't even change the time without the power adapter. Tivoli said they would repair or replace it for $75. I said no thanks. It seems as if these radios are calculated to break after not too long a time. It's unfortunate that a clock radio that sells for so much money, most would say they are over-priced, can't be constructed any better than this one is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minor startup problem","review":"This unit performs as advertised. Good bass, helps to have second speaker.One problem at startup was the alarm function. It was 1/2 hour off. After several days it is now spot on. Don't know why it had learning problems. To turn off after the alarm in the morning, first push the alarm set button, then turn it off. Otherwise you will get a beeping alarm.The blue clock light could be softer, it is too bright.

I've been using the same Ralph Lauren cutlery for 20 years on my Botanic Garden and haven't had any issues. I've also used it on some Denby plates with no issues. I wonder if it's really due to the ridges in the Sophie Conran plates. The bowls and mugs look great. I love the style and the color but do not know what to do with all the dark marks on my plates.

I packed in two air mattresses (deflated, obviously), a tarp, a lantern, a blanket, sheets, a small tent, a fan, and several other odds and ends. The shoulder strap helps when your bag is heavy, but it does dig into the shoulder a bit. The handle on the ends helps with the loading and unloading in the car part.

It's unfortunate because Dar Williams was once one of the most intelligent songwriters around. Now it sounds like she's writing the kind of music a songwriter writes when he or she has to fulfill a recording contract. Nowhere here is the fiercely individual music heard on \\"The Honesty Room,\\" \\"Mortal City\\" and sometimes on \\"End of the Summer.\\" It all sounds generic, overproduced and heartless. \\"The Green World\\" was disappointing, but not as bland as this.

My favorite songs-- \\"Mercy of the Fallen\\" and \\"The World's not Falling Apart\\"-- have a full sound and building rhythm punctuated by Dar's unique, delicate but powerful voice. There are also excellent acoustic numbers that Dar was first known for, but she's moving toward a richer, fuller sound.

Oh yea... in concert... awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dar not up to par","review":"OK, first off I want everyone to know I've been a Dar Williams fan from the get-go. She has proven to be an incredibly talented songwriter and singer-- her lyrics are poignant and thought-provoking, brutally honest, and magical. Her style of music, at one time beautifully simple, only complimented the depth and quality of her lyrics. With this album, Dar has stepped way outside her bounds as a musician. She distracts herself from her lyrics with complicated arrangements that don't fit with her at all. When doing this it causes the listener to be distracted and takes attention away from what she's saying. The musical arrangements, besides being too complex, don't help her singing style at all. While there are a few redeemable songs on the album (namely \\"The Beauty of the Rain\\"), the album itself is lackluster and is a real step down for this talented singer. I was thoroughly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the best music I've ever heard","review":"Listening to a teen's world of Rap and HipHop, it's really a nice change to listen to something as sweet and sentimental as this.

I like the \\"Fire, Soul\\" song because it's familiar. Just because they're family doesn't mean they're not evil! And I liked \\"Whispering Pines\\"; the harmony was great! This is a CD I could listen to on repeat, in a hammock, on a breezy day, without getting sick of it... Just chilling.

She has a lot of talent. I've been listening to her music since her cover of Better Things off of The End of the Summer, which was very good. What do you hear in these sounds? is one of the best songs about therapy I've EVER heardBut most of the songs here don't really leave much of an impression. Closer to you is a good song, nice and catchy. But a lot of this music is incredibly sad, or at the very least melancholyYou gotta give her points for doing the Bands Whispering Pines, but a lot of these songs don't really move me, and most of the songs I never really wanna hear againI'm sorry"},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointing, repetitive and uninspired","review":"What a disapointment from so talented a singer- songwriter. It sounds like the Dar-of-not-so-old and further- from- folk, but it has none of the spark, the intelligence, the depth of feeling characteristic of previous releases. I fear that Dar's commercial success may be compromising her art. I hope not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overproduced and blah de blah","review":"I was let down. Dar usually comes sparking unexpectedly out of album collections and demands that you recognize her lyrics - toes tapping or spontaineous singalongs. Stories casting a spell with a quiet intensity to them.Not this album.There's simply to many washes of synthesized sound that cover her voice and edge. (Things that made previous songs endearing and impactful.) This 'New Age' sound has swallowed up the vibrant and immediate nature that I was drawn to, but perhaps this could be for you. If you enjoyed music such as Joni Mitchell's latest work or something closer to Enya's otherworldly vibes - check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"It seems to me that Dar Williams has progressed and matured alot since the Honesty Room. Her voice, # of instruments, etc. This CD has some great arrangements. I especially like Closer to me, I saw a bird fly away, and fishing in the morning. Yet as i listen to the CD I find myself wanting to hear more of just Dar and her guitar, like in her early CD's. Sometimes less is more...But good pick overall. Give it a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for both mind and heart","review":"This album sets thought provoking lyrics to beautiful melodies that pleasantly haunt your soul. It was only a few months ago that I unintenionally stumbled upon \\"The Beauty of the Rain\\" (on the internet), and was captivated by the song, and by the extraorinarily gifted, Dar Williams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic Monotony","review":"I understand Dar's need to expand and try new horizons. I also understand Dar's need to go more mainstream, get more fans, and get some popularity outside of the sphere of folk music. But this album is so mediocre that I can't help but be upset. I'm not, as many of her fans are, dissapointed in the more pop approach she has taken in recent years. I came to Dar through the not-terribly-folky \\"End of Summer\\" album, and the more pop oriented tracks on it were also some of the best. However, the raw and passionate production on that album is worlds apart from the dull, luke-warm, generic sound of \\"Beauty.\\" This is the kind of album you'll find richoceting off the walls of Starbucks' everywhere; You'll kind of notice it in the background, but you won't give it even a passing thought. I think Dar is tired, over-confident, and trying to look for popularity in all the wrong places."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting and Beautiful","review":"This was my first Dar Williams CD; I happened upon it through Amazon's \\"Recommended for You\\" listings. Williams' lyrics are poignant and emotional, and her vocals are hauntingly beautiful. Her tone is light-hearted on songs like \\"The World's Not Falling Apart\\", and deeply moving on songs like \\"The Beauty of the Rain\\". If you enjoy the combination of free-spirited melody and heart-wrenching vocals offered by artists like Sarah McLachlan and Jann Arden, you will likely find at least a few songs to love on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent CD!","review":"I first heard Dar Williams on a compilation album from about 10 years ago and I have loved her music ever since. I will admit that I was a little disappointed with the lyrics. I look to the likes of Dar, Ani, and Melissa Ferrick to provide me with the kind of frankness and honesty that sums up my feelings in a poetic way that I cannot provide for myself. This album's lyrics are definitely thinner than her past records and the whole thing sounds a little too much like a \\"Pop\\" record. Still, I love it and have come to love it more as I listen more. It may not be vintage Dar, but it still speaks to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dar Gets Schlocky","review":"With none of the surprises or intelligence one usually expects from Dar Williams, this album deserves every one of the 2 star reviews and on-target criticisms it's getting. I wish she'd ditch her star-spangled band and perform solo like she used to do. The only high points of this album are Track 10 and Bela Fleck adding banjo sparkle to a couple of the other boring songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less of the same.","review":"I used to be a fanatical Dar-ling, but I have to admit it: it appears Dar Williams has peaked, and is reduced to pale rewrites of her old stuff. <Green World> still had an intelligent structure and some deeply moving songs like \\"Calling the Moon\\" and \\"After All,\\" but there is nothing here with remotely the level of inspiration or the satirical edge of her earlier work. She used to be an adept storyteller, speaking through her characters, but these lyrics are just New Agey mush, with very little focus or center, and none of the humor of her earlier works. Musically, she goes even further with the lush, heavily produced sound of <Green World>, venturing away from the acoustic folk of her early work deep into Windham Hill country. It's lovely to listen to, but without songs of substance, what's the point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Ditto\\" on Deception","review":"Why does Amazon allow this company to wrongly depict what you will actually be receiving when you order this item? 1 jigger of poor quality.

Just as the strainer, this is also very poor quality. I will not order from M.V. Trading Company again; the entire order was a nightmare, from the customer service to the cheaply made products.

The leather came torn in several small areas on the automan (mostly on the interior and out of plain sight). The exterior tear I turn to face my wall so it is not visible so the tears were not a major problem for me. Others would probably have to send it back for an exchange or refund.

I also used it to glue the rubber absorber onto the diving board concrete support, insulation onto metal ducts, and countless other home repair jobs. It gets dry enough so I don't have to hold the pieces together after about 5 minutes.

However, it is absolutely awful. It cooks up to a brown, pasty consistency and has a bitter-sweet aftertaste. No matter if you thin it out a little and add your favorite low-carb milk + some Splenda, because it isn't sweet enough either....you can't help frowning when it gets into your mouth. Yuckaduckdoooo! If you buy this product, just order one box and try it first. I'm stuck with 5 boxes that went straight to the trash!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How Great Thou Art - Elvis Presley","review":"I absolutely loved this CD. I had forgotten what a wonderful voice Elvis had when it came to singing hymns and found this CD to be so very inspirational. His voice is as strong as it always was, and it made me feel as though he put a great deal of emotion into the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elvis' second Gospel album and a Grammy winner!","review":"Released in early 1967, this was Elvis' second, full length Gospel album. It was a hit in the US climbing to 18 on the album chart and eventually being certified MULTI-PLATINUM by the RIAA and being award a Grammy. It was a bigger hit in the UK reaching 11 on the album chart there. It includes Crying In The Chapel which was a huge hit worldwide; it peaked at number 3 on the US singles chart in 1965 and stayed at number 1 on the US Adult Contemporary chart for 7 weeks. It also topped the charts in the UK as well as several other countries. Elvis' performance of these songs is excellent!While this is an excellent album, there are better Elvis Gospel collections available now, such as his excellent Ultimate Gospel CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan of Elvis gospel singing","review":"This CD is just beautiful.

It is one of my all time favorite Gospel Records. Elvis voice on this is so convincing and so pure, and it brings tears to my eyes some of these songs. The arrangements are timeless. The first side is mostly slower ballad Gospel type songs. The second side has more uptempo spiritual numbers- so its a great mix. I reccomend this to any fan of real Gospel music delivered in a timeless style as only Elvis Presley could do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Cute!","review":"I really like this dress.

I too am a Jamiroquai fan and there are artists in England and elsewhere in Europe that make the artists here sound like babies. The depth, the soul, the sensual sound of his vocal sometimes gives me chills. When he sings 'I Can See' off a Jazzanova cd oh man he blows me away. This is an artist that should not be overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"MARY WAS MAGIC.","review":"Just to hear Mary Martin sing \\"Never-Never Land\\" is well worth the purchase of this cd.

If the manipulative kitchiness of the Disney cartoon (errr, \\"animated feature film\\") and Spielberg's Hook left you flat, just listen to Mary Martin, Cyril Ritchard and the rest of the excellent cast transport you to a world that really was innocent enough to believe that a kid could fly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Wonderful","review":"Just recently my high school did the production of Peter Pan and I had the pleasure of being the student-producer. I fell in love with the play as we worked on it and recived this CD as a gift from the head producer. We were very lucky to cast an extremely talented Junior as Peter Pan. When I first listened to this CD I thought that she was singing and not Mary Martin. Anyway I just wanted to say that I really enjoy listening to this CD and every time I do it reminds me of all the fun and magic that goes with Neverland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!","review":"I was 8 when I saw the first broadcast of Peter Pan on TV - and it's been a touchstone for me ever since. Sadly, there doesn't appear to be any video of that show, probably because the kinescopes are all black & white and it had what would no doubt look like pretty clunky camerawork by today's standards. However, it was superior to the 1960 re-staged version, in which the cast seemed a bit out of sync with the material and the performances seemed to be \\"on automatic\\". (Mary Martin was performing on Broadway in \\"Sound of Music\\" at the time). This is a recording from that earlier era, when the show was still on Broadway, and the performances are magnificent. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Recording of a True Original","review":"After watching a high school performance of this musical comedy, I wanted to be able to listen to these wonderful songs as originally performed. Unfortunately, my first attempt was the CD of the Disney cartoon version - which was a big disappointment on several levels. This recording was exactly as I had hoped - it captures the Mary Martin and Cyril Ritchard vocals wonderfully (even 50 years later!). Although this is not my favorite musical comedy of them all, this recording helps me understand why this show played so long on Broadway and why Mary Martin will ALWAYS be Peter Pan for many people. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Product - Multiple Names , different Prices","review":"This Product with other names tooPhysical Science in Action: Light DVD = ==== == All About Light (Physical Science for Children) (1999)Same product in different NamesEnsure the pricesEditorial ReviewsPart of an 11-part series for children grades K-4, this disk takes kids on a fun journey to asnwer questions like, \\"Why does light shine through some things and not others?\\" and \\"Why can we see our reflections in water, but not in a rock?\\" Learn how light travels in waves, as well as how those waves behave, including an introduction to the 3 main characteristics of light waves: amplitude, wavelength and frequency.

I now have a much worse rash than the original poison ivy rash. Although the scrub and spray did seem to rid me of the poison ivy, I now am on medication for a worse rash."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works for me....","review":"My understanding is that you're supposed to use the scrub right after exposure, not when you see the results of the exposure (blistering, etc). I have a lot of poison ivy in my yard, and frequently come into contact with it when I'm weeding. I've been using this scrub religiously immediately after weeding (even if I think I managed to avoid the poison ivy), and the only time I've had problems since I started using it was one time when I was in a hurry and didn't scrub very well. I apparently missed a spot, and had a small itchy blister there. When used as directed, this product appears to work really well. What I particularly like is that I don't need to wear long-sleeve shirts when weeding now, which is a big deal in our hot, humid southern summers.I did use the spray when I missed that spot, and I think it did help with the itching.I bought my original tube of the scrub at another store for $30.00 so I'm very happy to find it here at Amazon for less than $10!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lee/Kirby build a legend","review":"This book has better plotted stories than the 1st \\"Essential FF\\". However, the idea of the group fighting/breaking up recurs too many times as a plotline. Other than that, we get several excellent Dr. Doom stories-his origin and the \\"Battle of the Baxter Building\\" are classics. The Baxter Building story has a poignant moment when Reed Richards must decide whether to turn Ben Grimm back into the Thing (possibly forever). The Hate Monger, in his 1st appearance is a very provacative character for the era. The stories featuring Dr Storm and Gideon are pure melodrama best read only by completists. Plus we get 5 crossovers with other characters (4 in a row at one point)-Most of them carried by the misunderstanding that leads the FF to battle other heroes. However the Daredevil crossover is a classic. These stories function as filler before the next volume which should feature the premiere appearances of Galactus, Silver Surfer, the Black Panther and the Inhumans."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as good as volume 1 but still worth it","review":"ok so i bought the first volume and loved it then i bought the second volume and enjoyed it but for me volume 1 and 3 are still better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get what you pay for.","review":"All I needed to get was a gauge to check the tire pressure quick and simple.

My previous experience was with Angela Hewitt's excellent recording on Hyperion; but this is even better in that there is softer pedalling and a clearer sound to the piano.

I had a hard time picking a favorite tune. In fact, it was one of the best albums I've heard since Embrace's \\"Out of Nothing.\\" It's one of those just-push-play kind of albums. The content and form of each song is fitting: the rockers kick, and the ballads were true to themselves, not wimpy or contrived.Check out: Satellite News, Piece by Piece, Turn, Seven Days..., and Under the Weather for a good sampling. Buy this and let your friends borrow it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Duncan's two best","review":"In my opinion 'West of January' and 'Shadow' are Dave Duncan's two best books. Not only are these undoubtedly the best of his single book novels, in many ways they are better than his series. My other favourite works by Duncan are his earlier series -- in particular 'A Man of His Word', 'The Great Game' and 'The Seventh Swordman'. West of January and Shadow are a distillation of what is best about Duncan; a coherent and intriguing alternative universe, excellent characterization and plotting -- plus a keen moral edge that is sometimes submerged in the storyline of his series. It's as if you took one of best series and squeezed the essence into a single book. Shadow has been re-released, and I hope the same happens to West of Janurary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value - especially if you have allergies!","review":"Okay, I am allergic to almost everything.

If you're a larger woman in height or weight these would just look ridiculous on you. On the positive side the clasp was very stong and the earring had a bit of thicknes to it. But really, a joke in terms of size, especially for the listed price. I would expect to find these in a discount retailer for about half of what they are on amazon.

It's only when he finds out she's nobility that he decides to treat her right. And she agrees to work with him? HECK NO! She should be trying to castrate him with a rusty knife like any real woman would. Not falling in love with the man who RAPED HER AND DEGRADED HER.

I think there was some intention of placing this at the end of the album (to indicate a somber ending to the entire song cycle) instead of its current position, but for what its worth it is a depressing track--sort of a cross between Jefferson Airplane/Starship, The Lennon Sisters, and Strawberry Alarm Clock (remember \\"Incense And Peppermints\\"?)But if you want to hear The Guess Who at its peak, this is the album you should get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"The Guess Who ase consistant with their music there is overlapping of albums I like albums that have a complete list of songs that are unique to that album."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Kinda Music","review":"This 8-track was listened to so many times it wore out, then I bought a cassette version, now finally I can lay my hands on a cd, and this sounds perfect.

By that time, you are already frustrated and hardly have the desire to enjoy it...

They eventually said it had disappered after arriving in Dallas. Amazon did refund my money, but I find it hard to believe such a large shipment could just disapear from Dallas. Ended up buying another TV from a local Sears store. The whole experience was a bummer, even tho Amazon did reimburse me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap quality","review":"Recieved item, used for 30 seconds and motor burned up. The Save Wave (manufacturer) will not replace or take the unit back. I spoke with Maggie Volkov (Save Wave) who told me they don't guarantee their products. Amazon did not have that on their web page. I do not want defective items. Seems like I gave $35.00 to Save Wave for no products. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"After spending about 40 frustrating minutes trying to get the thing not to spin out of control 1 inch above the ground by trimming the controls and making sure everything was straight, I finally realized that one of the counter-weights on the large rotor was missing, throwing it off-balance and making it impossible to use. I immediately sent it back, and I'm not satisfied with the product at all. The instructions were hard to understand, and the body of the helicopter is made out of hardened styrofoam, making it VERY easy to break if it crashes (not that I got mine 2 inches off the ground). The rest of the helicopter is made out of cheap, flimsy plastic that is just begging to break. All-in-all, It is a very poorly-made product, however it is kind of neat if yours isn't defective, and you can control the thing in flight."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want more","review":"My first impression was chintzy remote and OK helicopter. I still think the remote is chintzy, but I absolutely love the copter. It took a bit of tweaking (as per instructions) to make it behave. No problem. After that, it was just too much fun. It survived some rowdy use at a party and it did run into things and experienced some severe mishaps including being swatted into a wall. It required super glue and re-tweaking post swat.I wish it was quicker to charge and had controls for forward and back. I don't know how long the controller will last. It isn't built for the long haul like video game controllers are. On the other hand, it might outlast the copter given various mischievious impulses.Note: the rotor should not be allowed to hit bare skin. It hurts. Some people will pretend it doesn't hrt, but will seek revenge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copter is bumming me out!","review":"I got to fly it a handful of times before it started having problems. It keeps spinning in circles now and does not respond to my trim commands.Totally sucks!I like to point out that 3 friends of mine who received or bought the copter at the same time have broken copters with the same problems. I heard it is something about a wire at the back rotor breaking or coming loose. It does not get enough power and just spins in circle inches above the ground. I suggest spending more money for a better built helicopter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mini X-copter","review":"It is missing parts & weights. I have e-mailed TheSaveWave & they sent me an e-mail stating that people do not read the instructions very well & maybe we should read them again. The list enclosed states what comes with the X-copter & my husband looked through everything & he looked 2 different times & came up with the same conclusion, it is missing the extra propeller & the weights to make it fly. Thanks to them they ruined his christmas. I'm not very happy with this & I don't think I will shop on Amazon.com again. I should have just taken $55.00 & flushed it down the toilet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good performance","review":"It was a gift for my parents, so i don't have a direct experience with it.

I have been on an historical fiction craze lately, and after a couple of Leon Uris books, I decided to tackle some James Michener novels. I am so glad I did, as this is my first real attempt at reading Michener, and I really love his comprehensive portrayal of history. I feel like an honest attempt is made to present the facts as objectively as possible, but as I am a white person reading this, it is hard to imagine how the story might be viewed if I was a black or brown person of African descent.I find myself constantly trying to picture the landscape, and am often drawn to a map to check out the topography of the areas in question. I don't know if I will ever visit the country myself, but it sounds beautiful.I look forward to finishing this epic story."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one book I'll be happy to read again.","review":"From early man's wanderings to the heady days of apartheid Michner walks you through South Africa's history and makes you think you lived it.

Presented a wealth of information about the history of South Africa. JAM's style of narration blending fact with fiction is interesting. This novel led me to look for more about South Africa in reference books."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"I was looking for an overview of American History in one book. This one is very well written and covers all the right bases. Obviously it doesn't go into great detail on anything, but I was looking for a broad brush and this book fills the bill. I'm about halfway through and haven't found anything that seems to promote a biased view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viral anecdotes","review":"Just adding to previous comments to emphasize the accessibility of this book to the general reader. Brogan's anecdotal style lends itself to a sustained interest, or at least it did in my case. The best example I remember is the story about Ulysses S. Grant who, on being informed that a new Confederate General had declared that his 'headquarters would be in the saddle' until Grant was defeated, responded that it sounded like a better place for the hindquarters to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too scholarly for the average reader","review":"I did a fair amount of research on history books and finally bought this one because of the great product reviews it had. Boy was I disappointed when it arrived. The language it is written in is dull and hard to understand. I found myself Googling half of the events the author discussed because his analysis was too complex. This book is NOT for the average reader looking to learn a little more about the history of the greatest country in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled \\"The Penguin Completely Biased History of the USA\\"","review":"After reading the book, you will have no doubt that it was written by a very left leaning Democrat. The last one quarter of the book is so biased that it is not worth reading. Every Democratic President is a genius that did great things and their set backs were just bad luck (especially Jimmy Carter). Every Republican President was a moron and their triumphs were just good luck (especially Ronald Reagan).It may be too much to ask but when I finish reading a history book, I should not know the writer's political persuasion. An author of history should leave his one-sided opinions out of it and write what happened or his writing becomes an editorial piece and not a history book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headband not durable","review":"I have had the exact same problem with two pairs of these headphones, The headband cracks in the very center.

Don't bother with the e version, get it in print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously high price for below average sound","review":"The positive thing about them is they can be folder small enough to fit into a jacket pocket. However, the sound quality is below average compared to many other headphones I tried; particularly noticeable for bass in techno. I would understand if they cost $10, but for $40-50 range this is a huge waste of money. My previous headphones, foldable Panasonic that I bought for like $20, had much better performance; unfortunately the store stopped selling them so I gave those a try. I guess the only other positive things I could say would be the soft leather-like pads instead of the cheap foam pads that tear after a month, the small folded size, and the fact that they still work after being used for over half a year now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product switched","review":"Hard to know the quality of the PX200 since I received a lesser quality product instead. But I was still charged for the higher priced headphones. It was suggested I try again. Same results. There was no explanation, apology or offer of refund of difference in cost. I have a pair of these headphones I bought 2 years ago and they're great, better than great. small, lightweight, good quality sound, nice carrying case. And that's why I want a second set. Guess I'll never know if they're still the great product they used to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing in the extreme","review":"This was my third pair of Sennheisers. The previous two were just magnificent, so I was really looking forward to getting these to replace the PX100 I'd worn out.The first pair, the sound was so tinny that I assumed that they were defective and sent them back for replacement. The second pair sound just as bad. The description borders on false advertising, since the bass response was practically non-existant.

I was a huge fan of Sennheisers supposedly lesser model the px-100 (or 150?) which sounded great but the connection kept coming loose (where the left hear doesn't work or has a spottly connection and you have to wiggle the wire and then even then it doesn't work), I went through 3 pairs, getting them repaired all the time!!! These I thought would last as they were more expensive, and yeah, man, they lasted now a year or two... but for WHAT? The sound is awful -- I'm a New Yawker, so I'm running all over subways on these and unless you are in a dead quiet room with the sound way up on your ipod you wont hear any detail -- for jazz, for instance, you will hear Sonny Rollins sax okay and the bigger drums, but no brush work, no bass, no nothing... what's the freakin' point????I just dont know where to turn...

I also have the Sony MDR V6 and Grado SR60i.I thought these Sennheiser PX200 would be really good - but what the pictures don't do is give you an idea of how small, flimsy, and cheap they feel. The label should say \\"Fisher Price\\".Anyways, these were supposed to be a gift. I returned it and ordered a pair of Sony MDR V6 instead for approximately the same price.I'm very disappointed in these headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Bass, TERRIBLE!!","review":"These are terrible. I had the PX-100's and was going to switch them for the PX-200's, huge mistake. One, they don't reduce outside noise, and don't cancel the noise from your headphones. Two, there is no bass at all. Three, buy the PX-100's. Cheaper, and 400 times better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't lose those \\"Easily replaceable ear pads\\"...","review":"I have the PX 100 too, I guess I prefer the sound of the PX 200, but just a little. Better bass than the PX 100, less clarity.One of my ear pads (\\"cushions\\" according to Sennheiser) fell off when I pulled the headphones out of my jacket's pocket.Sennheiser asks for $7.21 for replacement set, plus $5 shipping, plus tax. Total $12.79. Too much to spend just to get these headphones back up and running. Hence just 2 stars. PX 100 has better value, 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headphones","review":"I'm not an audiophile so I cant comment about the specs but as a person who enjoys music I really like listening to these headphones. I use them with my pc and ipod and the sound quality is great. The collapsible feature is really useful because I can neatly store them in the bag that I take to work everyday. The headphones do keep some of the background noise out but not all of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good with some drawbacks","review":"It has very good sound quality for the price and can isolate noice to some extent.

I've gone through 2 sets of px200's and one set of px 100's, same scenario with both products. Disappointingly, overtime, they just don't hold up to any kind of physical abuse which a pair of stock headphones can easily sustain. Everything is solid from sound quality to the headphones themselves but, unfortunately, the wires are fragile which will most likely render these headphones useless before it's intended time. On the upside Sennheiser honors the warranty with no problems (you can do an RA through their website). But, unfortunately, you will most likely have the same scenario with the replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great while they lasted!","review":"In my opinion, these are very well designed and sound pretty damn good for the under $50 price tag without looking too extreme on a daily basis.Here's the bad part like a previous reviewer mentioned, that thin wire connecting these headphones broke. One pair of these guys lasted me 8 months and some change.They have some 24 month warranty that you have to ship out to get it repaired, according to the website, since I am headphone-less, even though they broke under a year, I like them enough to get a second pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Headphones","review":"...worth the money. Definitely better than my ipod earbuds and easy keep on your person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product fot the price...","review":"Purchased these headphones to listen to DVDs on a flight to Las Vegas. The sound quality is great, especially listening to music!!!! They are comfortable and the hard storage case that comes with them is a bonus. The headphones are well crafted. Cancelling background noise is only average, but at this price, that is most likely all that can be expected. For the cost- to this reviewer they are a wise investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent purchase!!","review":"I am very satisfied with these headphones. The difference in sound quality between these and ordinary earbuds is like night and day. It is a much, much richer sound and I am so glad I purchased them. They also do a wonderful job of canceling outside noise. I have used these on plane rides before and I have been able to hear my music perfectly, without blasting the volume. I would recommend these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ordered both these and the PX100","review":"Ordered both the PX200s and the PX100s and the PX200s turned out to be my favorites although both are excellent headphones. I like the closed headphone with less backgound noise and the music just sounds fuller. They are also a little louder than the PX100s at the same volume setting showing that they are easily driven. I use them with a Sandisk 512mb player. There is no problem with bass response, in fact, the bass is stronger than that of the PX 100s. I've had no touble putting them in the case either. These are great headphones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something important about bass with this headphones !!","review":"I was quite afraid about the lack of bass with this headphones, acording to what I red about it. But just for the size and collapsible possibility I bought it. When I listened first I was quite disappointed, so I let the headphone for break in with bass rich music (techno). After about 15 hours it sounded better but I found something interesting : the quality of bass depend in the way you put the headphone on the ear : it must be put on the lower part of the ear and not on the middle or higher part..Try it and you will se a great difference. I think the people who complain about the lack of bass first didn't let the headphones for break in enough, and the don't put it in the right position on the ears. This has to be put lower on the ear than with other headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After reading reviews highly rating these headphones I bought a set but was very disappointed due to hardly any sound in the bass range.So I bought the Panasonic RP-HT46 and feel like I got twice the headphonesfor one-fifth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bass Doesn't Grow On You","review":"I've had these headphones for over a year and have used them on a regular basis. No matter what EQ setting I use on my iPod or other device, the bass has remained virtually non-existent for over a year. It hasn't improved with additional listening time as other reviews seem to indicate; at least not for me, anyway. I also have the PX-100 phones, which oddly, seem to overemphasize the bass at the expense of the middles and highs. However, for overall portable usage, especially at lower volumes, the PX-100 wins hands down. I tend to agree with another reviewer that the middles seem to be very overemphasized on these phones, although I must say for middles and highs they're pretty good. I agree that these phones lack 'punch'. I use these mostly for rock and jazz by the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable, Disappointing \\"Blown Out\\" Sound","review":"Size and weight are nice, and build quality is fine. However, where it really matters, these headphones are a disappointment. They do not fit well on my slightly larger than average head, and don't sit well on my ears because the pads are too small to sit on the bumpy surfaces of the ear.As for sound, the headphones are too prone to tinny clicks and fuzzes that I associate with \\"blown\\" speakers or headphones. If you are listening to a lot of downloaded music, you will hear these defects very clearly with these phones, even when they don't appear with other ones. I am going to replace these, even though they're less than a year old, with another closed-design, probably the Koss."},{"rating":"2","title":"They were ok..","review":"I thought this headphones did alright, I didn't pay much for mine so I cannot really complain anyway but I don't know why people on here are saying the sound is bad, I get an excellent output from my headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"PX200 is garbage","review":"These headphones are horrible. I bought them to replace my ipod earbuds. Returned them the next day. The folding thing is cool, but the sound quality is horrible. The sound is tinny and has no depth. The only way to get decent sound out of them is to push them hard against your ears. In other words, these headphones are just plain worthless. Not worth the price at all, I'd rather have a non folding pair of headphones that sound great then a pair of horrible sounding headphones that fold. Don't buy these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speaker not functioning upon delivery","review":"One of the speakers was non-functional upon delivery so it is the process of being returned to Sennheiser under warranty for replacement. Purchased as a Christmas gift so Amazon's 30 days to return an item limit was exceeded prior to the package being opened and the defect discovered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product at a great price- noise be gone!","review":"I bought these headphones with the intent of blocking out some of the annoying background noise on the bus ride everyday to work. Space was a premium so noise cancelling and full over the ear headphones were not really an option. The foam pads on the headphones do a good job of reducing background noise. The sound quality is very good and the awful noise of a diesel bus engine is almost unnoticable with the music playing at a moderate level.The fold up style is great for commuters who dont have room in their bag for a big set of head phones and the storage case is great for keeping the cords from getting damaged or the headphones ruined. A definate must buy if you are want isolation from outside noise without the bulk of full over the ear headphones and dont want to drop the cash for noise cancelling that actually works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic mini-cans","review":"I've had these headphones for about 7 years now, and they are still awesome. They are very durable, and even though I have yanked the cord on various things, it has never come loose. I used to put them in the case before my backpack, but now I just fold them up and throw them in and they are fine. These phones are incredibly comfortable to wear for hours, and very little (if any) sound leaks out. The ambient sound isolation is really good. Sometime I put them on without any music and they do a great job of keeping things quiet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget about it.","review":"I bought these based on recommendations on a music newsgroup, and on Amazon. These are very disappointing headphones.First, they're allegedly \\"closed\\", but are nothing of the sort, and provide no more sonic isolation than any open design I've used (including the allegely \\"open\\" PX-100's).Second, the sound awful, with an overresonant, honking sound that I find absolutely unacceptable in a $10 set of headphones that might be included with a portable CD player. There's no excuse for a $50 set of phones sounding like this.Third, they can only be driven by portable units with fairly high output.Horrible purchase, and I'm usually a huge Sennheiser fan. I bought a pair of PX-100's last night, and they are infinitely superior, and slightly cheaper. I also use Koss $15 \\"Plug\\" earbuds, and these are also superior to the PX-200 in every way, including isolation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sounding Headphones!","review":"I have the Sennheiser HD 280's so I was confident when I bought these lightweight headphones. I use them with an iPod so I wanted to have a light and good sounding way to listen. The original Apple earbuds were not up to the task and lacked bass response. These jewels made the Apple earbuds sound thin and tiny. If you want good bass and definition, you won't be sorry if you pick this model. The carrying case is very cool and super convenient. I've only had them a month so I haven't had to replace the pads, but it is good knowing I can. I will have these for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great head phones for a commuter!","review":"I purchased these head phones to be used with a Toshiba Gigabeat portable media devise. I don't care too much for the in your ear type head phones that come standard with most players. I looked at the noise canceling model made by Sennheiser, but found that I don't have a problem with back ground noise during my commute. The Sennheiser PX200 head phones have preformed well for me with my Toshiba Gigabeat. I really like the compact design and the fact that they fold up and fit into a small hard carry case, which is very close to the same size as my Toshiba Gigabeat. The sound quality is great and I've recommended them to a fellow commuter for his mp3 player as well! Buy'em and enjoy your music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"low cost headphones","review":"they are comfortable and gives a good range in volume control but they work best with stereo apps where you have access to the equalizer ont he output because the headphone is bias towards bass or lower frequencies.

Save your money from getting those Bose sets !Kenny G 2009."},{"rating":"2","title":"sennheiser px200","review":"Well...at first I was surprised at how small these headphones were. The actual speakers aren't too big so it's not wierd wearing them and they fold up well and easily.

Overall, this product is pretty darn good."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this","review":"This is very bad. I thought it would be worth of money, but for a $50 headphone, I don't think so. It says 'powerful bass' on the cover, but i don't know how they define the word 'powerful.'

The highs and mids are very good with these and the soundstage is pretty solid. Try the pmx60's, though, they are excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Bass","review":"After buying both Sennheiser PX100 & PX200, I decided to return the PX200.

The sound is mediocre, the construction fragile and, for all but those under 120 lbs., overly petite. None of that bothered me enough to send it back; what bothered me was the strong reviews that hooked me into buying it. I'm dumbfounded. Does Sennheiser rally its employees to write reviews?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Near perfect form and function","review":"I bought these a little over 6 months ago. This is the best headphone purchase I've ever made. I use them at the office for listening to music. For the price, you can't beat them. They produce great quality sounds and the do an admirable job blocking out other sounds too. Full rich sound, good for everything from dance to classical.The industrial design aspect is simply amazing. They are very comfortable to wear. They collapse in to a great form factor for either putting in your desk or in your bag. The cord, itself, uses a sort of sliding binder to either keep the right and left cords neat when the headphones are put away. The case is the best I've ever seen for headphones.

But, at times I need a closed ear design to help block outside noise. So, I bought the PX200 headphones. The sound coming from this headset is extremely tinny and shallow. I returned them for a refund. If you do not have a good quality headset with you to compare the PX200 to, then you may not realize just how bad the sound really is.However, I discovered that both headsets were exactly the same size. So, I bought the replacement closed ear cushions for the PX200 and put them on my PX100. The ear cushions fit perfectly on the PX100. So, now I can switch cushions depending on my needs. This is a great solution that works great for me and may work out for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot better than my apple earbuds","review":"I used to get static along with my music on my apple earbuds whenever I decided to turn up the volume to the max with my ipod. But with the Sennheiser headphones, I can turn the volume all the way up and still retain the music WITHOUT the static.And although Sennheiser also provides the case these headphones come in, I've found that I rarely needed to use them. Since I use my headphones nearly everyday, taking the time to wrap them back up to put in their box to be quite frustrating and tedious.But other than that, this product is what I call sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"These headphones are well worth the price.

Small, compact, comfortable, they also sound very good compared to what you can get from this size of headphones. The sound is crystal clear and very good for acoustic music. With other types of music you will find them a bit sharp. But if you have adjustable EQ then they are fine. Good bass too. Only a few flaws: do not isolate you from the outside noise 100%; give a weak static noise when used with PC or something more powerful. I use them with my iRiver cd player and they are just the perfect match for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaking in the headphone","review":"The instructions mentions breaking them in and several reviewers felt they sound better, waming up, increasing bass after using them for awhile. I use to design audio equipment and can tell you this is due to certain moving part(sometimes the spider , or possibly the soft cone in this case) attached to the voice coil that \\"softens\\" after conitnued vibration. This results in a more relaxed, natural sound with deeper bass. So you can just leave it on playing music from your ipod/walkman/radio/computer even if you're no listening for hours at a time or even a day and this should improve the sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Evil","review":"Awesome product and shipped fast.

This powerful and potent feature makes the book worth buying and reading.MaryJane Ryan also reminds us that gratitude is a simple and effective tool for quickly undoing the false judgments we hold against self and others. This is because gratitude and resentment are mutually exclusive, and each one cancels the other one out. Because gratitude enables you to swiftly change your mind, it's a kind of magic fairy dust that turns you into the person you most want to be. Gratitude is easy. It's fast. And anyone can do it.

He seems to come up with a shaky (if familiar) definition of \\"modern\\" and presents a series of close-readings solely to fit them within that definition. For the seasoned student of Japanese literary studies, his readings may prove interesting but don't really take the texts themselves or the idea of the \\"modern\\" in a new direction.While there is no denying that Washburn is a topnotch intellectual in the field and an outstanding writer, for me this monograph reads like a gotta-make-tenure study that attempts to be groundbreaking while also very liberally discredits--I would say often unfairly--some of the leading Japanologists and literary scholars/critics seemingly for the sake of vanity.

I am sorry, but people don't change and accomplish as much as Logan did with as much hinderance as he had to get there, not even if you are driven as he was.

You get the sense that he wishes there were some real and imminent peril in praising Toni Morrison, but there isn't--and he KNOWS it--and therefore his tough-boy declarations are not only repetitive but repulsive.

Too flimsy, too heavy, too large or small and on and on. The 1.5\\" is the perfect size for me. The important thing in all hoops is to find the right size and width first. Good thing I read other reviews about the snap lock closure though or else I might have had a problem. These have a nice shine to them and are very pleasing to the eye. At first glance I didn't think these would be noticeable on but they are and very simple yet elegant. Another important factor is that they are light. I will be wearing these frequently. Great buy!!!

Tracing his career's rise and decline with an unswerving focus on the dangerous sport, the movie is gritty, seldom turning away from its less-than-glamorous aspects.Several Hollywood pictures have used bullfighting and its milieu ( \\"Blood and Sand,\\" \\"The Matador,\\" \\"The Bullfighter and the Lady\\"), but none has captured the day-to-day drama as well as \\"The Moment of Truth.\\" Mateo is a charismatic actor, and his dramatic scenes outside the arena come off convincingly, particularly his romantic scenes with co-star Linda Christian.Though the setting is Spain, the movie is in Italian with English subtitles. Blu-ray bonus extras include a 2004 interview with director Francesco Rosi, new English subtitles, and a booklet containing a critical essay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for younger kids","review":"I had purchased for my 9 year old (who is a very advanced reader and gifted student) the Usborne World History book. She LOVED that book, and has read it cover to cover several times. I figured that the Usborne Science Encyclopedia would be similarly interesting to her. Wrong. She has barely touched the Science Encyclopedia. The problem with the Science Encyclopedia is that it is very complex and written at a very high level.

On the positive side it orgainizes and presents a pile of information in a lucid and straight forward manner. The sections on the Spirit are fairly comprehensive and I'm sure that I'm going to be using the A to Z listing for years to come. The section on Eisner's post-Spirit work does a nice job of informing old and new readers alike not only to content of the GN's but also to the wide variety of material that's available. However, there are a couple of things that come down on the negative side. Why was the typeface so small? For that matter why was the book so small to begin with? And I don't know about any one else but I found the index page to be so damn small that it was rendered useless. However, it still remains a usefull reference work for any Eisner fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boss Queen, Little Big Bark, and the Sentinel Pup","review":"What an original and enchanting way to see the world from your loyal best friend's eyes.

The true test of time, however, remains the staying power of such notable works.Unfortunately, in the case of Catsam's _Bleeding Red_, this is not a very good book. Unlike previous reviewers who praise the author's work, for this particular reviewer, the book failed to meet the expectations of a significant contribution to the Red Sox Nation. While acquaintances and supporters of the author might be captivated by what he was doing on specific occasion, it leaves the non-partisan reader little substance to cling to. The book truly fails to offer anything more than sophomoric stabs at humor and its descriptions of the author's own self-imposed trials and tribulations really is unsympathetic.Readers can make their own judgments, but in this reviewer's opinion, _Bleeding Red_ falls short."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great album","review":"Of the CDs available of Jimmy Raney, this is my favorite.

But if the \\"leads\\" breaks in the pencil, they are unusuable because they wiggle back and forth in the plastic holder. And they do break - of our 18, about 4 or 5 are out of commission already. If the leads come out, they can't be used independently because they're too fragile to be held by hand. Too fragile for constructive use. (Amanda's point about their non-biodegradability is well-taken, and rhyming!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the convenience!","review":"I bought these despite the negative reviews and don't regret it. I wanted colored pencils that I didn't have to sharpen for the kids to use during church. My kids that use them range in age from 4yrs to 9yrs. They all LOVE these. They did take some coaching at first so they didn't twist the leads out too far and break them, but they got the hang of it. We only let the kids use them once a week (during church), and they've lasted quite a long time. One or two of them are almost all out -- which means my kids successfully used them up without breaking them!I'm actually about to buy each of the kids their own set of 30 now on Amazon so they don't have to pass the pack back and forth anymore. I definitely recommend twistables colored pencils."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Products","review":"These are by far the worst products from Crayola. I am so disappointed that Crayola would release such a product that is so substandard in quality. The leads have broken off on several of the pencils & my daughter has not had a chance to enjoy playing with them. As one of the reviewer has accurately stated, once the leads break off, it's unusable! Not worth the money spent. My confidence in Crayola's products has diminished drastically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!!!","review":"Never ever received the goods, nor was there a reply to numerous mails to enquire.

It's quite technical, but as lucid as possible.

It's easy to use and the cork just slides out effortlessly. However, the screw that it uses soon wears out. This can happen in as little as 3 to 6 months or so depending on how much wine you drink. I assume that the teflon coating wears off or the tip dulls. In any event, it then becomes increasingly difficult to use until it starts pushing the cork in the bottle. They throw in one extra screw, but additional ones are outrageously priced--$10 on Amazon. Nice margin for the manufacturer. There were at one time Chinese knock-offs in the marketplace that had the same characteristics, but at least they were cheap, $10 or 15 if I remember correctly.

Not one but TWO Kitchen Aides leaked and malfunctioned. A Cuisinart did not leak, but it didn't turn off, either. You had to pull the plug every time. I cannot function without my morning cuppa Joe and things were getting bad in my houseOne of my sons finally took pity on me (and the rest of the family) and bought this Krups for Christmas. From the first brew it has worked flawlessly --- makes great coffee and keeps it hot in the carafe. Could not ask for more. Programming it is easy, as is the cleanup of the carafe and drip basket.One caveat: if you like boiling hot coffee, this might not suit you. The coffee is at the perfect brewing temperature (in my opinion) but that is NOT boiling. It's just HOT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too weak to defend itself!","review":"I have been using Mr. Coffee drip coffee makers for years. When I saw the \\"famous\\" Krups on sale, I thought I would try one. Maybe I'm not clued in to the nuances of this coffee maker, but I can only say you must put in too much coffee to get even close to the strength of the brew produced by the Mr C.. I can not recommend this coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Coffee Maker I've Owned in 30 years","review":"While I don't own the programmable version of this maker, I believe the issues I have will be the same. How bad is this thing? The carafe does NOT keep the coffee hot. Each time I pour a cup of coffee, I have to stick it in the microwave for about 60 seconds to heat it up. In fact I don't think it starts out that hot to begin with. Because of this, I have had to up the amount of coffee needed to get a reasonable strength by 50-75%. Once you remove the carafe from the brewing position (which you must do just as soon as it is finished in order to seal the top) the thing drips. Speaking of dripping, the \\"spout\\" of this thing will drip too if you are not careful. I have always been a strong Krups supporter, but this will be the last time I buy Krups--its that bad. Even though I've only owned this for about four months, I am planning on getting a new coffee maker very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carafe exploded after only two years!","review":"I loved this coffee maker for two years. Then, this morning, I found the glass thermal insert inside the plastic carafe had EXPLODED. I was shocked--shocked! Turns out this is a common occurrence for this machine (check out the feedback on amazon.com for the carafe alone. Lots of us have looked into buying a new carafe after ours spontaneously combusted). It seems I was actually lucky to have mine last for two full years. Krups \\"consumer support\\" told me I should not used a sponge to clean it. That is ridiculous. Suffice to say, you can see the pictures of my carafe on this website by clicking the \\"costumer images\\" link under the machine's photo above, and I suggest that if you respect your money you buy a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Manufacturing","review":"The coffee maker itself works fine. However, within 3 months after purchase the handle fell off the carafe and can not be fixed. Amazon does not sell a replacement carafe that matches. The Krups company does not offer replacement parts and merely refers you to third-party websites. These site do not have the replacment part either. Having paid $130 for it on Amazon, we must now throw it away and purchase another."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor excuse for a coffee maker","review":"Here are some of the problems with this coffee maker:>The water that flows onto the coffee bores right through the coffee grounds and consequently does not allow complete absorbstion such that the coffee made is very weak.

The design does not lend itself to turn easily as well.>The carafe handle wobbles and does not appear to be solidly attached.>The lid design on the coffee maker does not make it easy to add the water.All in all this item is too little for too much.Where have you gone Joe Dimaggio?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too watered down","review":"I prefer my coffee a bit on the strong side. This product creates coffee that tastes too watered down. I initially added four large tablespoons of coffee for 6 cups but was too watery. This is the formula my old Krups uses to create decently strong coffee. I stepped it up to five, and then six tablespoons per six cups of water and couldn't get a strong cup of coffee. The coffee also tastes better from my old Krups. The thermal carafe is great and works extremily well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coffee","review":"We've had one of these coffee makers for over a year now, and we're buying another as a gift. It's an excellent product for the money - it brews coffee quickly, and the thermal carafe keeps it fresh and hot, without burning, for up to 4 hours. I'd recommend this product to any coffee drinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made for looks but not for use!","review":"Obviously, the designers of this coffeemaker never actually tried using it. It looks good, but unless you use the coarsest possible grind of coffee -- gravel would work best -- you can expect the filter to overflow on your counter and not into the carafe. We've owned many cone-filter coffee makers, and this is by far the most frustrating. There is no rhyme or reason to its idiosyncracies. It might make perfect coffee for two mornings in a row, but then on the third morning, when we least expect it, it again pours all the coffee and grounds on to the counter. Not the best way to start the morning. The functionality of this piece is unpredictable and annoying and unless you enjoy cleaning a mess from your counter three mornings a week, we would not recommend it. It's a product for masochists."},{"rating":"2","title":"S.

I just can't get beyond the poor quality of writing, the incessant rambling about nothing, stories with no point. I suspect the reader doesn't need more than half of the background on what it's like to be thirteen - not to mention those who may not sympathize with a girl who is growing up in privilege and complaining about it. I wouldn't waste the money - there are plenty of less painful ways to learn about the dangers of the internet than reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star - for lack of a lower rating","review":"This book is, as an understatement, a disgrace to the average human being. Katie has no concept of decent writing and her story should not have been published. As a student of Katie's age, I can honestly say that she doesn't know what suffering is. Living in privilage is all that Katie has ever, or will ever know. Her pathetic attempt to win sympathy in the public eye casts a shadow of contemptablility on all SPS students. Although, in a different context, her message could be useful, her blatant bid for pity disgusts me. As a 14 year old, Katie should have known what responsibility meant when she started using the internet. Being clueless on the web is more than stupid. She was asking for it. Not that it should ever happen, but you can not be careless! EVERY 14 year old knows that! Everyone, obviously, except for her. SAVE YOURSELVES! RUN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I disappointment","review":"I often struggle to find a good book to read. When I read the amazon review, I thought it would be a good, well written novel about the dangers of the internet. After reading the book, I was shocked with the first reviews of the novel, for they seemed unreal and fake, as if the person never read the book. After the first pages, I felt like I was listening to someone complain, and as I read, it seemed to get worse and worse, making absolutely no sense with no application to my life. It seems like it were written by my little sister. An interesting topic, but dissappointing product. I feel cheated. If you are about to buy it, Please reconsider and spend your money on a book with real substance, that has some value towards your life. Even if you think you can relate to the topic, it doesn't address the issue intelligently. I find it hard to imagine anyone appreciating this as a piece of \\"literature.\\" There are thousands of great books out there.

I dunno, maybe Dutton was just desperate for something, anything dealing with the internet when the internet was \\"hot\\" but this? It almost encourages teens go to and get themselves into dangerous situations so they can make money off of it as well.If you want the real skinny on interent dating, and meeting people on the net, go to http://www.saferdating.com or http:;//www.wildangel.com - the real deal!Another (yawn) book by a verbose teen who did something stupid and managed to live through it.Commend her courage?

Katie lets us into a world that many of us just don't see or understand. Her message of the loneliness, insecurities, and pain that kids face should help us to better handle kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Perspective!","review":"The topic of this book intrigued me, but I was dubious of whether a seventeen year old would possess the writing skills necessary to put a whole book together. After reading Katie.com, I am totally amazed at Katie's ability to convey her story both with a sense of introspection where needed, enoughh humor so that it is not too morose, and a freshness that clearly reminds me that a teen wrote the book. The story is compelling and certainly tells a cautionary tale that all teens and parents should read. I look forward to more of Katie Tarbox's writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Katie.com review","review":"Katie.com was a great book. I liked it because it explained so much of how her life was when this tragedy happened. This book is about a girl, Katherine Tarbox, who has just a regular everyday life. But, when her sister comes over, she brings her laptop along with her. Since Katie didn't have a computer, she explored the Internet. Then she finds a chat room and she starts looking for someone just like her. When Katie does finally meet \\"The Guy,\\" she keeps it a secret. Mark, \`The Guy,\\" desperately wants to meet her and visa versa. They finally meet at her swim meet and she goes to his hotel room. When they meet face-to-face it's really not what she expects. It is a very surprising book. I think that anyone, boy or girl, should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This book was sooooooooo good. it was something that everyone should read. it's creepy that there are people like marc out there. another cool thing was that i live in new canaan and everything was real, even the teachers she dedicated it to in the back of the book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whine, whine, whine, whine","review":"In this book, Katie Tarbox, a sheltered, rich, naive, and self-absorbed attempes to make us cry for her.When she was 13 she met a person on the internet and revealed personal identifing information to him, they talked over the phone and then at a hotel she was staying at, the met up and he raped her. I really don't shed tears for Katie. It was her fault. I believe rape is a terible thing and internet stalker s are disgusting and heinous but I just cant see feeling sorry for her.

Had I spent any money on it, I would've felt gipped. (sp?)It's too bad this happens to so many girls, but wow - how stupid can you be? Believe me, I've been there, so I know what I'm talking about.Anyway, this book reads more like a diary would - Katie confesses her tale of woe of being upperclass & lonely. But boy, did she paint her parents in a bad light! I'd be surprised if she was still on speaking terms with them, putting all this in print. Ah but yes - it's a TRUE STORY.Finally, why was the book named \\"katie.com\\" when no one related to the book owns it? That was pretty lame...don't tell me the marketing people didn't check this out. The poor woman who owns that domain is still waiting for an apology - what, 3 years later?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive","review":"I checked this book out from my local library and was unimpressed. As a human being, of course I feel empathy for Katherine Tarbox, the young woman who wrote the book. But judging it as a written work (which I thought was the purpose of these reviews), I have to say that it was awful. It probably would have been better to ghost-write this particular story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very impressed...","review":"The basic outline of what happened to her is very sad, but if you're going to fill a book, you need a lot more skill than she possesses. Her writing style is sub-par and her knowledge of technology is also lacking. It would've been a much better book if she'd had it ghost-written."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of fuss over nothing","review":"Firstly, let me put a few things straight that have missed, deliberately or otherwise by other reviewers. 1) She was not thirteenn when she wrote the book, she was 18, 2) she was not raped. I agree, the situation she found herslf, for a 13 year old girl might have been unconfortable, but the entire book builds up to an incident that lasts about a page. I find it rather ironic that a paedophile of 41 is somehow shocking to Miss Tarbox and yet a paedophile of 23 isn't. Like some others have said, the real victims in this story are the sexually abused children that we hear breifly about, the author's experience of a quick kiss and grope hardly seem to measure up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"A complete waste of time.

I was surprised that a teen could write a book that would be so compelling and insightful. In fact, I think that it is fair to say that Ms. Tarbox has more insight into life than most forty year olds. She writes with wonderful clarity in a straightforward manner that doesn't leave you guessing to get her message. The message, in fact, is one that every chatroom visitor should take seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please.....","review":"Let me save you some time..... girl with low self-esteem meets older man who makes her feel important.

You'll regret buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blaaa","review":"I'm a 17 year old female and I've been meeting people off the internet since I was about 15, I do have more commen sense then Katie did though, You always make sure the person has lots of pictures, and find out things more believable about them. Also any girl should know that you always meet them in a public place first, with lots of people around. This book just really aggervated me more than it excited me or made me feel for her. It made me want to jump through the book and slap her, and tell her, you know your 14 what are you gonna do with a 31 year old man. No matter how much someone makes you feel special that big of an age difference anyone should know, that its WRONG!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nah","review":"This book was poorly written and plain old boring.

It is a book of beautiful poetry written by a Catholic Priest that gave up his church because of it's antiquated ways and the church refused to changed. The church relied on fear and guilt and as the times changed, the church did not. His poems are not only great, they can be very, very funny as well as serious. They are lifting because they make you laugh and laughing is the best key to good health I know. On Larry King, he was noted as being America's Poet Laureate.

While you are at it, go ahead an get the DVD of the REAL \\"Queer As Folk\\". Far better...guys are better looking...dialogue sounds better without the nasal, American whine...just everything.

Things just get worse and worse for our hero as the story gets closer and closer to its final confrontation in the woods. I found much to enjoy in this film and even though it's a direct-to-video.

You have never seen the lead actor, Kerr Smith (Dawson's Creek) act so strongly. Well-written and well-directed, Pressure is an example of an unassuming character, an everyman, pushed to the brink when one bad event after another befalls him.

I looked the docking station up by the model number, which I first found out from the driver disk included with the docking station, and I found out that the model that would work with 64 bit Windows 7 had a model number one digit from the one I received.

It does what it says it will do, just not as well as I'd hoped. There are two problems. First, response time on the monitor you hook up to the docking station is pretty slow - particularly when you're on the Web. The mouse pointer moves at about one-half its normal speed, if that. As a result, I'm not even using the monitor port on the docking station. (I've got my external monitor plugged right into my laptop.) Second, there are occasional mouse and keyboard glitches. For example, the mouse might freeze up for five seconds, or the keyboard will type kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk when all you wanted was k.

After installing this item and beginning use with it, it became evident that the video portion of the device didn't work correctly. The monitor hooked up displayed the same thing as my laptop but on a 5 second delay and the mouse and everything else appears to trail. We updated all necessary drivers and sought technical support from Targus. It took them a long time to respond and once they did, there advice was to hook the monitor directly up to the laptop, defeating the purpose of having a docking station. So, with that said, if you are looking for a USB hub, this will work, but if you are looking for a Docking Station with Video (as this device/company claim) I would strongly recommend you purchase something from a company other than Targus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I had the same problem as the other customer but downloaded the updated drivers from Targus' website at http://www.targus.com/us/product_details.asp?sku=ACP50US.

I installed it on my new HP laptop with a 1.6 GHz Centrino Duo processor (which took a phone call to tech support and a download of new drivers) and found that there was a significant delay between what I was doing with the mouse and what I was watching on the screen. The resolution you're able to display on the external monitor is also limited, a fact which would have influenced my purchase. Without video capabilities that actually work, this product is a very expensive USB hub. I'm returning my docking station and using a USB hub. It only adds one more plug (instead of power and docking station I'm plugging in power, USB hub and VGA cable) and works infinitely better."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD VIDEO","review":"I've learned that USB connections are too slow to run an external monitor - the mouse action on the monitor was very eractic as a result.

The main selling point for this is that it has video capabilities... well, as much lag as there is even with super low quality video settings and with a lack of support for higher resolutions (above 1024x768) ... it just ruins the selling point. Buy a dock made specifically for your notebook if you're looking for video capabilities. The rest of the ports work fine. No PS/2 ports though for keyboard and mouse, just USB.

After repeated requests for a replacement a Targus rep finally did respond and allowed me to return one of the replicators. The replacement is no better.

Even the musical director comments at the end that this version of \\"Oliver\\" was not particularly well sung but that the cast had a lot of energy.Unfortunately,(in my opinion) this energy doesn't translate suficiently to the recording and I agree - it's not particularly well sung. Again, from the perspective of a former child performer singing with other kids, it actually is possible for a group of children to sing together and make pleasant-sounding music. The adults in this \\"Oliver\\" aren't up to musical snuff either.Although I haven't heard it, I'd be willing to take my chances on the original London version before settling for this one (which, by the way, was recorded in an LA studio before it even got to Broadway.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Film soundtrack much better","review":"Although the film soundtrack does not carry all the songs the original musical does I believe that the film's soundtrack is far superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for Thought - Great for Productions","review":"If you are considering a production of Oliver this is a great recording that has good background information.

So I am disappointed in the musical style on this recording.Everyone seems to be shouting instead of singing. I expected Fagin to \\"patter\\" in that speaking-singing hybrid, but on this recording MOST of the characters do it, and in a loud, forced voice -- the Artful Dodger, Nancy, and the kids' chorus.

I do like some of the approaches to the music in the old version, though. Gwen Verdon is great! Yet, pickups in the music is slightly off and tempo seems slightly uneven.

Their is the young, impulsive love affair, October and Harlin (ed norton). With that, comes the struggle with the father figure Wade (david morse). Also in the mix is Harlin's relationship with the little brother. The movie never really said how Wade and the two kids ended up together, and it hinted at how Harlin ended up in his chosen role as an urban born Valley cowboy. In all, this movie made was interesting, good acting, but not super suprising to me on how it ended. But you do see the depth in characters despite not having much of their history layed out as well.

I grew up semi rural Texas with a rich (not redneck) cowboy ethic and culture, and I lived in San Fernando Valley for a decade. I recognized no truth in any of the characters in this incredibly slow-going movie. It reminded me of an expanded student film in which the filmmakers have no real life experience but only know a virtual life as lived in front of a TV screen or in dark theater. Life is too short to waste on bad movies. And, sadly, this is one. This is a two hour film with about ten minutes of actual story."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one was a dud ...","review":"I'm glad I rented this first. I had some fairly high expectations going into it. Edward Norton has proved his acting talent in films like American History X, Fight Club, and Primal Fear. This movie, however, doesn't belong in the same class. It borrows heavily from classics like Taxi Driver, Five Easy Pieces, and Badlands (three of my favorite films) but doesn't have anywhere near their success. The movie just didn't add up to much. The dynamics are missing. The cause and effect relationships are weak. The dialogue is mundane. Everything is straightforward.

The book uses line drawings, which for buds & leaf scars actually works pretty well.The keys use quite a bit of plant science terminology- most of it is covered in the glossary at the end of the book.The biggest disappointment for me was the exclusion of coniferous evergreens from the book.On a day to day basis, I used another book \\"Fruit & Twig Key to Trees & Shrubs\\" more often, but this one covers more species."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Headed Monster","review":"\\"H20\\" is basically divided into a soul and a rock side.SideA contains all the hits plus the lean,stripped-down \\"Crime Pays\\"and the rolicking doo-wop of \\"Open All Night\\".Side Two contains the rockier \\"Family Man\\",\\"Italian Girls\\" and the catchy \\"Guessing Games\\" making this a worthy addition to theH&O's early 80's showcase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty and the Beast","review":"This movie is my favorite rendition of the classic fairytale. The costuming is so elaborate (even if it is in black & white), and the main characters (most especially the Beast) are so full of emotion and vulnerability that you literally feel their pain. In fact, I was kind of disappointed in the end when the Beast transformed into the Prince, as I'd fallen in love with the creature just as Belle had!The special effects are rather fascinating, as well. The Beast literally smokes after a hunt, the enchanted servants appear as moving statues or arms either holding candelabras or pouring out wine in the Great Hall.I highly recommend this film to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"good fine fun","review":"9-12 years old is just right for this book.

It looks NOTHING like the picture. The pendant is cheap and flimsy. The gold and silver colorations are not very true to the picture, it barely sparkles or has the same personality as the photo listed on this page. It's not a terrible necklace, but this is NOT what I was expecting at all. The only thing redeeming about this necklace is the chain it came on. It's pretty high quality, but it's also very thin...so it gets tangled VERY easily without you doing much of anything to it.I will be posting my own images of the pendant in the user submitted photos section, so if you don't believe me, have a look for yourself and then make up your mind.

It has a pliers like grip on the nose which has come in handy more than once. It also has an area behind the hinge for crimping B-connectors, etc. Another nice feature is that it is thin and compact, which makes it nice when keeping it in a pocket or tool belt. finally, these strippers look much nicer than products from Klien, etc.Cons: My main beef with these strippers is the spring mechanism; it is not held on very well, so it can pop out and get lost if dropped or opened to far. Also, for some reason they are labeled \\"Vice-Grip\\" instead of \\"Irwin\\", which isnt a con, but its just odd.All said, these are a great product and i would recommend them to any of my co-workers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Wiring Multitool","review":"This tool is solidly crafted.

As a published novelist myself, I don't know that this book would be my first choice to research a particular subculture I wanted to write about. The knowledge here can't substitute for actually getting out and talking to members of the subculture.

Sadly, we have some incandescents that are still running after 5 years of similar use, which by comparison, reflects poorly on these fluorescents.

What I think the books lacks is the detail necessary on all of the major topics. An example would be that he describes how to build a leanto for shelter, but doesn't go into detail on how to tie the structural members together. He just tells you that you need to tie them together. What if you don't have a shoelace to use? What other alternates are there?

Too bad a terrific punk soundtrack doesn't make up for a mediocre movie. Sure, the movie's alright and I know Tom Green didn't go for awards and praise, but I laughed maybe once. That may actually be alright though, because I rarely laugh at films these days.Hmm... Back to the album... If you're anything but a suburban skateboarding middle school underachiever, pick this up.

Hiding behind the cloth of the church, outside, they are loud, foul and running wild. It's an aventure reading about their double lives and the secrets reveal in their parents. My friend let me borrow this book and I pretty much guessed the outcome. So if you're look for surprises, this doesn't offer that because the outcome is very predictable, but another book that was recommended to me that is all about family and church drama is a novel called Lust Of The Flesh. This book was totally unpredictable and lively. Not a dull moment. A true pageturner and leaves you desiring more. I was actually mad when I got to the end and had to close the book. But I heard the sequel will be out sometime this year. I can't wait. Ya'll need to get Lust Of The Flesh. You'll be in for an educational surprise! Not to take away from The Preacher's Son, this was a good read too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable but still good","review":"Having read Mr Weber's previous books, I knew that I was in for a host of characters and a fast-paced plot.

Sit back and enjoy this book...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Not a Page Turner","review":"This book starts out REALLY slow and picks up for the last 100 pages or so. I was kind of disappointed with this one because I have really enjoyed Carl Weber's other books. I think it was REALLY unrealistic. I won't give it away but I just could not buy into Dante's choice at the end. Weber should stick with what works and not try and venture into Christian fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Novel!","review":"Like any other Carl Weber novel, this book was dynamic - a must read! However, I think I would have called it the 'Preacher's Kids' as it was based on the life of Dante (son) and Donna (daughter). Nevertheless, the only downfall, which was on my part was that I did not read the dimensions of the novel, so I was expecting the \\"big-size\\" Carl Weber novels.

It was no coincidence. I hadn't heard that song in all that time. I had to learn how to live again and this song really sunk in. You never know the far reaching effects a song can have in your life, this one helped me to move forward with alot of help from Our Father in Heaven.

Shepp's sax playing does indeed have an improv feel to it at times, but it's not so \\"out there\\" that the listener feels lost in space. He can hold a groove and lock in, as well as spread out and do his improv thing too. As noted by others, these recordings were made in the late 60s and include jazz luminaries such as Cedar Walton Bernard Purdie, Joh Chambers, Grachan Moncur, and Woody Shaw. There is also a guest vocal by Doris Troy. All in all, there is a good balance of styles on this CD, some of the music even bordering on fusion.

I know some reviewers criticized Sarah's lack of growth in the book, but my opinion is this is a more realistic version of a love story for the over-30 crowd. Yes, Sarah whined and carried on, but her family was funny and the situations she experienced were over-ther-top and hilarious!

As I got into the book, however, I began to enjoy it in its own right. Since I'm a big reader I often prefer the book to a movie adaptation, but in this case, I still preferred the movie. The book is good. It's just not as fleshed out as the movie was. I like the change in the father's girlfriend in the movie and felt the man who finally wins the heroine's good graces didn't get enough 'air' time to let me understand how he earned it in the book. I'm grateful, however, that it inspired the movie, which is among my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUN BEFORE ITS TOO LATE!!!!!!","review":"I read this book and I can say that I wish I had never picked it up! I could not stand the main character and her self-pity attitude. She never stood up for herself she just complained through out the entire book! She did not grow or change as a character. After finishing this novel I wanted to return it and get my money back! It was a pessimistic view on love and relationships in general. I thought that the end might make the book worth reading, but in fact it just solidified my disappointment. It is a depressing book toped off with an annoying main character.

The bad parts: a very unfunny and too long ending (the Ed Sullivan/ballet sequence), a dull dance routine with Janet Leigh in a fraternal lodge, Janet Leigh croaking through her numbers. I like this movie very much. I just fast forward through the dull parts. A charming bit of early sixties americana."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whats with the cover on this DVD?","review":"Why do they make a DVD with cover art that does not even appear in the film?

It was really good and I enjoyed it. The difference between the stage play and the movie is the story line. The writers and director took a big chance changing the storyline and lyrics around. The gamble paid off. Bye Bye Birdie is a watchable, enjoyable film. Paul Lynde makes me laugh with his rendition of Harry McAffee. Even unknown Jesse Pearson shines as Conrad Birdie. Bobby Rydell also gives a funny performance as Hugo Peabody. Overall, a well done movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly memorable, but not true to original script.","review":"In this Columbia Tristar version there are great performances by a number of people, from Dick Van Dyke to Ann Margaret to Janet Leigh to the wonderful Paul Lynde (as the father) to make this a lot of fun and though dated never seem to lose its magic.

It's kitschy at times. It's innocently saucy as well. This was before the Beatles hit the American music scene, of course it's based on Elvis getting drafted (amusing considering the Elvis/Ann Margaret rumored affairs later).

If you saw the play or were in the play in High School, you'll hate it. As is typical, Hollywood took a good script and completely re-wrote it....badly. In this version it fits with the \\"zany '60's comedy\\" format with campy situations, forced humor, and terrible overacting. The musical productions are so bad I thought I must be having sound difficulty. In all, the TV version made in '95 with Jason Alexander and Vanessa Williams is a much better production.

The story is so dopey, the teenagers so gagaliciously 1950ish (\\"getting pinned\\" is the source of a major number and integral to the plot), the parents so repulsive and/or outlandish, that it is a wonder anyone would bother putting it out on DVD. Unlike Grease, or Oklahoma, or any other musical I can think of, Birdie has no \\"larger\\" coherent message that translates through the anachronistic setting. And, purely as a musical, it is weak. With one or two exceptions, the songs are not well constructed and the choreography is unimaginative. The one redeeming feature is the very young and gorgeous Ann-Margaret. She is truly luminous, charismatic and talented, and the movie falters whenever she's not on screen.For real lovers of the genre only, otherwise, it's a very fast way to clear a room."},{"rating":"1","title":"So cutesy it made me nauseous","review":"Normally I enjoy nostalgic, goofy musicals.

Just seeing her in the \\"Got a lot of Living..\\" number gives me goosebumps! I love this film and can watch it over and over, they just don't make'em like they used to. Watching Dick van Dyke is a laugh riot. he could really give it his all. And Paul Lynde is a scream. If one knows anything about Elvis Presley and his impact on Rock-n-Roll and more importantly his major impact on young girls of the 50's-you can appreciate the near hysteria he caused.

St John shows a capacity for precise and economic use of language which results in a clarity which fully reveals the strength of his poetic imagery. This strength manifests most clearly in the many sensual metaphors which he uses to describe the human body. These wonderful images accumulate throughout the collection and their highly visual nature makes the poems come alive with images of the naked bodies which populate the text. The poems impressed me with their thematic sophistication, the clarity with which they expressed ideas, the intimacy of their detail and the honest nakedness of the subject matter. The Red Leaves of Night is a collection of immediate, passionate and powerful poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Enough To Educate Us","review":"Well it's only 4 stars cause as the old saying is nothing's perfect.Upon listening to \\"The Stereophonics\\" thrid album \\"Just Enough Education To Perform\\" I was not sure what to expect. At first listen I found myself comparing this album to their earlier works such as; \\"Word Gets Around,\\" and \\"Performance and Coctails.\\" After two or three listens it becomes obvious that this is their best album to date. With melodic acoustic arrangements and killer vocals by kelley Jones this eclectic 11 song album pushes along hit after hit. With Songs such as \\"Step On My Old Size Nines,\\" and \\"Rooftop,\\" it becomes obvious why this is one of the biggest bands in Europe, and gives us and understanding as to why they are becomming bigger in the US even with limited airplay on both MTV and radio.

Both those things result in passion.The Stereophonics, after a patchy but interesting debut with great singles, and a mediocre but intermittantly promising second album, appear to be in cruise control, knowing that the money's on the way in.'Meat and Potatoes rock' is a reasonable criticism really - most of the stuff here is so unexciting, predictable and generic, that it fails to hit any real emotion.

My only critcism is i think the first and last songs try too hard to be rocky and dont work with the rest of the album. However with 9 out of 11 good songs and a variety instead of the same type of songs over and over again I would recommend you buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"i dont normally like this sorta stuff but...","review":"some of u will hate my kind but i am a grunger or a metaler or a greebo whatever u call it but when i were given this album i firstly though bollox i want somethin hard and even though i would normally look down my nose at bandslike the STEREOPHONICS i decided to give it a go. it was fantastic the best non metal/ hard rock album i ever heard no i play it all the time YIPPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it the Stereophonics?","review":"Having bought this CD I feel a little let down. I fell in love with the first two albums, but this one just feels different. It's very laid back, and could do with being a little more heavier, like their first two albums. If you like the softer songs on their other albums then you'll probably enjoy this one, but for me it's just missing something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I recently started listening to the Stereophonics. I think that their musical style and the arrangement of songs on this CD are outstanding. It's not often that you find a band which not only shines in musical talent but has strong integrity to boot. I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes alternative/brit pop music and wants to add a quality CD to their collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different but as Solid as their other Albums","review":"J.E.E.P. is a softer, mellower album from the Sterophonics. Kelly Jones's voice is just as powerful--raspy in that earnest way of his--and the lyrics are, for the most part, just as compelling (except for the lyrics of \\"Mr. Writer\\" where Kelly says he wants to shoot all his critics--that was a bit much). I usually skip the first and last songs of the album and play the rest of it through. Particularly good are \\"Lying in the Sun\\", \\"Step on My Old Size Nines\\", \\"Nice to Be Out\\", \\"Everyday I think of Money\\" and \\"Caravan Holiday\\". Of course, that's almost the whole album right there!Some people have been disappointed with this album because it doesn't have as much \\"energy and rawness\\" to it as their previous two. While that's true, these critics must think that any change is a bad one. I disagree. This is a slower more thoughtful album, and it shines because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Stereophonics album","review":"I really enjoyed the previous two albums and this latest is no exception. It took a couple of listens before I loved J.E.E.P. It's got a slightly more melancholy tone than their two previous records. I especially like \\"Lying in the Sun\\", \\"Have a Nice Day\\", and \\"Maybe.\\" If you like the Stereophonics, this is a must have and if you've never experienced them, why not start now? This is a brilliant album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big dissapointment","review":"I thought this was going to be the best stereophonics album yet after waiting for it for so long,boy i was wrong. This album isn't stereophonics its mostly just Kelly Jones.most are acoustic songs which are boring apart from \\"step on my old sizes nines\\"When Kelly Jones picks up his electric guitar the album becomes alot more stronger with the likes of\\"vegas two times\\" the first single \\"mr writer\\" and the best track on the album\\"watch them fly sunday/rooftop\\"Those songs are brilliant its a pity the rest of the album isn't like that. And the new single \\"have a nice day\\"is the lamest single they have ever brought out. When they perform rock songs they are superb but if their next album is going to be like this,you can forget me buying it.

Straight out of the box, I toasted three slices of bread (two together, then one alone); they were burnt on the bottom and nearly white at the top -- and that was on a low setting. I promptly exchanged it for a Cuisinart CPT-160. The extra money seems to have been worth it -- so far, it makes beautiful toast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Great, Not a Terrific Toaster.","review":"I am a little disappointed with the Krups Toast Supreme Compact Toaster. It has some really nice features like a pull out crumb tray and several settings like defrost and bagels. The sleek design looks great on the counter and it is easy to clean. That said, not once since I unpacked it has anything been evenly toasted and the elements inside do not glow uniformly, bread slices are really dark on the bottom and not toasted at the upper centers. This toaster feels and sounds cheaply made, and I am dreading sending it for service. I wish instead, I could exchange it for something that works better and isn't such a lightweight. I expected better from Krups and can't recommend this toaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Vote Against this Model","review":"I agree entirely with the gentleman who criticized this model for toasting unevenly.

I could have bought a less expensive model and had a smaller, sturdier device. Worse, I've yet to have an English muffin or piece of toast that turned out evenly toasted. One side of the item gets very dark, the other side is light. And if you are toasting items that are smaller (like an English muffin), they are so low down in the unit that you will need something other than your fingers to pull them out with (or risk burning yourself like I've done.) Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this toaster","review":"I should have paid more attention to the other negative reviews before buying this piece of junk. After six days, it quit functioning. But by then, I was happy to return it -- the toasting was inconsistent and uneven, much worse than the $12.00 Proctor-Silex I was replacing. How hard can it be to make a toaster that works reliably? Krups apparently has a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toaster Death","review":"The Krups FEC212 died a smelly death after one year of service - the electronic control board had one part go up in smoke.

Someone escapes from prison on Blackwell's Island, so the boys go to investigate at the dock on West St. The police think the prisoner has drowned, but has not. By stealing a truck they helped the convict. The kids end up in reform school (again). Danny's (Bobby Jordan) brother, Bill, is wrongfully accused of murder. The real murderer is the same convict that got the boys in reform school. Within two days, the kids must break-out of reform school to save the life of Danny's brother before he is executed. Ann Doran is in this one and Bobby Stone too. Gabriel Dell who was over with Billy Halop, Huntz Hall and Bernard Punsly helping the Little Tough Guys joins the East Side Kids films too.

Unfortunately, what ever energy she put into that cut is lost on the full-length album. That song is still supremely catchy, but the rest of the album is a limp affair that tries toreplicate that hit, but instead reveals the artist's thin vocalswrapped around soulless Europop dance grooves and sappy, hollow production.

In addition, the quality of the box was quite poor for the price, the plastic was rough around the edges and not sturdy at all. I might have returned the box even if it hadn't been broken. Overall, a very disappointing purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken","review":"May have been great if it wasn't crakced and broken in 2 out of 4 corners.

After about 2 months of use... the steamer ceased to function properly and steam came out of the espresso head instead. I contacted a service advisor at Krups' website and it turns out that I would have to ship the machine to the nearest service center in Illinois on my own dime. No thank you! I'll find something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unsatisfactory Experience","review":"Consolidating a long story into a few sentences, I actually owned 3 different Krups Espremio's, after 1 was returned to the store and 1 was lost by their Service system. Two were defective right out of the box (nonfunctioning 'ready' light/ bad leakage around filter basket), and the third failed after 5 months of use (loud bang followed by profuse leaking).My experience with the Krups Service System was so unsatisfactory that I will not try to have my current machine repaired, despite time remaining on the warranty.When it worked, it produced great espresso and foamed milk rather nicely.My advice: Spend a little extra and buy a better machine. (Please note that people with bad experiences are more likely to write reviews than are happy customers. Your experience may differ from mine.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great cup of espresso, but only one at a time.","review":"As a recent purchaser of the Krups Espremio, I was amazed at how easily the pump action worked compared to my old boiler model. It's a faster process and makes a hotter cup of espresso. It also froths well and because of the large tank, can froth large amount of milk. The only drawback to the machine is it's ability to produce only one cup of espresso at a time. This is due to the shallow, small one-cup filter. I saw no optional filters on Krups.com, and have emailed them asking if a two cup filter is available. Other than that, I recommend this machine highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst KRUPS !!!","review":"Do not waste your money on this machine.

Water leaked out of the filter and I assumed I had received a defective machine...I guess not. Though I like the convenience of having a removable water tank, not knowing how much water I need per cup of espresso was aggravating. For this and all the reasons the previous reviewer has stated, I asked for a replacement thinking I had received a dud machine, but now it appears it will have to be permanently returned. The quest continues for another espresso machine that is easy to use and reasonably priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but cheap for a reason","review":"Nice machine; does a very good cup of coffee.

A list of my grievances:1) water leaked from all around the filter cup while brewing;2) The filter stuck in the machine when I removed the cup and then spilled watery grounds all over the place;3) Even after several attempts I was unable to produce any froth at all with the steaming function. All I got was boiling milk; and4) I didn't like that you had to guess how much water to let flow through to get one shot of espresso. Personal preference, I know, but I like to have the water premeasured;Basically, this machine is a pain to use. Maybe I was doing it all wrong, but I never had any trouble operating my el cheapo thirty dollar machine. The only reason I'm replacing the old one is because it's begun leaking steam from the screw-top lid.I've returned this one and purchased a different (more expensive) machine, and I'm hoping for the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"This machine leaks horribly!","review":"I recently bought this machine, which works fine except that it leaks horribly all around the filter holder. Water goes everywhere, into the coffee, all over the machine. I tried compacting the coffee more and less, using different grinds of coffee, nothing worked. It was just a bad machine. I assumed that it was defective, so I sent it back, and got another one, which did exactly the same thing. On the positive side, it did heat up very fast, and would have made espresso very fast, and if it werent for the extreme leaking, I would have kept this machine. The leaking was so bad it made the machine unusable. Do not buy this machine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality for the price","review":"This was my second cappuccino maker, and after 1 use I am returning it. It feels really cheaply-built. The knob to turn it from espresso to steam feels like it will break very soon. It only makes 1 cup at a time, and doesn't get the milk very frothy like my last one did. I got it on sale, but it still wasn't worth $69. I'll spend more if I can find one that doesn't feel like it was built by a kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Steam Hose","review":"Initially, this machine worked well. It made very good espresso and easily steamed the milk. It was also easy to clean. After about 8 weeks, steam was coming out from the insides, not through the nozzle. I took it apart to find the hose leading to the nozzle had come off. I replaced it and tried again. The pressure knocked it right off again. The nipple used to connect the hose is very short, which means this will be a common problem. We ended up returning this for a full refund (luckily the store we dealt with had excellent service)."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke within 7 months","review":"I bought this machine for my husband for Christmas.

Second, the way this is put together, it separates with the lightest touch, making it impossible to even shift the habitats around without it falling apart. The rainforest portion is made up of three walls that are really not attached together or to the base, and it literally collapsed upon on itself, freeing the tree frogs that I just put in there.I wish that this was better created.

Good background music, essentially. However, one night last summer I came home, grabbed a drink, opened the windows, and put this CD in the stereo (because it happened to be laying around), and just sat down to chill. That's when it hit me: this a fantastic album. Nicola Hitchcock's beautiful voice literally seems to cascade over the shimmering beats and lush soundscapes of the music. An absolutely perfect CD to have on while relaxing on a warm summer evening (in fact, listening to the album now reminds me of that summer evening when I first \\"discovered\\" the album).

No, they aren't doing anything we haven't all heard before, but so what! Sometimes you just want more of what you know you like. This isn't going to become a favorite CD in my collection, but it is a nice addition. Yes, there are plenty of trip hop bands out there like Portishead, Lamb, even Alpha who do this stuff better, but there's room for both the innovators and the copy cats they breed. Besides, there are plenty of copy cats out there who can't even swing COPYING a good band. And \\"Not Seventeen\\" is a really standout song. Similar to Lamb (Ugh! The comparisons!) they've hitched the song to a Gorecki symphony, but I actually think (just barely, mind you) that they did a better job with it.

Everything here remind the Portishead world.In the same veine than Alpha, or Andrea Parker, Mandalay has done a very good album, but with the same ingredients, so there is nothing new in this. Let say, that if you think Portishead has not done enough album, buy this one, if you are tired with slow bass tempo, don't buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD for quiet reflection","review":"I agree with the comments the remix CD was a nice addition but in no way compares to the original disc. The comparison to Massive Attack were fairly apt and you can hear hints of a \\"Teardrop\\" sound to several songs; it's far lighter, subtle, and ethereal than a Morcheeba, Portishead, Olive, or other groups which others compared this to.This definitely isn't music for a vigorous exercise session or dancing, but is perfect for a day of quiet reflection. It would also be ideal if you were looking for something which would be agreeable to an extremely broad cross-section of listeners, it'd be a nice changeup from classical or similar during your dinner or cocktail party."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be prepared to lose media","review":"Nero makes beautiful CDs and the few times I could get it to make a dvd the results were ok.

And All-In-One is blatant false advertising unless you're prepared to fork out even more money to get all of the features turned on.Don't believe the hype (which seems to have made it's way all the way down into the \\"user\\" reviews). Nero is a jumble of poorly defined programs with overlapping functionality (or lack there of) and useless documentation to help wade through the mess. It lacks a lot of useful and user friendly features found in freeware.

The results remind me of listening to old audio cassettes on those old portable desktop cassette players (as in the 1970s and early 1980s).

A class encapsules the implementation and iterface or a user defined data abstaract data type, also know as user defined type.

Yet when things get abstract I've found this book extremely lacking:=the explanations become confusing, and the language used is certainly not beginner friendly. The code examples are in some cases terrible and lacking in variety and scope. Add to this: typos, missing code examples, and answers ommitted to the Chapter problems.

For example, the topic of pointers is thrown at the reader without even a discussion of what * or & means. The whole slew of pointer syntax possibilities is laid out in front of you, but without a description of why and how each statement does what it does.Intermediate \\"programmers\\" - not \\"pc users\\" as the author claims - would probably not get lost in this book, but even then a great deal of 'how & why' is missing.Summary - there are much better introductory C++ books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for beginners!","review":"I recently decided to learn the C++ programming language and was having a difficult time as I have NO prior programming experience, except for the ancient BASIC language.

Olivia holds nothing back (including naughty words) on any of her songs. The two songs I didn't care for were \\"'Til He Comes Home\\", where she is praising her criminal boyfriend, and \\"Bring Da Roof Down\\", a silly club song.

I know I don't have to tell you all how uncommon it is to find an album where every song is just hot, but trust me, this is the one! Olivia has her own unique sound-she doesn't have bubble gum lyrics as some of our young artists do today. Although my girl, Monica, has a mature sound, she is still missing the street edge. On \\"It's On Again\\" and \\"When 2 Souls Touch,\\" her voice is almost angelic, no offense, Aaliyah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven, mediocre debut","review":"Olivia's song Bizounce was a good funky song for the album's first single, but the rest of this album sounds surprisingly uneven and mediocre. The explicit nature of most of the songs really turns me off. She comes off sounding offensive on most songs as she wants control of the man and the relationship. And the wanting to be a singer then turning around and being a rapper comes off as disjointed here. Olivia needs to pick a style and stick with it. The uptempo numbers lack the punch of what Aaliyah or Mary J Blige did before. And she lacks feeling on some of the ballads. I'm surprised that this album didn't sell well on J Records.

The ghetto princess persona is so played out, and was even played out then. One second she is queen of the ghetto, the next track she is talking about passionate love making, then she goes back to the hood, talking about how she will hold her man down while he's in the penitentiary. Then we have the standard mindless club \\"bangers\\" that fall flat and have zero credibility. And of course a song with new, made-up slang.

This gives explainations of Spares magical philosophy and his art in a less enigmatic way then his writings do. The second part is The Book of Zos vel Thanatos, containing The Logomachy, The Zotic Grimoire: The Formulae of Zos vel Thanatos and The Living Word, all later material by Spare published here for the first time.The book is filled to the brim with Spare's art, including some beautyful colour pictures.

The content itself is light -- if you don't already understand one of the points, there often isn't enough there to help you \\"get it\\". The book also flits back and forth between being targeted at business writing and at legal writing, but it never does the transition well, and doesn't really do either one justice.The author also keeps denigrating \\"jargon\\", but doesn't distinguish between pretentious language and technical jargon.Finally, the appendices made NO sense to me at all when I got to them. It sounded like the author has some pet peeves or theory that she wanted to put into the book, but couldn't make them fit anywhere else. Now that I've read the Amazon entry for the book, it makes sense -- the author sells traveling writing workshops, and the appendices would seem to be trying to market those, albeit indirectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burnout Revenge","review":"This is the best racing game ever better that Forza Motorsports 3.

Were the other games if you bumped a car you wreck and start all over. This game the more cars you hit the more points you get and the only way you can wreck is head on colligation which are rare. It much easier but still challenging, even if you hate the other burnouts games, this one is much better and worth the try.It really is fun trying to wreck on purpose and the kids like that they are able to get through the race on the 1st try. Were in the old game they'd have to do it a couple times before getting at least 3rd place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burnout Revenge Review","review":"Yes, I must admit, sometimes seeing how big of a wreck you can make is fun, but this is mindless. The graphics aren't what they are often described as - they only look good because there are so many colors and lights and lines, and you're moving so fast that sometimes you sort of forget about the graphics. Racing isn't so bad, but I have never been satisfied with closed-course racing. When you do a takedown, the camera looks back at the car you just totaled and plays it in slow-motion. Then, all of a sudden, you're back to racing. This happens so quickly you don't have time to react...and then you watch yourself smash into a wall. And this game is so unrealistic - you run into a semi-truck and it goes flying into the air and you never see it again. Obviously, everyone has a different opinion on this game, but if I were you, I would rent it before I spent my money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"just a great concept","review":"Everybody loves to crash, i really like the crash tracks, that is fun by yourself and playing with friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crash Racing Game","review":"This is a racing game where you can crash and come back again.

The gamer does not need simulation driving skills. It is simply meant to be fun and the music is great. Visually, it takes some getting used to the harsh contrast incorporated into the game. It must have been intentional, though. The bright sunlight in your eyes contrasted by the dark shadows on the road, add a level of difficulty without slowing down the gaming experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Play","review":"What can i say about this game that hasn't already been said?

For me the original world tour interface was perfect and the new revenge interface changed something that didnt need fixing. Also, the crash junctions have lost alot of their appeal by eliminating all pick-ups.

If you click on the CD image for a larger view, so that the names of the musicians can be seen more clearly, you will see the actual line-up. Still, this is a solid band for sure. Snidero comes from the \\"Cannonball Adderly\\" school of saxophone playing, as is evident in his phrasing and tone. Being that the Criss Cross label keeps its talent \\"close to home\\" so to speak, the musicians on this CD, particularly Snidero and Peter Washington, have played together on more than one occasion, yielding a studio album with a real sense of cohesiveness that is more often only heard from bands that work or tour together regularly.

Fortunately I came here and found out it was on this Como album -- believe me, this song alone is worth the price of the CD!

John Madden himself, doesn't even make an appearance in the game, which leads me to believe that the game was rushed through production.

I now own the new John Madden for the Xbox 360 and I am very disappointed. How can there be any football played without refs on the field, there are no chains for measurement. Also there aren't any way to challenge a call this is unheard of, no edit mode or anything. I think EA Sports should have a recall on all of their Madden games."},{"rating":"1","title":"this game sucks!!!!","review":"the only reason i gave this game 1 star is because it wouldnt let me give 0 stars, or negative stars. no superstar mode, franchise mode blows. if you feel like wasting 60 bucks, you will get more out your money if you just set it on the ground and walk away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Game is fun, until you can no longer play because of bugs.","review":"At first, I really liked it. It's nice looking, plays well, ... anyway. You can't even play past the 3rd week in Franchise Mode because of a roster problem. It won't let you simulate or play certain games, and you can't play past an incomplete week. The manual is absolutely horrible, and online play is really slow/skippy, whereas other Xbox 360 games have been perfect and smooth online.None of these things even matter, though, as the support staff is unresponsive, and the game can't be completed. I've been looking around for days for a solution, but this games primary audience, 13-year-olds, aren't really the most instructive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look!!!

What a beautifully polished turd.Why is there even a franchise mode??, they cut so much from it that its just a shell of its former self...

Say goodbye to everything you liked about Madden. They axed a ton of features that seperated this game from all the other football games. Online play has suffered, the fantasy draft is no more, you can't even challenge plays! Graphically, it looks amazing but that's the only improvement. It honestly feels like you're playing a demo and you're denied access to all the functions that make the game worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe it","review":"First of all I must say that the game is beautiful. The upgraded environments and player profiles are stunning. With that said however; EA....what were you thinking with this game! I am a lifer when it comes to this series and I could not be more disappointed with the removal of certain game features (just ridiculous). The camera modes and lack of them are just awful, the movements of the players look like they are power walking when running, and the playcalling menu really should not have been changed. I'll buy your next release but don't break my heart again."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUSHED TO MARKET TOO SOON","review":"If the gameplay was as detailed as the PS2 version, this game would have rocked. The graphics are superior. They really dropped the ball of gamming options....some of the key things missing was no Superstar mode. You can't build and devolpe you own player for a career. No challenge of plays. I am sure there are several other things missing, after playing it about 4 or 5 times, I quit playing because it was no fun. I hope the 2007 edition will be better.

Your madden game of 2006 is the same as the 2004 edition. The graphics looks identicle, 1 useless feature is added and you charge full price. Its pethetic. Your games suck. i played a game without ever touching my controller on defense! isent that amazing! The computer controllers my character and plays defense. i dont need to touch anything.

I have owned every madden game since it was on the super nintindo, and this has got to be one of the most defective in the series.If you are looking for a football game, Madden 07 is ok, they fixed a lot that was broken with this one, but it would be smart to wait for Madden 08.Because of the \\"next-gen\\" engine that they were working on for this one and 07, they are still ironing out a lot of the kinks, however having played Madden 07, I feel that Madden 08 will finally be worth our money, so steer clear of this one and wait a couple months."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sport played and watched by retards","review":"My title says it all really, this is the most backward sport ever created.

If you want to watch a real sport watch the world cup in germany later this year along with the rest of the world.

To tell the truth, its probably more fun without the darts. the scope is a non-magnifying plastic tube, and you cant even ajust it. Because of this, the crosshairs are way above were the dart will hit, especially because the dart starts to dip down after about 10 feet (assuming it makes it out of the barrel). the secondary gun didnt even work when i got i got it. If you get the little nerf pistol with the laser on it along with some dart tag darts it shoots twice as far as the long shot.

After removing parts of the plastic pieces I was able, with some force, to snap the pistol grip firmly in place.

Firstly, it was impossible to put together properly because the stock on the front will not attach properly - it's supposed to slide all the way back but won't, so the trigger on that bit won't work at all. Consequently he never actually used the front part of the gun. It's a waste. And worse - after only 5 days of use, the main gun won't fire even twice in a row without jamming. I have a boy in tears.. it was the thing he really wanted for Christmas. It's an over-expensive, useless piece of plastic waste.

The longshot is so disappointing. Jams constantly, slow mechanism, heavy for the weak shots u get. Inconsistent shots. The pathetic front gun handle snaps off all the time, who designed this crap? We ended up keeping the stampede instead. I think that all the glowing reviews here are probably fake. I read them and based my decision on those. If you get this gun, you too will be adding your poor review. The longshot has less power than the stampede, the hyperfire, even the nite finder has more power and distance. It's not so much the weak fire, it's the variable firing and accuracy. We ended up ripping off that stupid front gun, taking off the barrel, which just retards any power, taking off the stand ( too heavy), and trimming off all excess plastic crap that this gun has. Now a decent gun that jams only now 60% of the time. Avoid this dog of a nerf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nerf Longshot","review":"Great toy.

Comes with two mags, which is nice. Haven't had trouble with it yet, and is a very nice looking toy. Shoots well stock, and is a little tricky to mod if you want a little more out of it.

This movie stinks, its all hype great marketing , great packaging, great trailer, but the film is crap it stars stupid horrible acting porno chicks and , after watching the doll lick enough booty while farting, and seeing it ejaculate a few times ive had enough this is not a horror film its mostly porno and its just not funny for more then 5 mins, the film has no class, and is trashy 13 yr old humor that gets old fast, dont be fooled by the hype trust me pass on this, its junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING BORING BORING!!!","review":"First off, I admit that I LOVE offensive movies. I love exploitation films and cult movies and 'so-bad-they're-good' movies. So I was really excited when I heard about this film. The artworkon the DVD cover was very funny and the movie seemed like it would be a blast.It was not. The writing was insultingly bad, and the directing and \\"acting\\" were worse. It's a shame, too, because a murderous Black Panther ventriloquist dummy is actually a very funny idea. Unfortunately funny ideas don't always translate into watchable films.The most offensive thing about this movie is that it was so boring. It was just over an hour long, and it felt like four hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been so much better...","review":"I had initially been exposed to 'Black Devil Doll' through an advertisement in Rue Morgue magazine. What seemed to be a pretty entertaining premise fell flat on its face and this movie's only saving grace is that it's so preposterously far-fetched that it almost makes it enjoyable.I'll save you the agony of delving into details about what makes this movie so terribly bad, but I'll give you the quick summary: it begins weak, the build to the climax is weak, and the climax is anti-climactic. The length of some of the scenes were really annoying as well. I am a huge supporter of underground and independent film-making, but I just can't support something so boring and annoying. If you consider yourself to be a semi-intelligent person, you'll be running for the hills if you give this one a shot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not even be average for a porn film","review":"Really??? People think this movie is good?? Cult potential?? What?? Why?? This has to be the product of some loser in middle school that tried really hard to be offensive and funny and wanted any reason to film a movie just for an excuse to finally see naked women. I mean this movie was not funny, had terrible effects even for a home movie, and the acting was literally worse than anything I have seen (and I own thousands of low budget horror films). I mean 90% of it was random shots/flash edits of naked women.

I have the original film on a beaten up VHS. I think the original film is far better. Or rather I should say, far weirder, then the remake. The newer film has the benefits of..... well, more women for one. And of course, being more modern, and will appeal to a more modern audience. However, I much prefer the complete insanity that is the original flick, and if you really want that Grindhouse feel, the original is the only way to go.IMDB: [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful.","review":"There's really not much to say about \\"Black Devil Doll.\\" The storyline is minimal: the ghost of an executed black serial killer possesses the body of a ventriloquist's dummy, then murders and rapes (in varying order) a bunch of white women.

Umbrella Conspiracy was one of the best books I have ever read, and a month later I got this one. It isn't quite as good as the first novel, and about 100 pages go by before any real zombie-busting goes on (the fight with the Umbrella troops is cool, though), but still, it is good enough to buy and a decent novel for big RE fans... I can't wait for the novelization of RE2!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as exciting as the other books.","review":"I am a big Resident Evil fan and I have all of Perry's books. The 2nd book to me was very bland. The characters are well developed, but there was something missing in the plot. Seriously, zombies with guns? Although in the fourth game the 'zombies' (not corpse-like) are armed, the idea of picturing a rotting corpse with a machine gun is laughable, but boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow Much Better","review":"This bok is much better then the first Resident Evil book. First of all SD Perry is not bounded by a script form a computergame and she's more free. er writing has become more independent and her fantasy more real.Overall it's a god book, and if the like the Zombie world that George A Romero or HP Lovecraft or any of those writers.

With boring and pointless riddles the book becomes dull about 100 pages in. Also the only real enemy is a few gun weilding zombies. All the others at least offered a variety of enemies.

I especially enjoyed Donadio's examination of James' vivid Tie collection. Donadio's own illustrious break dancing career makes him the perfect man to document Nietzsche's own prolific moves. While Donadio's style is dry at times, he quickly remounts his literary horse, drawing the reader into a trance-like state of literary ectasy. If that isn't the artistic will, I don't know what is!Any true student of American literature would love hiding away with Donadio and a six pack, ready to appreciate approach life with renewed vigor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick reference to those forgotten legends","review":"First thing you will notice is that this is definitely a picture book. I has pictures of great works of art that depict different interpretations of great legends (and I believe them all) from around the word and throughout time.This book is a keeper. As time passes and your interests move form one location to another this book will get you off the ground with the basics. I checked out Persephone as I have a copy of Dante Gabriele Rossetti's Persoperine in the library. I found references and related art peppered through the book. However, I seem to remember her eating six pomegranate seeds, not one.The book has a clear well organized table of contents (also with pictures), an extensive cross-referenced index and easy to read layout."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!","review":"Unless you're a fan of \`The Mick Box Band,' there's no reason for this CD to exist. Aside from a few tracks from Firefly (why fade out the last few seconds of \\"Wise Man\\" and call it a \`single edit'?) and \\"Free \`n Easy,\\" there's nothing for the early fan at all. Sure, there are the live versions of \\"Easy Livin'\\" and \\"Suicidal Man\\" (the last known recordings with Hensley in the band), but the sound quality on these tracks is awful, and the performance (especially the vocals) is even worse. The only other redeeming factor is a cover of the Argent classic, \\"Hold Your Head Up.\\" True to the original version overall, Box turns in some respectable guitar work on the cut. Skip this one unless you want to see how the band deteriorated into what it is now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound and Fury Signifying Nothing","review":"I purchased this book with great anticipation, having already accepted the (apparent) basic premise. I believe that much about traditional or at least fundamentalist Christianity is/can be immoral. I was looking forward to some innovative thought on this subject. Instead, I found a poorly written, meandering rant. The tone and style of this book is that of the worst stereotype of the fundamentalist hell-fire and brimstone preacher. This style is certainly ironic given the subject matter. There is at least as great a danger in taking at face value an uneducated writer who attacks his subject out of such obvious fear and anger. While the author raises some valid points, this book is so bad I stopped reading after the first 30-40 pages and skimmed the remainder to see if it contained anything of redeeming value. It didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Received 2. Both Leak from the top.","review":"I received two of these for Christmas. I tried them both.

The first two years, we used it once or twice a week, after which the top \\"lip\\" separated from the carafe. No way to fix it.The second one lasted another two years, with more frequent use. Because the first one went so quickly, we've been extra-careful with this one (hard to do when you haven't had your first cup yet!). The handle is now separating from the carafe.

It's not terrible, but as a riff-powered song I don't think it holds up compared with some of their earlier work. In fact it sounds downright forced and more than a little cheesy. The band embraced a new style on the album of its origin, \\"One Second\\", and I don't think the formula mixes well with this nostalgic throwback to chugging guitar times. At the very least, fans who are into Paradise Lost enough to buy this would do well to just buy the album and leave it at that. They'll find \\"Soul Courageous\\" there also and plenty of stronger material. The only reason to buy this single is the b-side \\"Cruel One\\", a relatively weak song that PL guitarists Greg Mackintosh and Aaron Aedy have since admitted they detest."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the most part, succeeds at what it's trying to be","review":"My aunt got this book for me a few years ago when I mentioned to her that I'd like to learn to cook. She knew that I needed simple recipes and that I have very little time to plan and prepare meals for my family. To that end, this book is useful. It advertises that every recipe contains only 5 ingredients and can be prepared in 3 (or less) easy steps, and it certainly does that. It's utilitarian to the core---all black-and-white text, no pictures, two recipes crammed onto every page for a total of over six hundred recipes. One could certainly complain about the lack of pictures, but that isn't what the book is trying to be, and for what it's trying to be, it does it pretty well.My only complaint about the book is that some of the recipes I've tried have been duds.

John Denver lays his heart out on the table with this 1971 release. With raw emotion John attacks a pair of Paul McCartney songs,\\"Let It Be\\" and \\"Junk\\", and gives them new life. After buying this CD I was forced to invest in a boxset and it turned out to be a great move. This is a good John Denver Starter album and is also full of some great songs many fans might not have heard. It is slower and more emotional than his album Windsong but in the same token, don't worry it is not depressing.

I would put things there, and in a few minutes (after making a turn, etc.) they were tipped, scrambled, and all over the place! Maybe my husband could build some kind of a box to hold them? But first I looked on the internet, and found this Litter Bag. It sounded small, but I ordered it for a try. It is wonderful! It holds more than I ever thought it could, and never tips over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"flimsy","review":"I've had this little trash bag in my car for probably 8 years. It has been very useful and never tips over. But it is small as people have said, and it's getting smaller all the time, because it compresses down since the sides don't hold it up (as another reviewer has mentioned). I have to say, I'm finally looking for a different style of trash can for my car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing....","review":"I really loved the idea of the Trash can in the car. No mess, no garbage floating around. I was very exited and disappointed when I finally got the product. It is much smaller than expected. It really won't fit a bag so you have to take it out to empy it. It also does not stick to the cars carpeting. It's weighted at the bottom, but it will still tip over. Did I mention it's very small? This is a good idea, but it's still more practicle to carry a bag in your car instead of this. It just takes space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Objects (in the picture) appear larger than they are","review":"This might be really great if all you need is a place for used kleenex. Please read the product dimensions and try to imagine what that size container would hold, considering what you have in your car! In my car I have small water bottles, other drink containers, an occasional fast food bag, and mail that's not going home. This will hold about one day's worth of that! One-half day if my grandchildren are with me.Product is well built and attractive. The weight (a bean bag) takes up some of the trash space in a zippered compartment on the bottom. The bag I have is 7 x 6 x 8. (Not the listed dimensions) Minus the bean bag = not much space for trash. Right now there is a water bottle, a juice bottle, and a crumpled up paper bag. Full. Time to empty.I am returning the three I just bought for all the cars in the family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy little item!","review":"This small but functional waste basket performs well for me. I like the fact that it has a lid to cover the trash, and the fishnet side pockets are handy for keeping CDs or small Kleenex packages, etc.I was concerned that it would not 'stay put' on the raised hump in the floor of my Buick. The Velcro strips on the bottom don't seem to add much grip, BUT the sandbag sequestered cleverly in the zippered slot in the bottom of the wastebasket does an excellent job of stabilizing it! I've been using it for a couple of months now, and while I don't drive as aggressively as I did when I was younger, it's not tipped over once!I would recommend this item to anyone. I'm very happy with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"The weighted and velcro base keep this product in place nicely. It also blends right in with a black or charcoal interior. Exactly what I wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sondheim At His Best!","review":"This is a breath taking masterpiece. Sondheim is truly a genius. The story combined with the amazing voice of Bernadette Peters makes this one of the greatest musicals of all time. If you have only heard the cd, buy the viedo. It is an amazing piece of art that should be heard by every body, musical lover or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Artists Only","review":"I once was associated with a community theater production of \\"Sunday In The Park With George,\\" my favorite musical. Unlike most community theaters, this one was well-funded, with money to burn, and burn money they did. In attempting to replicate the production values of the original Broadway show, their comprehensive carbon copy was the most expensive play they had ever put on in their 150 year history. It was DOA, and a flop. Because copying isn't art. Because they could sing it, but they couldn't hear it. What makes \\"Sunday In The Park\\" so thrilling is that it soars on songs that plumb (with great good humor and compassion), the demands that art makes on artists. As the title of this review, taken from the Talking Heads, suggests, you either get it, or you don't. Most don't. Or as George sings, \\"They have never understood / And no reason that they should / But if anybody could. . .\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Believe it's from Sondheim","review":"All I can say about this is boring.

Thank God they saved themselves six years later with INTO THE WOODS"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Example of What Sondheim Can Do","review":"Scrolling down the screen, I see a lot of four and five star reviews of this CD. I feel bad about doing this, but I bought \\"Sunday\\" only because I though Sondheim would have repeated the brilliance he put into the likes of \\"Sweeney Todd\\" and \\"Company.\\" I think this CD is garbage. Maybe the score sounds better when mixed with the other elements of the show (which I've heard many good things about). I saw the second act of the B'way production, though, a was not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pppppttttthhhhllllltttt!","review":"Sondheim, your work is very intricate, very tediously written, the performances were outstanding, and would have been better if you had included a MELODY OR TWO IN THIS SHOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best!","review":"I first saw the video of SITPWG, and I must say I was a little disappointed when I got the CD: the voices are sometimes behind the music, the sound changes, and most of all I found that several songs were \\"rushed\\" (Sunday in the park..., Everybody loves Louis). But even though, it still gives me shivers everytime I put in on the player. The music is gorgeous anyway. Just buy the video as well as the CD :-) !"},{"rating":"2","title":"not quite perfection","review":"i think this show drags in the second act. fortunately, this isn't as apparent when listening to this recording. ms. peters is excellent (and should have won the tony). this was probably the last performance mr. patinkin gave before his voice became just too precious to be tolerated. (i love the act two opener \\"it's hot up here\\")"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not get this version if you want the lyrics booklet!!!","review":"Dont make the same mistake I did and get the newer 2007 version. The sound is not much different to the original recording. If its remastered it should have included the original booklet info along with the new liner notes. Otherwise it is a great musical.I'd get the 1990 release or earlier of this which does include the lyrics of the songs and not just pointless liner notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"One of the best scores written by Stephen Sondheim! So amazing! You will enjoy it very much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Musical Ever","review":"This is, quite simply, the worst musical ever written. Boring, self-indulgent and completely lacking in charm. It is difficult to sing, worse to listen to, and impossible to sit through. Sondheim fans rant and rave about it's technical superiority in terms of musical sophistication. Sophisticated it is, entertaining it most definitely is not. I honestly never expected to find a musical I didn't like, but in this case I did. Do not buy this album, do not go to see this show. It is art for art's sake, and that should never be encouraged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunday in the Park with George is Outstanding","review":"I saw this show on Broadway in 1984 and this recording brings back the thrill of that experience. Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters are at the top of there game. This is a magical recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Sondheim","review":"This has all the elements of a classic Sondheim musical. Haunting melodies, lyrics that can really make you think. Sondheim is unmatched in musical theatre today for his ability to write such complex and beautiful music and lyrics. And this show will demonstrate it. Bernadette Peters is wonderful in the role of Dot, even makes you laugh a couple of times. Her Children and Art is beautiful in every sense of the word. Mandy Patinkin is also wonderful, his voice soars. If you want a loud, fun musical, don't buy this. But if you want a beautiful, intelligent piece of art, buy Sunday in the Park with George!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An old favorite","review":"After seeing a few revivals of this musical in the 2000-2002, inclduing the Kennedy Center show, I felt compelled to pull out the original again for a listen. It was once a favorite, and yet in recent years has taken a back seat for me to other new cast recordings. However, I now once agian have it out to be played often... what wonderful performances by the origainl cast. And the entire cast, in my opion, has not been euqulaeed since 1986. Bernedette Peters I feel was at her finest in this role, her unique voice enhancing the songs (in some other shows or CD's I feel her style can detract from a song). Ditto for Mandy... his George is excellent, but his \\"Wild Party\\" performace, both on the CD and in person, detracted from the songs. This 1986 cast may represnet the very best version of \\"Sunday...\\" that we will ever see or hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous recording of a great Sondheim show.","review":"Performances could not be better.

As a nice touch, the cd notes include the written music for each chart (in a fractured way), fun to follow, and then hear what they do with them. Group playing at it's finest, combined with some very tasty solos, all propelled in beauty and power. Also, a very fine recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for the price","review":"For the price you would think that these are junk knives but I love a good knife and these are great for the price. Compared to the Henkels they are similar in quality. They hone well, have a nice angle to them for chopping and work well. I was suprised how well these keep up with the $120 chef knife. For the price try it; give to the kids if you don't like them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth about Ronnie Raygun","review":"This booklet is a classic. It's essentially a long, well-organized list of contradictory Reagan quotes - some from the same day. For example, \\"I love trees and think they are unique\\" versus \\"I think that if you've seen one tree, you've seen them all.\\" If you have had a sneaking suspicion that there is/was something flaky about old Ronnie, confirm that suspicion with this booklet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Review of Reagan's Reign of Error","review":"Many books and articles about Ronald Reagan's life and presidency have been remarkably one-sided, focusing only one things that readers would like about him. This book is one of the best in documenting how Reagan deserves much less praise from historians than he has received. It lists the hundreds of things that Ronald Reagan said during his political career which were not true. These are not the \\"gaffes\\" which most politicians make; these are fantasies, sometimes outright lies, many of which he would repeat over and over again even after they had been corrected in public. Reagan was very good at appearing knowledgeable and compassionate on television, but few presidents in our history have had less of those traits than Reagan did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Toy","review":"This is a wonderful toy for an older child.

At the end, he argues that the British possession of the Falkland Islands is just like the British rule over India or Egypt. This falls flat. The Falkands are inhabited by British people who want to be part of Britain. The islands were never part of Argentina. Why does he argue against British imperialism only to argue for Argentine imperialism?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The underrated Walt Weiskopf","review":"This album is just another example of Weiskopf's mastery of the tenor saxaphone. His fresh compositions and very global approach to not only tune names, but more importantly his \\"harmonic bag\\" are extremely striking on this particular album. His intro on \\"Immortal Soul\\" displays his mastery of synthetic scale usage, pentatonics, and sound. Simplicity will ultimately define all of the complexities of life, but take a second and check out Walt Weiskopf because the complex nature of his sound and harmonic and intervallic approach is nothing short of beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good bargain - but be careful, it can be too much food","review":"A good bargain, but to re-iterate the description, this is one liter of fish food.

Gorgeous strings and of course excellent production from his right hand man, Milton Okun. This CD was the begining of his reign as the \\"Far Out\\" cowboy pop star that he became in the mid 70's. Start with this CD then move on to An Evening JD and Windsong. Goodbye Again, is also on this CD and was also a moderate hit. So may inuendo's have been witten about what the lyric's to RMH mean.

Superb performance. Easily 5 stars. Better than Zefferelli's other accomplishment with Migenes and Domingo. Better than the Glyndebourne version. Well balanced in sound, lighting, color, acting and singing. Most DVDs on opera are notoriously dark, especially night scenes. This one is unusually bright, except for Act 3. The color is absolutely fantastic. The audio is better than most opera DVDs. I bought this DVD because of the positive comments of two of the reviewers. I share and appreciate their enthusiasm.Micaela is stunningly beautiful, with a voice to match. How can Don Jose, or any red-blooded Spaniard, not fall for her? Besides, she is mama's choice. But that was before Carmen did her erotic dance. Carmen's seductive facial expression and singing when she wanted something from Mr. Joe is worth the price of the DVD.There are glitches in the reproduction, about a second each. These are easily forgiven."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book was exquisitely poetic and suspenseful.","review":"Kasischke is a remarkable talent. Her book was beautiful simply for the poetry.

One related to the context more clearly perhaps, was that it was a book written by an old-Dilliwallah, about the city, as it was, with the full background of the whys, the hows, the kuchas and the gallis. The book reads like a ruin. I mean you know it was, but can't find it now, entirely. You see it still, but in certain parts. On the surface, it seems non-existent, but it's there. It makes you think on while you assimilate different cultures and experiences, and allow yourselves to be molded into someone new inevitably, do you still look at the ruin and want to go back at times?The tragedy of the ruin is people realize its importance much later. Some live their entire lives not bothering too and are happy.

Combining melodic hard rock with gothic and punk overtones, Love presents The Cult at their creative peak. Featuring soaring vocals by Ian Astbury and wailing guitars by Billy Duffy, Love contains several truly great rock anthems no weak ones. The album would be followed up by the boneheaded southern rock-tinged Electric, and then thankfully by the far-superior Sonic Temple. The best version of Love is the original 1985 printing, as subsequent releases have the sound maxed out and flattened due to rematering. Be sure to seek that one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"the one i can't quit....","review":"I quickly collected all the cult (Southern Death and the Holy Barbarians, also); LOVE is the one I keep going back to. There are few singers who have a voice and inflection that can become a musical instrument. All these albums need to be played loud and on nice equipment to be appreciated. Billy Duffy and James Stewart are phenominal. The drummer for this venture is, in my opinion, one of thier best. I'm not getting up to see who, just trust me, he is all over the place. If you want to get the the merging of the Goth Cult towards the Electric, get this. Then go and get them ALL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Representative of All Mixed Race People in America","review":"If you want a book that contains a large bibliography for later research and study, then this is the book to buy. If not, do not bother.This book does not represent all of us who happened to be mixed in America. In fact, many of the participants used in the various studies throughout the book do not seem to make up a representative sample for all multiracial people. Furthermore, the editor of the book was not even accepted, or respected, by the many multiracial Asian Pacific American students at her own university (ultimately leading to her departure from the Ethnic Studies department at the school).Again, if you like a good bibliography, get this book.

It gives insight as to what the characters were thinking and how they felt about the war, their leaders, and what it was like to enter into battle. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stonewall and General Lee","review":"Jeff Shaara's GODS AND GENERALS is a very fine book. However, as has probably been said at least two hundred times in the reviews, its not at the level of his father's THE KILLER ANGELS. Part of the problem is that Jeff Shaara is limited in his choices on who to develop on the Union side that will bring both continuity and yet freshness to this prequel of THE KILLER ANGELS. Hancock is the obvious choice, but the Chamberlain is a mistake. It feels forced and flat. On the flip side, however, the choice of Jackson is inspired and easily the best storyline in the book.Despite the criticisms, still a very worthwhile book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joe and Generals","review":"I think Gods and Generals is a semi-horrible book. This book has too many different types of settings. It goes from a bright and sunny day, to two feet of snow. This book also switches between the main characters too often. This may be a good idea for showing different points of view, but it also a good way to get someone confused. This book also has no plot twists what so ever,which makes this book very obvious and can get boring. There is one plot twist, and that plot twist is really predictable. If you want to read this book I suggest you make that you are out of firwewood first. This is what i think about the horrible book Gods and Generals."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story ends in a fizzle.","review":"\\"Gods and Generals\\", starts well enough. However, the farther the story goes the more piecemeal it becomes. I liked the book's beginning. The history of the breakup of the army, at the beginning of the war, provides a rich source of storylines. The book follows the lives of four men, when any one of their war experiences is more than enough to make a book. The last part of the book left the four characters underdeveloped. I think a better story could be had by focusing on the relationship between Lee and Jackson. Then the book could have properly ended after the battle at Chancellorsville."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeff sure is not his dad!!!!","review":"I waited with baited breath for this book to come out and when it did I was so disappointed I wanted to scream. My question harkens back to the 80's Wendy's commercial- \\"Where's the Beef?\\" Of Gods and Generals read more like my 8th grade text book than the work that this one is to prequal. The charachter development is not there-I was actually hoping Chamberlain would catch one in the head so I could stop listening to his whining. I was most disappointed with the treatment of Jackson in this pot boiler. Yes, Jackson was a fanatic but Shaara missed the boat in the way the men looked at him and how he preceived himself. Where is the scholarship in this novel. If you are going to write Historical Fiction at least include some History. For Pete's sake at least plagerize some Foote or somebody who knows a little about the Civil War. I will begrudgingly read The Last Full Measure. Jeff I am putting you on notice, do better research or go back to Florida and sell coins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Jeff Shaara made an impression that will last a lifetime in my eyes.

I have never come across another book (save your father's) that has informed, amused, and heartened as much as this one has. There are a lot of people who do not understand the civil war and what it represented to both the North and the South. If they want to understand, all they have to do is read this book and they will glimpse what the views and thoughts were of so many Americans, not just the four men profiled in the book. This book should be on every American History teacher's reading list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Work","review":"I have nothing but praise for Jeff Shaara's addition to Killer Angels. I was moved by his description of the last meeting of Hancock and Armistead. I was also moved by Jackson's reaction to the little child's death. Excellent book. Should be compulsory reading. Every bit as good as his dad's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Storytelling","review":"The style and format of this book permits the reader to get a better picture of the battle scenes than many other Civil War publications. I am not particularly fond of fictionalized history BUT I think the benefits to the reader outweigh my own personal bias. This type of literature and this book in particular are great vehicles to get younger readers interested in a very important period of American History.

The 150th anniversary of the war did not get much attention from mainstream media outlets that I can recall (of course, my powers of recollection are not what they used to be) but this book has provided a unique perspective that such sources would not likely have been able to provide anyway. And judging by the reviews of the film released this past summer, one is better off with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the chip off the old block","review":"Jeff Shaara make a game effort, but his is simply not the storyteller his father was. On it's own, it stands weakly to \\"Killer Angels\\". Realizing full well this book is not history, it is a novel - a story based on historic events great dramatic license must be granted. Unfortunately that allowance greatly stretched credibility in the actions and personality of the characters and particular events. Shaara might been have written on his own of characters of his creation and not under the shade of his father's literary skill. If you are a fan of historical fiction, this might be your book. If you are new to the genre, pass this book and go straight to \\"Killer Angels\\". If you are knowledgeable of the period, this book will greatly disappoint if not irritate you."},{"rating":"1","title":"the book was hard to follow","review":"I didn't like this book, the Killer Angles was a good book but this one was hard to follow because there were too many characters and it kept jumping around between the stories of the different generals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough Shoes To Fill","review":"I found this book to be disappointing.

The author does not have the gift his father had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riding On Coat-Tails With Mistakes And Lazy Research","review":"The reason why this book was written was to make money and ride off of the popularity of his daddy in \\"Killer Angels.\\" Pure and simple. Historical innacuracies from start to finish, incorrect depictions of the main characters, who are historical people, the author set out what he intended to accomplish: push this piece of garbage to the \\"New York Times\\" best-seller list. Does Oliver Stone bring a sense of deja vu? Those who read the \\"Killer Angels\\" but like this book, obviously haven't done their homework."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Definition of Trash","review":"Trash sells and this is the definition of trash. Unfortunately many readers see this as history instead of fiction. Shaara who may have had a ghost writer obviously never visited a manuscipt library to do research. Readers should stick to reading the history of these events done by people who know how to research and how to write."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gods and Generals... good but could have been better","review":"In \\"Gods and Generals\\" Jeff Shaara has quite a time explaining the actions of 4 great Civil war officers, Robert E. Lee, Thomas Jonathan \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, Winfield Scott Hancock, and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. Although the story is loosely based on these characters, Shaara fits many different, interesting, and mostly fictional characters into the book. The book features real civil war battles such as the battle of Fredricksburg and the battle of Chancellorsville.There are many twists and turns in this book and, although not historically accurate at times, it is a great read. I hope that anyone a little interested in this book and the civil war will read this and come up with there own opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son like Father","review":"I read this as a follow on to Killer Angels. Great book, although a prequel to Killer Angels Jeff Shaara captures his fathers ability to feel out these people who we see so two dimensional in history book's, although fiction, the thoughts and views can't be to far off. I felt Lee's struggles, Chamberlains doubts and Jackson's faith as if I was each of them. Gods and Generals is a good first book for Jeff and I am sure his stories will continue to improve. Now I am reading The last full measure and am pleased. Read Gods and Generals, the Civil War was never more alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holding My Breath","review":"The coming movie is directed by the same guy who directed Gettysburg. Gettysburg was the worst Civil War movie I have ever seen. Martin Sheen was totally miscast as Lee.

We shall see."},{"rating":"1","title":"co-opted by the Lee-Jackson mafia","review":"The wretched Jeff Shaara, trying to find out how to make a living and deeply jealous of his father's abilities, went to Lexington Virginia when he started to research his (first) novel. He promptly fell under the spell of the Sons of the Confederacy and was lost forever. Michael Shaara's Killer Angels had plenty of historical inaccuracies, but it was full of profound truths about men at war. Longstreet, Lee, Chamberlain, Buford were real, flesh and blood, minds and hearts. Jeff Shaara writes Ol' South windbag history for wooden puppets. He should be ashamed of himself. He should limit himself to writing novels for the 10-17 boy market, since they seem to be his most enthusiastic fans. Awful book, soon to be an awful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful, awful","review":"I showed up for the premier in my Iron Brigade uniform. There was a guy in a full reb uniform there, too. We begrudgingly acknowledged each other. The movie was awful, long and boooring! I finally walked out of it and met the reb in the lobby. We became friends agreeing how bad this clunker really is. Save your time and money and skip this horrible movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"History Un-told","review":"A wonderful job of misrepresenting the facts and characters involved in some of the Civil War's most pivotal events. Remember when you read this that is is historical FICTION. There is much that is overlooked, misrepresented, embelished or just downright made up. It's a novel, not a history of the Civil War, and that is something that everyone who reads this book needs to remind themselves every time they turn a page. As a novel it is fine, but don't take it for gospel. For the real story head to the non-fiction section"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaara spreads himself too thin","review":"The writing style is annoying. The narrative gaps stick out like ugly roaches. His portrayal of Stonewall Jackson is not even close. Jackson's POV is MIA for 150 pages...where'd he go? I would have preferred an in-depth portrayal of a single battle (hey! just like _Killer Angels_!) instead of covering 2 years of the Civil War with the occasional in-depth portrayal of a battle. After thin descriptions of some battles, like 2nd Manassas, I felt very cheated. After no description of a battle, like 1st Manassas, I was enfuriated. Shaara offers nothing new to Civil War buffs; a lot of re-uttered platitudes from the PBS Civil War series. After I read this book, I said \\"Been there, done that.\\" Read Shelby Foote instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gods and Generals","review":"You think you are there on the battle fields with them.

I thought to myself \\"Hmmm...wonder who wrote it?\\". Then I discovered it was the son of the author who wrote the masterpiece \\"The Killer Angels\\". I bought the book and read it. My opinion? BRILLIANT!!! For a guy who wrote this novel for his first, he did a DAMN good job!!\\"Gods & Generals\\" and \\"The Killer Angels\\" are the perfect pair. If you buy one, get the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for all Civil War buffs.","review":"Gods and Generals was an excellent precursor, chronologically, to The Killer Angels. It was very informative as to the background of a few of the key men who fought in the Civil War. From Lee's own personal struggles with his family to T.J.Jackson's strict adherence to what he believed God wanted from him, Shaara took us into the minds of many a great soldier. There were also numerous tidbits of information on what influenced the outcome of the war. Shaara also provided vivid discriptions of the battle of Fredericksburg and the men's moral at that point in time. In my humble opinion, the only downfalls were a couple trivial factual errors and the lack of battle scenes. Were it not for my reading of Shaara's own father's Civil War masterpiece, I would have given this a 9."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story of four generals' struggles in the civil war.","review":"Gods and Generals, by Jeff Shaara, is a beautifully written prequel to his father'smasterpiece The Killer Angels. Jeff's father, Michael, portrays the personal side of war inhis novel about the battle of Gettysburg. Now his son is taking a stab at it in his novelGods and Generals which tells of the struggles of four generals that play a key role in thecivil war leading up to the battle of Gettysburg. He truly captures the feeling of what itmust have been like to be a general in the civil war and the sadness and sacrifice that itwould have involved. It's an emotional thrill ride that the casual reader and civil war buffalike can enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do not skip this book because of the movie...","review":"I was stunned at how much I enjoyed this book. I had avoided it for years since I was not a big fan of the movie. This book really explains well both the history of the Civil War (troop movements, etc) as well as the personalities of its participants. It is an intimate portrayal of these characters, especially Lee and Jackson. I found it to be quite compelling and I'm looking forward to book three of the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gods and Generals...from Historical facts to fascinating story","review":"God's will be done. This motive, God's will/morality for the four main generals, Robert Lee, Stonewall Jackson, Winfield Hancock, and Joshua Chamberlain, provides without a reasonable doubt how selfless these men truly were and how stalwart they were during that time and age.Shaara goes to the heart and soul of what he believes these men stand for. This Historical event, the Civil War, is colored through background stories and fictional character that Shaara makes up to help the flow of the book. It is this flow that causes GODS AND GENERALS to be so appealing. GODS AND GENERALS is not your wow-this-is-bland history book. Shaara does not just state facts;however, their usage helps him depict what these men might be going through.All in all, this book is well worth reading. Though it may be considered quite long, the book itself seems quite short once you begin reading. Thank you Shaara, for making history fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine novel.","review":"For some reason I've read nothing but war novels this summer; Gods and Generals, The Triumph and the Glory, and Cold Mountain. Gods and Generals is a great Civil War novel, Jeff Shaara has made those epic days come to life in the pages of his wonderful novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely well written!! This is definitely a book to read","review":"This book shows you that Michael Shaara's writing ability is still alive in Jeff. He explains the true reality of war and how it took its toll on those who commanded in it. It shows you how the generals felt about the continual bloody war they fought in. General Lee and General Hancock are the characters you should focus on. Their thoughts on the war are intresting and intriguing. Each chapter ends with you waiting for more. You always want to find out what happens next. This is the second best book I have read after The Killer Angels. Be sure to read the Last Full Measure if you read this one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning prequel to The Killer Angels","review":"Jeff Shaara does a fantastic job in narrating the thoughts and feelings of those key players in the civil war, from First Mannasas to Chancellorsville, providing excellent detail of each battle, and the circumstances around it. Jeff Shaara is surpassed only by his father's The Killer Angels. I recommend this to all people who are interested in the civil war, and also to those who aren't. It provides tremendous background information for the Killer Angels"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is plodding and soporific.","review":"Jeff Shaara slavishly attempted to copy his father's style. He managed to copy the form and not the substance. The prose is lifeless. Jeff needed an editor who would get him to write simple sentences in the active rather than the passive voice. He also needed an editor who would check Jeff's dates. A glaring mistake like Chapter 4 entitled \\"Lee, November\\" describes Lee's encounter with John Brown when Brown had been tried and convicted of murder and treason by October 31st. This book would neither be published nor noticed if Jeff had not been Michael Shaara's son. If Jeff has talent, it was not exhibited in Gods and Generals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Father, Not Like Sun","review":"Filled with awkward prose, and bizarre grammar, Gods and Generals only proves that literary talent may not be genetic. Do yourself a favor and just reread Killer Angels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled: Jeff Shaara is not his father","review":"Don't be fooled (as I was, and as marketeers hope you will be) into thinking that Jeff Shaara carries on the tradition of his father's writing: he doesn't. His writing drags and plods along. He should have left well enough alone. \\"The Killer Angels\\" is a masterpiece, and Jeff Shaara is dragging it out to no good end. He should try to write something of his own, rather than capitalizing on his father's good name. \\"The Killer Angels\\" stands alone and does not need to be dragged out in this manner. Jeff Shaara adds nothing to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"too military-oriented","review":"Althought this book was very well-written and the research appears to be incredible, I felt it did not provide a well-rounded prespective of the Mexican-American War. All of the views presented are from military leaders. I was hoping Shaara would include at least a couple chapters told from the stance of someone involved in the political and/or economic aspects of the war; or perhaps from some of the more \\"common\\" people who are affected by war. Since this is technically a work of fiction, it seems he could have easily done this without disrupting the sequence of military events in the war. In \\"rise to rebellion\\" Shaara told the story from several differing points of view. Here the characters are not very divergent from one another and so I felt like I was getting a one-sided view of the entire conflict. Read only if you are interested in MILITARY fiction, not necessarily historical fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs Down for the Abridged Audio Version","review":"I read \\"Gods and Generals\\" about two years ago and liked it pretty well. I bought the abridged audio version recently, but don't like it at all. The abridgment is pretty severe (there are only four cassettes). It's read by Stephen Lang, who, I'm sure, is a fine actor (he played Pickett in \\"Gettysburg,\\" I believe) but who doesn't do the different voices very well. Everyone is a bass or a baritone, and they all sound like they're trying very hard to stifle English accents. I understand that Lang is to play Stonewall Jackson in the film version of \\"Gods and Generals\\"; I hope he gets his mountain accent up to snuff, 'cause his Jackson on this tape don't talk like no mountain boy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lacking in details and intimancies","review":"i'll be the first to admit that i'm biased based on my expectations from shaara's father's great book, the killer angels. it is not fair to compare the two, but because reading the father's book lead me to buy this one, i thought i should mention it. this book does not contain nearly the details and intimancies of the father's book. it is not surprising since this one covers a much longer time frame than the battle of gettysburg, so shaara has less pages to devote to each person and battle. but the result is a less satisfying book. it skims rather than digs deep."},{"rating":"1","title":"riki tiki tavi did this","review":"This book [was weak].

Lee, Thomas Jonathan \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, Winfield Scott Hancock and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. Shaara closely follows the history of the Civil War, but from much research reading diaries and other documents he assumes the dialogue of the generals and other men and women and this part of his writing is fiction. He does a masterful job and you feel like the dialogue is what really took place. It is though he recorded the conversations. His accounts of the battles of Williamsburg, Antietam, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville pick up the feeling of how it really was. You feel like you are there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well written book","review":"The books Gods and Generals is a well written book and nice to read. It is interesting written and tells a lot about the American Civil War. The only weakness of the book is that it switches between the charackerst Lee, Jackson, Hancock, and Chamberlain. This is very interesting but often occurs at the wrong times. Means that at some points of the book it is possible to get annoyed. Overall it is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gods and Generals","review":"Gods and Generals by, Jeff Shaara is a very descriptive timeline of the Civil War, up to the Battle of Gettysburg. It is a very explanitory book, you understand what is going on because of the description. Shaara really brings to life the dilemma of serving your country or your home state, and the shortages of fighting the war. Shaara also goes into depth the personality the characters, he brings them to life and draws you into the past. This book is very informative and I would recommend it to anybody who enjoys history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Review","review":"Gods and Generals is like no other. This book describes four characters in the Civil War. Chamberlain, Lee, Jackson and Hancock all are portrayed perfectly in this novel. A great thing about this novel is it is not just a story, but a biography like story that tells what each of these four men went through during the war. The characters are all so well described and are so well thought up that it makes you wonder if Shaara lived during the time of the Civil War. He tells of some major battles, and it is so historically accurate. If you are interested in reading a good novel about the civil war, Gods and Gnerals is the book of choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for a book with educational value- Brooke M.","review":"Gods and Generals by Jeff Shaara was one of the better historically-based novels I have read. It had the typical blood and gore battle content, which was intriguing, but it also gave you a feel of the men in the war as humans, not just killing machines. It showed how even the most brutal of generals was hurt by problems within their families. I also thought that it was interesting when they portrayed the real emotions of the men fighting in the fields. I learned a ton about strategies of war and about Civil War generals and the military. The novel switched to a different person every chapter so it never really got too boring. The only part that lost me were when they discussed a battle plan in great depth or used military terms to describe stuff. Gods and Generals is definitely a good choice if you're required to read a novel on the Civil War."},{"rating":"2","title":"No sex","review":"I enjoyed reading about the big people of the ciivl war. I missed the blow by blow of the battles but mebe that is too difficult to detail in print. The sketches of battle lines were very small and impossible to read.

It is refreshing to read an account with out all the superfluous BIG SEVEN curse words that modern writers think is necessary.

It was recommended by a history teacher. I enjoyed it so much that I ordered Jeff's two novels that complement, one of them being Gods and Generals. The trilogy is really well written. They are not meant to be 100% non-fiction but instead have historical events and people intermingled with fictional thoughts which allow the reader to get to know (and in most cases, like) the historical characters very well. I would read Gods and Generals followed by Killer Angels and then Jeff's last novel, Last Full Measure. It gives the reader a chronological order to the events and characters. Hope you enjoy the books as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gods and Generals continues the tradition of Shaara Magic","review":"Gods and Generals is a fantastic addition to the world of Civil War fiction. Shaara's style, while different from his father's, is powerful in character development as well description of battle scenes.

A very powerful book that should be read by anyone that read Killer Angels."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you live history, then you must read God's and Generals","review":"God's and Generals is a must read. Not only is it based on a very popular issue, the Civil War, but it is readable, informative and riviting.

I finished the piece very quickly and bought it's \\"sequels\\" Killer Angels and The Last Full Measure.

I thoroughly enjoyed Killer Angels for its approach, it's very well written prose, and its conciseness. I was sure that Jeff Shaara would have some difficulty following in this style. What I found was worse. It is a very difficult book to begin reading, and after several chapters I put it down for good. I found the writing style virtually unreadable and found myself re-reading lines to see if I was missing something. I always finish books...but this is one exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Killer Angels is good....","review":"Killer Angels is a great book. Gods and Generals...well, again Killer Angels is a great book! Gods and Generals is the most boring Civil War book I have read out of thousands! The battles are there, somewhere, but the description we are waiting for is dry. The generals do participate in the battles, but its nothing noteworthy. The descriptions are not the author's strong suit. I guess I will give the author one last chance with Last Full Measure, but as for his newest Gone For Soldiers about the Mexican War, no thank you! The family name is being driven into the ground depeer and deeper, I see. BOTTOM LINE ON GODS AND GENERALS: SKIP THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book, Looking forward to the movie","review":"Gods and Generals is a good but not perfect book (what book is?). I agree that the battle descriptions could have been longer. I wish the author would have depicted Stonewall Jackson at First Bull Run and showed him in the Shenandoah Valley Campaign of 1862. I was so interested in the depiction of Sandie Pendleton, Jackson's Aide, I had to pick up a book entitled \\"Stonewall's Man\\" by W.G. Bean a full and excellent biography. While looking through some of the lower ratings of \\"Gods and Generals\\" I did find mistakes in their reviews. Someone says that it would be far-fetched for Lee to capture John Brown at Harpers Ferry but that is exactly what happened, read the historical record. And another person says that the reaction of Jackson at the execution of John Brown is inaccurate. Please read Burke Davis' \\"They Called Him Stonewall\\" and you will find out that the reaction of Jackson in the book is historically accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eating the Civil War \\"elephant\\"","review":"I was addicted to Civil War (er, \\"The War of Northern Aggresion\\") stories as a boy. With the 100th anniversary of the war in 1960-1965 occuring duing my 5-10 age period, the whole thing was an outstanding fantasy. As I've gotten older, I've longed for a way to get back into Civil War (uh, \\"The War for Southern Independence\\") stories. Most of the stuff written for adults, though, makes it tough to get started. Books quickly veer from sensory immersion to left-brain statistical abstraction. This book has really acted like the first forkful of Civil War (I mean \\"The War Between the States\\") history and I'm ready to \\"eat the elephant\\" and take the plunge again. I've got \\"Killer Angels\\" on the bedstand -- I can't wait to see how his father writes. This book is competently written and very engrossing. Bruce Catton, Shelby Foote -- set the table!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I am amazed that there are so few recordings of French harpsichord music from the last generations of French clavecinistes. Perhaps the music is too light for those who love French harpsichord music. This stuff is definitely not Couperin.\\"Le Combat Naval\\" is a narrated piece which effectively paints a musical picture of a naval battle. It is one of my favorite works. Les Giboulees de Mars is a depiction of a type of wind.

'Show me your Colours' is very different. 'Have You Ever' is cute. However the catchy songis 'Do it till we drop'. Rachel needs a clap for keeping up with the tempo.

But because of his radical ideas, he was never given the opportunity. He became a scholar who taught his pupils to think. Many years after his death, his ideas were written down and have survived for thousands of years. Tidbits of Confucius's wisdom have even made their way into American fortune cookies. Because little is known of the fifth century B.C. scholar, Freedman makes an effort to establish what information is believed to be fact and what is more likely legend.The book's beautiful antiquated illustrations complement the text. They are as mysterious as the life of Confucius. I especially like the little details in this book: the quotes from the Analects on the endpapers, the author's note detailing his observations of the celebration in China held for Confucius each year, and the annotated bibliography."},{"rating":"1","title":"More unanswered questions than answers","review":"It seems as though Hosty&Son decided to cash in on the cottage industry that has become the JFK assassination.

Hosty deals with the assasination as he perceived it (and it was he who investigated Oswald).

However, I still stubbornly choose to believe in the conspiracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Hosty has no credibility","review":"FBI agent James Hosty is the guy who destroyed critically important assassination evidence -- a written note left by Oswald at the Dallas office of the FBI, two weeks before the assassination.

Good power for small to medium size rooms Excellent for the Home. Some people may think this is over kill for a home unit but I disagree. Because you have the extra power you can actually play at acoustic piano and drum kit levels with out pushing or working the amp too hard, and you still get a beautiful clear sound.You can also hook up your CD player or MP3 to it for the drummers or singers who like singing to a track. For what it does it is pretty compact and light weight.You can pay a guitar through it electric or acoustic/electric but don't expect too much even when you put your pedals thru it.

Sold the amp for half of what I paid for it and felt guilty about taking the money. It's a very well made product with a good variety of inputs and controls.

I have pretty wide feet so a lot of classic looking shoes are too narrow for me, but not these. They are very comfortable when it comes to width. I got a size 12 and these feel a lil to big (length). Maybe like a 12.5, but it's not too big of a deal as I'm not running in these at all, they're just casual shoes. I like that they're leather all over versus most 81s that are mesh on top. But overall these are great looking and feeling shoes. I actually came here today to buy another pair but they're out of my size unfortunately. So if they have your size I recommend getting two pairs!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be ready for it to break","review":"Within two months of purchasing it, the plastic gears attached to the blade were significantly worn.

It can't even handle making a simple fruit smoothie and leaves big chunks of banana and other fruit. The only good thing about it is its size, but I have since bought a Cuisinart Blender and find its function superior. Also, a handheld Braun mixer wand for $20 is far better for making smoothies, pureeing foods, etc. Maybe the Magic Bullet is good for whip cream, gooey alfredo sauce and other smooth things they show in t.v., but alot of us don't eat heavy junk like that on a daily basis and I find it to be completely lacking in the daily things I need a blender for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic Bullet Express works","review":"I really enjoy my Magic Bullet Express , I bought it mainly to fix drinks, smooth out lumpy sauces and so on.

But that's not the case.The juicer was pretty bad. I never got a full glass of juice from the thing, and it's a really hard to clean. I tried using it several times, but eventually just gave up. It now lives in my garage.The blender/chopper is ok. Usually, I find that it's TOO powerful. Everything basically turns to liquidy mush. And the machine chops unevenly, so the stuff on top is chunky while the stuff on the bottom is mushy.But all that doesn't even matter because since the rubber thing broke, I can't blend/mush liquids, or it'll leak. These days, I use the machine primarily to grind my coffee beans every morning, and it does a good job at that.

PLAIN AND SIMPLE. The idea of the blending and chopping all those foods is an excellent idea. However use a blender or Jack La Lanne's power juicer. I feel stupid buying this dum thing. Common sense - If you want to blend fruit, veggies or whatever a larger blender has a large motor and is much more powerful. If you want to chop hard items well look at the previous sentence. The Jack La Lanne's power juicer is best if you want to separate the pulp from the juice. Much more juice comes out of this power juicer, even a non Jack La Lanne's power juicer does better then this piece of junk. The person inventing this had an excellent idea in easy cook and health making in just blending and chopping everything together. I came up with that myself. It is amazing to resolve all that chewing and chopping.

You will spend all of your time opening and repositioning the items to get them blended.Also the rubber gear on the bottom continues to become engaged and disengaged by the pressing motion and grinds the rubber down so you have disintergrated rubber flakes to clean up when you are done, not to mention the burnt rubber smell in your kitchen.Do not buy this thing it is a total foist on consumers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic Bullet; Very little to complain about","review":"I love this thing...it makes everything from a single serving drink to a puree/paste for gourmet cooking.I only have one complaint about it.

I have to blame this on the blade more than anything else. It seems very inconsistent.Tried chopping some onions - used pulse and tap and everything else - ending up with half pureed onions and half unchopped onions after 5 minutes of tapping, pulsing, etc etc.Biggest problem I have - doesn't perform as in the commercial. Definite trickery going on there.

We tried carrots and beets but even cutting them up small did not allow the machine to compeletely juice them. Also, it does not pull all the juice out of the pulp, which means much of the juice is in the pulp you are going to through away. So, I'd suggest throwing away the juicer part. However, when we used the blender to make mix 16 eggs for omelets it took only a few seconds. For a breakfast drink with protein powder and a banana, it mixed the powder quickly. The banana took a lot longer, however, I'm not sure it took much longer than my immersion blender did. I like the small size of the machine which really doesn't take up any more room than my immersion blender.

The Magic Bullet chops nuts, blends pancake mix, blends dressings, ...it does it all! I love it! Yes, if you leave the blender going and walk away you will smell the motor overheating. You don't need to blend that long.

I will honestly say that it does work very well....AT FIRST. You'll love it, then be disappointed when it breaks. Before 1 year was up the motor died and it stopped working. This also happened to three of my friends who bought the magic bullet. The customer service stinks and they won't replace it. In my opinion, $60 for 1 year of use is not worth it.

If youre looking to dice though,,,,dont count on this machine helping you out. It either whips or blends I dont care how many times your suppose to push down on it.

I now must add it to the landfill. The gear in the center of the base is made out of cheap plastic and the threads that hold it on have stripped out and the gear busted into 3 pieces. (And I have not used it with anything like the frequency they tout in their infomercials.) After contacting the company, I was informed that they will not sell me this piece or repair my base. What a waste - I won't be purchasing from them again. Instead I'll be investing in a better piece of equipment.Also the juicer attachment is worthless - maybe you can use it for citrus, but who needs a juicer for citrus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic Bullet","review":"Product works well for its intended use as a small scale blender - excellent for an individual or couple.

My mother-in-law actually bought this for us and I thought \\"Great, another gadget to deal with.\\" My kids bugged me to make shakes with it, so I got it all out and tried it. It worked great. We have had so much fun coming up with shakes and smoothies. They need more liquid than the recipe book calls for. I was having trouble getting things to chop or mix completely until I started adding about twice as much liquid as the recipes call for. The chicken salad is really yummy.The Magic Bullet is also really easy to clean. I never owned a blender because I didn't want to deal with cleaning it. Overall, it is probably a little underpowered, but the smaller size and ease of cleaning make up for that. I think I might buy one for my mom...."},{"rating":"1","title":"motor gave out","review":"this product was great for a little while. After about a year, the motor gave out and stopped working.

I tried it for making mousse and thought it was the greatest thing I had ever seen. Then I used it to chop onion - only problem is that the onion turned into gooey liquid, even using the tap method.

The idea is fantastic, but the product is lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic Bullet hits the mark!","review":"We purchased the Magic Bullet for a very specific task ...to mix nutritional supplements into healthy juices and smoothies; and for this task it's performed perfectly. Some of the supplements in our health regime don't mix easily but the Magic Bullet works great. Our household of four gets it's start in the morning with with individualized servings of blended drinks. Because the Magic Bullet allows the beverage to be blended in the mug used for drinking, it enables us to get our day started quickly and with ease. Clean up is also quick and easy. We've used other quality blenders of the 40+ ounce variety, but this is the first blender we've used that allows us to do a very quick blended smoothie/icee/drink in a 16 oz. mug. We use our Magic Bullet at least 10 times a day and I can't imagine getting along without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is great","review":"I love this item and use it nearly every day. I must admit that like most products it doesn't work exactly like the previews and video's but you find your own way to do it the way you want. It not only saves a ton of time but it makes things that also saves you money. I recommend anything that you use with tomatoes you actually blend those separately to get the right consistancy and then add it to the other ingredients. I also recommend anything that calls for cheese (i.e. Omelet) that you use shredded cheese and add later unless it's something like a cheese dip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bite the Bullet","review":"That's what I had to do - Bite the Bullet after I Bought the Bullet. I spent $150 on this infomercial piece of junk. It was difficult to use. The first time I used it, it started smoking. After about two more uses, the motor decided to stay running - it would only stay off if it was unplugged. Additionally, the cups would not come off the bullet without much force and meanwhile it leaked everywhere. Now that I want a refund - I am shorted $50 in shipping fees to send everything back! What a waste of money. I'll tell everyone I know about the inconvenience and hope they don't Bite the Bullet."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISSAPPOINTED!!!!!","review":"I tried this product and was totally dissappointed!

This is the part that actually drives the blender \\"thingy\\" broke after a while. So the whole thing is pretty much useless. There is no replacement for it. So now I don't know what to do with all that plastic cup and containers that came with it..if the motor base itself does not work. REMEMBER: There are no spare parts that are sold seperately.This is certainly a good idea, unfortunately it is not very well made to last. For instance, the bearings holding the blades go bad after a few uses and they wobble making irratic contacts with the driver shaft of the motor. I think this causes everything to break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea Terrible Experience","review":"The idea behind the Bullet is a great idea - small, easy to use and clean, includes \\"to go\\" cups with lids for finished product for traveling. However, my experience with using it was awful. If I didn't tighten the blade base to the cup really well (to the point of almost stripping the screw-in ridges), it would leak because if I didn't hold it just right to pulse, it locks; when trying to unlock, I invariably would loosen the blade base and juice would start leaking out. Eventually after only about a year's use (and not much at that), pulsing would not work well, and the motor would keep running past lifting my hand, or not pulse at all until it locks and eventually started stripping pieces of plastic off of the bottom of the cup that connects to the motor. In my book this gadget is a waste of $60. Don't be fooled by all those great commercials about it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Magic Bullet! Should have read Reviews 1st","review":"Seems to be about 50/50 that like or hate this product. Had I read the reviews first, I would not have purchased the product. First it is very cheaply made. The plastic and the metal parts are so cheap they look like they won't last a month. It certainly does not work like in the infomercial.They tell you in the manual that it takes some time to master the \\"technique\\". I am still trying after a week and it just pluses everything into mush. Although I have not given up, I am mostly using it to make shakes and things, although I have pulled my old blender out of the closet and it works much better. The recipes also call for you to put much more into the containers then will fit. Even the large one is very small. And so far everything I have tried to Microwave leaks out and makes a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"crappy quality, does not work as promised","review":"I bought this after seeing it countless times on TV. We have two small children and my wife thought it would be easier to use than a larger food processor.After about two weeks the plastic o-ring broke, as many others have stated as well. Have not called in yet, but they are apparently about $10 for 4.It is also not very useful for chopping. All the stuff has to be pre-cut to even fit into the small cups or you use cocktail tomatoes and pearl onions, like they do on the show. This should have been a hint.Try to put a couple quarter onions in the cup and chop it and it will be very inconsistent with the stuff in the bottom being a mush and the larger pieces stick to the top and sides.I bought a small food processor (Black & Decker) at Wal-Mart for less than $15 and it works much better for chopping onions and veggies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made, breaks, poor customer service from Homeland Housewares","review":"Not worth the money, works for a short time then the cheap plastic gears break.

I bought this when they had the two for one deal and I have the other unit and it's accessories to my parents, they too had the same results with the Magic Bullet. The only thing I made with seccess with this unit was a milkshake, everything else advertised failed, and from what I can see on here it was truly false advertising, this garbage should be labeled a failed product and recalled.

One as a gift, the other for our use. Ours broke quickly. For starters, the seals pulled out of the blender base.

But, tonight, just as it has done to many other users, the base unit stripped the blade unit's turning mechanism. I looked at the bottom of my other blade, and it is showing signs of stripping as well, and it is only a short matter of time before it goes too. I am returning the Magic Bullet to the store to take my chances with something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"The product is not as advertised.","review":"The magic bullet has a lot of functional flaws. Well, first of all, when I called to buy the product, customer service tried to push a whole lot more expensive \\"additional\\" parts on me. For juice, this thing is pretty useless. You MIGHT be able to make juice from it's blender/filter combination. Juicing only works on very soft fruits (orange, canned pinapple). I tried make carrot apple juice and it all when to the garbage.

Definitely does not chop ice, so why it comes with drink mugs for frozen drinks is beyond me.

This bullet doesn't do what they advertise. The pulse 3 tap method for chopping onions is all lies. This machine will puree anything you put in it. It doesn't chop when it's supposed to. Perhaps the small cups to make smoothies are the only thing worthwhile here.Next time you watch the commercial, pay attention to when the lady is making alfredo sauce.

All it does it liquify everything. I've found the only thing it actually does very well is make smoothies. But don't count on crushing too much ice in it! It can only handle about 2 cubes at a time. It comes with a recipe book (also useless). I tried to make the salsa in it and in the end it had turned into spicy tomato puree. Yuck. At least it's pretty easy to clean and the cups are the perfect size for my breakfast smoothies. If that's all you're looking for it to do, then the Magic Bullet is perfect for you. Overall though, I'd say this thing is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I got my not-so-magic bullet on another web site.

There is a plastic gear on the top of the base unit that transfers power from the motor unit to the cutting blades. It can and does shatter into pieces. Customer service can not or will not offer a replacement gear and instead they offer to sell you a new base unit for $30.00 plus $10.00 Shipping. This unit is over priced, breaks easily, and emits a burning smell if you run it continuously for over 30 seconds. Just to let you know, this unit was adult operated and not abused.

I received the large blender (aka juicer) with my machine and I have used that inplace of the smaller cup for larger amounts of ingredients. Can't say I like the juicer for juicing. Didn't work well at all.For better mixing, stop and shake between pulsing.Bottom line is if it broke on me, I would buy it again. Just wish I could master the dicing technique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"We burned through 2 Magic Bullets in a fairly short amount of time. Now I'm left with all the cups, blender attachment, juicer attachment, etc. After learning that most blenders work with either a standard or wide mouth mason jar depending upon brand, why not just buy a case of mason jars at your local grocer or retailer and attach that to your blender? If you want mugs Ball makes Mason Mugs, they're only $8-10 a dozen. You can even try your Mayo jar! All you do is fill the mason jar with ingredients, attach the bottom of the blender to the mason jar, and set it on your blender base and turn it on. Basically the Magic Bullet is a blade, a motor, and a small jar. You can get that in a blender for less money. The juicer function is worthless, and it doesn't come with this set anyway. I could have saved myself a ton of money if I had just purchased the mason jars. Lesson learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do _NOT_ put ice cubes in it!","review":"I bought one of these for my girlfriend a couple weeks ago.

She made just one drink with it, the second time she used it she threw some (3) ice cubes in and it was instantly toast.We spent ~$70 (with shipping) and got one use out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Two, there are no replacement parts!","review":"I've had my Bullet for about a year and a half--just long enough to be out of warranty. As a Blender it's great. As a chopper/food processor it has issues. If I want chunky chicken salad, I use something else. With light use, (no one but me using it maybe twice a month) the plastic gear that runs in the base--and turns all the blades broke in two. It's a cheaply made, small piece that should be easily replaceable for under $10.00. I just got off of the phone with Customer Service and there are no replacement parts. You can buy a whole new base--for $40.00 plus shipping and taxes if you are out of warranty. Bottom line is that the Magic Bullet's \\"magic\\" is a design flaw that will break and you get to buy a new one every year or so--unless you are one of those lucky people who got a 4 yr warranty by purchasing two."},{"rating":"1","title":"careful not to eat plastic","review":"the plastic ring that is supposed to prevent leaking sometimes comes loose and becomes ground up in your product.

Although I haven't experimented alot with it, I have made smoothies for the kids basically with it. I tried chopping onions as they promise in the infomercials, but was unsuccessful - seems like it liquifies it instead of chops. But for a quick smoothie or frozen margarita, it is wonderful! I love the color coded lids, everyone can have their own cups, even if I am not using the blender, just using the cups for juice.The blade tops are not really dishwasher safe, i recommend hand washing. If you stick them in the dishwasher with the seal still inside, it will crack and break on you.

Plus the blades are still silver, not corroded/red as some other reviewer suggested.At first I used the Bullet everyday; making chicken salad, personal soups, and smoothies. Then I set it aside and only used it on occasion. Within the past year or so, I got back into a health kick and I use my Magic Bullet on a daily basis again -- sometimes two or three times a day. I think this is the best blender for personal-sized shakes and small dishes!It's annoying that replacement gaskets or blades aren't sold through the site though. I lost the cross blade and my last gasket burned out about 3 months ago. But thanks to Amazon, I found another company that sells replacement parts. Overall, I am very pleased with the Magic Bullet and completely recommend this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap junk","review":"Do not waste your money.

It is the piece they make out of plastic so when it breaks you buy another unit. I have had two Magic Bullets and in both cases this piece broke.

I will go back to a blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect it to last very long","review":"I bought the Magic Bullet and used it for two years for mostly making smoothies. I loved that you could make a smoothie and then drink it from the same cup, cleans easily in the dishwasher and very convenient. However, if you like making guacamole, hummus, or dips of that sort, it doesn't blend well and its a pain to constantly have to use the spatula to mix it around and then blend it again. The motor burned out after two years of sporadic use. So don't get too excited about this!

Then (suddenly?) the drive gear on the motor base wore away. You'd think the little rubber nubbies on the bottom of the cutter assembly would wear, and they probably did, but the hard plastic vanes of the driver piece just shredded.Could this have been because of mis-use, like maybe not pushing down hard enough to assure full engagement of the nubbies in the vanes? I don't know; I'm not going to tell my wife and daughter that they didn't know how to operate a simple hand blender. This thing has to live in the real world.Now the thing is junk. I'll start looking for repair parts, but it sounds like I'm out of luck. I wouldn't recommend the Magic Bullet, until they change their material choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only grind grains and beans with it!","review":"Well, when we first purchased this, we tried to send it back. It didn't do anything that even the commercials SHOWED it doing! You have to take the cup part out of the base and shake it to redistribute the contents. I can't even puree baked vegetables in it very well! HOWEVER, it does a fantastic job powdering grains and beans for my son's super porridge. BUT--NOT in large quantities! You have to use the little cup. It won't puree baby food very well, doesn't puree ripe fruit, won't chop anything (it just puree's what's near the blade and doesn't pull food down from the top of the cup so it remains whole), and you have to add a LOT of water to get it to make smoothies or, well, anything else for the matter. NOT worth your money unless you are specifically making super porridge (it DOES NOT grind coffee beans very well because of the oil--JUST DRY GRAINS AND BEANS)."},{"rating":"1","title":"pulverizes onions","review":"I tried to chop onions with it (seemed simple enough).

I even scooped out some of it. More of a hassle than help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic Bullet #3","review":"We've purchased three of these magic bullets, one as a gift to our daughter. Aside from its convenience, what my wife loves is its ease of cleaning. We threw away our coffee bean grinder and now use the magic bullet instead. The first two we bought were with the weaker motor so, according to the manufacturer's directions, we are careful to run it only in 30 sec. bursts. For our purposes that's fine. It also makes a quick and convenient margarita mixer for individual portions. We haven't begun to take advantage of what seem to be endless uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel like an infomercial idiot!","review":"I had to get this after seeing the infomercial. When I received it and read the book I realised that this does nothing more than any other blender. And in order to \\"follow the recipes\\" you are starting with a lot of premixed and premade ingredients-that's what makes it quicker. It crushes ice very poorly and only in very small amounts. I'm guessing they used pre crushed ice on the infomercial too. Not worth the $39 I paid for it and definitely not worth the $59 that it's being sold for in stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good system for single servings","review":"So I blend on a regular basis and until buying this used a full sized blender for my single serving shakes. It worked but it was difficult to clean as part of it needed to be taken completely apart. The magic bullet on the other hand is very easy to use and clean. Shakes are a good even consistency even when I throw in chunks of ice or large pieces of frozen fruit. It also doubles as a way to carry a shake to work or the gym with the set of lids they include. A lot of the negative reviews say this thing is prone to breaking but I have had no issues thus far, with the exception of needing to glue one of the little rubber feet on the bottom back in place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect little machine!","review":"I absolutely love this little machine! My mom's friend has had it for about a year now and she uses it daily for just about everything. For christmas, my mother bought me one as well and I've been using it daily since. I've tried nearly every recipe in the book that comes with it and more, and have had no problems.The motor turns VERY quickly, easily chops ice, etc as mentioned in the TV ad. I'm also very picky about what I eat and I love how the recipes they give you taste. If you don't like them, make your own recipe (it's not that hard).I absolutely hate any type of big cleanups, which is why I love my Magic Bullet so much. Prep and cleanup are so easy! There isnt anything bulky to try and clean up. Just the blades and any canisters and knives you use. You might need to wipe the base unit and countertop if you're as messy of a cook as I am. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bullet Express Review","review":"Do Not Waste Your Money...

If it had not been a gift from my daughter I would have thrown it away since other parts are made of the same cheap plastic and I do not want to spend $35.00 every time.

Here I am on Amazon (thankfully) to purchase a replacement part for it! Lucky for me, they sell it!! The rubber on the underside of the blade (to make the blades move with the gear) has worn off. So, can't use it! I've never had to use any of the spare gaskets that it came with. A few of the tabs have broken off the cups that make the unit turn on.

It is pretty good for making small shakes and batters for things such as pancakes, also useful for scrambling eggs. But that's about all its good for. Honestly, a regular blender will do the same thing, and give you more room to make larger amounts.The components are cheaply made. I used mine pretty much every day (only mixing liquids though) and it didn't hold up to the use. The gear that drives the blades, actually shattered during use. Never had that happen with a regular blender. I thought about purchasing another, and then thought better of it. I'll just get a regular blander and be happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks and unscrews easily","review":"I just bought mine, it has a date of manufacture of July 2006. I bought this to mix up some drinks, like a protein shake. My first attempt the thing unscrewed itself and the mix got over part of it. This is a big problem... The unit is not UL approved (or any safety agency) and a greater of shock hazard could exist. When this starts to unscrew itself you cannot get it out of the base when it is latched in for continuous use. I had to pull the plug from the receptacle, fun when your hands are wet from this unscrewing. The second time I figured I'd make sure it was tight, so I gave it some extra muscle. As I went to insert it into the base, it began to leak through the threads. I had to put a lot into tightening it before it would stop leaking. Could a larger gasket help? Maybe! I think this product is a good cocept, but sadly implemented.

My first one was from QVC's Cooks Essentials & Magic Bullet is my second. My original problem was the the very small plastic tabs that provide the pressure to activate the blending would break off. Then you can't blend. What I discovered was that the dishwasher weakens the plastic & they would break off. Since we have been hand washing the cups that were not put in the dishwasher - they have not broken. Also, if you have a leak you have to wipeout the blender well or the little levers on the blender that are pushed down by the little tabs on the cups can get sort of stick & stuck in place & that will also snap off the little plastic tabs on the cups. We use our blender often- mainly for making smoothies and salad dressings. They don't work well for chopping- but anything with enough liquid blends very well. Overall we are very pleased & would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real great for making juice!","review":"I really like this product when I'm making my own drink.I would recommend the magic bullet if you're making individual drinks. It's real easy to use, just put the fruits or any other ingredients you want in there and close with the blade, lock it, push down and it's ready to go. It's also really easy and fast to clean.The only down side is that, if you fill it to a certain point(where it might be too full), it'll overflow and comes out when you're blending it.It's a little too pricey for me, but that's just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"I purchased last year for christmas. It stopped working in late November.I wasn't able to contact them until after the holidays on December 26th.

CUSTOMER SERVICE TERRIBLE. THEY DO NOT BACK THIS PRODUCT"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this product!","review":"Great transaction! Fast Shipment. Product arrived new in the box as described. Love the Magic Bullet. It does so many wonderful things, so quickly and easily.

I try to use it but it does not chop anything and I am forever having to remove big chunks out of it.

Unfortunately, I was recently pureeing some very well-done caulifleur into soup, carefully as instructed, and after about 10 seconds of grinding (during which time it had done the job very well, it developed a high piched squeal and stopped.

They are great out of the starting gate...best \\"blender, chopper, etc\\" I have ever experienced. But it wasn't built to last!! We follow directions, love everything it makes, love the way it looks on the counter even. But it dies quickly and the company S**Ks at replacing or helping out.

NEVER in the commercial to you see the host either scooping out chunks, disloging the blade, and not once did he have to stop and tap the ingredients(as you have to do every 5 seconds in reality)I waited a looong time to order one of these things and finally the 2 for 1 deal talked me into it(only to pushed by a salesman trying to sell additional merch) and to top it off I was hit w/ a 40 dollar shipping fee for 2 blenders.

The second time I used it (and I was following directions), the blade got stuck on the \\"locked-on\\" position (easier to do than you might think and the manual warns you against!) and the gasket became wrapped around the blade and chewed up the plastic.

If anyone out there has mastered this or salsa, please email me.perhaps I was doing something wtong.Grated cheese- worked ok, but the cheese got stuck to the cup.Smoothies did pretty well, when the blad didn't strip into the ice in the bottom.It is GREAT for whipping cream. Can't say enohg good things about that.I haven't done much more with it, but now that I read all these great reviews I'll get my book out and use it some more.

I tried one of the party drinks listed, a bullet to the head, the bottom of the blade stripped as it could not even chop ice. The Magic bullet broke after 2 uses. I would say your better off buying a good blender. I strongly advise not to buy this product. Buyer beware. We are going to try and send back to get our money back.

I didn't expect it to work, but it does! It has a lot of power for such a small machine. It chops, blends, and the screw on lids & mixing cups are surprisingly useful.

It's true that if you run it for more than 10-15 seconds at a time, it might start running hot, but that's more than enough time for my purposes.

I make the smoothies in the cup I'll be drinking out of and then only have to rinse off the blade under water that's it, no mess, no other cleanup.I'm planning on making salsa with this as well. The only think I'll complain about is it's ability to crush ice, my icecube tray makes giant ice cubes and the magic bullet doesn't fully crushed them as well as I would like but I think it's more about the size of the ice than anything else, I plan on getting a smaller ice cube try. But making smoothies with frozen fruit has allowed me to skip the ice all together!

I am a protein shake drinker and was having to mix my drinks by hand (a large blender didn't seem to suit my needs for one drink in the mornings). I have used this blender only for smoothies and shakes so far, but I do have to say it is a great product. It honestly takes 3 pulses to blend my shakes in the mornings and the thing I like about this product is the individual size cups that screw directly into the unit.I have not used this product for dicing, chopping, etc. so I cannot comment on that. I usually do all that by hand and have never used an appliance to do that kind of work.The instruction manual does point out NUMEROUS times not to run the appliance for over a minute as it may burn out the motor. Therefore, I rarely use it in the lock mode and only use the pulse option.I am pleased so far and think if you are looking for a blender for drinks, shakes, smoothies, this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"wheel on base broke","review":"Initially loved it.

Well, it worked just like the $29 walmart one. The power motor just does not have the power and speed to really grind through ice or frozen fruit. It will eventually get the job done but blending time is in the minutes. This one will be returned as well and I will stick to my good ol' blender that will have a finished smooth-e in less than 30 seconds.

The next morning i went to make a coffee mocha, I mixed all the stuff in tall cup, useing the cross blade i put it on the blender, the drink leaked throught the base into the bullet out of the bottom of the base onto my counter top,I checked the o ring and it was sealed, now i know they call it the magic bullet.We have tryed the seven second salsa, by the time you tryed to get the onions and cherry tomatoes choped it came out like mush, but that was my fault, they make it look so easy on tv.

I picked up on impulse at costco and knew I was risking disappointment...wrong!I've had it a two weeks and used it more than I ever used my blender, mixer and food processor combined.When you are juggling four dishes in one meal and trying to get it all on the table at one time the most obvious plus is the multiple cups. Rinse off the blade and away you go. Once I used it five different ways in one dinner.It is certainly way cooler than my big old blender. Don't hate it because the infomercial is so obnoxious.

Use it daily!","review":"Bought my Magic Bullet over 5 years ago (and got one for my daughter). I don't always 'pulse' and have used it several times a day for over 5 years. I use it DAILY to make my morning smoothy and for various other tasks throughout the day. I truly enjoy it; loving the small size and convenience. It's a breeze to clean if one just does it immediately after using it! I have had only one complaint. I'm not sure whether I got the little gasket in the base crooked or what, but I've managed to chewed up the gaskets over time and although I don't have any gaskets left and am therefore using it without a gasket, I'm still a happy camper. It leaks a bit on occasion if my smoothie is a bit thin, but AGAIn, it's a breeze to rinse and clean up, so not a problem. If mine broke today, I'd order a new one and consider it a good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty design and basic junk technology-MagicBullet junk and fell in mid-air","review":"Have the same problem, the impeller broke and no way to fix it.

What a garbage product. For the 180 1-star reviews I saw (didn't see until today unfortunately) you'd think this thing would sell everywhere for no more than $10. People, like me, buy the idea..which is great...forgetting to check reviews. Great accessories, great idea, easy to use, small and easy to store, easy to clean but without a working motor it's pointless. DON'T BUY IT. You may or may not get a few weeks to a few months at best and for the price you can actually get a working blender!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"When the Magic Bullet first came out, it was a really, really great little blender. But now, I think the company has gotten greedy. I am on my third one (the original lasted 5 years) and bought two more on a great sale of $18 each.They do not last very long, even when used as recommended. Those two did not last even a year and neither one worked worth a toot.The parts are cheap, the motor is cheap, and it does a terrible job of blending, chopping, or mixing. Can't even blend smoothies without getting lumps of this and that. If you try to blend for more than 10 seconds, you can smell the motor heating up. I have moved on to something more reliable. Too bad the company ruined such a nice product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaply made","review":"The Magic Bullet falls under the category of \\"They don't make things like they used to\\". I have used mine a total of maybe 30 times in just over a year. Early on, one of the plastic tabs snapped off. Two months ago, the second one snapped off. This morning, the third tab just snapped off as I was placing the blender onto the motorized base. Without those three tabs to fit into the three corresponding grooves, the motor will not work and essentially you have no Magic bullet. Called to complain. They told me they would send me a new blender unit for 18 dollars and told me I was too aggressive with the thing. Not true! This is a cheaply made product that I am done with. No confidence I will spend 18 dollars and it will last any longer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mushy","review":"I had wanted to buy this product for a long time now. Finally took a chance last week and am very disappointed. Like the other reviews I found the food at the top of the cylinder simply does not make its way to the blade and vice versa so 1/2 is all mushy and the other half is untouched. I had to constantly stop it and bang the cylinder to try to get the untouched food near the blade. Not at all worth the $50. I paid. Luckily I bought it a a dept. store do I can return it easily... going back today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the concept but in reality did not perform","review":"Loved the concept, but after using for one week, the plastc \\"rivits\\" that the main frame grabs on to, to spin the grinder frayed and will no linger spun to grind.

I'm very dissatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"My bullet kicked the bucket","review":"Not intended for every day use. Just as other reviewers here have mentioned - there are irreplaceable, movable, plastic parts that drive the blades. I got about 1 year of daily use out of my bullet before the plastic disc that spins the blades split into 3 pieces. I never used it to crush or blend anything very hard (no ice or compact solid foods - generally just bananas and soy milk). I tried to repair the disc with epoxy and got it back into one piece, but the threads that the disc screws onto had been rubbed bare. The threading was of course made of the same weak plastic - so no luck on that. I even tried to line the disc with glue so there'd be no need for the plastic threading. This fix was also not effective.Recently I got a Bella Cucina Rocket from Target - I will update if it proves to be a superior product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine was a birthday present","review":"it was fun to make smoothies, I like that it is smaller and saved dirtying an extra glass compared to using a blender. But just by looking at it you can tell its cheaply made. Personally I think this unit should sell for under 20 dollars. It was only a matter of time before it bit the dust. Mine was bought at full price $59.99 at bed, bath, and beyond but apparently the warranty is no good and I can't get parts. Even though it says it has a warranty, it's a lie. The concept is good, I just wish that it was better made by a company that stood behind their product. I think there should be a class action law suit to refund all the units that failed under the stated warranty but were not replaced. In the mean time I will continue to use my Oster that has lasted me for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it might seem","review":"This machine is perfect for doing slushies, smoothies, iced drinks and frozen drinks. Anything beyond that is a failure. It doesn't dice fruits and veggies, it liquefies them. You don't get nicely chopped pieces of anything. You get clumps of food stuck around the blades, liquified gunk and you certainly don't get anything mixed well.The infomercial makes it look nice and easy. Just pulse and VOILA you have perfectly diced and mixed salsa. In reality you have mushed up chili peppers stuck in the blades and some tomato puree.I'd skip this unless you want it exclusively for drinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke in 6 months","review":"I have used it for smoothies only and it stopped working after 6 months.

Don't waste your money on this junk. Buy a blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent product... BAD warranty","review":"I've had my Magic Bullet for 5 months. I use it mostly for smoothies, and it works great. Chopping onions or anything else, it turns them to mush. The base no longer shuts off when I remove the cup, until I unplug the base. Customer Service was happy to send me a replacement, but they charge $10 for shipping. As they pointed out, it does clearly state in the warranty that shipping on replacements is not included, but they don't even offer a repair location or any alternative. You pay more money for them to ship you a replacement, or you're stuck with a broken item. Luckily, at least mine still works. What kind of 1 year warranty is that?? Buy a good knife and a decent blender and forget this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No magic, just a pile of cheap plastic.","review":"Terrible design!The gear connects to the cross blade is loose in the first day of using.

Remember, you get what you paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warranty not honored. Beware Homeland Housewares","review":"I bought a Magic Bullet in May '05. It worked great for 5 months and then the plastic drive gear stripped on the base and took the one on the blade with it. The manufacturer will not sell the gears separately and refuses to honor the warranty since I bought from an online distributor instead of off the TV ad.I have pages of e-mail dialogue with the manufacturer where I asked about the warrany, got a rude response, and then offered to buy the parts, only to be told they don't sell them, but would be happy to sell me another complete base unit for $30 + $10 shipping.I would buy another make and take my chances."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Broke","review":"I received the Magic Bullet as a gift--I loved making homemade sauces with it until it broke.

I tried it out, and the blade broke the first time I tried it. It had a \\"one year warranty\\" so I called the company and they refused to accept it. So if I wanted a new piece to replace my also new piece that broke the first try, I would have to send them 8.95 plus shipping and handeling.

Noticeably less palm impact on recoil. Well worth the money, as are all things Hogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits my Kel-Tec PF9 and Ruger SR22","review":"I have purchased 3 of these over the past several months. I currently use the grip on my Kel-Tec PF9 and Ruger SR22. There was minimal trimming required to get it to not interfere with the safety or magazine on the PF9, and absolutely no trimming to fit it on the SR22.The third one I got was for my Diamondback DB9, but because the grip on the gun is so short I had to do major trimming, nearly cutting the Hogue in half. In the end I didn't like the jagged finish (my fault for hastily cutting) and ended up scrapping it.These grips do a wonderful job improving the ergonomics on both guns, which initially felt too small to handle comfortably. Also, when I carry inside-the-waistband I feel like I get a better draw because of the extra friction provided by the Hogue. There is noticable reduction in perceived recoil on the PF9 at the range. Great product, and I intend to try again on getting one on my DB9."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for taming small handguns!","review":"Let's face it, small handguns in calibers above .32 can be uncomfortable to shoot for extended periods of time.

A little difficult to get on, will definetly need some hot water encouragement and possibly some very slight trimming at the bottom. Overall, I'm very pleased. I now have a Hogue on all 3 of my pistols and wouldn't have it any other way. It greatly increases grip and comfort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits as Advertised","review":"The Hogue Rubber Grip Jr. does what it is supposed to do-it adds a better grip to your small handgun. It takes little effort to stretch it over the handle. Once on where you like it simply cut around the bottom to remove any excess that hangs over the handle. You can use an X-acto knife or, like me, use a good pair of scissors to complete the job. Whatever you use just be careful not to scratch your firearm. It's worth the money and I'm buying a second one for another small handgun I own. I don't think you'll be disappointed if you purchase this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs some tweaking, but nice!","review":"Beretta Nano required a little snipping off of the bottom. I then read the reviewer who turned the grip upside down. My grip went from acceptable to perfect. The grip is firm and doesn't really add any bulk. I am glad I got it, makes a HUGE difference. I noticed the Nano hurt the hand a little after a day at the range, this fixed that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits my Kel Tec PF9","review":"Before I purchased this grip, it was almost painful to shoot my Kel Tec PF9. Now, with the addition of this grip and the magazine extension, it has been more of a pleasant experience to shoot. The only thing I had to do was trim a small piece off the front of the grip because it would wrap around the bottom of the mag well and come in contact with the magazine. This might only be a problem if you have big hands such as myself. The space between the trigger guard and the finger notch on the grip is too small for my middle finger which causes the grip rubber to slide down and come in contact with the mag well. I used a razor blade to trim the piece of rubber causing the problem and now it works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for KelTec PF9","review":"This thing added another level of comfort to shooting my Keltec PF9 which has a lot of recoil. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice handgrip","review":"This is nice for a universal handgrip. I only had to cut a small piece off for it to fit my Kel Tek P3AT .380.

Overall I am very satisfied and will recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable Grip","review":"I bought theHogue Rubber Grip Handall Jr. Small Size Grip Sleevebecause my Kahr CW40's checker-textured polymer grip irritated my hand after extended shooting. I found it listed on Kahr's website and ordered it from Amazon, which was a little bit cheaper. It took a little bit of effort to get it on and slide it up (not too bad) and positioned the finger groove where my middle and ring fingers grip the gun. The Kahr fit my hand like a glove before, but now it feels even better with this non-slip tube grip. Will be ordering another for my father-in-law's weapon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Grip","review":"In my opinion Hogue makes the best grips on the market.

Though they were super hard to get on, once on the gun, they fit like a glove. I bought these grips because the older model Walther I have, will not accept anything other than a slide on grip.They made all the difference in the world on how the gun fit my hand.

The grip has not slipped a bit and I am very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good fit for Ruger LC9","review":"I did the \\"hot water\\" trick for install which helped the rubber be a little more flexible. It still took some mechanical \\"oomph\\" to get on, so if you don't have the dexterity to throw elbow grease into it I would use a little dish soap in the hot water. Just a touch of dish soap. Just like putting hand grips on bicycle handlebars when you were a kid... the soap and water will dry out.Anyway, onto the review. Fits firearm snugly and needed just a wee bit of trim around the mag release button. I didn't trim the same area on the opposite side so when I press the mag release the grip gets pushed a little there, but nothing too crazy. It does help the native grip feel more full in the hand and I like the finger lip this has.

The rubber is too stiff anyway. I bought a Pachmayr for my Ruger LCP and really liked the material, feel and comfort.

As you have already found out, the little pocket pistol wants to rotate in your hand when you fire it. This grip adds one more finger grip to the design, which really helps you keep a firm grip on the gun. In combination with the extended grip on the magazine it's just about perfect.When installing this grip don't be afraid to experiment before cutting it to size. Try it right side up or upside down and see which gives the best grip, and on the LCP there will be some extra grip material on the bottom. While durable, the material is very easy to cut. I used a cuticle scissors and it came out perfect. Make sure the mag release button (both sides) is not hindered and the mag slides in and out easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits Kahr P380 with minor trimming","review":"Feels really good on my Kahr P380.Had to trim a bit off the bottom with an exacto knife, but it cuts really cleanly.Just that little bit of extra girth makes a world of difference.Note that I do not have really big hands, so the finger hump was in the right place for me.Might need to be installed upside down to fit bigger hands.

But it does fit (well, sort of). Once on and flush with the bottom of the grip, the top portion of the sleeve covered the mag release button so I had to trim it back a little to get to the button. It could use a trim on the bottom to slide it down a little for a more comfortable fit with the grip bump-out/middle fingers. Overall, I like it and I'm certain it's not going to slip off. Better than what I was expecting for a \\"general\\" sized grip sleeve."},{"rating":"2","title":"great upgrade for Kel-Tec PF9","review":"This was a great upgrade for the grip on my PF9.

When we put it on, it was still very tough so we boiled it longer and continued to stretch it in between taking it out of the water and putting it back in. When it was finally stretchy enought to put on, we started slowly working it up the grip of the gun. Then it split in the seam of the grip and is now useless.

Me, I love Bert Williams.Actually, ALL of the discs put out by Archeophone are fantastic. They manage to find very good-sounding discs and clean them up just enough to sound good but not ruin the music. (In other words, yes, there's crackle here and there, but at least the music sounds clean and crisp instead of muffled, as can often happen with noise reduction.) Naturally the older the discs, the less clean they'll sound, but they're all quite listenable. If you're interested in more of their CD's, look them up on Amazon or go to their web site (which is the name of the company, [...]).

We've learned a lot about the Bible and ancient Israel in the last 127 years.The author doesn't even do what he proposes; many of the \\"explanations\\" consist of saying that he doesn't understand it but he believes that there is no contradiction or he proposes outlandish explanations that conflict with the clear meaning of the text. I think this undermines the Bible's reliability - if it doesn't mean what it says, how can I trust anything it says!A quaint book with some interesting explanations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Real Thing","review":"I think John Denver was concerned about losing some of his popularity and this album reflects his attempt at \\"throwing something against the wall and seeing if it sticks.\\" John was not Bob Marley nor was he Bruce Springsteen. He was best at being himself. The thing about it is, the lyrics still reflect his true self, but he tried to put them to music that just wasn't him. Later on, I think he realized why we bought his albums and tried to go back to that successful formula. Unfortunately, his untimely death came before that reached fruition."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Different Sound for John Denver","review":"This album has a completely different sound and feel than John Denver's previous albums. While the songs are not unpleasant to listen to, many of them do sound canned or forced and the tender and careful rendering the musician usually lends to his creations is absent. One can expect changes in an artist's style and music as the years go by, but this particular album is completely uncharacteristic. Had it been someone else, I would have thoroughly enjoyed it but this is NOT the John Denver most people would be familiar with."},{"rating":"1","title":"The White Suit Says It All","review":"John Denver became my favorite male vocalist more than 25 years ago, and he remains my favorite long past his untimely death. His album \\"It's About Time\\", however, is anything but a favorite. The arrangements and accompaniments carry such a forced big band sound that any beauty of the lyrics are totally lost. This album is incredibly over-produced, with none of the simplicity, soul, and heartfelt vocals that characterizes Denver's best works. The white suit on the cover photo says it all. This ain't John Denver, folks, it was the producer trying to mold him into a new image. Only the anchor song \\"It's About Time\\" is genuine Denver. My advice: find these songs on a live album without the studio band and the producer, and forget this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic JD Album","review":"Lots of old favorites on this album. This CD was shipped to me promptly and arrived here in good order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Cheap","review":"I suppose these things are cheap for a reason. I bought this CD player knowing this but I didn't realize how cheap it was. I took the item out of the packaging and put brand new fully-charged batteries in it. I tried burned cds and regular audio cds but the player would not play any of them. I put the disc in and the player would read disc on the screen but it wouldn't play. The CD-RWs would read ER so the player wasn't even registering it. Maybe the one I had was defective but I would definitely recommend springing for the better quality players."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the editor?","review":"As a novice to securitizations, I can't speak about the merits of this book in comparison to its peers. However, I will say that it is neither a reference book nor a novel. The overall structure and organization of the book was horrendous with stories leading nowhere and technical examples blurted out onto the page without thought to a fundamental theme or why they were offered. An example is not a good teaching lesson if it doesn't relate to a fundamental point.I don't blame the author because she is obviously skilled and well informed. I do blame the editor for not reviewing the book more carefully. Wiley shame on you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star Reference Book","review":"\\"Reviewers\\" of this book are clearly bimodal, 5 stars or 1 star. I really don't think any technical textbook could be rated 5 stars by anyone other than the author touting the book--Tom Clancy perhaps, but not a bone dry technical book. The value of a great technical text is one that offers some great insight, which this book does not, or one that covers the subject matter in such a thorough, fundamental and unbiased matter as to be considered a reference text. On the second measure, the author in her book and speechs to the industry seems to opine that structured financial products are a instruments fraught with risk. As such, I seriously doubt this text will have the legs to become an industry ready reference book. In the distribution of ratings on this book-- love it (touting) or dislike-- I rate this a 1 star text book; spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creates More Questions than it Answers","review":"Poorly written - poorly editedThis book needs a complete rewriteIts more a collection of disjointed notes and facts than a bookIf you don't understand CDOs before you read it - you won't after you read it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically average with some industry color","review":"From the vantage point of an experienced financial risk management professional, I found this treatise on CDOs and other structured financial products a technically average effort. I do believe that Tavakoli's book would be useful to those looking for an introduction to such financial instruments and those seeking some industry color; she does provide real life examples to help the book along. As correctly noted in a previous review, the author seems more cautionary or paranoid of the use of these types of financial instruments. Obviously a case can be made that intentionally misused or ignorantly applied, these financial instruments can be lethal. Although an unlikely possibility, this type of book should be read by any director of a public company that uses these instruments. If on the other hand you are seeking a solid technical resource, my opinion would be to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little value for the experienced professional","review":"This book was a disappointment to me and will likely disappoint anyone that has been in the business of managing financial risk for a while. For people that are just starting their careers in the field, this may be a good starting point. I don't believe the book offers any new insight into the uses and abuses of CDOs and synthetics. I was looking for insight and inspiration for better methods and possible new product ideas. This is not the book. The color commentary of industry abuses used in the book as examples might be of interest to newbies, but old news to anyone else. This is a one-star rating for anyone with experience in the business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over promised, under delivered","review":"Having worked in the financial risk management business for more than 15 years with significant experience in structured financial instruments, the book was not particularly useful to me. I believe the book may be of use for training young associates in need of a primer. The author uses relevant examples which would be helpful to those with little context. The tone of the book would lead me to conclude that author is quite cynical regarding the actual use of CDO's and other structured products. I don't think anyone working in the business would find much new here; certainly not a reference book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oneness:Silver Dreams Golden Reality","review":"I am a Santana fan , but this album(cd) comes up short.

The songs seem to be cut off very quickly as the extended solos just come in. Knowing Santana is a perfectionist makes me think that this was probably for the best. The art work and surrounding message are very spiritual, a little cultish looking back from our perspective and perhaps a little baffleing if you're not very familiar with eastern religion. He has some good moments as he does in all of his work especially in Song for Devadip. However, if you're not a very devoted fan I would stick to Barboleta, a very good album. There's nothing on Oneness that Santana hasn't done much better elsewhwere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!!","review":"If you are a Santana fan, a music fan or a guitar enthusiast Oneness is a must have for your collection!

I think that this album was a special project for Calos and he put his heart and soul into the performance. A collection of eclectic tracks culminating in the Oneness track itsself. The way the guitar work ebs and flows is a special delight, especially when listening through high quality headphones. A must for any Santana fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life after Limahl","review":"Limahl was given his cards at the end of 1983 because of conflicts with the others and lack of credibility in the press.

Overall, the album didn't do as well as the last. The band name was shortened to Kaja and they were given a makeover by the time \\"Islands\\" was released in North America as \\"Extra Play\\" to no avail. This was a textbook case of sophomore slump, you can see. The tour had Beggs hand free to keep the old pattern and a session took over bass. Drummer Jez Strode quit after that and only played again on the Vh1 reunion.This may be an import, according to Caroline, part of the EMI family. Either way, it's still worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical self-help garbage","review":"Well, to those of us who are \\"flirting challenged,\\" the title of this book would lead us to think that FINALLY there is an actual STRATEGY we can use, rather than relying on intuition.

The only one I can remember takes place early in the book: It's the scene where she ran into someone in the airport and she glances at her watch and leaves the person she was talking to.

It most certainly will NOT teach you \\"how to attract anyone, anytime, anyplace\\"!!! It doesn't even pretend to teach you that. No book could.I was hoping for more ice breakers and conversation starters. I already know not to stare at a woman's body or stare at somebody across the room too long, not to brag about myself, take an interest in her, be a good listener, etc. The very few conversation starters it did give were pretty lame.

Herbal remedies have side effects, mostly good. Sometimes using pharmaceuticals along with herbal remedies creates a time bomb. Your physician and/or pharmacist doesn't always know how your new prescription may rock the boat or in some cases capsize it altogether. I'd worked in the natural remedy industry for 10 years, pretty much ignored drug-herb interactions, and had a new pharmaceutical prescription.

There's really no need to go into technical details since Mr. Kroll has always been a master at this. What really makes this book great is the sexuality in it. This is real sex. The depictions of SM and fetishism are beautiful and it is easy to see why Mr. Kroll enjoys photographing Gwen. Besides being a beautiful woman she has the ability to make the situations very natural. There's no glossy mainstream pornmag in these photographs. Each of them would be suitable as a high quality print. A sure winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fan Speaks Up!","review":"As a serious collector of photography, I have long been a fan of Eric Kroll. His vision is erotic, exotic, sometimes bizarre, always provoking. His Gwen series is an exciting followup to his previous collections like Fetish Girls and Beauty Parade, in that here he approaches photography as sequential art, a visual approach that adds context and implied storylines to the titillating images. Kroll picks up where the art of John Willie and Eric Stanton left off, adding his photographic skills and eye for beauty, mixing in sex and eroticism, tossing in a dash of over-the-edge shock-you images. Maybe this book (and its sequel Transformations of Gwen Vol. 2) are not for the timid, but it's the cutting-edge fantasy that wet dreams are made of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy weight warm winter pants","review":"I purchased these for my elderly mother who is often cold.

Though Morton's writing is weak, his subject is interesting enough to propel the book. Although it has been criticized for not really containing anything new, it is thorough (delving into Madonna's family history on both sides) and insightful. Morton has a tendency to analyze his subjects as if they were mental cases, and he does this to Madonna throughout the novel. His findings, however, are nothing new; Madonna needs attention, and Madonna needs to mother and be mothered. Nonetheless, the book is readable and insightful, and gives the best look that the public has seen so far at the woman behind the persona. Morton has done his detective work, and done it well, his findings giving some insight into the complexities that make the world watch Madonna."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna Queen of Pop","review":"Madonna...

This air purifier actually works. It puts out ozone which kills any odors. It leaves the car smelling a bit like a hospital (clinically clean smell). It only took about one day and now I just leave the purifier in the glove compartment until I might need it again.It has a faint blue glow to signify that it's working.

Didn't know what I was going to do once the markers dried up."},{"rating":"1","title":"adult supervision required","review":"We got this from Nana for my daughter's third birthday. I was sorely tempted to return it unopened! It has three markers included and several image sheets to trace. Every other minute my daughter wanted to change the sheet to a different picture. The 'eraser' include is a piece of a kitchen sponge. When I finally stopped changing the page, she decided to color all over her arms with the markers. She doesn't care that she can't trace the pictures. She likes to scribble. I'd rather just give her crayons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a 3-year old with parent's can help","review":"My daughter and I draw on this every night before bed.She loves it as long as I help her. As other reviewers mentioned, an adult will be needed to help get the papers into the slot and to erase the picture. I have found that wet wipes work great for erasing so I threw the useless sponge away. I also wish they would sell a packet of markers without additional templates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea but Very MESSY!","review":"This is the worst Doddle product I had purchased by far. It was a great idea but somebody at Fisher Price needs to go back to the drawing boards. The little sponge that comes with it is suppose to clean the board when wet. Ha ha. It just smears it all over the board and it gets all over your hands and everything else. Then you have to dry it to use it again. Yucky and Messy! Don't waist your money like I did. We even bought the extra pads."},{"rating":"1","title":"kids may enjoy...but it's a mother's nightmare!!","review":"My daughter loves this toy.I, on the other hand, cannot stand it.I have actually tried to hide it from her.It is a mess! The markers are not washable, the screen does not clean up easily and the sponge that comes with it is practically useless.Plus, the tracing pages tear easily - they should be laminated.If you are interested in a doodle pro product, I would stick with an original."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess!","review":"This toy makes coloring cool. I really like the \\"glow\\" effect. Is it worth that cool glow effect? Noooooooo! The markers are easily lost, and the mess of cleaning the pad up is so not worth it. The marker just smears instead of wipes off. It gets all over everything. Yuck! Until they figure out a better way to clean the board, I would avoid this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Markers stain!","review":"My 3 year old got this from my aunt and uncle and within 5 minutes had a permanent stain on her Christmas dress from it.

Your clothes, their clothes....it is bad. My son is within the recommended age for use but while wiping the markers off he was holding the marker in his hand and got it on his shirt. I can't get it off - have tried everything! DON'T BUY THIS OR LET THEM PLAY IN OLD CLOTHES!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a 3 year old..","review":"My son got this for his 3rd birthday and it's too difficult & messy for him. Adult supervision is definitely required since it gives you several markers...a 3 year old with a marker is not a good thing. The sponge 'eraser' has to be damp and you then have to wipe it with a dry cloth to completely remove the marks. Older kids might enjoy this a little more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying to Keep Clean","review":"My daughter is 4 years old and LOVES to trace so I decided to by her the Doodle Pro Glow. From the outside it looked like a snap to wipe clean, what a mistake! First you have to make sure that your child does not smear the marker (which stains) all over the place, second they provide you with a tiny sponge (not the same as the picture on the box)and you have to wash it clean after every stroke across the board. I don't know about you but I get tired of running back and fourth trying to keep it clean. Third you then have to wipe the board clean with a dry cloth since the wet sponge never gets all of it off.Take my advice and pass up this toy and go for the simple Doodle Pro, much easier all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"As others have said, this is a neat concept, but in reality, it doesn't work that great. After drawing on it, you wet a sponge to erase it. Think about a small child wetting a sponge. It ends up a dripping mess! Then they end up with runny marker all over their hands, which ends up on their clothes, etc. We're good about watching the kids, too. You really have to take control of the sponge and make sure the board is wiped properly before the kids use it. The other thing is that none of the colors glowed very well and the kids stopped using it after only a couple of days. Just a very disappointing gift. Fisher Price should have stuck with the original Doodle Pro... my kids have had it for a year and still use it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed cat drawings","review":"Fairly high-detail line drawings of many species of wild cats, not for very young children.

I don't think I have ever hated a book's format as much as I hate this one. Questions are presented in multiple choice at the beginning of each chapter. Then you have to flip several pages to find a list of answers. The questions and answers never appear on the same page any where in the book so if you're looking for a casual read you've found the wrong book. All your time is spent flipping pages and matching questions with answers. There may be some interesting information in it but I haven't found time to read far enough in to find it. I do not recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great idea for a book","review":"It is hard to believe that there is no other Disney trivia book.

I have been a Disney buff all of my life and have found that I remember small trivial things about everything Disney without thinking about it. This book encompasses a wealth of trivia on Walt Disney World. Many books of this genre regurgitate facts from sources in a very cut and dry manner, while Mr. Mongello has a wonderfully playful style of getting the reader involved by creating questions with multiple answers. His style and humor make this lighthearted informative tour of the parks a must read.I suggest reading it in the car, plane or train as you head to your magical destination as well as a fun way to pass the evening after a fun day at the parks.I for one am eagerly anticipating the release of his next installment, The Walt Disney World Trivia Book, Volume 2 : More Secrets, History & Fun Facts Behind the Magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Of the many books on Disney Trivia that I own, this book is the most fun to read.

I don't like Uriah Heep (keyboardist Ken Hensley formed Heep right after The Gods disbanded), but the sonority of the two bands is pretty different.

He seems to be coming full circle. His voice had matured and the cd had a more soul and gospel, and raw feel - you know, like unassimilative black music. I love his other works, but his vocals seems to be watered down to appeal to the mainstream audience.I understand he had to have two faces. One for his folks, the real self, and a water down version for the mainstream(mo money)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest live performances","review":"Sam Cooke delivers an unbelievable performance in this one. When I first got it, it was difficult for me to appreciate this live album. But as time passed by, the more it grew on me. And now, it's truly one of my favorite albums. Any soul music fan has to have this one.The way Sam Cooke works the crowd is a thing of beauty. Those people that attended this performance are some lucky folks. He gives it his all and the crowd appreciates it. My personal favorite was \\"Chain Gang\\" because of the way he works the crowd at the end and because his voice is just electrifying with his \\"oh yeah\\" screams. Sam Cooke may not be my favorite artist but I believe he's the greatest artist of all-time. This record is one of the many testaments of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible remix","review":"This is obviously a classic live recording, and of course Sam Cooke sounds great. But I don't understand all the great reviews. In case no one noticed, King Curtis is leading the band, and he's been effectively erased from this cd. The extra chatter is nice, but the music is what counts. Search out a copy of the original cd release; the artwork is lousy, but you can actually hear the horns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Record","review":"This is perhaps the greatest record of all time. I've played it for my friends, and they love it, I've played it for my mom and her friends and they love it, me and my dad sit around and get drunk and listen to it.I have had this album stolen by from me by roomates, friends, relatives, it is a classic album, that everyone can enjoy.Sam Cooke was the greatest singer of the 20th century. He makes Sinatra etc look like a f***ing joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Twistin\\" edit","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite live albums, and is possibly THE best live album around. I pretty much wore out the vinyl version, and purchased this remastered CD edition. My problem is a scratch or edit on \\"Twistin The Night Away\\" contained in the second verse. I returned the cd to the store I purchased it from, and they replaced it with another copy. Same Problem!!! 2nd verse starts off ok but you get a truncated version of it i.e. it jumps forward to the end of the verse and you don't hear it in its entirety. One time - manufacturer problem. Both copies - edited? If so, why? Can't be to fit the album onto CD as it only goes for about 40 mins. Lucky KC's sax solo was left intact (one of the greatest imho). I also agree with others re bringing crowd noise/participation and King Curtis up in the mix, as both contribute so much to this recording. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent, sweaty soul","review":"Read the editorial review, it's great.There, that's my review right there.Well, okay, but there's really not much more to say. \\"Live At The Harlem Square Club\\" is by far the best testament to the talent and charisma of the founding father of soul, the great Sam Cooke.Cooke is backed by a swinging R&B; band, and his raspy vocal delivery turns extremely harmless little pop songs like \\"Cupid\\" and \\"For Sentimental Reasons\\" into soulful expressions of lust!This magnificent live album goes from one highlight to the next. \\"Feel It\\" is pure James Brown, \\"Chain Gang\\" and \\"Bring It On Home To Me\\" are sweaty rhythm and blues, and the classics \\"Twistin' The Night Away\\" and \\"Having A Party\\" never sounded this good.If you only ever buy one Sam Cooke-album, get this one. Hell, if you only ever buy one soul record, you really need to consider this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sam Cooke Forever !!","review":"As a boy, I remember the Sam Cooke songs that made the top 40 radio stations . . . . it is a ridiculous understatement to observe that this CD transcends that Sam Cooke. . .the Sam Cooke of the dreamy middle American early sixties pop culture universe.This is the gritty, raw, earth-shattering side of the legend. A Sam Cooke that was free to cut loose in a fashion that would have been unthinkable on a five minute stint on the Ed Sullivan show. From the opening intro, into the first spine-shattering bars of the opening song, you are on your way. If, after listening to this CD, you aren't shaken to the core of your being, you have my condolences, because you've probably just flat-lined.It's heart-breaking to think that little over a year after this performance, Sam was gone. But he lives forever in this disc.Do yourself a tremendous favor. Buy, beg, borrow, or steal this one. As \\"the one and only, Mr. Soul\\" saidDon't Fight It, Feel It !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mature Sam Cooke","review":"I can categorically say this album was the cream of Sam Cooke. The reason for saying this, is to counteract the previous comment made by A. Sturley. Sam did not change his voice for this concert. Sam was getting more mature. His voice was breaking. Which I preferred. Had he lived longer, he would'nt be too far of Bobby Womack or a more polished soul singer. Also him moving with the times, who knows how he would really sound like had he lived longer. A. Sturley, if you do not believe me,buy and listen to the album (Keep Moving On).Both albums will always make music listeners take notes. The One Night Stand: Live at the Harlem Square Club was Sam Cooke delivering at his very best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE NIGHT STAND...ONE GREAT MAN!","review":"THE KING OF SOUL MAKES A TRIUMPHANT RETURN! THIS CD TOTALLY ROCKS. THE CLARITY ON THIS CD IS GREAT FROM THE \\"INTRO TO THE LET-GO\\"!SAM IS IN TOTAL COMMAND IN EACH AND EVERY TRACK.THE GROOVES ON THIS CD ARE UNMISTAKEABLY SAM COOKE. ON \\"DON'T FIGHT THE FEELING\\" THE GROOVE WAS SO INFECTIOUS I FOUND MYSELF SINGING IT IN MY OFFICE WHILE USING MY MOUSE AS A MICROPHONE! LET ME WARN YOU, IF YOU'RE EXPECTING THE SILKY SMOOTHE SINATRA-ESQUE COOKE THAT WE'RE ALL ACCUSTOMED TO FROM THE 1957 HIT, \\"YOU SEND ME\\"... FORGET IT! THIS IS SAM AT HIS RAWEST AND GRITTIEST.

This is the most energetic, soulful, soaring album ever recorded. For once an artist is matched by his audience. The people in the Harlem Square could best be described as the back up singers. This is one of those rare occasions where you can tell there wasn't a bad vibe or disintrested fan in the house. This concert is my first stop if I ever get a time machine and after one listen Im sure I'll see you there."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Night Stand","review":"I grew up listening to Sam Cooke, he was my mother's favorite.

I always loved Sam Cooke but find his studio work a little too polished. When you hear him live, however, he is raw, raw, raw. His voice is so much grittier and his delivery fits in more with the soul of the music. The breaks between songs where he ad-libs and talks to the audience really add to the atmosphere and it is obvious from audience reaction how much they are loving it too. You get a wide selection of his songs, so can get a real feel to how his music should be heard. This is such a good soul album and a great recording of a legend. Highly, highly recommended.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious and nutritious!","review":"Delightful flavor combination plus great texture.

It's ALL small stuff? Tell that to a family whose loved one was just murdered. Or a parent who has to raise three severly deformed babies. That's the problem with self-help books of this genre, everything is penned into a nicely managed coral that totally ignores the REAL pains of life.

The sets, costumes, dance, and characters are wonderfully penned and created. However, the CD leaves much to be desired. George Hearn doesn't have enough \\"gay\\" to make a believable drag performer. His version of \\"I Am What I Am\\" while true to the character, is not as beautiful or faltering as Albin should be.

I don't really know how to review it; it's great, of course, and was an important gig for him, but is this one any better or any worse than any other live Elvis set? I have no idea. I love 'em all, no exceptions. Decades ago I remember not playing this particular one too often because it had a thin, pinched sound (even more so than the original \\"Aloha\\" set). That's been fixed to a great degree, so there went the only distinguishing feature of the disc to me.It's Elvis Presley, the greatest musical artist of all time. Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"The King in the Big Apple","review":"I'm not a big fan of rock music, but \\"The King\\" is an exception, and this album is his greatest live concert (although it is similar to the Hawaii concert). This album has an electricity that is high voltage. Elvis first appears to the majestic fanfare from Richard Strauss's \\"Zaracusthra\\" and closes with a little \\"Blue Hawaii\\", followed by his theme music and the guy saying \\"Elvis has left the building\\". It's a fast-paced, humourous, and electric journey. He sings old songs and new songs, rock-a-billy and ballads. His vocal range and inflections are outstanding. He sings with his band, an orchestra and two choirs (one male, one female). I love the part during \\"Suspicious Minds\\", where Elvis says \\"shove it up your nose\\".He's the King."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS CD","review":"My dad had bought this tape when my family went to Graceland and every vacation we listened to it.

Almost all of the performances were the best, or comparable to the best, I have ever heard. Even the covers. Yes, Elvis did a lot of covers. And if you are a die-hard fan of the original bands, then you probably won't like the Elvis covers as much as the original recordings. However, if you are an Elvis fan, you will know that he rocks these songs and you can totally hear the audience going crazy from these performances. Trust me, if you like live performances and you are an Elvis fan, you will love this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Elvis at his best.","review":"1972's Elvis Presley as recorded at madison square garden is not Elvis at the top of his game.

They made that way too easy. My buddies and I find that the putting is way too easy.I got mine from the big auction website, so I only paid $40 which included shipping. That makes it ok for me.

As others have noted, this game contains only 6 courses, hitting the ball has become an impossible task that requires 3 hands to power up, spin and swing, and the in-game achievements (trophy ball case, check your progress, etc.) has been completely removed.It seems like EA cut too many corners to get this game out the door for 360 launch day.

Yes, it was worth it. The information and photographs detail the research the author has done to write this book. Some of the terminology looses me because so many French words are used as names for different parts in a fort and I can't remember them. There is a lot of depth to this book and I have thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I would love to see this book got back into print. For someone interested in how and why the third system forts were built, this book is an essential read. For a Civil War buff this book also talks about the strategy used in defending and defeating the forts. If you want to get a copy of this book just keep searching and eventually you will find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best regular album","review":"Maybe you could claim a greatest hits compilation is better, but this is his best regular album in my opinion.

The only minus is \\"Two Shots\\" which seems out of place on this album. However, this is John Denver at the height of his career, and the songs definitely show it.

I could barely make it though the first in the series of seminars when I gave up. Maybe there was more there, but I didn't make it far enough to find out. And I blame the author and editors.

But of course the ingenious Texas programmer/multi-talented instrumentalist Shane O' Madden still embraced Govinda's trademark of contemporary world music with the generation of layer upon layer of violin playing, doing it careful and subtly as to not overdo it but instead to place it exactly in all the right yet minimal spots. So once the production is completely finished the end effect is a lush, cooing atmosphere of angelic female vocalese's entwining bright textures and delicate groovebeats to raise an intoxicating mist in one's mind; leaving the listener deliciously satisfied. Understand, though, that this is no Entwined & Entranced or Oh Earthly Gods, but instead more of a changing experiement that deems, in my opinion, notably worthy of listen upon listen upon listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"exotic/erotic....it works","review":"Like some other people, I first heard Govinda's work in the Buddha Bar compilations. This prompted me to buy three albums of his, all excellent: this one (Erotic Rhythms from the Earth), Worlds Within, and Entwined and Entranced.I highly recommend all three, though perhaps this one is my favorite.

Thus, going through batteries quickly. There is a red LED incicator light but, it is on the right speaker/driver shell and still easy for this dumb bell to notice it on. If the batteries are weak, the sound gets really crappy with extreme bass distortion.

I liked some of their productions, but I really didn't wanna drop $20 on a cd that I would never listen to. Well...I was wrong. G&D did an outstanding job with this cd. Their mixing is flawless and the energy in some of the tracks is just amazing. I will warn you though, that this cd is in a slower tempo, my guess between 137 and 131 bpm (beats per minute). So if you're looking for an up-tempo trance/prog cd, this is not for you. The basslines on these tracks are just plain sick. If you do buy this cd, the tunes are just what you'd expect, hard bassline and constant building during the song/set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally the long awaited CD...

Last years' highest new entry into the DJmag Top 100 and responsible for some of last years biggest anthems (including Beatifull Things and As the rush comes)not to mention their Essential mix (which in my opinion was the best essential mix for 2003) and topped off with remixes ranging from Britney to Tiesto.Well this CD almost lives up to the Hype, the track selection is smooth and stylish with a few classics like Anything and the current dance floor chart buster Anyone on Earth plus the highly anticipated next Motorcycle track Imagination.Overall this is an OK album.

I think they were trying to push to many of their own tracks and they just weren't good.But having heard them some other live sets from them that weren't very good, I've come to the conclusion that they're just plain boring as DJs. They came out with a few good mixes and that was it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooo Boring!!","review":"Not what I was expecting from these guys, at all!

The book, written by a Tibetan rinpoche, is a living thing that needs to be read each day. The translation is lyrical and pellucid, yet pulls no punches; it is mountain-stream clear.

What is good about it? The depiction of life as an illegal immigrant and how immigrants help the American economy. What is flawed? Much more than I am willing to write here. The statistics he uses--conveniently picks and chooses to support his argument. His statistics don't paint the full picture. He doesn't distinguish between legal and illegal immigration. He seems to find no problem with illegal immigration--that's what really bothers people. He believes that it's Mexicans that Americans dislike. It's not Mexicans, it's illegals! All he does seem to do is whine about what is not right. He states there is no way to fix it and suggests that since it can't be fixed, to open our borders fully. There is no advocation about increasing the number of work permits or any cracking down on people who hire the illegals. Not much thought went into providing solutions. Anyone can criticize, but the good ones come up with solutions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racism examined by a politically correct racist","review":"This book is incredibly racist, against white Americans. Ramos goes out of his way to show every negative stereotype of white Americans that he can find.I had to read it for a Master's level class on culture and the entire class was revolted by what we read. The only saving grace (from an academic stand point) is that he admits to his bias in the introduction. Indeed, he wears his bias like a badge of honor. The thing that keeps him from being attacked for his views is that he is a member of an ethnic minority. No way a white male could get away with printing views this clearly biased.Highly recommend you pass on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but at this point a little dated","review":"I think overall Ramos does an excellent job in this book. He candidly and honestly portrays the variety of experiences of Hispanic Immigrants. He has a great appreciation of the wide variety of cultures that fall under the title of Hispanic, as well as the particular challenges faced by each of them in America. In all honesty I could have done without his ode to Spanglish, as well as one or two other chapters, but overall I think this is a worthwhile read.

In these crazy, tense times, Will Ackerman plays music that is relaxed, calm, and unhurried.These songs are old favorites for Will's fans, re-recorded, re-interpreted, and delivered with perspective that only decades of performance can bring.

British Sea Power don't seem to have much to do with other bands right now. I don't know if it is that they do too much drugs or are too strange by birth. They go from pop singles to experimental noise and on this album some tracks go twelve minutes. \\"Something Wicked\\" is an example of great songwriting that goes beyond the limitations of Coldplay.

I don't like the tiny photos for pictures where the text takes up just as much room as the photos, and I agree with another reviewer that the photos are dark. The full page drawings in Catch Me Catch Me are much better, as are the simplistic drawings in Thomas the Tank Engines Big Blue Treasury. Depends upon the age of the child I guess, when it comes to selecting Thomas books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Story needs editing","review":"While my three year old son recognizes his favorite Thomas characters, this book is poorly written and edited. The first story, \\"Cranky Bugs\\" is especially annoying because little sensitivity was used to match the pictures with the text. It is bad enough that the text is taken straight from the video tape, but some editing would greatly improve the stories. How sad that the Britt Allcroft empire has reduced the original, wonderful stories from Rev. Awdry to such rubbish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Me & my dad recommend this book\`","review":"Me & my dad read this book and it was very funny.

I agree with Florida, but I think the film was excellently cast, especially Michael Parks as the corrupt cop. Great accent and acting on his part.

Not even close, But this is a very entertaining movie that I have watched time and again. The cast is excellent, top to bottom and in my mind, it is James Spader's best performance.It has its flaws. But I've already said, it does not approach the perfection of Chinatown. But, if you are in the mood for some intrigue with fine acting and wonderful music all woven together, watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A formulaic and inept production","review":"A feckless, charmless, and morally vacuous man, haunted by the suicide of his father, runs for congress in Louisiana. His opponent, far ahead in the polls, nonetheless arranges an erotic encounter (in an abandoned aikido studio!) to get our hero's adulterous moves on video. Yawn. Everything--lines, camera angles, plot points--proceeds in the most predictable and utterly uninteresting fashion. Who gives a damn about this dissipated and rather fatuous pretty boy? Frost and Spader fail to bring any life to this yarn. Even Robards, a real pro, is off his game. Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD STUFF","review":"This CD is really great.

The author masterfully captures the sights, sounds, smells, tastes and feelings of a warscape and tugs at the reader to join the frantic ride. Every sentence incarcerates the helpless reader and stretches his emotional balloon to the bursting point. Thank you, Mr. Yeatts for taking me to the front lines. Although I've never been there, done that, I'll never again be able to shrug my shoulders mundanely at war. Yeatt's book should be required reading for every student seeking a military career.

As Tom Jennings said of his book many of the men were reluctant to speak of their experiences of the war, it was like he had to pull it out of them .

But, fortunately, because of my style and look, I'm able to wear them well. I've bought other gold earrings for this same price that weigh \\"half\\" the grams these do, so I'm not sure why people are saying they expected them to be heavier and less expensive. The size of these earrings are exactly that of the size of a nickel. So if your a guy and your not sure, put a nickel up to your ear to get an idea of how big it is. Well worth the price.

They wear me out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sandford is simply brilliant!!!","review":"After starting to read this book, I just couldn't put it down. There was always something interesting happening, and you get caught up in this Triller with no way to escape.James Qatar has a thing for the neck of pretty blondes, and can't keep away from them. After a dead body has been found he no longer feels safe and becomes more and more careless. Even though he knows he cannot keep feeding his desire, it just gets too stong. Capable of anything, he finds himself another pretty blonde...Lucas Davenport is the brilliant Deputy Chief who, despite the difficulties he sees the future will bring, takes on the mission to stop the killings and find out who is the one behind it all.Sandford is a brilliant writer and once you start reading it, there's no way out. His way of writing makes you feel that you're in the middle of it all, experiencing and seeing everything through the eyes of the writer.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves ficion!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read","review":"All Sandford's books are fun to read.

Don't buy it!","review":"I have become a real fan of John Sandford's prose style, his suspenseful tales, and masterful dialogue. This book IS NOT written by Sandford. I suspect it was written by a sophomoric student of his and Sandford's name was appended to promote sales. Shame on Sandford. Shame on the publisher, and shame on Amazon for presenting it as Sandford's work. Refunds are in order. Do not be disappointed as I was. Do NOT buy into this literary travesty.RSC"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read","review":"I've followed Lucas Davenport and his exploits since \\"Rules\\" and it is still one of the best series around.

I recommend this series to anyone who likes a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chosen Prey","review":"This is the first book that I have read by John Sandford. I had trouble putting it down because the characters become so real. I am going to explore some more of the prey books. The only trouble I had with it is it was close to plagerism which is common with this type of book. The graveyard scene flashed my mind back to the movie and books Chiefs where foxy funderbird buried his hichiker boys and some of the Chiefs in a graveyard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't make it past 100","review":"I had heard such great things about the 'prey' series and thought I'd give it a try, well I'm sorry I did. I got about 100 pages in and still nothing had happened, no action, no nothing. It started out good the first 3 pages or so kinda grabbed me, but after that I felt like I was reading just for the purpose of reading. A boring book and I won't be looking into any of the other 'prey' novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"Wow, what a letdown! After reading 'Certain Prey', my first Sandford novel, I was hopeful that I would be equally impressed with the other books in the Davenport series. Unfortunately, 'Chosen Prey' was nothing like 'Certain Prey'. Gone was the instant deluge into the world of a ruthless killer. Instead, we get a white bread and mayonnaise, ho-hum serial killer, with whom even Davenport even seems bored to death (no pun intended). Talk about your lackluster antagonists! I hope I didn't waste my money on the other Sandford novels I've purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chosen One, Not This Time","review":"Sanford, you are amazing, everytime I think I get it figured out, you throw me another curve ball. This was a very good story with a modern theme. Who would have thought to look at a college professor, in a catholic school? He had access to these beautiful women and he took that to the utmost advantage. It made me look closely at my surroundings. Glad this one didn't get away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and predictable","review":"Book reads like simple genre formula. Plot and characters are generic and predictable.

The characters were well-developed. But....The dialogue didn't.

Mostly talking about the weather and Weather, comparing lists and phone records, eating, driving cars, talking to snitches and the press......zzzzzz. He needs a fight or a shootout and some danger to raise the flatline thrill level of the last two entries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"A very nice basic introduction to world war two. It is not comprehensive, but it covers the broad scope of events. It also has many pictures. I taught an introduction to world war two using this book as my primary resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious, difficult to follow, pointless.","review":"Very pretentious and artsy book, most of the events feel pointless and loosely connected at best. The artwork is interesting until you try to figure out what's going on at any given point. Personally I'd take Frank Miller or Jeph Loeb over Grant Morrison any day of the week - I like stories that are intriguing and unpredictable, but actually have a point. The one thing I did like was the portrayal of Two-Face, but I will never forgive Morrison for his unmotivated, unnecessary, gratuitous and disgustingly pretentious bloodletting scene. In my opinion, the most impressive thing an artist or writer can do is make something intriguing, original and deep while maintaining a clear and purposeful expression of thought or emotion.Doing dark or graphic things for no reason doesn't make you an artistic genius, it makes you annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"My favorite part of this whole graphic novel would have to be the art. The art is definitely unlike anything I've seen in comics before, and I've only seen the style here and there in artistic media. The Arkham backstory was interesting, but did get a little confusing at times when Arkham's dialogue was on panels of Batman running through Arkham. Although I really enjoyed the art it does lend itself to having to focus on the panels for a bit longer to fully absorb the action being depicted. The story is fairly simplistic and you can either take it at face value or dig deeper into it. Overall this graphic novel is an interesting Batman novel, but from what I can tell it's not a full on Batman story as it delves deeper into the mythos of Arkham Asylum and its insane inmates. Still an interesting read none the less. I recommend this as a buy, or if you have a friend that has it barrow theirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the comic book instead","review":"If there was a 1/8 star then I would use that rating instead. The quality of this kindle version is horrible. The resolution looks like it was shot using a phone cam with 1/2 a mega pixel. Arkham Asylum is a classic collectors item and it definitely does not deserve the quality put into the kindle format.I strongly suggest you get the comic book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best..","review":"It wasn't all that great. The title is the same as the video game, so I thought that this was what the video game was based off of. When I opened the book and read the first few pages, it wasn't all that bad. As I got further into the book I quickly grew bored of it. The art was decent, except for batman. The curls on his cape kept bugging me. It's probably not important, but it's my way of saying the art is bad. Next is the dialogue. It's good, but the way it's written and coloured makes it almost unreadable. There is not much action, the book doesn't seem like batman at all. In my opinion, this book wasn't good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really did a good job portraying my psychotic character.","review":"I just love how sadistic Morrison made my character. Really portrayed me.. The Joker at its best. The unusual lettering contributed to the mood. Of all people, even I had chills. Woo Hoo Hoo.Really gave Bats a hard time this time, mentally that is. Hahaha.This graphic novel is seriously fun to read. Pun intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best illustrated graphic novel ever!","review":"The art in this book is incredible! Each panel is a painting in itself. Very expressive and atmospheric. The story is a bit pretentious but still engaging, and a lot more grown up and interesting than the usual Batman cliches.It's just wonderful to see a graphic novel where the art is so lavish and sophisticated unlike the usual cheap, simplistic stuff you sometimes get.Dave Mckean is some kind of genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman Through the Looking Glass","review":"A trippy, surreal take on the caped crusader, Arkahm Asylum, and those who inhabit it's walls. This is not action comic and it certainly isn't mainstream. The only thing I can compare it to are the Sandman stories. I not sure of the exact timing but I think AA came first. Either way it is clear Gaiman was inspired by the style and storytelling when writing his later gems. McKean's pencils are so visually arresting that I would go so far as to say he birthed the style present across the entire Vertigo line. Great read, beautiful visuals, dark and disturbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems lacking","review":"The book has amazing amounts of intricate detail in the images but the story seems to not say anything really worthwhile for the bottom line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly executed","review":"Arkham Asylum suffers from very poor execution. The plot is well-conceived and pulled off well enough given the dialog, but the art style hampers everything down. It seems there are no light fixtures in Arkham Asylum, as every panel is about 90 percent shadow. There is a font used for everything that The Joker says that was a chore to try to read; I had to put the book up to my nose to figure out which letters were which.If you're a huge Batman fan, you've probably already read this. If not, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"Dont waste your money on this. Spend it on Year One, Killing Joke etc. The story and drawings are awful"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...","review":"I was horribly disappointed with this book. There's two different kinds of Grant Morrison writing. The REALLY REALLY good stuff. Then he has the really weird, outlandish, Throw a million ideas into one issue, writing. This book was the latter. Dreadful, confusing, and Annoying art. There was points when I literally COULDN'T read the dialoge which really bothered me. And overall the story was just garbage. Wouldn't recommend it to my worst of enemies."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought this for my husband","review":"I bought this for my husband. I wanted it for the art but i didnt like them, i thought they were gonna be more like the front cover however my husband did like them and he said the book itself really twisted and dark a lot different from alot of the other ones. Deffinatly not for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good potential, poor execution -","review":"Am I a Batman fan? Yes. But not a zealot.I love graphic novels, this one failed to deliver on two counts:1- it is difficult to read, the lettering for all of joker's lines is hard to read and strains the eye... a graphic novel should not be like that.2- it was a great opportunity to show Batman's dark and confusing mind... they started to do so and then dropped it.Not one I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insert Batman to sell comic books","review":"Wow what can I say about this graphic novel... I honestly didn't like this book, but just because I didn't like this book doesn't mean I can give it a 1 star. It was a book, it had color and technically it was completed. After reading this book I felt like the author's just wanted to shock me. It didn't feel like a true batman story, and the ending was a joke. I don't want to give anything away, but the way they made Harvey look in this book was horrible. Took his coin away and moved him Tarot cards, give me a break.On the extra content, it's nice to have, but it's completely unneccesary. Infact after reading through it I was certian that the author was just trying for the shock and aww effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with this version of Batman","review":"After reading The Dark Knight and The Killing Joke, I had high expectations for Arkham Asylum. I was very disappointed however. Like in other Batman books and comics, Batman displays cunningness, being fearless, being athletic, and just being a bad ass hero. He did not display anything in this book. The villains did not display their specialties or twisted selves as they do in other books or comics. The drawings were interesting, not great, just interesting. The story was too short and meaningless. Perhaps I did not understand or interpret the story the way the writers, Morrison and McKean wanted to portray Batman. Still, the story was too short to overanalyze. This book is going as far as I can throw it! Or to someone who wants to experience this bland version of a Batman story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth the time...","review":"So I must be honest and say that I bought this book after playing the video game in the series. And I must say, i'm hugely disappointed. I thought the book lacked any real story that I even cared to follow. It seemed to be reaching way too often for some very deep, emotional, psyche to come out of and really, it just made no sense. Plus, the real issue I had, is that it deviates from Batman as a character. I kept reading and saying, Batman would never do that, or that, or that. It was just very inconsistent for me and a total letdown. I wish I wouldve saved my 15 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arkham Asylum: Seriously Is That Even A Font?","review":"Avoid this like the plague. The art is god awful, the writing is illegible, and the plot itself is absolute garbage.Look up a few pages online if you're curious what I mean. It looks like someone painted it (art and writing) while on the brink of passing out from too much booze.If you want a real Batman graphic novel, go for something from either Miller or Loeb. Morrison can't write whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short, ho-hum story","review":"The only way I'm willing to pay this much for a graphic novel is to know that it is good and long and will take me a few weeks to go through it a few pages at a time.Arkham Asylum is far too short with most of the novel being taken up by extra materials, sketches, essays, and other worthless crap. The story is also not all that interesting. Like many others I am sure I hold every batman story up against Frank Miller's work, and that isn't always a fair comparison. With this, however, I got a short graphic novel with a story that was ho-hum at best.I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insane","review":"This book seemed as if it were written by charles manson, which is what the writer probably was trying to acomplish. The writer has an apparent knowledge of tarot and as well drops a line questioning whether alister crowley was truely the 'most wicked man on earth'. The writer as well, in a Superman title, speaks very condescendingly of the crucifixion.But in this work, seeing Batman on his back, being overwhelmed and beaten by whom I have no idea, brings to mind only one word: pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely difficult to read","review":"Please note that the two stars are for the quality of the digital kindle copy of this book, rather than the story itself (which I'm sure would have been a decent read if I had been able to understand it). I should have read more of the reviews, because really half the of dialogue in this graphic novel is impossible to make out on my kindle fire hd. The panel viewing does very little to make reading easier, in fact I think that it subtracts from the beauty of the artwork by chopping bits of the page up and zooming in on them. This was my first time buying a graphic novel on my kindle (something I had really been looking forward to was reading comic books on it), and maybe I'll try it again in the future, but you're better off buying a physical copy of this. I'm really disappointed with this purchase and am returning it for a refund, I'm hoping that maybe this is just a one-time deal and that other graphic novels will be easier to read and enjoy on my kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK","review":"Its a very good book, with awesome, yet graphic drawings,well maybe not that graphic. The joker is a pretty dark character in this book,very well written story, not exactly what I was looking for, but a great item for batman fans nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Batman Villain Fans","review":"Very unique art style, and it features so many villains - even some of the lesser-known ones. Honestly, that's the main reason I read it. I can't get enough of those Batman villains. If the Rogues Gallery is your favorite part of the Batman Universe, you appreciate mixed-media art, and enjoy exploring psychological allegories, you should check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring","review":"This was one of my least favorate Batman comics. Lots of disturbing hack and slash movie feel to it. Not a lot going on, no big mistery to solve. Artwork was wierd and different. Batman's bloody mouth, Two-face's fungus looking side of his face, everything looked distorated. Writing was hard to read sometimes. Could be good for others, but no my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Art, So-so Story","review":"I'm a big fan of Batman, particularly his conflicts about criminal insanity.I've collected a few comics, but I wouldn't say I'm a comic buff or anything.-The artwork is beautiful and dark.-The story is just dark and sort of poorly paced.

Until this is resolved I cannot recommend purchasing it for Kindle. :( Very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It would be less than one star as a rating","review":"If you are a huge batman fan then please do not read this book.- Batman shows little mental strength- Unnecessary parts and acts such as (SPOILER ALERT) pushing the wheelchair down the stairs.- Everyone at my local comic book shop tried to steer me away from the book, but the Amazon ratings still pulled me in. 19 times out of 20 they are right. Here is number 20. Most people that rated it highly probably don't have an actual quality Batman graphic novel to compare it to.Why you should read it:- If you are a Grant Morrison fan (I don't know why anyone would be, but okay)- The artwork is neat.
